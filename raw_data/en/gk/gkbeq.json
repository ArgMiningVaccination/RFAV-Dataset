SUMMARY This figure illustrates the patent count by assignee for the patent landscape for Adenovirus Vaccine Technology for HIV. The top assignees include Merck and Crucell Holland. This figure illustrates the patent count by inventor for the patent landscape for Adenovirus Vaccine Technology for HIV. The top inventors include Shiver, Wilson and Vogels. 2 Value Added Features This Report enhances previous Pierce Law Patent Landscape Reports Series by adding innovative capacity building features including: 1. Due to the complexity of the subject, the limited timeline for completion of this project and the use of the acquired data by PIPRA, the need for more in-depth technical expert opinion was required. As such, Dr. Dan Barouch was consulted regarding the nature of this project. Dr. Barouch is an Associate Professor at Harvard University. He has conducted research and written numerous papers regarding HIV vaccines using adenovirus vectors. 2. A much greater pool of non-patent, scientific literature was utilized to establish appropriate keywords, inventors and assignees to facilitate patent mining. 3. Due to the complexity and broad nature of the project, a greater pool of patents was reviewed. 4. Due to the complexity of the subject matter, it was necessary to divide teams to specialize in certain aspects of the technology. Each team was assigned a sub-specialty and mined for patents using keywords, inventors, assignees and classification schemes specific to that aspect of the technology. 5. Greater organization of team members resulted in a team leader overseeing two students, a project leader overseeing the team leaders and two professors overseeing the entire project. 6. Introduced use of new patent analytic tools (e.g. Aureka\u00ae and Patent Insight Pro\u00ae which enable enhanced analyzing of data). 7. Determined and utilized Derwent\u00ae Manual Code. 8. Compared and contrasted data obtained by our mining methods with PIPRA collaborator Dr. Kerri Clark. Determed patents unique to Dr. Clark and those unique to the Pierce team. Determined patent documents common to both search efforts. 3 Scope of the Technology Analyzed 1 2 Adenovirus HIV 3 Currently the use of adenoviruses as a vaccine carrier for such diseases as HIV is being extensively studied. However, the pre-existing immunity in humans has become a major hurdle when using the adenovirus in such a fashion. As such, research into such a vaccine carrier involves the deletion of one or all of the adenovirus genes. The deletion of E1, E2, E3 and 34 are often referred to as first generation, second generation and 1 Adenovirus, http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Adenovirus.jpg (last visited Dec. 4, 2008). 2 3dScience: HIV, http://www.3dscience.com/3D_Images/Biology/Viral/HIV/HIV_Green.php (last visited Dec. 4, 2008). 3 Another Shot of Rohail, http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://sabahkamal.files.wordpress.com/2007/03/vaccine.jpg&imgrefurl=http://sabahkamal.wordpress.com/2007/03/11/another-shot-for-rohail/&usg=__eDBIHHth6NoabgG1G1X3t6I0834=&h=306&w=311&sz=17&hl=en&start=2&sig2=24x_7kO9JrfDPce6-yjTiQ&um=1&tbnid=xNPfVnCwmDjyDM:&tbnh=115&tbnw=117&ei=o9g3SafcNaaUeID76IkD&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dvaccine%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26rlz%3D1T4GGLF_enUS292US292%26sa%3DN (last visited Dec. 4, 2008). 4 \"gutless,\" depending on which gene(s) have been deleted. The purpose of this patent landscape study was to search, identify and categorize patent documents that are relevant to the research, development and distribution of a Adenoviral vector based HIV vaccine. 5 DISCLAIMER This is an educational report and is neither inclusive nor comprehensive. Rather, it is an informational resource to facilitate a better understanding of the international patent literature landscape with regard to Adenovirus vaccines for HIV. This report is not a list of all potentially relevant patent documents. It is not a Freedom to Operate (FTO) opinion. Furthermore, this report does not reach the level of a FTO analysis, but instead constitutes an educational presentation of potentially relevant information. While the search engine utilized in this project are extensive, it is likely that the entire spectrum of patent documents was not obtained utilizing the various search strategies and methods articulated herein. Therefore, it is not the supposition of this team that all relevant patent documents were discovered during the creation of this report. As the team members are not experts in the field of Adenovirus vaccines for HIV, it is also highly possible that the categorization of the patent documents found, coded and compiled are incomplete. The team cannot guarantee that these patent documents were evaluated at the level of expert scientific sophistication. Due to the limited time frame (15 weeks) imposed upon this project, the number of patent documents evaluated was established by this constrained schedule, the overall semester demands, and the general press of business. As such, additional patents may have been available for evaluation, but without the necessary time, they may not have been considered. Again, this report should not be viewed as a FTO analysis but instead constitutes an educational report. 6 I. About the Technology 1. Adenovirus Biology 1.A. Adenovirus Biology Overview Adenoviruses were first isolated from cultures of human adenoid tissue (tissue located at the back of the nose, above the tonsils) and were discovered in 1953.4 Adenoviruses are non-enveloped, icosahedrally symmetric double-stranded DNA viruses with a genome of ~ 34-43 kb.5 See Figure 1. They are associated with acute upper respiratory tract infections as well as gastrointestinal and ocular disease in normal hosts.6 Figure 17 4 Samuel K. Campos & Michael A.

Capsid: The protein shell of the virus. 2. Nucleic acid: DNA/RNA. 3. Capsomer: An individual unit of the Capsid. 4. Nucleocapsid: The genome of the virus and the protein coat that surrounds it. 5. Virion: A complete virus particle with its DNA or RNA core and protein coat as it exists outside the cell. Also called a viral particle. 6. Envelope: Made of phospholipids and proteins, but include some viral glycoproteins. 7. Spike Proteins that contain oligosaccharide chains covalently attached to their polypeptide side-chains. 7 The capsid is composed homotrimeric Hexon capsomers with twelve Penton capsomers located at each of the twelve fivefold axes of symmetry. See Figure 2. The capsid of the virus contains three major proteins: Hexon, Fibers, and Penton Base proteins. The Hexon protein provides structural support, but differs in size and immunological properties between serotypes. It is comprised of approximately 1,000 residues, which form three identical large polypeptide chains.8 The Fiber protein of adenovirus exhibit high homology among serotypes and occurs as a trimer on the surface of the capsid. The Fiber proteins are anchored to the capid by the Penton Base proteins, which occur as a pentamer. Figure 29 Together with the Fiber protein, it is responsible for the attachment of the virus to cell surfaces.10 The capsid is stabilized by several minor scaffolding proteins: VI, VIII, IX, IIIa, and IVa2. Protein VI is located beneath the hexons in the viral capsid. When the virus enters the host cells, the lowered pH causes destabilization of the capsid, which liberates protein VI and promotes membrane disruption.11 Proteins VIII and IX are thought to aid in stabilization and/or assembly of the virion.12 Protein IIIa is associated with the Penton Base and is critical to major late mRNA and protein expression.13 Protein IVa2 plays a role in viral DNA packaging and is a transcriptional activator of the major late promoter. Research suggests that the IVa2 protein 8 Hans Jornvall et al., The Adenovirus Hexon Protein, 256(12) 6181, 6181 (1981). 9 MicrobiologyBytes, Adenoviruses, http://www.microbiologybytes.com/virology/Adenoviruses.html (last visited Dec. 3, 2008). 10 Luci Karayan et al., Structural and Functional Determinants in Adenovirus Type 2 Penton Base Recombinant Protein, 71(11) J.

Figure 315 The core of adenoviruses contains four key proteins: Terminal Protein, V, VII, and Mu. The Terminal Protein is covalently attached to the ends of the genome strand. Protein V and VII are non-covalently associated with the genome forming a chromatin-like substance and the latter is believed to form a link between the viral DNA-core protein complex and the viral capsid.16 Protein Mu is believed to help condense DNA. However, Mu has a precursor protein, preMu, works with protein V to demonstrate nuclear and nucleolar targeting. preMu may also be capable of modulating splice-site selection.17 As previously stated, the genome of adenovirus is approximately 34-43kb and forms double-stranded DNA. To conserve space, it encodes polypeptides from both DNA strands and uses alternative splicing and different polyadenylation sites. Its genome carries five E3, and E4.18 The E1A gene induces 14 Wei Zhang & Michael J. Imperiale, Requirement of the Adenovirus IVa2 Protein for Virus Assembly, 77(6) J.

Conversely, the E3 gene is not essential for virus replication, but is involved in blocking Fas-mediated apoptosis. This gene allows the virus to escape immunosurveillance by reducing expression of major histocompatibility complex class I determinants. E3 is expressed at a late state of viral replication and encodes a protein, the Adenovirus Death Protein, which promotes death of the infected cell and thus releases the virus particles.22 The E4 gene encodes seven proteins that affect transcription and affect host cell functions, including proliferation and apoptosis (in part by degrading p53). This gene is essential for nuclear export of viral RNA.23 Adenoviruses are species specific. Their taxonomic family is Adenoviridae there are four genera: Siadenovirus, Aviadenovirus, Atadenovirus, and Mastadenovirus. Each genus is serologically distinct from the others and there is great variation among the genera, especially regarding the size of the genomes and the virion surface proteins. The Siadenvirus genus has only two known members: Frog adenovirus 1 and Turkey adenovirus 3. This genus only affects amphibians (frogs) and birds (turkey, pheasant, and chicken). The Aviadenovirus genus infects birds only and its genome is approximately 20% - 45% larger than the other genera in the family. The Atadenovirs genus has a broad range of hosts (snake, duck, opossum, ruminant, etc) and all of the affected classes are vertebrates. The Mastadenovirus genus infects mammals only. There are at least fifty-one antigenicaly unique serotypes or species categorized into six subgenera (A-F).24 19 Alan J. D.

Benko, VIIIth Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (Jan. 2007), available at http://www.vmri.hu/~harrach/AdVtaxlong.htm. 10 This virus is genetically very similar to the host cells which it infects. Antivirals have generally been ineffective against adenovirus infection. The vaccine against adenovirus is live, oral and attenuated in the intestine. Vaccines are administered to the military but not available for general use because of concern about the live vaccine's oncogenic potential and the level of attenuation achieved in children. Adenoviruses can lead to serious and sometimes fatal infections such as meningioencephalitis and pneumonia, especially in children and individuals with compromised immune systems.25 See Figure 4. Figure 426 1.B. Adenovirus Replication A single virus particle (called virion) essentially lacks all the necessary components that are present in cells to reproduce. They are therefore completely dependent on the host cells for this function. Viruses of the family Adenoviridae are no different. They use the host cells own replication machinery (DNA polymerase, DNA binding protein etc.) to reproduce the viral DNA in the cell.27 25 Tatsis et al., supra note 5, at 616-18. 26 Benko, supra note 24. 27 TOPLEY AND WILSON'S MICROBIOLOGY AND MICROBIAL INFECTIONS, VOLUME 1: VIROLOGY 75-91(9th ed., Oxford Univ. Press 1998). 11 Figure 5: Adenovirus cell infection.28 Replication is divided into 2 phases: early and late. The late phase starts upon onset of DNA replication. Before and independently of genome replication, immediate early and early mRNAs are transcribed from the input DNA. Transcription of the Adenovirus genome is regulated by virus-encoded trans-acting regulatory factors. Products of the immediate early genes regulate expression of the early genes. Early genes are encoded at various locations on both strands of the DNA.29 See Figure 5. The first mRNA/protein to be made (~1h after infection) is E1A. This protein is a trans-acting transcriptional regulatory factor whose precise mode of action is not known (not a DNA-binding \"transcription factor\") but is necessary for transcriptional activation of early genes. The protein is also capable of activating transcription from a variety of other viral and cellular promoters and shows no sequence-specificity, rather a modification of the cellular environment. E1A is considered the \"immortalizing\" protein of Adenoviruses.30 \"E\" mRNA/proteins are made during the early phase. \"L\" mRNA/proteins are made during the late phase.31 Refer to Figure 3 (above). 28 Alan Cann, Welcome to Microbiologybytes, www.microbiologybytes.com (last visited Dec. 3, 2008). 29 J. Flint & T. Shenk, Viral Transactivating Proteins, 31 ANNUAL REVIEW OF GENETICS 177, 192. (1997). 30 John W. Shiver & Emilio A. Emini, Recent Advances in the Development of HIV-1 Vaccines Using Replication-Incompetent Adenovirus Vectors, 55 ANNUAL REVIEW OF MEDICINE 355, 357 (2004). 31 Cann, supra note 28. 12 Upon E1A being made, the early phase of replication begins and E1B is made. E1B \"cooperates\" with E1A to transform the cell. The E1B gene product 19K also seems to function co-operatively with E1A and p53 in promoting oncogenesis and transformation, mainly by ensuring that the downstream consequences of cell cycle release do not induce apoptosis.32 At this point E3 proteins are made. There are seven E3 proteins, none of which is required for replication in cultured cells, implying anti-immune functions. E3 has therefore been called the \"stealth\" gene, allowing adenoviruses to evade the host immune response.33 Thereafter, late transcription ensues, with five cassettes of transcripts (termed L1 to L5) resulting from a complex series of splicing events. These lead to the production of the virus structural components and the encapsidation and maturation of virus particles in the nucleus. A key player in the control of transcription is the major late promoter (MLP), which is attenuated during transcription of the early genes. Late phase gene expression is primarily concerned with the synthesis of virion proteins.34 The adenovirus genome has inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) of about 100 bp. Located within the ITRs are the cis-acting DNA sequences which define ori, the origin of DNA replication. Covalently attached to each 5' end is a terminal protein (TP) which is likely to be an additional cis-acting component of ori. Within the terminal 51 bp of the adenovirus 2 genome, four regions have been defined that are involved in initiation of replication. The terminal 18 bp are regarded as the minimal replication origin and these sequences can direct limited initiation with just the three viral proteins involved in replication: preterminal protein (pTP), DNA polymerase (pol) and DNA binding protein (DBP). However, two cellular transcription factors, nuclear factor I (NFI) and nuclear factor III (NFIII) are required for efficient levels of replication. In contrast adenovirus 4 replicates efficiently without NFI and NFIII. A further cellular factor, a topoisomerase, is required for complete elongation.35 The DNA replication has multiple steps: First, the viral genome is coated with DBP This protein reacts co-operatively with the cellular transcription factor NFI which binds to a recognition site within the origin of replication, separated from the 1-18 bp core by a precisely defined spacer region. NFIII also binds at a specific recognition site between nucleotides 39 and 48. Protein-protein interactions, between NFI and pol, and pTP and NFIII help recruit the pTP-pol heterodimer into the preinitiation complex. Interaction between the heterodimer and specific base pairs 9 to 18 in the DNA sequence ensures correct positioning and the complex is further stabilized by interactions between the incoming pTP-pol and the genome-bound TP. 32 W.C. Russell, Update on adenovirus and its vector, 81 J. GEN. VIROLOGY 2573, 2576 (2000). 33 MicrobiologyBytes, supra note 9. 34 Russell, supra note 32, at 2577. 35 MicrobiologyBytes, supra note 9. 13 DNA replication is then initiated by a protein priming mechanism in which a covalent linkage is formed between the alpha-phosphoryl group of the terminal residue, dCMP and the beta-hydroxyl group of a serine residue in pTP, a reaction catalysed by pol. This acts as a primer for synthesis of the nascent strand. Base pairing with the second GTA triplet of the template strand guides the synthesis of a pTP-trinucleotide, which then jumps back 3 bases, to base pair with the first triplet (also GTA) and synthesis then proceeds by displacing the non-template strand. NFI dissociates as the first nucleotide binds just prior to the initiation reaction. Dissociation of pTP from pol begins as the pTP-trinucleotide is formed and is almost complete by the time 7 nucleotides have been synthesized. NFIII dissociates as the replication binding fork passes through the NFIII binding site. Assembly of these virion proteins starts in the cytoplasm where the monomers become penton and hexon capsomers. The newly replicated DNA is then inserted into these hollow capsids in the nucleus.36 Eventually, the cell will lyse from the continuous replication of the Adenovirus, facilitated by the adenovirus protein E3-11.6K which induces apoptosis. This allows release of the virus to infect more of the host's cells.37 1.C. Adenovirus Infection Adenovirus infection is widespread in nature, affecting many species including humans, monkeys, pigs, cows, horses, sheep, dogs and birds.38 Adenovirus infects the tissue lining of the respiratory tract causing illnesses including acute upper respiratory tract infections and may also be the cause of illness such as gastroenteritis, conjunctivitis, cystitis, and rashes.39 A particular illness may be associated with a certain type of adenovirus as illustrated in Table 1. Disease At Risk Acute Respiratory Illness Military recruits, boarding schools, etc. Pharyngitis Infants Gastroenteritis Infants Conjunctivitis All Pneumonia Infants, military recruits Keratoconjunctivitis All Acute Haemorrhagic Infants 36 Id. 37 Id. 38 Id.; Teng Chih Yang et al., T-cell Immunity Generated by Recombinant Adenovirus Vaccines, 6(3) EXPERT REVIEW VACCINES 347, 348 (2007). 39 MicrobiologyBytes, supra note 9; Center for Disease Control, http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/revb/respiratory/ eadfeat.htm (last visited Dec. 3, 2008). 14 Cystitis Hepatitis Infants, liver transplant patients Table 1: List of Diseases and Associated at risk person(s)40 Most people will have been infected with some sort of adenovirus infection by the age of fifteen due to its prevalence within the population. Because the adenovirus is only present within a few cells of the body, scientists have been unable to ascertain how long the virus can live within the body or if it is capable of re-activation resulting in illness after long periods of dormancy. However, it has been ascertained that virus re-activation occurs during times of immunosuppression (i.e. AIDS and organ transplants).41 In order to replicate, the adenovirus must remain hidden from the immune system until such time as the replication has completed. Adenoviruses have three main means of avoiding the host immune system. The first method of avoidance by the virus involves preventing the action of the interferons which play a crucial role in attacking the adenovirus infection. Interferons seek to stop the replication of the adenovirus and boost the body's immune response (i.e. macrophages and natural killer cells). By preventing the action of the interferons, the adenovirus survives and replicates. The second method of avoidance by the virus involves preventing cell death using the adenovirus E1b protein. Preventing a cell from \"commit[ting] suicide\" to spare the host from viral infection allows the virus to continue spreading. Finally, the final method of avoidance by the virus involves ensnaring the host major histocompatibility complex (MHC) within the endoplasmic reticulum. The MHC functions to signal distress to the immune system. The trapping of the MHC, thus, allows virus cells to preserve themselves by not displaying viral peptides to the immune system.42 Figure 6 illustrates the process of adenovirus infection. First, the adenovirus vector binds to a specific cellular receptor, coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) on the surface of the host cell. Next, endocytosis occurs, resulting in the virus being freed into the cytoplasm. The virus then heads to the nucleus where gene expression occurs.43 40 MicrobiologyBytes, supra note 9. 41 Id. 42 Immune System Evasion and Adenovirus, http://www.stanford.edu/group/virus/adeno/2004takahashi/webpage/Immune%20System%20Evasion%20and%20Adenoviruses.htm (last visited Dec. 3, 2008). 43 Juan Contreras, Nonhuman Primate Models in Type 1 Diabetes Research, 45(3) INST. LABORATORY ANIMAL RESEARCH J. 334, 337. 15 Figure 6: Adenovirus Infection44 At least 49 adenovirus serotypes have been identified to date, classified into six subgroups (i.e. A, B, C, D, E, and F) based on hemagglutination properties, genomic organization and ability to produce tumors in rodents.45 Adenoviruses belonging to subgroup A including serotype 12 (Ad12) have been found to induce tumors with short latency and high frequency. Those belonging to subgroup B including serotypes 3 and 7 (Ad3 and Ad7) are weakly oncogenic. Adenoviruses belonging to subgroup C including serotypes 1, 2 and 5 (Ad1, Ad2 and Ad5) as well as the serotypes in subgroups D, E and F are non-oncogenic. Serotypes 1, 2 and 5 (Ad1, Ad2 and Ad5) are adenoviruses which most commonly infect humans and generally cause mild upper respiratory infections in children. Serious infections such as pneumonia and meningioencephalitis may be caused by adenovirus serotypes 4 and 7 (Ad4, Ad7) and 32 (Ad7, Ad12 and Ad32), respectively.46 The serotypes most frequently used in human vaccination research are Ad5. This particular serotype is rigid, accepting only those genomes which are no bigger than 105% of the wild-type genome. This characteristic allows the insertion of only about 2 kb of exogenous DNA. Recombinant serotype 5 (rAd5) has specifically been targeted for vaccination research based on the above. Additionally, recombinant adenoviruses are highly immunogenic, have been extensively researched resulting in simple methods of introducing DNA into the genome and their characteristics are easily amplified in culture.47 2.

Adenovirus Uses Other Than Cancer and HIV 44 Id. 45 Id.; Yang et al., supra note 38, at 348. 46 MicrobiologyBytes, supra note 9; Tatsis et al., supra note 2, at 618. 47 Yang et al., supra note 38, at 348. 16 Adenoviruses have been heavily used as vectors to deliver a vaccine primarily because of their benign history of upper respiratory tract infections and more generally, their lack of association with oncogenicity in humans.48 The use of serotypes Ad4 and Ad7 have been particularly useful as they have been used for decades in soldiers to combat acute respiratory distress without any adverse effects.49 In addition to the safety factors, adenoviruses are excellent candidates for use as vaccine vectors because adenoviruses have high gene-transfer potential, the ability to be propagated to high titers, a broad cell tropism, a large insert capacity, a well characterized genome and protocols for manipulation and are highly immunogenic. These characteristics make adenoviruses excellent candidates to be used as vectors not only for HIV, but also for other diseases.50 The majority of adenovirus vectored vaccines for infectious and non-infectious disease are based on first generation Ad5.51 The E1 and E3 replication regions are generally removed or manipulated to carry an antigen expression cassette in place of the deleted region.52 Several laboratories are also experimenting with vectors from other serotypes, non-human adenoviruses and chimeric or hybrid vectors.53 One group of viral infections that have been attacked using adenovirus vectors includes Hepatitis C, Dengue viruses, Ebola virus, Marburg giloviruses and most recently, SARS.54 See Table 2. Replication defective rAd vectors encoding Hepatitis C virus (HCV) have been shown to elicit specific immune responses and varying degrees of protection using a mouse model.55 Structural proteins of several different adenovirus serotypes in animals have shown encouraging results for Dengue Fever.56 Using rAd to encode a recombinant antibody was shown to protect mice against a lethal West Nile Virus Challenge.57 Human Ad5 expressing an Ebola envelope glycoprotein was shown to elicit immune responses in mice and fully protect monkeys from the virus. A human ebola vaccine is still needed as one of the more successful NIH ebola vaccine trials has been paused for review. Encouraging results to combat SARS (avian flu), Marburg virus, Rabies, and malaria have also been produced.58 48 Tatsis et al., supra note 5, at 618. 49 Tanu Chawla et al., Adenovirus-Vectored Vaccines, 18(3) EXPERT OPINION ON THERAPEUTIC PATENTS 293, 293-94 (2008). 50 Tatsis et al., supra note 5, at 616. 51 Id. 52 Id. at 619. 53 Id. at 624. 54 Id. 55 Chawla, supra note 49, at 299. 56 Tatsis et al., supra note 5, at 624. 57 Chawla, supra note 49, at 299. 58 Tatsis et al., 2.B. for Production of Adenovirus Vectors There are a number of methods that have been used by clinicians to prepare alternative adenovirus (Ad) vectors to treat HIV.60 The prominent methods that are currently receiving the majority of attention are ligation, deletions, alternative serotypes, and altered tropisms. These methods are all used to increase the effectiveness of gene transfer with an adenovirus vector. Prior to looking at the methods it is important to first look at the evolution of adenovirus vectors.61 The first attempts at creating a vector involved non replicating vectors, also commonly referred to as First Generation adenoviruses. These were based on an E1 deletion. This is followed by the insertion of foreign DNA through homologous recombination. There was also the potential to include an E3 deletion, this would allow for a larger piece of DNA to be inserted, and has shown to decrease host immune 59 Id. 60 John W. Shiver et al., Replication-Incompetent Adenoviral Vaccine Vector Elicits Effective Anti-Immunodeficiency - Virus Immunity, 415 NATURE 331, 332 (2002). 61 Eric J. Kremer et al., Canine Adenovirus Vectors: an Alternative for Adenovirus-Mediated Gene Transfer, 74 J. VIROLOGY 505, 505 (2000). 18 response.62 One of the major drawbacks of the First Generation is that the deletion of the E1 gene is not enough to totally obliterate all viral gene activation.63 Those limitations lead to the advent of the Second Generation vectors. At this point the vector contained additional deletions and/or mutations within E2 or E4 regions. This increased the potential package size. The E4 deletion in the viral genome offered an improvement in the stability of gene expression, with a reduction in the inflammatory response.64 The most resent work has been done in the Last Generation or Gutless adenoviruses. These vectors are devoid of all viral coding regions.65 It also contains only the cis-acting elements. These vectors often require a Helper Virus to produce the virus. The use of a Helper requires the use of a strategy to avoid/reduce helper contamination.66 One of the first methods for producing a vector was by in vitro ligation. This method starts with a deletion at the E-1 deleted Ad vectors.67 After the gene of interest is inserted downstream of the viral sequence of the plasmid, the fragment containing viral sequence and the gene of interest is excised and ligated into the unique site, in this case the ClaI site, replacing a portion of the viral E1 region, the ligated DNA is then transfected into cells to make recombinant virus. This method is rarely used as it is very inefficient and requires additional steps of purification for contamination and transgene null viruses related to the incomplete restrictions digestions and self-relegation.68 Construction of recombinant adenovirus by ligation consists of the following steps: first, introduce three unique restriction sites into the E1 deletion site of the vector plasmid, this plasmid contains a complete E1, E3-deleted adenovirus type 5 genome; second, a shuttle plasmid containing multiple cloning sites between the sites, is then constructed.69 Once the gene of interest is inserted into the shuttle plasmid, the plasmid for E1-deleted adenovirus vector can be prepared by in vitro ligation using the sites. The large number and strategic location of the unique restriction sites will not only increase 62 Kathleen M.

This variability comes into play through the amount of the adenovirus sequence can be deleted. With the deletion of E3, which encodes gene products that are nonessential for virus replication, there is room to accommodate an additional 3.5 kb of foreign sequence.71 Deletion of adenovirus is done to facilitate the insertion of the desired gene of interest. The steps to achieve the deletion are: first, generate knockout point mutations into the unassigned adenovirus open reading frames (ORFs) to determine if they were essential for virus replication; second, construct genomes with various deletions in the regions of these nonessential ORFs; third, an expression cassette coding for the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) is inserted in place of the deletions to follow expression of the transgene and propagation of the vector in cell monolayers; fourth, retain the vector backbone that has the largest deletion, this can then be used for the construction of vectors carrying infectious virus proteins.72 These vectors can then be used for vaccinations.73 Another area of research has been in alternative serotypes, most currently used adenovirus vectors are based upon serotypes 2 and 5 (Ad2 and Ad5), but these vectors are limited in their application due to anti-immunity in the population.74 There are 51 identified serotypes of human adenovirus, divided into six species (A-F), each with a different tropism. Adenoviruses of different species have different tropisms, indicating that serotypes other than Ad2 or Ad5 could be evaluated for their potential as a vector. It stands within reason that these other serotypes can alleviate the limited tissue tropism and immunity problems of Ad2 and Ad5.75 Altered tropisms have also been used to increase the viability of adenovirus vectors. Gene delivery to cells by adenovirus is initiated by the binding of the adenovirus fiber knob to a cellular receptor.76 Of the 6 species, A and C-F have the same coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR), species B uses a receptor different from CAR. Studies have shown that the fiber of the subtype C can be replaced with that of 70 Id. at 215-16. 71 I.

This ability to genetically engineer the tropisms allows for a variety of potential vaccines.77 2.C. Strategies to Attack Pre-existing Immunity 2.C.1. From Drawbacks to Merits Recombinant adenovirus vectors have been recognized as a favorable candidate for gene therapy because of their high transduction efficiency. However, transgene expression from adenovirus gene therapy vectors was significantly limited by the rapid emergence of potent cellular and humoral immune responses against both the vector and the insert.78 Ironically, however, it is a desirable feature for vector-based vaccine. 2.C.2. Adenovirus Immunogenecity Mechanism The mechanism of the adenovirus immunogenicity can be divided into four steps. First, adenovirus vectors attach to cells by a specific interaction between the adenovirus fiber proteins and its cell receptors. The receptors vary according to the adenovirus serotypes. For example, Ad5 attaches to the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) on the surface of the host cell, and Ad35 attaches to CD46 rather than CAR as the receptor. Second, once an adenovirus vector attaches to the receptor of the host cell, it enters into the cell by an endocytosis mechanism between RGD motif of penton base and cellular intergrins. Third, the acidification of endosomes allows the vector to escape into the cytoplasm and traffic to the nucleus. Finally, antigens are synthesized intracellularly, and these antigens are efficiently processed and presented in association with MHC class I molecules on the cell surface.79 77 Thomas J. Wickham, Targeting Adenovirus, 17 GENE THERAPY 110, 111 (2000). 78 Barouch et al., supra note 5, at 150. 79 Id. 21 Figure 7: Transduction of adenovirus into the cell80 2.C.3. Problems of Pre-existing Antivector Immunity Pre-existing anti-vector immunity could neutralize the vaccine and eliminate transduced cells before immune priming; thereby, suppressing vaccine-elicited immune responses. For example, in certain regions in developing countries, Ad5 sero-prevalence is more than 90%, with remarkably high neutralizing antibody (Nab) titers.81 Not only are Ad5 neutralizing antibodies a major reason for anti-Ad5 immunity, but also Ad5 specific humoral and cellular immune response (CD4+ or CD8+ T Lymphocytes) contribute to the suppression of the immunogenicity of adenovirus vaccine.82 2.C.4. Strategies to Attack Pre-existing Immunity Scientists have been studying the effects of fulfilling pre-existing antivector immunity. Currently, there are at least three categories being considered. The first category includes the use of novel methods to deliver existing rAd5 vectors, molecular engineering of rAd5 vectors, and developing novel rAd vectors from alternative serotypes or different species. It also includes an administration of higher doses of rAd5 vectors, rAd5 boosting after DNA priming, or mucosal delivery of rAd5 vectors, etc. The second category includes the use of specific engineering of rAd5 vectors including chimeric rAd5 vectors with regions of the Ad5 fiber proteins or hexon proteins which have been exchanged for the corresponding regions of different Ad serotypes. The third category 80U.S. National Library of Medicine, Genetic Therapy Using an Adenovirus Vector, http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/ illustrations/therapyvector (last visited Dec. 4, 2008). 81 R.

HIV Vaccines 3.A. Using the Adenovirus Vector as an HIV Vaccine CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) play a critical role in control of both acute and chronic HIV-1 infections. Further, experiments in rhesus monkeys demonstrate that CD8+ T-cells are absolutely required for control of the persistent viremia established by the related simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Several studies also suggest that the elicitation in monkeys of virus-specific CTL can influence the outcome. Experiments also show that recombinant viral vectors, particularly those based on replication-defective adenoviruses were most effective in eliciting specific CTL responses.86 An optimal HIV-1 vaccine vector produces the vaccine antigen in excess of its own proteins. This will allow the immune response to focus on the target antigen and would be produced in cells that can serve as antigen-presenting cells for induction of CTL responses. Adenovirus vectors have a broad cell tropism, and they can enter and replicate in cells from most animal species.87 See Figure 9. Fig. 9 - Schematic diagrams of replication-incompetent Ad5 HIV-1 gag, pol and nef vaccine vectors.88 An adenovirus vector is commonly based on a replication-defective adenovirus type 5 (Ad5). Recombinant Ad5 vaccine vectors are highly immunogenic and elicit the highest antigen-specific CTL responses.89 The viral vector is rendered replication-defective by removing the E1 gene, which is required for both adenovirus replication and downstream viral gene expression. Genes encoding vaccine antigens may be inserted in 86 Shiver, supra note 30, at 356. 87 Id. at 357. 88 Id. at 358. 89 Barouch et al., supra note 5, at 150. 24 place of the E1 gene with expression driven by heterologous regulatory elements. Some experiments use the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and bovine growth hormone transcription regulatory elements to drive expression of the vaccine antigen.90 See Figure 10. Fig. 10: Advantages and disadvantages of rAd5 Vector-Based Vaccines for HIV-1.91 Adenovirus vectors retain the ability to efficiently bind cells, become internalized and deliver their genome to the nucleus for subsequent expression of encoded antigen genes. E1-deleted adenoviruses can be produced in large quantities in human cell lines designed to provide the E1 gene product in trans. The most typical cell lines used for E1-deleted adenovirus propagation are 293 and PER.C6 cells.92 See Figure 11. Fig. 11: The Original HIV-1 gag Adenovector (Ad5HIV-1gag) disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,733,993.93 3.B. Measuring Cellular Immune Responses Against HIV-1 Antigens Since the objective of the HIV-1 vaccine is to elicit anti-HIV-1 cytotoxic and helper T-cell immune responses, a proper method must be used to measure the CTL 90 Shiver et al., supra note 30, at 357. 91 Barouch et al., supra note 5, at 150. 92 Shiver et al., supra note 30, at 358. 93 U.S. Patent No. 6,733,993 (filed Sept. 14, 2001). 25 responses. Traditionally, CTL responses were measured by the in vitro capacity of CD8+ T cells to kill autologous cells presenting appropriate cytotoxicity assays. These assays are not quantitative and are extremely tedious to perform. However new methods have emerged that enable a more accurate measurement of the antigen-specific population for CD8+ and CD4+ T cells.94 The ELISPOT assay is an efficient and sensitive means of assessing the total T-cell response to a given antigen and detects a much larger fraction of the actual responding T-cell population than previously used assays. The ELISPOT is performed in 96-well plates coated with anticytokine antibodies into which peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are added along with peptides representing a processed form of the target antigen. When activated by the processed antigen, cells produce and secrete cytokines that are captured by the anticytokine antibodies. The cells are washed away after overnight stimulation with the antigen and a second anticytokine antibody is added. The second antibody is conjugated to an enzyme that leaves a colorimetric substrate that becomes insoluble. Spots representing individual cytokine-secreting cells may be visualized, counted and normalized with respect to the number of cells added to each well.95 The ICS assay is similar to the ELISPOT assay except that the induced cytokines are trapped within the cells by brefeldin A treatment. These cytokines accumulate within cells that are identified using anticytokine antibodies but are visualized by flow cytometry. The ICS is a little less sensitive than the ELISPOT but provides additional information regarding the T-cell population responding to the antigen. T-cells can be phenotyped as either CD8+ or CD4+ so that the total and relative contributions of each T-cell can be quantified.96 94 Shiver et al., supra note 30, at 358. 95 Id. at 359. 96 Id. at 359-60. 26 Fig. 12: Examples of an IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay, an ICS and a CFSE proliferation assay are shown. All assays test for responses to peptide stimulations. For the ELISPOT assay, the spots represent IFN-gamma, which has been secreted by an individual cell in response to stimulation. For the ICS assay, each dot represents a CD8 T cell and the position in the FACScan represents the cytokines produced in response to peptide stimulation. Cells in the upper left quadrant are IFN-gammaproducing cells, cells in the upper right quadrant are IFN-gamma and IL-2producing cells and cells in the lower right quadrant are cells that produce only IL-2 (this cell type is rare among CD8 cells). The strength of cytokine production by individual cells is reflected by the positions of cells in their respective quadrants. For the CFSE assay, cells were pre-stained with CFSE and then stimulated with peptide for 6 days. Following the stimulation, CD8 cells were analyzed for CFSE and staining with Ki-67 (a marker for dividing cells). Cells with the least intense staining for CFSE (furthest to the left in the FACScan) and positive for Ki-67 (upper quadrants) are the ones that have undergone the most division. h, hours; d, days.97 3.C. Selecting Vaccine Antigens and Potential for Cross-Clade Immune Responses HIV-1 contains many genetically diverse groups that have been separated into at least 10 defined families or clades of viruses. These clades have been alphabetically designated. Clade C, the most prevalent worldwide, is found predominantly in southern Africa and southern Asia. Clade A, the second most prevalent, predominates in central Africa and eastern Asia. Clade B, the third most prevalent, is found mostly in the western hemisphere and Europe. Together, Clades A, B and C comprise about 85% of all 97 Harriet L. Robinson & Rama Rao Amara, 11 NATURE MEDICINE S25, S30 (2005). 27 infections worldwide. The best T-cell based vaccine for covering this diverse range of genetic groups requires a T-cell response against multiple epitopes to ensure a sufficient match between vaccine antigen and infecting virus to trigger an effective immune response.98 Consequently, the leading vaccine candidate for initial efficacy studies is a trivalent mixture of Ad5 vectors, each encoding either HIV-1 gag, pol or nef as vaccine antigens. The antigens are among the most conserved and largest gene products of HIV-1 that serve as targets for CTL responses in HIV-1 infected humans. The highest level of T-cell responses was observed against gag, pol and nef.99 3.D. Current Progress for HIV Vaccines Using Adenovirus Vector- Clinic Trials 3.D.1. Clinical Trial Overview100 Clinical trials for vaccines are divided into three phases: Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III. A phase I trial is the first test on human for a vaccine. The trial is usually tests a small number (ten to thirty) of healthy volunteers. The main goal is to evaluate the safety of the vaccine. The trial also collects data for the immune responses evoked by the vaccine, and dosage and immunization schedule of the vaccine. A Phase I trial takes about eight to twelve months to complete. A phase II trial usually tests a mixture of low-risk and higher-risk volunteers. The number of volunteers is usually increased in a range of fifty to five hundred. These volunteers are chose from people where the corresponding phase III will be conducted. In this stage, the researchers collect additional safety data and additional information for refining the dosage and immunization schedule. Sometimes, this information is enough to indicate the efficacy of the tested vaccine. A phase III trial increases the number of volunteers to thousands. These volunteers are high-risk people from the area that the HIV is circulating. A phase III trial of HIV vaccine is generally expected to require a minimum of three years for enrollment, immunizations, and assessments of efficacy. 3.D.2. Current Clinical Trial for HIV Vaccine Using Human Adenovirus Ad5 Vector There are more than 30 clinic trials studying different approaches for HIV vaccine candidates. Some related to adenovirus vectors are listed below.101 98 Shiver et al., supra note 30, at 361. 99 Shiver et al., supra note 30, at 361-62. 100 International AIDS Vaccine Institute, Vaccine Science: Clinical Trials for a Candidate Vaccine are Divided into Three Distinct Phases (2008), http://www.iavi.org/viewpage.cfm?aid=27 (last visited Dec. 4, 2008.) 28 Phase Vector Antigen (clade) Organizer, Sponsor, manufacturer* I DNA prime/ Ad boost Ad alone Gag, Pol, Nef (B), Nnv (ABC); Gag, Pol (B), Env (ABC) IAVI, VRC I DNA prime/ Ad boost or Ad prime/ Ad boost Gag, Pol, Env (B); Gag, Pol, Env (A, B, C) HVTN, VRC Gag, Pol Env (A,B, C) HVTN, NIAID, VRC II Pol, Nef (B), Env (A,B,C); Gag, Merck * HVTN: HIV Vaccine Trials Network; IAVI: International AIDS Vaccine Initiative; NIAID: US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; VRC: Vaccine Research Center at the US National Institutes of Health; WRAIR: Walter Reed Army Institute of Research Table 4102 Among these trials, two demonstrate the highest level of immunogenicity by two different approaches: (1) recombinant Ad5 adenovirus vector, or (2) in combination with plasmid DNA in a heterologous DNA/Ad5 prime-boost regimen.103 The two trials are performed by Merck and VRC (Vaccine Research Center of NIH). 3.D.2.a. Merck Research The vector used in Merck's research is a modified human adenovirus vector Ad5. The vector is called MRKAd5.104 It is an Ad5-gag recombinant vector or an Ad5-gag/pol/nef vector.105 The Ad5-gag recombinant vector generated CD8+ CTL response 101 David A.

Merck's Phase II Trial 109 A Phase II trial is formed for Ad5-gag/pol/nef trivalent recombinant Ad5 vaccine by Merck, HVTN (HIV Vaccine Trial Network) and NIAID (US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) at several centers in North America, Peru, Brazil, Caribbean Island, and Australia. Originally, the vaccine is tested on 1500 volunteers in eight countries. This project only enrolls people with a low level of pre-existing immunity to Ad5 so the researches can fairly assess how effective the vaccine would be. The result will come out by the end year 2009. 3.D.2.a.ii. Merck's Phase IIb Trial 110 The project later progressed into a Phase IIb \"test of concept\" trial. This kind of trial enrolls only 2000-5000 volunteers, which is much less than what a Phase III trials usually requires (more than 10,000 volunteers). The trial is not designed to establish the efficacy of this vaccine; it is to help researches decide if this vaccine candidate is worth testing in larger Phase III trials. More diverse population of volunteers enrolled in this phase; that is, not only people with a low level pre-existing immunity were enrolled. The vaccine candidate is tested on approximately 3,000 volunteers. 3.D.2.b. VRC Research111 This vaccine candidate uses another non-replicative vector expresses and gag/pol/nef proteins from Clade B.112 On the other hand, the Merck vector only encodes conserved genes gag/pol/nef from clade B. By using a DNA prime/Adenovirus boost strategy, the study shows the vaccine candidate enhanced CD4+T lymphocyte count in macaques. DNA prime is one method dealing with pre-existing immunity issue. DNA prime may allow the levels of boosted CD8 responses in seropositive individual to approach those of seronegatives who receive Ad5 vectors alone. 3.D.2.b.i.

A Phase I DNA-Ad5 prime-boost trial test is further tested in US, Brazil and South Africa and extended to East Africa in collaboration with IAVI (International AIDS Vaccine Initiative). In 2006, a trial begun at IAVI's sites in Kenya and Rwanda and IAVI's core laboratory at Imperial College in UK. IAVI and NIH planned to do an additional 500-person trial in high-risk population in Africa.114 IAVI also proposed enrolling approximately 600 participants to do a Phase IIb efficacy trial; however, this project is on hold in light of Merck Ad5 trial results (which might yield efficacy data in late 2008 or early 2009). 115 3.D.3 Other Clinical Trials Using Vectors Other than Human Ad5 Vector The pre-existing immunity problem is the major issue affecting the efficacy of these HIV vaccine candidates using adenovirus vectors. There are numerous strategies are underway to circumvent this issue, including (1) the use of higher doses of virus, (2) using different less common adenoviral serotypes, and (3) using different viruses in a prime-boost regimen.116 One study examines the use of an Ad prime/MVA or canarypox boost that resulted in enhance immune responses in macaques; however, a use of a poxvirus prime/ Ad boost failed to elicit impressive immune responses.117 The data indicate that the immunization order is critical to ability to generate immune response.118 In addition, less common adenoviral serotypes such as Ad6, Ad35, Ad11, or Ad24 are studied to replace Ad5 vector in future HIV vaccine trials conducted by Merck, Crucell, Transgene and IAVI.119 There are two more ways researches tried to solve the pre-existing immunity issue- use nonhuman adenovirus vectors such as such as Ad5/Ad11 or Ad5/Ad35.120 By replacing the fiber gene of an Ad5 vector by that from a rare Ad subtype to achieve the goal to escape the anti-Ad5 pre-existing immunity.121 3.D.3.a. Clinical trial Using Human Adenovirus Vector Other than Ad5 by IAVI 122 The trial has been conducted by IAVI, Crucell, a Dutch biotech firm and Harvard Medical School since 2004. Replication-defective Ad35 and Ad11 are used as vectors. 114 International AIDS Vaccine Institute, 2006 Annual Progress Report (2006), available at http://www.iavi.org/viewfile.cfm?fid=46170 115 Id. 116 Hokey et al., supra note 101, at 274-76 117 Id. 118 Id. 119 Girard et al., supra note 105, at 4069. 120 Id. 121 Id. 122 International AIDS Vaccine Institute, 2007 Annual Progress Report (2007), available at http://www.iavi.org/viewfile.cfm?fid=49059; International AIDS Vaccine Institute, 2005 Annual Progress Report (2005), available at http://www.iavi.org/viewfile.cfm?fid=40735; see also International AIDS Vaccine Institute, 2006 Annual Progress Report, supra note 31. 31 In year 2006, IAVI completed characterization of a cell line licensed from Crucell and received favorable regulatory feedback from FDA. IAVI further provided a non-exclusive license to Beth Israel Deaconess medical center, which a major teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School to manufacture Ad vector for clinical trials. IAVI also ready to initiate a Phase I trial in US and Ease Africa in Q3 of 2008. 3.D.3.b Clinical trial using Nonhuman Primate Adenovirus by IAVI 123 In June 2005, IAVI contracted GSK (GlaxoSmithKline) for this project. The main focus is to evaluate replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus vectors including AdC68, AdC6, or AdC7, as human vaccine for HIV. However, this project was terminated in year 2007. 3.E. Future Approaches Towards Developing an Adenovirus-based Vaccine After the clinical trials for the promising Merck rAd5 vaccine were terminated due to its failure to show efficacy and to the problem of pre-existing Ad5-specific immunity, scientists began to search for a way to circumvent pre-existing vector immunity and for a reason why the vaccine was actually increasing the risk of HIV-1 acquisition among some volunteers.124 This unexpected discovery that prior immunity against the adenovirus would increase susceptibility to HIV infection in volunteers has shifted many scientists back to basic research for a better understanding about the relationship between infection and immunity and to search for alternative approaches towards developing effective vector-based vaccines, including the use of novel animal models for testing immune responses to the vaccines.125 3.E.1. Major Alternative Approaches There are currently two major alternative approaches involving adenovirus vectors to circumvent the problem of pre-existing immunity.126 The first approach involves DNA prime-boost in combination with Ad5; the second approach explores other types of adenoviral vectors, such as Ad26 and Ad35, that may be more effective than Ad5 due to lower pre-existing immunity to these alternative adenoviral vectors and because they do have the same receptor as Ad5.127 Other alternative approaches include using non-human adenoviral vectors such as those from a chimpanzee origin, novel rAd chimeric vectors combining different characteristics of different adenoviral vectors, and masked adenoviral vectors.128 123 Id. 124 Rafick-Pierre Sekaly, The failed HIV Merck vaccine study: a step back or a launching point for future vaccine development?, 205(1) J.

Prime-Boosting Regimens One alternative approach is to develop a DNA prime plus adenoviral vector boost approach. DNA priming is important for inducing strong HIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses in monkeys; the DNA prime boost regimen has led to strong env-specific responses and the Merck rAd5 vaccine, focusing on the gag/pol/nef genes, did not involve env constructs.129 Since many people in developing countries have already developed a pre-existing immunity to Ad5 in its naturally circulating form, this suggests that the use of Ad5 alone may not be the best choice as a carrier virus in a vaccine. However, DNA priming can be used in combination with Ad5 or with other adenovirus serotypes to circumvent pre-existing immunity because the level of CD8+ responses is higher with the boost than the level of responses with Ad5 alone.130 The NIH Vaccine Research Center has developed a vaccine regimen using this DNA prime-boost approach and early studies has shown the vaccine to be immunogenic, especially to env-antigens.131 3.E.3. Adenoviral Vectors from Rare Human Serotypes Since Ad5 may not be the ideal carrier virus, alternative adenoviral vectors derived from less common serotypes are being studied for use in vaccines; in particular, alternative adenoviral vectors that can provide a level of immunogenicity at a similar level as Ad5 are needed.132 There are 51 known human Ad serotypes, divided into six subgroups, from A-F. A past study found Ad35 and Ad11 from subgroup B as promising alternatives to Ad5, but it noted that there are disadvantages for using less common serotypes, such as \"lack of knowledge regarding the biology of these viruses including tropism on human cells, potential difficulties in manufacturing, and the possibility of in vivo recombination with human types leading to unknown disease.\"133 A more recent study has compared the seroprevalence and immunogenicity of six rare serotype recombinant adenovirus vaccine vectors and has identified the Ad serotypes that are highly immunogenic and that best circumvent anti-Ad5 immunity.134 The study compared Ad5 from group C with Ad11, Ad35, and Ad50 from group B and Ad26, Ad48, and Ad49 from group D; the seroprevalence of all six serotypes were lower than that of Ad5.135 The results showed that in the absence of anti-Ad5 immunity, Ad5 vectors were consistently the most immunogenic; the reason for Ad5's potency is unclear, but possible reasons are efficient entry into cells or efficient triggering of innate immunity that amplifies adaptive immune responses.136 With anti-Ad5 immunity, all six rare serotype Ad vectors were significantly more immunogenic than the Ad5 vectors; and among the 129 Spearman, supra note 106, at 1157. 130 Id. 131 Dan H.

Priming with a rare Ad26 vector followed by boosting with Ad5 has proved to be a very potent combination.139 A clinical trial has showed that rAd26 elicited strong immune responses in rhesus macaques at levels similar to those observed with rAd5, and a rAd26 prime/rAd5 boost combination elicited cellular responses that were ten times that observed with a homologous rAd5 immunization.140 3.E.4. Nonhuman Primate Studies A current method used to understand the interaction between infection and vaccination in order to develop an effective HIV vaccine is to develop better animal models for studying HIV infection and find clues about virus control from nonhuman primates.141 Scientists believe that although nonhuman primates are excellent animal models currently available for studies, they still need to be improved for studying HIV infection in humans. In this regard, mice have been genetically altered to express human immune cells and these humanized mice are presently used to study HIV pathogenesis in the gut, the area where virus replication and CD4+ T-cell depletion occurs early when humans are infected with HIV.142 The humanized mouse model is still under development; thus, for the time being, primates are still the best available model for studying HIV infection. Scientists are currently experimenting with sooty mangabeys, which are natural hosts of SIV and can be infected with the virus without harming them.143 These monkeys showed a lack of immune activation during infection, despite chronic high levels of viral replication, and showed low CCR5 expression on CD4+ T-cells. Scientists are searching for connections between this absence of immune activation, the low CCR5 expression on CD4+ T-cells, and the lack of disease progression to AIDS.144 137 Id. 138 Id. 139 Id. 140 Kimberly A.

Adenoviral Vectors from Nonhuman Serotypes The pre-existing immunity problem can also be addressed by using non-human adenoviral vectors, such as chimpanzee or porcine adenovirus vectors, as vaccine carriers.145 Chimpanzee adenovirus vectors have been shown to be the most immunogenic, inducing good CD8+ T-cell responses in the presence of preexisting antibodies against Ad5.146 Chimpanzee vectors C6, C7, and C68 have been identified as favorable carriers, and neutralizing antibodies to Ad5 do not impair transgene product-specific T-cell responses to these chimpanzee adenovirus vectors.147 induction of transgene product-specific CD8+ cells elicited by those chimpanzee vectors, affecting the efficacy of these vaccine carriers in humans.148 In addition, there is however a safety concern regarding the use of nonhuman serotypes instead of human serotypes that the nonhuman serotype adenoviral vectors \"may have the potential to recombine with their human counterparts and/or cause disease.\"149 3.E.6. Chimeric Adenoviral Vectors and Masking Adenoviral Vectors Novel rAd chimeric vectors that combine different characteristics of different adenoviral vectors may be used to circumvent the pre-existing immunity problem.150 The rAd5 vectors can be modified to circumvent anti-Ad5 immunity and to construct a novel rAd5/rAd48 chimeric vector by replacing the seven short hypervariable regions on the surface of the Ad5 hexon protein with the corresponding HVRs from a rare adenovirus serotype Ad48.151 Other chimeric vectors that have developed include combining Ad5 fiber with Ad35.152 A chimeric vector based on a nonhuman serotype has recently been developed, combining chimpanzee adenovirus vector C1 with another chimpanzee adenovirus vector C5; the T-cell responses from this combination can then be enhanced by using a prime-boost regimen.153 Finally, masking adenoviral vectors from the immune system is another alternative approach to escape pre-existing immunity.154 Adenoviral vectors can become \"hidden\" by being coated with polymers such as polyethylene glycol; the polymer-coating would mask the capsid surface and thus block the neutralizing antibodies.155 145 Chawla et al., supra note 49, at 301. 146 Julie C.

Patent Search Methodology and Results 1. Patent Search Methodology The International Intellectual Technology Institute Patent Landscape Analysis Clinic began on August 28, 2008 with a conference call between the Clinic members, Professor Jon Cavicchi, Dr. Stanley Kowalski, and Dr. Kerri Clark at PIPRA. The scope of the project was defined as conducting a patent landscape analysis of technologies pertaining to adenovirus vector vaccines having applicability to HIV. The team began the project reviewing past and recent literature relating to HIV vaccines and adenovirus vectors. The nine-member team was divided into three groups, and each group was assigned to research and present on a different aspect of adenovirus vector vaccines. The three groups presented on the general biology of adenoviruses, adenoviral vectors, and HIV vaccines; one team also researched on past and current clinical trials on HIV vaccines, which gave team members initial exposure to some of the major inventors and assignees. The first team researched the three generations of adenovirus vectors and the critical components necessary for final vaccines. The second team researched production methods of assembling HIV vaccines, including purification, packaging cell lines, screening methods, and cell lines specific for virus production. The third team researched chimeric adenovirus vector chimeras, nonhuman adenovirus vectors, and clinical trials looking at alternative adenovirus serotypes. All teams jointly researched on HIV adenovirus vector vaccines in general. The team then commenced an intense four-month journey of patent searching and coding. Delphion was the primary patent searching database that the team used. In addition to a general HIV adenovirus vector vaccine search, each group was assigned to search for patents relating to the aspect of adenovirus vector vaccine technology that the group researched and presented on. The search methodology was devised to initially generate a broad set of patents and then to narrow down the results using the \"Iterative Search Approach,\" as promoted by Professor Cavicchi. The searches utilized keywords derived from the literature reviewed and initial searches to generate useful search strings; the searches also used United States Patent Classifications, International Patent Classifications, and Derwent Classifications that were identified through subsequent searches and team meetings. Top inventor and assignee names were also identified from clinical trial data. The combination of keywords, inventor/assignee names, and classifications in search strings was useful for parsing the technology into compartments and allowing each team group to generate a different set of search results that keywords alone could not provide. The initial round of searching involved a search string (\"Adenovirus + Vector + HIV + Vaccine\") that generated a broad set of patents. Keywords and classifications were then used in subsequent rounds of searching. Later correspondences with Dr. Clark led to modifications in the team search strategy, taking into account of the future possibilities of using different types of adenovirus or vectors that have been used so far in HIV vaccines. After each round of searching, team meetings were held to identify the most important keywords, inventor names, assignee names, and classifications for use in 37 subsequent search strings that became more defined and effective. The main keywords used by the three groups in the searches were: - All Teams (search for HIV adenovirus vector vaccine patents in general): Adenovir! or Ad?? or HIV or \"human immunodeficiency virus\" - Team 1 (assigned to search vector, plasmid, vehicle, virion, immunodeficiency virus\" - Team 2 (assigned to search for patents relating to production methods): \"cell vaccine, HIV, and \"human immunodeficiency virus\" - Team 3 (assigned to search for patents relating to chimeric proteins and alternative serotypes): gag or pol or nef, hexon or penton hybrid protein? or prime or chimer! or fusion <near> or \"cell binding,\" vaccine, HIV, and \"human immunodeficiency virus\" Most of these keywords were searched under the search field of \"Title, Abstract, Claims, \" since searches under the field of \"Description\" or \"Specification\" led to too many irrelevant results. It was useful to limit the most important keywords under the search field of \"Claims.\" The keywords above were then combined with inventor names, assignee names, U.S. classifications and subclasses, International classifications 38 and subclasses, and Derwent classes to generate different sets of search results. Some of the most common classifications used were US Classifications 435/456, 435/320.1, and 435/235.1, D16, and The top inventors used in searches were Emilio Emini, John Shiver, Ronald Vogels, and Danilo Casimiro; the top assignees used in searches were Merck, Crucell Holland, GenVec, the United States Government, University of Saskatchewan, Glaxo Group, and the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania. The search strings gave the team an outcome of more than 1000 patents, which was deduplicated using the family option of MicroPatent\u00ae into 690 patents (for the meaning of 'deduplication', see the Appendix B). Each team member saved their own search results and created their own work files in Delphion. The search results were assembled together and extracted into PDF files for coding and into Excel spreadsheets for data analysis. The subsequent data analyzed were placed into a Master Sheet. The 690 patent documents were divided into the three groups for coding; the claims in the documents were analyzed and the document was then coded under one of the seven categories: 1. Vectors 2. Production Methods 3. Adenovirus Serotypes 4. Chimeric Protein 5. Final Vaccine Product 6. Prime-Boost 7. Adjuvant Each patent was initially coded by individual team members and emphasis was placed on claim language in order to determine whether the patent was relevant to adenovirus vector vaccine technology for HIV. When coding, team members also took consideration of the patent's title, abstract, and specification. Each patent was then reviewed by the entire team and Dr. Kowalski, and each patent was coded according to their relevancy. Of the 690 patents, 267 patents were found to be relevant. The coding results were inserted into a Master Sheet containing all of the information on each of the patent documents. 39 2.

There are three generations of adenovirus vectors. First generation adenovirus vectors have been developed by the deletion of E1 genes necessary for expression of E2 and late genes required for adenovirus DNA synthesis, capsid protein expression and viral replication. First generation adenovirus vectors often also include deletion of the E3 gene.157 Second generation adenovirus vectors also removed the E2 and E4 genes to provide increased packaging capacity.158 Third generation adenoviruses are gutless and require a helper virus to produce the adenovirus.159 The spreadsheet will indicate all patents that discuss any of these generations of adenovirus vectors in the category labeled \"vector.\" Patents also claim methods of producing and constructing the adenovirus vector for HIV vaccines. Original adenovirus vectors are constructed by homologous recombination. These vectors are ligated with the purified shuttle vector. The vector is then purified and used to transfect E-1 transcomplementing cells. When plaques develop, the vector is purified and tested for replication competent virus.160 Cell lines for the propagation of adenoviruses are created for transcomplementation.161 Patents generally claim methods of large-scale production and efficient purification techniques including chromatography 157 Barry, Michael A., Current Advances and Future Challenges in Adenovirus Vector Biology and Targeting, 7 CURRENT GENE THERAPY 189, 189-190 (2007); Wu, et al., Cancer Gene Therapy by Adenovirus-Mediated Gene Transfer, 1 Current Gene Therapy 101, 103 (2001). 158 Kochanek, Stefan, Division of Gene Therapy, Adenovirus: Biology and Vectors at the University of Ulm (Nov. 9, 2006); Wu et al. supra note 157 at 104. 159 Id. 160 Tatsis, Nia and Ertl, Hildegund C.J., Adenoviruses as Vaccine Vectors, 10 MOLECULAR THERAPY, 616, 620 (2004). 161 Chawla, et al., Adenovirus-Vectored Vaccines, 18 EXPERT OPINION ON THERAPEUTIC PATENTS 293, 295 (2008). 56 and of the adenovirus vector. Patents also claim packaging of complementing cell-lines for adenovirus production. These patents are categorized under \"method.\" There are at least 49 different human adenovirus serotypes.162 Adenovirus serotypes are distinguishable strains of adenovirus that vary in cross-reactivity with antibodies. These patents have been appropriately labeled \"serotype.\" Most patents in this category will fall under multiple categories. Another strategy is to incorporate desirable serological and immunological attributes of different adenovirus vectors into one chimeric protein.163 Chimeras are formed from a heterology of genetically distinct cells. To retain inherent immunogenicity of Ad5 while at the same time evading Ad5 neutralizing antibodies, domains of Ad5 capsid proteins are replaced with corresponding domains from other adenovirus serotypes.164 Ad35 can also carry an Ad5 fiber shaft in a different construct.165 Patents of this kind are labeled \"chimeric protein\" and possibly fall under multiple categories as well. Adjuvants are modulatory agents that help boost the effect of the vaccine without having any specific antigenic effect in itself in order to increase the immunity to a particular disease, in this case, HIV.166 Patents that claim adjuvants have been labeled \"adjuvants.\" The final category of patents contains HIV vaccine using adenoviruses. These patents claim the innoculation and the eliciting of immune responses. Vaccine patents are labeled \"final product\" in the patent search results summary. 162 MicrobiologyBytes, Adenoviruses, http://www.microbiologybytes.com/virology/Adenoviruses.html (last visited Dec. 4, 2007). 163 Chawla, et al., supra note 161, at 302. 164 Id. 165 Id. 166 U.S. National Institutes of Health, Dictionary of Cancer Terms, http://www.cancer.gov/templates/db_ alpha.aspx?CdrID=43987. 57 58 3.2 Master Spreadsheet Publication Number Vectors Production methods Ad Serotype Chimeric Protein Final Vaccine Product Prime Boost Adjuvant COMMENT Title Assignee/Applicant Name Inventor Name US5106965 N N Y N N N N Detection of human adenovirus Research Corporation Technologies, Inc.

The final step was to produce refined analytics using Microsoft Excel. 4.1 Search Analysis through MicroPatent, Aureka\u00ae, Patent Insight Pro\u00ae After the coding period, we analyzed the 267 patents which we found relevant using the analytic tools of MicroPatent\u00ae, Aureka\u00ae and Patent Insight Pro\u00ae. 4.1.1 MicroPatent\u00ae Results Figure 1: Patent count versus Assignees: the top three assignees for adenovirus vaccine related patents are Merck, University of Pennsylvania and Crucell Holland. Those three encompasses about 50% of the patents. According to Figure 1, Merck, University of Pennsylvania and Crucell Holland occupies about 50% of the adenovirus vaccine related patents. This suggests that these companies are powerhouses in research and development projects addressing adenoviral vaccine technology for HIV. 92 Figure 2: Patent count versus main IPC class: the top two IPC classes for adenovirus vaccine technology are A61K and C12N. According to Figure 2, the most frequently cited international classifications include A61K and C12N. Figure 3: Patent count versus assignee versus publication date: 93 According to Figure 3, GenVec started to file the patents related to adenovirus vaccine from 1996. Figure 4: Patent count versus publication year According to Figure 4, the number of adenovirus vaccine related patents has increased upto 2002 and has been decreased slightly after 2002. 4.1.2 Aureka\u00ae ThemeMap\u00ae Results By using Aureka\u00ae, we generated Preliminary Aureka Thememaps for HIV Adenoviral Vaccine Landscapes. Thememaps were generated from the 267 relevant patent documents, using language from either the claims or the title and abstract as the data foundation. Maps therefore represent a very broad view of the representative technologies which are embodied in the entire patent landscape. As such, these thememaps provide an overview of potentially applicable technologies. For example, from the Claims Map, it appears that a larger proportion of technologies are in the area of cell packaging and purification. In addition, the relative proximity of the packaging and vaccine peaks suggests possible co-development of these approaches as a strategy for securing a broad spectrum of patent rights. 94 Figure 5 : Thememap based on the languages from the patent claims in the 267 relevant patents 95 Figure 6 : Thememap based on the languages from the patent title and abstract in the 267 relevant patents 96 4.1.3 Patent Insight Pro\u00ae Results By using Patent Insight Pro\u00ae, we could understand the Filing Trend of the adenoviral HIV vaccine technology. As we saw the Publication Trend in the Figure 4, patent filing number of adenoviral HIV vaccine also has increased upto 2002 and has been decreased slightly after 2002. Figure 7: Patent count versus filing year Figure 8: Patent count versus publication year We were able to generate several valuable datas from Patent Insight Pro\u00ae for each top 5 assinee (Merck, Crucell, Transgene, U Penn, GenVec) including Filing trend, Forward citations, Key IPC, Publication trend and Prolific inventors. We were also able to generate Collaborating 97 inventors, Key IPC, Key US classification and Publication trend for each top 5 inventor (Shiver, Wilson, Vogels, Casimiro, Emini). 4.1.3.1 Top 5 Assignees (1) Merck & Co., Inc.

(Figure 18) 111 4.2 Final Analysis after Consolidating Adjusting Assignee Names As shown above, we found that each commercial analysis tool doesn't reflect the slight variation of the assignee's name (for example, 'Merck and Co.' is recognized differently from 'Merck & Co.') thereby the total patent counts are varied in each tool. For adjusting this problem, we reviewed and manually consolidated the same assignees by using our master spreadsheet, and generated additional tables and graphs. 4.2.1.

Campos SK, Barry MA. Gene delivery vectors based on Adenoviral (Ad) vectors have enormous potential for the treatment of both hereditary and acquired disease. Detailed structural analysis of the Ad virion, combined with functional studies has broadened our knowledge of the structure/function relationships between Ad vectors and host cells/tissues and substantial achievement has been made towards a thorough understanding of the biology of Ad vectors. The widespread use of Ad vectors for clinical gene therapy is compromised by their inherent immunogenicity. The generation of safer and more effective Ad vectors, targeted to the site of disease, has therefore become a great ambition in the field of Ad vector development. This review provides a synopsis of the structure/function relationships between Ad vectors and host systems and summarizes the many innovative approaches towards achieving Ad vector targeting. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17584037 2. Hum Gene Ther. 2005 Feb;16(2):149-56. Adenovirus vector-based DH, Nabel GJ. Recombinant adenovirus (rAd) vectors have received considerable attention for gene therapy because of their high transduction efficiency. However, recombinant gene expression from rAd vectors elicits rapid and potent immune responses to foreign transgene products. Such immunogenicity limits the duration of transgene expression and poses a major challenge to the use of rAd vectors for gene therapy. In contrast, the inherent immunogenicity of these vectors is a desirable feature for vaccine development. The immunogenicity and protective efficacy of rAd vector-based vaccines have now been demonstrated in a number of animal models, and rAd vaccines for a variety of pathogens are currently being explored in early-phase clinical trials. In this review, we describe progress in the development of rAd vector-based vaccines with a focus on human immunodeficiency virus type 1. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez 3. Mol Ther. HC. 123 Adenoviruses have transitioned from tools for gene replacement therapy to bona fide vaccine delivery vehicles. They are attractive vaccine vectors as they induce both innate and adaptive immune responses in mammalian hosts. Currently, adenovirus vectors are being tested as subunit vaccine systems for numerous infectious agents ranging from malaria to HIV-1. Additionally, they are being explored as vaccines against a multitude of tumor-associated antigens. In this review we describe the molecular biology of adenoviruses as well as ways the adenovirus vectors can be manipulated to enhance their efficacy as vaccine carriers. We describe methods of evaluating immune responses to transgene products expressed by adenoviral vectors and discuss data on adenoviral vaccines to a selected number of pathogens. Last, we comment on the limitations of using human adenoviral vectors and provide alternatives to circumvent these problems. This field is growing at an exciting and rapid pace, thus we have limited our scope to the use of adenoviral vectors as vaccines against viral pathogens. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15451446?ordinalpos=6&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum 4. J Biol Chem. 1981 Jun 25;256(12):6181-6 The adenovirus hexon protein. The primary structure of the polypeptide and its correlation with the hexon gene. J\u00f6rnvall H, Akusj\u00e4rvi G, Alestr\u00f6m P, von Bahr-Lindstr\u00f6m H, Pettersson U, Appella E, Fowler AV, Philipson L. The primary structure of the adenovirus hexon polypeptide has been determined by amino acid sequence studies of peptides from all regions of the molecule combined with sequence analysis of selected areas of its gene. The sequence presented contains 966 unique amino acid residues. Overlapping peptides recovered from CNBr cleavage and from digestions with proteolytic enzymes were analyzed, as well as DNA segments around sites for restriction endonucleases in the hexon gene. The primary structure is in good agreement with the total composition of the protein, with the compositions of individual CNBr fragments, and with known locations of restriction enzyme cleavage sites in the gene. Distinct regions of internal homology do not occur in the structure. The entire hexon polypeptide is encoded by a contiguous DNA sequence without intervening sequences. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6263909?dopt=Abstract 5. J Virol. 1997 Nov;71(11):8678-89. Structural and functional determinants in adenovirus type 2 penton base recombinant protein. Karayan L, Hong SS, Gay B, Tournier J, d'Angeac AD, Boulanger P. Discrete domains involved in structural and functional properties of adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) penton base were investigated with site-directed mutagenesis of the recombinant protein expressed in baculovirus-infected cells. Seventeen substitution mutants were generated and 124 phenotyped for various functions in insect and human cells as follows. (i) Pentamerization of the penton base protein was found to be dependent on three amino acid side chains, the indole ring of Trp119, the hydroxylic group of Tyr553, and the basic group of Lys556. (ii) Arg254, Cys432, and Trp439, the stretch of basic residues at positions 547 to 556, and Arg340 of the RGD motif played a critical role in stable fiber-penton base interactions in vivo. (iii) Nuclear localization of penton base in Sf9 cells was negatively affected in mutants W119H or W165H, and, to a lesser extent, by substitutions in the consensus polybasic signal at positions 547 to 549. (iv) Penton base mutants were also assayed for HeLa cell binding, cell detachment, plasmid DNA internalization, and Ad-mediated gene delivery. The results obtained suggested that the previously identified integrin-binding motifs RGD340 and LDV287 were functionally and/or topologically related to other discrete regions which include Trp119, Trp165, Cys246, Cys432, and Trp439, all of which in penton base-cell surface recognition, endocytosis, and postendocytotic steps of the virus life cycle. http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/71/11/8678 6. J Virol. 2005 Feb;79(4):1992-2000. Adenovirus protein CM, Wodrich H, Gerace L, Nemerow GR. In contrast to enveloped viruses, the mechanisms involved in membrane penetration by nonenveloped viruses are not as well understood. In these studies, we determined the relationship between adenovirus (Ad) capsid disassembly and the development of membrane lytic activity. Exposure to low pH or heating induced conformational changes in wild-type Ad but not in temperature-sensitive Ad (ts1) particles that fail to escape the early endosome. Wild-type Ad but not ts1 particles permeabilized model membranes (liposomes) and facilitated the cytosolic delivery of a ribotoxin. Alterations in wild-type Ad capsids were associated with the exposure of a pH-independent membrane lytic factor. Unexpectedly, this factor was identified as protein VI, a 22-kDa cement protein located beneath the peripentonal hexons in the viral capsid. Recombinant protein VI and preprotein VI, but not a deletion mutant lacking an N-terminal amphipathic alpha-helix, possessed membrane lytic activity similar to partially disassembled virions. A new model of Ad entry is proposed based on our present observations of capsid disassembly and membrane penetration. http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/full/79/4/1992?view=long&pmid=15681401 7. Virus Res. 2002 Feb 26;83(1-2):197-206. Unscheduled expression of capsid protein IIIa results in defects in adenovirus major late mRNA and protein expression. Molin M, Bouakaz L, Berenjian S, Akusj\u00e4rvi G. 125 Adenovirus gene expression is to a large extent regulated at the level of alternative RNA splicing. For example, in the major late region 1 (L1) unit, a common 5' splice site can be joined to two alternative 3' splice sites, resulting in the formation of the Whereas, the 52,55K mRNA is expressed both early and late during infection, the IIIa mRNA is strictly confined to the late phase of the infectious cycle. We have previously shown that IIIa mRNA splicing is subjected to a tight viral control of IIIa 3 splice site usage. In an attempt to determine why adenovirus uses elaborate mechanisms to confine IIIa mRNA production to the late phase of infection, we characterized the phenotype of a recombinant adenovirus expressing the IIIa protein from an inducible tetracycline regulated gene cassette. The results show that expression of the IIIa protein during the early phase of infection results in a significant reduction in late viral protein synthesis and a moderate block to viral DNA replication. Interestingly, unscheduled IIIa protein expression resulted in a perturbation of the accumulation of alternatively spliced L1 mRNAs. Thus, 52,55K mRNA accumulation was inhibited while no effects on endogenous IIIa mRNA expression was detected. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T32-45BCRKP-J&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=f0cf47596a587bb4abbed02e1b694b3e 8. J Virol. 2003 Mar;77(6):3586-94. Requirement of the adenovirus IVa2 protein for virus assembly. Zhang W, Imperiale MJ. The adenovirus L1 52/55-kDa protein is required for viral DNA packaging and interacts with the viral IVa2 protein, which binds to the viral packaging sequence. Previous reports suggest that the IVa2 protein plays a role in viral DNA packaging and that this function of the IVa2 protein is serotype specific. To further examine the function of the IVa2 protein in viral DNA packaging, a mutant virus that does not express the IVa2 protein was constructed by introducing two stop codons at the beginning of the IVa2 open reading frame in a full-length bacterial clone of adenovirus type 5. The mutant virus, pm8002, was defective for growth in 293 cells, although it replicated its DNA and produced early and late viral proteins. Electron microscopic and gradient analyses revealed that the mutant virus did not assemble any viral particles in 293 cells. In 293-IVa2 cells, which express the IVa2 protein, infectious viruses were produced, although the titer of the mutant virus was lower than that of the wild-type virus, indicating that these cells may not fully complement the mutation. The mutant viral particles produced in 293-IVa2 cells were heterogeneous in size and shape, less stable, and did not traffic efficiently to the nucleus. Marker rescue experiments with a wild-type IVa2 DNA fragment confirmed that the only mutations present in pm8002 were in the IVa2 gene. The results indicate that the IVa2 protein is required for adenovirus assembly and suggest that virus particles may be assembled around the DNA rather than DNA being packaged into preformed capsids. http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/full/77/6/3586?view=long&pmid=12610134 9.

Lee TW, Lawrence FJ, Dauksaite V, Akusj\u00e4rvi G, Blair GE, Matthews DA. We have examined the subcellular localization properties of human adenovirus 2 (HAdV-2) preMu and mature Mu (pX) proteins as fusions with enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP). We determined that preMu is exclusively a nucleolar protein with a single nucleolar accumulation signal within the Mu sequence. In addition, we noted that both preMu-EGFP and Mu-EGFP are excluded from adenovirus DNA-binding protein (DBP)-rich replication centres in adenovirus-infected cells. Surprisingly, we observed that cells in which preMu-EGFP (but not Mu-EGFP) is transiently expressed prior to or shortly after infection with Ad2 did not express late adenovirus genes. Further investigation suggested this might be due to a failure to express pre-terminal protein (preTP) from the E2 region, despite expression of another E2 protein, DBP. Deletion mutagenesis identified a highly conserved region in the C terminus of preMu responsible for these observations. Thus our data suggest that preMu may play a role in modulating accumulation of proteins from the E2 region. http://vir.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/85/1/185 10. Mol Cell Biol. 1985 Aug;5(8):1933-9. Control functions of adenovirus transformation region E1A gene products in rat and human cells. Bellett AJ, Li P, David ET, Mackey EJ, Braithwaite AW, Cutt JR. Altered control of the rat cell cycle induced by adenovirus requires expression of transformation region E1A, but not of E1B, E2A, E2B, or late genes. We show here that neither E3 nor E4 is required, so the effect results directly from an E1A product. Mutants with defects in the 289-amino-acid (aa) E1A product had little or no effect on the rat cell cycle even at 1,000 IU per cell. A mutant (pm975) lacking the 243-aa E1A product altered cell cycle progression, but less efficiently than did wild-type virus. The 289-aa E1A protein is therefore essential for cell cycle effects; the 243-aa protein is also necessary for the full effect but cannot act alone. Mutants with altered 289-aa E1A proteins showed different extents of leak expression of viral early region E2A as the multiplicity was increased; each leaked more in human than in rat cells. dl312, with no E1A products, failed to produce E2A mRNA or protein at 1,000 IU per cell in rat cells but did so in some experiments in human cells. There appears to be a very strict dependence of viral early gene expression on E1A in rat cells, whereas dependence on E1A is more relaxed in HeLa cells, perhaps due to a cellular E1A-like function. Altered cell cycle control is more dependent on E1A function than is early viral gene expression. http://mcb.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/5/8/1933 Cell AL, Yang XJ, Liao D. The adenovirus E1B 55-kDa protein binds to cellular tumor suppressor p53 and inactivates its transcriptional transactivation function. p53 transactivation activity is dependent upon its ability to bind to specific DNA sequences near the promoters of its target genes. It was shown recently that p53 is acetylated by transcriptional coactivators and acetylation of p53 by these proteins enhances p53 sequence-specific DNA binding. Here we show that the E1B 55-kDa protein specifically inhibits p53 acetylation by PCAF in vivo and in vitro, while acetylation of histones and PCAF autoacetylation is not affected. Furthermore, the DNA-binding activity of p53 is diminished in cells expressing the E1B 55-kDa protein. PCAF binds to the E1B 55-kDa protein and to a region near the C terminus of p53 encompassing Lys-320, the specific PCAF acetylation site. We further show that the E1B 55-kDa protein interferes with the physical interaction between PCAF and p53, suggesting that the E1B 55-kDa protein inhibits PCAF acetylase function on p53 by preventing enzyme-substrate interaction. These results underscore the importance of p53 acetylation for its function and suggest that inhibition of p53 acetylation by viral oncoproteins prevent its activation, thereby contributing to viral transformation. http://mcb.asm.org/cgi/content/full/20/15/5540?view=long&pmid=10891493 12. Gene Ther. 2000 Oct;7(20):1707-14. Production of first generation adenovirus vectors: a review. Danthinne X, Imperiale MJ. In the past decade, adenovirus vectors have generated tremendous interest, especially in gene therapy applications. In the so-called 'first generation' adenovirus vectors, the transgenes are inserted in place of the E1 region, or less often the E3 region. Although second-generation and helper-dependent adenovirus vectors will probably prevail in the future in applications that require long-term gene expression, first generation adenovirus vectors will remain very useful in other settings, such as cancer and vaccination, or simply to transfect cell lines that are refractory to other transfection methods. Until a few years ago, the construction of first generation adenovirus vectors was a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. More than 20 methods have appeared that facilitate their construction and are reviewed below. http://www.nature.com/gt/journal/v7/n20/abs/3301301a.html 13. Diabetes. 2001 May;50(5):980-4. Adenovirus early region 3(E3) immunomodulatory genes decrease the incidence of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice. Efrat S, Serreze D, Svetlanov A, Post CM, Johnson EA, Herold K, Horwitz M. The early three (E3) region of the adenovirus (Ad) encodes a number of immunomodulatory proteins that interfere with class I major histocompatibility-mediated antigen presentation and 128 confer resistance to cytokine-induced apoptosis in cells infected by the virus. Transgenic expression of Ad E3 genes under the rat insulin II promoter (RIP-E3) in beta-cells in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice decreases the incidence and delays the onset of autoimmune diabetes. The immune effector cells of RIP-E3/NOD mice maintain the ability to infiltrate the islets and transfer diabetes into NOD-scid recipients, although at a significantly reduced rate compared with wild-type littermates. The islets of RIP-E3/ NOD mice can be destroyed by adoptive transfer of splenocytes from wild-type NOD mice; however, the time to onset of hyperglycemia is delayed significantly, and 40% of these recipients were not diabetic at the end of the experiment. These findings suggest that expression of E3 genes in beta-cells affects both the activation of immune effector cells and the intrinsic resistance of beta-cells to autoimmune destruction. http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/50/5/980 14. J Virol. 1991 Mar;65(3):1440-9. Adenovirus E4-dependent activation of the early E2 promoter is insufficient to promote the early-to-late-phase transition. Hemstr\u00f6m C, Virtanen A, Bridge E, Ketner G, Pettersson U. The adenovirus E4 ORF6/7 protein has been shown to activate the cellular transcription factor E2F. E2F activation leads to activation of the adenovirus early E2 promoter which controls the production of viral DNA replication proteins. In the present study an adenovirus type 5 cDNA mutant, H5ilE4L, was constructed. This mutant is capable of making the ORF6/7 polypeptide but lacks the coding sequences for all other E4 products. H5ilE4L trans activates the early E2 promoter to wild-type levels, but still it is defective for viral DNA replication. A mutant expressing ORF6 in addition to ORF6/7, H5ilE4I, is normal for viral DNA replication. This indicates that activation of the early E2 promoter is insufficient to promote efficient viral DNA replication and that another E4-encoded function is necessary. The ORF6 protein seems to provide this function. We suggest that ORF6/7-induced activation of E2F is not necessary for adenovirus growth in HeLa cells. Rather, this activation might be of importance in the normal, growth-arrested host cell, since E2F has been shown to bind to the promoter regions of a number of immediate-early genes involved in regulation of cell proliferation (M. Mudryj, S. W. Hiebert, and J. R. Nevins, Viral transactivating proteins. Flint J, Shenk T. Department of Molecular Biology, Princeton University, New Jersey 08544-1014, USA. Many viruses utilize the cellular transcription apparatus to express their genomes, and they 129 encode transcriptional regulatory proteins that modulate the process. Here we review the current understanding of three viral regulatory proteins. The adenovirus E1A protein acts within the nucleus to regulate transcription through its ability to bind to other proteins. The herpes simplex type 1 virus VP16 protein acts within the nucleus to control transcription by binding to DNA in conjunction with cellular proteins. The human T-cell leukemia virus Tax protein influences transcription through interactions with cellular proteins in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm. http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.genet.31.1.177?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dncbi.nlm.nih.gov 16.

An increasing body of evidence suggests that a vaccine that elicits anti-HIV-1 cellular immunity could provide the basis for an effective AIDS vaccine. Comparative immunization experiments testing a variety of vaccine approaches have demonstrated that replication-incompetent adenovirus vectors are an effective means for eliciting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) immune responses against HIV-1 antigens. These immune responses effectively control viremia in nonhuman primates following challenge with simian AIDS viruses. Such data, coupled with epidemiology studies that identify HIV-1 gag, pol, and nef as the best antigens for broadly directed cellular immune responses, provide guidance for the development of a potential AIDS vaccine. http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.med.55.091902.104344?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dncbi.nlm.nih.gov 17.

T-cell immunity by recombinant adenovirus vaccines. Yang J, Bramson JL. Recombinant adenovirus vaccines show great promise for generating protective immunity against infectious agents and tumors. Our studies have identified several interesting biological features of the adenovirus vector that influence the T-cell response. Notably, we have 130 demonstrated that following immunization with adenovirus vaccines, the transgene antigen remains available to the system for a longer period than would be expected, resulting in a T-cell population with a sustained effector phenotype. The implications of these observations with regards to the utility of adenovirus vaccines are discussed. http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/abs/10.1586/14760584.6.3.347?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dncbi.nlm.nih.gov 19. ILAR J. 2004;45(3):334-42. Nonhuman primate models in type diabetes research. Contreras JL, Smyth CA, Curiel DT, Eckhoff DE. The recent success of \"steroid-free\" immunosuppressive protocols and improvements in islet preparation techniques have proven that pancreatic islet transplantation (PIT) is a valid therapeutic approach for patients with type 1 diabetes. However, there are major obstacles to overcome before PIT can become a routine therapeutic procedure, such as the need for chronic immunosuppression, the loss of functional islet mass after transplantation requiring multiple islet infusion to achieve euglycemia without exogenous administration of insulin, and the shortage of human tissue for transplantation. With reference to the first obstacle, stable islet allograft function without immunosuppressive therapy has been achieved after tolerance was induced in diabetic primates. With reference to the second obstacle, different strategies, including gene transfer of antiapoptotic genes, have been used to protect isolated islets before and after transplantation. With reference to the third obstacle, pigs are an attractive islet source because they breed rapidly, there is a long history of porcine insulin use in humans, and there is the potential for genetic engineering. To accomplish islet transplantation, experimental opportunities must be balanced by complementary characteristics of basic mouse and rat models and preclinical large animal models. Well-designed preclinical studies in primates can provide the quality of information required to translate islet transplant research safely into clinical transplantation. http://dels.nas.edu/ilar_n/ilarjournal/45_3/pdfs/v4503contreras.pdf 20. Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Patents 2008;18(3): 293-307 adenoviruses are being increasingly explored as immunoprophylactic or immunotherapeutic vaccine vectors. Encouraging data from preclinical studies using human adenovirus vectors carrying different antigen genes have resulted in many currently ongoing clinical trials. Objective: The article seeks to review the current status of the use of adenoviruses as vaccine vectors. Methods: This review is based on the patent literature since 2000 pertaining to the development of adenovirus vaccine vectors for infectious and non-infectious diseases. 131 Conclusion: Human adenovirus-vectored vaccines have important limitations that stem from their immunogenicity and restrict their utility. This has spurred intensive efforts to find alternative adenovirus vectors and strategies, each with its own advantages and shortcomings. http://www.informapharmascience.com/doi/abs/10.1517/13543776.18.3.293 21.

We comparatively assessed several vaccine vector delivery systems-three formulations of a plasmid DNA vector, the modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus, and a replication incompetent adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vector-expressing the SIV gag protein for their ability to elicit such immune responses in monkeys. The vaccines were tested either as a single modality or in combined modality regimens. Here we show that the most effective responses were elicited by a replication-incompetent Ad5 vector, used either alone or as a booster inoculation after priming with a DNA vector. After challenge with a pathogenic HIV-SIV hybrid virus (SHIV), the animals immunized with Ad5 vector exhibited the most pronounced attenuation of the virus infection. The replication-defective adenovirus is a promising vaccine vector for development of an HIV-1 vaccine. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11797011?ordinalpos=3&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum 22.

Preclinical studies have shown that gene transfer following readministration of viral vectors is often inefficient due to the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Vectors derived from ubiquitous human adenoviruses may have limited clinical use because preexisting humoral and cellular immunity is found in 90% of the population. Furthermore, risks associated with the use of human 132 adenovirus vectors, such as the need to immunosuppress or tolerize patients to a potentially debilitating virus, are avoidable if efficient nonhuman adenovirus vectors are feasible. Plasmids containing recombinant canine adenovirus (CAV) vectors from which the E1 region had been deleted were generated and transfected into a CAV E1-transcomplementing cell line. Vector stocks, with titers greater than or equal to those obtained with human adenovirus vectors, were free of detectable levels of replication-competent CAV and had a low particle-to-transduction unit ratio. CAV vectors were replication defective in all cell lines tested, transduced human-derived cells at an efficiency similar to that of a comparable human adenovirus type 5 vector, and are amenable to in vivo use. Importantly, 49 of 50 serum samples from healthy individuals did not contain detectable levels of neutralizing CAV antibodies. http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=10590140 23.

Molecular characterization of replication-competent variants of adenovirus vectors and genome modifications to Armentano D, Cardoza LM, Choquette LA, Everton MB, Keegan J, Martin JM, Pratt DA, Smith MP, Smith AE, Wadsworth SC. Adenovirus (Ad) vectors for gene therapy are made replication defective by deletion of E1 region genes. For isolation, propagation, and large-scale production of such vectors, E1 functions are supplied in trans from a stable cell line. Virtually all Ad vectors used for clinical studies are produced in the 293 cell, a human embryonic kidney cell line expressing E1 functions from an integrated segment of the left end of the Ad type 5 (Ad5) genome. Replication-competent vector variants that have regained E1 sequences have been observed within populations of Ad vectors grown on 293 cells. These replication-competent variants presumably result from recombination between vector and 293 cell Ad5 sequences. We have developed Ad2-based vectors and have characterized at the molecular level examples of replication-competent variants. All such variants analyzed are the 293 cell Ad5 E1 sequences have become incorporated into the viral genome by legitimate recombination events. A map of Ad5 sequences within the 293 cell genome developed in parallel is consistent with the proposed recombination events. To provide a convenient vector production system that circumvents the generation of replication-competent variants, we have modified the Ad2 vector backbone by deleting or rearranging the protein IX coding region normally present downstream from the E1 region such that the frequency of recombination between vector and 293 cell Ad5 sequences is greatly reduced. Twelve serial passages of an Ad2 vector lacking the protein IX gene were carried out without generating replication-competent variants. In the course of producing and testing more than 30 large-scale preparations of vectors lacking the protein IX gene or having a rearranged protein IX gene, only three examples of replication-competent variants were observed. Use of these genome modifications allows use of conventional 293 cells for production of large-scale preparations of Ad-based vectors lacking replication-competent variants. http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=8970968 133 24. Gene Ther. 1996 Jun;3(6):521-30. Stabilization of transgene expression by incorporation of E3 region genes into an adenoviral factor IX vector and by transient anti-CD4 treatment of the host. Poller W, Schneider-Rasp S, Liebert Merklein R, C, HH. Complex interactions between replication deficient adenoviral vectors (Ad5) and the immune system of the host influence the stability of transgenes in vivo. Vector-infected cells are attacked by diverse cellular immune mechanisms which limit transgene persistence. On the other hand, the products of several E3 region genes of wild-type adenovirus can suppress host immune reactions by interference with the expression of MHC class I molecules and by other mechanisms. We have developed an adenoviral vector for human factor IX (Ad5E3+FIX) which carries the E3 region of wild-type adenovirus, and an E3-deleted vector of otherwise similar structure (ad5 delta E3FIX). Intravenous injection of Ad5E3+FIX in C57BI/6 mice resulted in expression levels up to 6000 ng/ml of recombinant human factor IX in the mouse plasma and in enhanced transgene stability as compared with the vector Ad5 delta E3FIX. Whereas expression from E3-deleted vectors was essentially turned off 8 weeks after the gene transfer, the vector Ad5E3+FIX3+FIX supported transgene expression with therapeutic levels of human factor IX in the mouse plasma for > 4 months. The enhanced stability of the vector Ad5E3+FIX appears to be a consequence of efficient E3 region-mediated suppression of the host's antivector immune response. As an additional approach to improving transgene stability the influence of transient CD4+ T cell depletion of the host was investigated. CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes contribute to the clearance of adenovirus-infected cells and play a pivotal role in the activation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and as helper T cells in the formation of human adenovirus neutralizing antibodies (HANA). Transient anti-CD4 treatment of the host limited to the time of vector injection resulted in a significant prolongation of transgene expression from the factor IX vector Ad5E3+FIX and a luciferase vector Ad5Luc. The combination of transient anti-CD4 treatment of the host and integration of a complete E3 region in an adenoviral vector resulted in markedly improved transgene stability after gene transfer to the liver (therapeutic factor IX levels for > 6 months). http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8789802?dopt=Abstract 25. J Virol. 1998 Mar;72(3):2022-32. In vitro and in vivo biology of recombinant adenovirus vectors with E1, E1/E2A, or E1/E4 deleted. Lusky M, Christ M, Rittner K, Dieterle A, Dreyer D, Mourot B, Schultz F, Pavirani A, E1 and E4 were cell expressing E1, E1 and E2A, or E1 and E4 and characterized in vitro and in vivo. In the absence of complementation, deletion of both E1 and E2A completely abolished expression of early and late viral genes, while deletion of E1 and E4 134 impaired expression of viral genes, although at a lower level than the E1/E2A deletion. The in vivo persistence of these three types of vectors was monitored in selected strains of mice with viral genomes devoid of transgenes to exclude any interference by immunogenic transgene-encoded products. Our studies showed no significant differences among the vectors in the short-term maintenance and long-term (4-month) persistence of viral DNA in liver and lung cells of immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, all vectors induced similar antibody responses and comparable levels of adenovirus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. These results suggest that in the absence of transgenes, the progressive deletion of the adenovirus genome does not extend the in vivo persistence of the transduced cells and does not reduce the antivirus immune response. In addition, our data confirm that, in the absence of transgene expression, mouse cellular immunity to viral antigens plays a minor role in the progressive elimination of the virus genome. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9499056?ordinalpos=7&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum 26.

Schiedner G, Morral N, Parks RJ, Wu C, Graham FL, Beaudet AL, Kochanek S. Many applications for human gene therapy would be facilitated by high levels and long duration of physiologic gene expression. Adenoviral vectors are frequently used for gene transfer because of their high cellular transduction efficiency in vitro and in vivo. Expression of viral proteins and the low capacity for foreign DNA limits the clinical application of first- and second-generation adenoviral vectors. Adenoviral vectors with all viral coding sequences deleted offer the prospect of decreased host immune responses to viral proteins, decreased cellular toxicity of viral proteins and increased capacity to accommodate large regulatory DNA regions. Currently most vectors used in vivo for preclinical and clinical studies express cDNAs under the control of heterologous eukaryotic or viral promoters. Using an adenoviral vector with all viral coding sequences deleted and containing the complete human alpha1-antitrypsin (PI) locus, we observed tissue-specific transcriptional regulation in cell culture and in vivo; intravenous injection in mice resulted in high levels of very stable expression for more than ten months and decreased acute and chronic toxicity. These results indicate significant advantages of regulated gene expression using genomic DNA for gene transfer and of adenoviral gene transfer vectors devoid of all viral coding sequences. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/utils/fref.fcgi?PrId=3094&itool=AbstractPlus-def&uid=9462752&db=pubmed&url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng0298-180 27. J Virol. 1999 Sep;73(9):7835-41. 135 Improved production of gutted adenovirus in cells expressing adenovirus preterminal protein and DNA polymerase. Hartigan-O'Connor D, Amalfitano A, Chamberlain JS. Production of gutted, or helper-dependent, adenovirus vectors by current methods is inefficient. Typically, a plasmid form of the gutted genome is transfected with helper viral DNA into 293 cells; the resulting lysate is serially passaged to increase the titer of gutted virions. Inefficient production of gutted virus particles after cotransfection is likely due to suboptimal association of replication factors with the abnormal origins found in these plasmid substrates. To test this hypothesis, we explored whether gutted virus production would be facilitated by transfection into cells expressing various viral replication factors. We observed that C7 cells, coexpressing adenoviral DNA polymerase and preterminal protein, converted plasmid DNA into replicating virus approximately 50 times more efficiently than did 293 cells. This property of C7 cells can be used to greatly increase the efficiency of gutted virus production after cotransfection of gutted and helper viral DNA. These cells should also be useful for generation of recombinant adenovirus from any plasmid-based precursor. http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=10438876 28. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983 Sep of by transfection of plasmids. Berkner PA. Biologically active fragments of Adenovirus 5 (Ad5) DNA that span the entire genome have been cloned into plasmids. The covalently attached terminal protein was removed and Eco RI linkers added in a fashion that preserves the Ad5 terminal sequences. When plasmids containing overlapping fragments that represent the entire genome are cotransfected onto 293 cells, infectious virus is obtained. Generation of virus depends upon the release of the 0 or 100 mu Ad5 terminus from pBR322 DNA by Eco RI cleavage. During virus production the modified termini of the transfected fragments are corrected exactly to that of wt viral DNA. The above method for preparing adenovirus recombinants has been used to construct a mutant, Ad5 delta (78.9-84.3), lacking most of the non-essential EIII transcriptional unit. This mutant is phenotypically wild type with respect to burst size and kinetics of growth. Surprisingly, it inhibits wt viral growth upon mixed infections of HeLa or 293 cells, apparently at the level of DNA replication. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6310523?ordinalpos=&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.SmartSearch&log$=citationsensor 29. Hum Gene Ther. 1998 Nov 20;9(17):2577-83. Efficient construction of a recombinant adenovirus vector by an improved in vitro ligation method. Mizuguchi H, Kay MA. 136 An efficient method for constructing a recombinant adenovirus (Ad) vector, based on an in vitro ligation, has been developed. To insert the foreign gene into an adenoviral DNA, we introduced three unique restriction sites, I-CeuI, SwaI, and PI-SceI, into the E1 deletion site of the vector plasmid, which contains a complete E1, E3-deleted I-CeuI and PI-SceI are endonucleases with a sequence specificity of at least 9-10 and 11 bp, respectively. A shuttle plasmid, pHM3, containing multiple cloning sites between the I-CeuI and PI-SceI sites, was constructed. After the gene of interest was inserted into this shuttle plasmid, the plasmid for E1-deleted adenovirus vector could be easily prepared by in vitro ligation using the I-CeuI and PI-SceI sites. SwaI digestion of the ligation products prevented the production of a plasmid containing a parental adenovirus genome (null vector). After transformation into E. coli, more than 90% of the transformants had the correct insert. To make the vector, a PacI-digested, linearized plasmid was transfected into 293 cells, resulting in a homogeneous population of recombinant virus. The large number and strategic location of the unique restriction sites will not only increase the rapidity of production of new first-generation vectors for gene transfer but will allow for rapid further improvements in the vector DNA backbone. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/utils/fref.fcgi?PrId=3043&itool=AbstractPlus-def&uid=9853524&db=pubmed&url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/10430349850019418 30. Hum Gene Ther. 2000 Jan 1;11(1):213-9. A cell line for high-yield production of E1-deleted adenovirus vectors without the emergence of replication-competent virus. Gao GP, Engdahl RK, Wilson JM. Production of E1-deleted adenovirus vectors for gene therapy has been plagued by the emergence of replication-competent adenovirus. A number of investigators have minimized homologous sequences between the vector and transfected E1 DNA in an attempt to avoid replication-competent adenovirus. We describe a HeLa-based cell line called GH329 that stably expresses the E1 locus from a promoter derived from the phosphoglycerate kinase gene. Overlap sequences with a standard E1-deleted vector that retains a full pIX transcriptional unit have been eliminated at the 5' end and minimized at the 3' end. The GH329 cell line plaques and produces E1-deleted adenovirus as well as 293 cells. Replication-competent virus has emerged after 5 passages of vector on 293 cells but was not detected after 20 passages on GH329 cells. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/utils/fref.fcgi?PrId=3043&itool=AbstractPlus-def&uid=10646652&db=pubmed&url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/10430340050016283 31. J Virol. 1985 Jun;54(3):711-9. Construction of nondefective adenovirus type 5 bearing a 2.8-kilobase hepatitis B virus DNA near the right end of its genome. Saito I, Oya Y, Yamamoto K, Yuasa T, Shimojo H. A novel helper-free adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vector system, which utilizes a cloning site 0.2 kilobase (kb) from the right end of the genome, has been developed. To construct a nondefective 137 Ad5 bearing the 2.8-kb DNA fragment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) at this site, we deleted the 2.1-kb nonessential E3 fragment from cloned DNA covering the right one-fourth of the Ad5 genome (76 to 100 map units), inserted the HBV DNA into this site, ligated the recombinant DNA to the rest of the Ad5 genome, and transfected the ligated DNA into human embryo kidney cells. Most of the recovered virus clones had only the E3 deletion and no HBV insertion, suggesting that a homologous recombination occurs between transfected DNAs in these cells. The isolated Ad5 virus bearing the HBV DNA (Ad5-HBL) grew without helper virus in HeLa cells as efficiently as wild-type Ad5, although the 1.9-kb major E4 transcript was detected only poorly in the early phase in the Ad5-HBL-infected cells, suggesting that the HBV DNA inserted upstream of the E4 promoter reduces the E4 transcript. HBV mRNAs transcribed from the inserted DNA were at least as abundant as Ad5 early mRNAs in the late phase of Ad5-HBL infection, but the HBV surface antigen was barely detectable in the infected-cell lysate and culture medium. This result suggests that HBV mRNAs can be transcribed from the inserted genes but no protein can be translated from the HBV mRNAs, presumably because of the translational suppression of cellular mRNAs caused by adenovirus in its late phase. http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=3999192 32.

Adenovirus E1A N-terminal amino acid sequence requirements for repression of transcription in vitro and in vivo correlate with those required for E1A interference with TBP-TATA complex formation. Boyd JM, Loewenstein PM, Tang Qq QQ, Yu L, Green M. The adenovirus (Ad) E1A 243R oncoprotein encodes an N-terminal transcription repression domain that is essential for early viral functions, cell immortalization, and cell transformation. The transcription repression function requires sequences within amino acids 1 to 30 and 48 to 60. To elucidate the roles of the TATA-binding protein (TBP), p300, and the CREB-binding protein (CBP) in the mechanism(s) of E1A repression, we have constructed 29 amino acid substitution mutants and 5 deletion mutants spanning the first 30 amino acids within the E1A 1-80 polypeptide backbone. These mutant E1A polypeptides were characterized with regard to six parameters: the ability to repress transcription in vitro and in vivo, to disrupt TBP-TATA box interaction, and to bind TBP, p300, and CBP. Two regions within E1A residues 1 to 30, amino acids 2 to 6 and amino acid 20, are critical for E1A transcription repression in vitro and in vivo and for the ability to interfere with TBP-TATA interaction. Replacement of 6Cys with Ala in the first region yields the most defective mutant. Replacement of 20Leu with Ala, but not substitutions in flanking residues, yields a substantially defective phenotype. Protein binding assays demonstrate that replacement of 6Cys with Ala yields a mutant completely defective in interaction with TBP, p300, and CBP. Our findings are consistent with a model in which the E1A repression function involves interaction of E1A with p300/CBP and interference with the formation of a TBP-TATA box complex. http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=11773419 33.

Kostense S, Koudstaal W, Sprangers M, Weverling Havenga M, Goudsmit J. The seroprevalence of adenovirus types 5 (Ad5) and 35 (Ad35) was investigated in patients at risk of AIDS. The seroprevalence of Ad5 was higher than Ad35 in HIV-infected patients from The Netherlands (60% versus 7%) and sub-Saharan Africa (90% versus 20%). The seroprevalence was similar among HIV-infected and uninfected individuals, and remained constant during progression to AIDS. Ad35 is less prone to neutralization than Ad5, encouraging the further development of Ad35 for vaccination against HIV. http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0269-9370&volume=18&issue=8&spage=1213 34. J Immunol. 2004 May 15;172(10):6290-7. Immunogenicity of recombinant adenovirus serotype 35 vaccine in the NL, of pre-existing immunity to adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) in human populations may substantially limit the immunogenicity and clinical utility of recombinant Ad5 vector-based vaccines for HIV-1 and other pathogens. A potential solution to this problem is to use vaccine vectors derived from adenovirus (Ad) serotypes that are rare in humans, such as Ad35. However, cross-reactive immune responses between heterologous Ad serotypes have been described and could prove a major limitation of this strategy. In particular, the extent of immunologic cross-reactivity between Ad5 and Ad35 has not previously been determined. In this study we investigate the impact of pre-existing anti-Ad5 immunity on the immunogenicity of candidate rAd5 and rAd35 vaccines expressing SIV Gag in mice. Anti-Ad5 immunity at levels typically found in humans dramatically blunted the immunogenicity of rAd5-Gag. In contrast, even high levels of anti-Ad5 immunity did not substantially suppress Gag-specific cellular immune responses elicited by rAd35-Gag. Low levels of cross-reactive Ad5/Ad35-specific CD4(+) T lymphocyte responses were observed, but were insufficient to suppress vaccine immunogenicity. These data demonstrate the potential utility of Ad35 as a candidate vaccine vector that is minimally suppressed by anti-Ad5 immunity. Moreover, these studies suggest that using Ad vectors derived from immunologically distinct serotypes may be an effective and general strategy to overcome the suppressive effects of pre-existing anti-Ad immunity. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/utils/fref.fcgi?PrId=3051&itool=AbstractPlus-def&uid=15128818&db=pubmed&url=http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15128818 139 35.

Bergelson JM, JA, Droguett A complementary DNA has been isolated that encodes a coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR). When transfected with CAR complementary DNA, nonpermissive hamster cells became susceptible to coxsackie B virus attachment and infection. Furthermore, consistent with previous studies demonstrating that adenovirus infection depends on attachment of a viral fiber to the target cell, CAR-transfected hamster cells bound adenovirus in a fiber-dependent fashion and showed a 100-fold increase in susceptibility to virus-mediated gene transfer. Identification of CAR as a receptor for these two unrelated and structurally distinct viral pathogens is important for understanding viral pathogenesis and has implications for therapeutic gene delivery with adenovirus vectors. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9036860?ordinalpos=&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.SmartSearch&log$=citationsensor 36. Gene Ther. 2000 Jan;7(2):110-4. Targeting adenovirus. Wickham TJ. The use of targeted viral vectors to localize gene transfer to specific cell types holds many advantages over conventional, non-targeted vectors currently used in gene therapy. The resulting improvements in gene localization from targeted adenovirus vectors are likely to reduce immunogenicity and toxicity, increase safety, and enable the systemic administration of these vectors for multiple indications including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and inflammatory disease. Recent advances in the biological understanding of adenovirus structure and adenovirus receptor interactions have fueled the rapid development of targeted adenovirus vectors. Two basic requirements are necessary to create a targeted adenovirus vector: interaction of adenovirus with its native receptors must be removed and novel, tissue-specific ligands must be added to the virus. Two general approaches have been used to achieve these basic requirements. In the 'two-component' approach, a bispecific molecule is complexed with the adenovirus. The bispecific component simultaneously blocks native receptor binding and redirects virus binding to a tissue-specific receptor. In the 'one-component' approach the adenovirus is genetically modified to ablate native receptor interactions and a novel ligand is genetically incorporated into one of the adenovirus coat proteins. Two-component systems offer great flexibility in rapidly validating the feasibility of targeting via a particular receptor. One-component systems offer the best advantages in producing a manufacturable therapeutic and in more completely ablating all native adenovirus receptor interactions. The coming challenges for targeted adenovirus vectors will be the demonstration that the technology performs in vivo. Ultimately, or in parallel, 'receptor-targeting' technology can be combined with improved adenovirus backbones and with 'transcriptional targeting' approaches to create adenovirus which deliver genes selectively, safely, and with little immune response. 140 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10673715?ordinalpos=8&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum 37.

Replication-deficient human adenovirus type 35 vectors for gene transfer and vaccination: efficient human cell infection and bypass of preexisting adenovirus immunity. Vogels R, Zuijdgeest D, van Meerendonk Quax Panitti Grimbergen Bout A, J, Havenga M. Replication-deficient human adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) can be produced to high titers in complementing cell lines, such as PER.C6, and is widely used as a vaccine and gene therapy vector. However, preexisting immunity against Ad5 hampers consistency of gene transfer, immunological responses, and vector-mediated toxicities. We report the identification of human Ad35 as a virus with low global prevalence and the generation of an Ad35 vector plasmid system for easy insertion of heterologous genes. In addition, we have identified the minimal sequence of the Ad35-E1B region (molecular weight, 55,000 [55K]), pivotal for complementation of fully E1-lacking Ad35 vector on PER.C6 cells. After stable insertion of the 55K sequence into PER.C6 cells a cell line was obtained (PER.C6/55K) that efficiently transcomplements both Ad5 and Ad35 vectors. We further demonstrate that transduction with Ad35 is not hampered by preexisting Ad5 immunity and that Ad35 efficiently infects dendritic cells, smooth muscle cells, and synoviocytes, in contrast to Ad5. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/utils/fref.fcgi?PrId=3494&itool=AbstractPlus-nondef&uid=12857895&db=pubmed&url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=12857895 38. Nat Med. 2005 Apr;11(4 Suppl):S25-32. T cell vaccines for microbial infections. Robinson HL, Amara RR. Vaccination, or the deliberate induction of protective immunity by administering nonpathogenic forms of a microbe or its antigens to induce a memory immune response, is the world's most cost-effective medical procedure for preventing morbidity and mortality caused by infectious disease. Historically, most vaccines have worked by eliciting long-lived plasma cells. These cells produce antibodies that limit disease by neutralizing a toxin or blocking the spread of the infectious agent. For these 'B cell vaccines,' the immunological marker, or correlate, for protection is the titer of protective antibodies. With the discovery of HIV/AIDS, vaccine development has been confronted by an agent that is not easily blocked by antibody. To overcome this, researchers who are developing HIV/AIDS vaccines have turned to the elicitation of cellular immunity, or 'T cell vaccines,' which recognize and kill infected cells. 141 http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v11/n4s/abs/nm1212.html 39.

In December 2005, the UNAIDS and WHO reported that the global epidemic known as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has claimed the lives of more than 25 million adults and children over the past 26 years. These figures included an estimated 3.1 million AIDS-related deaths in 2005. Despite enormous efforts to control the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) new infection rates are on the rise. An estimated 40.3 million people are now living with HIV, including 4.9 million new infections this past year. Nearly half of new HIV infections are in young people between the ages of 15 and 24. While drug therapies have helped sustain the lives of infected individuals in wealthy regions, they are relatively unavailable to the poorest global regions. This includes sub-Saharan Africa which has approximately 25.8 million infected individuals, more than triple the number of infections of any other region in the world. It is widely believed that the greatest hope for controlling this devastating pandemic is a vaccine. In this review, we will discuss the current state of DNA-based vaccines and how they compare to other vaccination methods currently under investigation. We will also discuss innovative ideas for enhancing DNA vaccine efficacy and the progress being made toward developing an effective vaccine. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17031649?dopt=Abstract 40.

Since the discovery of AIDS in 1981, the global spread of HIV has reached pandemic proportions, representing a global developmental and public health threat. The development of a safe, globally effective and affordable HIV vaccine offers the best hope for the future control of the pandemic. Significant progress has been made over the past years in the areas of basic virology, immunology, pathogenesis of HIV/AIDS and the development of antiretroviral drugs. However, the development of an HIV vaccine faces formidable scientific challenges related to the high genetic variability of the virus, the lack of immune correlates of protection, limitations with the existing animal models and logistical problems associated with the conduct of multiple clinical trials. More than 35 vaccine candidates have been tested in Phase I/II clinical trials, involving more than 10,000 volunteers, and two Phase III trials have been completed, themselves involving more than 7500 volunteers. Multiple vaccine concepts and vaccination strategies have been tested, including DNA vaccines, subunit vaccines, live vectored recombinant vaccines and various prime-boost vaccine combinations. This article reviews the state of the art in HIV 142 vaccine development, summarizes the results obtained so far and discusses the challenges to be met in the development of the various vaccine candidates. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16530298?ordinalpos=&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.SmartSearch&log$=citationsensor 41. Curr Pharm Des. 2006;12(9):1147-67. Current progress in the development of HIV vaccines. Spearman P. The greatest hope for controlling the expanding HIV epidemic is the development of a preventive HIV vaccine. Despite almost twenty years of effort, the search for an effective HIV vaccine continues at the present time. Advances in the understanding of HIV immunopathogenesis, and especially viral immune evasion mechanisms, have provided important insights into HIV vaccine design. HIV vaccine approaches based solely on recombinant monomeric envelope glycoproteins have failed dramatically and have been discarded. Modern vector technologies with the potential for generating protective cellular immune responses against HIV are undergoing intensive evaluation in clinical trials. Adenoviral vector systems appear to be very promising for this purpose, while the ability of poxvirus-based regimens to elicit potent HIV-specific cellular immune responses in humans is less certain. A number of novel live vector-based approaches are in development. This review presents the current state of the HIV vaccine field, with an emphasis on those vaccines that are in clinical trials or in an advanced stage of preclinical testing. The HIV vaccine field is a very active and challenging one that will continue to push forward our understanding of basic immunology and drive the development of new vaccine technologies. New breakthroughs in methods to generate effective neutralizing antibody responses against HIV are urgently needed. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16515492?ordinalpos=&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.SmartSearch&log$=citationsensor 42.

Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, CR-CHUM, Institut U743, rafick-pierre.sekaly@umontreal.ca The world human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines has suffered a baffling setback. The first trial of a vaccine designed to elicit strong cellular immunity has shown no protection against infection. More alarmingly, the vaccine appeared to increase the rate of HIV infection in individuals with prior immunity against the adenovirus vector used in the vaccine. A new study in this issue suggests that a different vaccine approach-using a DNA prime/poxvirus boost strategy-induces polyfunctional immune responses to an HIV immunogen. The disappointing 143 results of the recent vaccine trial suggest that a more thorough assessment of vaccine-induced immune responses is urgently needed, and that more emphasis should be placed on primate models before efficacy trials are undertaken. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/utils/fref.fcgi?PrId=3494&itool=AbstractPlus-nondef&uid=18195078&db=pubmed&url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=18195078 43.

Challenges in the development of an HIV-1 vaccine. Barouch DH. The development of a safe and effective human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 vaccine is a critically important global health priority. Despite recent advances in our understanding of HIV-1 pathogenesis and immunology, however, major scientific obstacles remain. Prototype HIV-1 vaccine candidates aimed at eliciting humoral and cellular immune responses have so far failed to protect against HIV-1 infection or to reduce viral loads after infection in clinical efficacy studies. A renewed and coordinated commitment to basic discovery research, preclinical studies and clinical trials will therefore be required to overcome the hurdles currently facing the field. Here I review key challenges and future prospects in the quest to develop a prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine. http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v455/n7213/abs/nature07352.html 45.

Abbink P, Lemckert AA, Ewald BA, Lynch DM, Denholtz S, L, Damen I, Vogels R, Thorner AR, are currently being developed for both human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and other pathogens. The potential limitations associated with rAd5 vectors, however, have led to the construction of novel rAd vectors derived 144 from rare Ad serotypes. Several rare serotype rAd vectors have already been described, but a detailed comparison of multiple rAd vectors from subgroups B and D has not previously been reported. Such a comparison is critical for selecting optimal rAd vectors for advancement into clinical trials. Here we describe the construction of three novel rAd vector systems from Ad26, Ad48, and Ad50. We report comparative seroprevalence and immunogenicity rAd49 vectors from subgroup D; and rAd5 vectors from subgroup C. All six rAd vectors from subgroups B and D exhibited low seroprevalence in a cohort of 200 individuals from sub-Saharan Africa, and they elicited Gag-specific cellular immune responses in mice both with and without preexisting anti-Ad5 immunity. The rAd vectors from subgroup D were also evaluated using rhesus monkeys and were shown to be immunogenic after a single injection. The rAd26 vectors proved the most immunogenic among the rare serotype rAd vectors studied, although all rare serotype rAd vectors were still less potent than rAd5 vectors in the absence of anti-Ad5 immunity. These studies substantially expand the portfolio of rare serotype rAd vectors that may prove useful as vaccine vectors for the developing world. http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/full/81/9/4654?view=long&pmid=17329340 46.

A simian replication-defective adenoviral recombinant vaccine to HIV-1 gag. Fitzgerald JC, Gao GP, Reyes-Sandoval A, Pavlakis GN, adenoviral recombinants of the serotype 5 (AdHu5) have shown high efficacy as vaccine carriers for different Ags including those of HIV-1. Humans are infected by common serotypes of human adenovirus such as AdHu5 early in life and a significant percentage has high levels of neutralizing Abs to these serotypes, which will very likely impair the efficacy of recombinant vaccines based on the homologous virus. To circumvent this problem, a novel replication-defective adenoviral vaccine carrier based on an E1-deleted recombinant of the chimpanzee adenovirus 68 (AdC68) was developed. An AdC68 construct expressing a codon-optimized, truncated form of gag of HIV-1 induces CD8(+) T cells to gag in mice which at the height of the immune response encompass nearly 20% of the entire splenic CD8(+) T cell population. The vaccine-induced immune response provides protection to challenge with a vaccinia gag recombinant virus. Induction of transgene-specific CD8(+) T cells and protection against viral challenge elicited by the AdC68 vaccines is not strongly inhibited in 145 animals preimmune to AdHu5 virus. However, the response elicited by the AdHu5 vaccine is greatly attenuated in Jan 16. A CD46-binding chimpanzee adenovirus vector as a vaccine carrier. Tatsis N, Blejer A, Lasaro MO, Hensley SE, Cun A, Tesema L, Li Y, Gao GP, Xiang ZQ, Zhou D, Wilson JM, Ertl HC. A based on the chimpanzee adenovirus serotype C1 was developed and tested as a vaccine carrier in mice. The AdC1 virus is closely related to human adenoviruses of subgroup B2 and uses CD46 for cell attachment. To overcome poor growth of E1-deleted AdC1 vectors on cell lines that provide the E1 of adenovirus of the human serotype 5 (AdHu5) virus in trans, the inverted terminal repeats and some of the early genes of AdC1 were replaced with those from AdC5, a chimpanzee origin adenovirus of subfamily E. The vector efficiently mouse cells and initiates their maturation. Transduction of DCs in vivo is inefficient in CD46 transgenic mice. The AdC1/C5 vector induces transgene product-specific B- and CD8(+) T-cell responses in mice. Responses are slightly higher in wild-type mice than in CD46 transgenic mice. Transgene product-specific T-cell responses elicited by the AdC1/C5 vector can be increased by priming or boosting with a heterologous adenovirus vector. Pre-existing immunity to adenovirus of the common human serotype 5 does not affect induction of cell-mediated immune responses by the AdC1/C5 vector.

The system functions via adenoviral terminal fragments present on the plasmid that are less than 500 basepairs each. The result is a plasmid which is more readily analyzed by restriction digestion, PCR, DNA sequencing or used in transient transfection studies. The adenovirus plasmids that are generated can be rescued back into virus form. The entire procedure takes 4 days or less instead of the weeks required of plaque purification or dilution cloning isolation techniques. An additional plus of the instant invention is that the disclosed method does not require the use of tissue culture materials or facilities. The disclosed method allows for a more extensive and thorough examination of a viral preparation, in that it allows for the detection of variants incapable of propagation without the assistance of co-infecting intact adenoviral genomes. Under standard conditions of plaque purification, these variant genomes are not detected. It is predicted that far more variant genomes will be observed using the rapid method than would otherwise be detected by standard plaque purification methods.

This phenomenon was observed with both isolated CD4 + and CD8+ T cells.
