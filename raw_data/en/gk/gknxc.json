The medical & healthcare sector has been identified as one of six priority sectors that are considered to offer the most potential to deliver sustainable economic growth in Plymouth . In reaching recommendations o n the priority sectors, the 'Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors ' report cited the substantial scale of the medical & healthcare sector in Plymout h (with some 14,000 employees), the extent of recent growth, and the de velopment of a cluster of activity in the north of Plymouth with a particular focus in the Derriford area. To help achieve economic growth, local planning aut horities are urged to plan proactively to meet the development needs of busine ss and support an economy fit for the 21 st century. When preparing a Local Plan, Plymouth Ci ty Council (PCC) is therefore required to work closely with the medi cal & healthcare sector to understand their changing needs, and to use this in formation to assess the needs for land or floorspace for economic development ( as required by the National Planning Policy Framework, March 2012, paragraphs 2 0 & 160). The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to update and develop a further appreciation of the land, premises and infrastructu re requirements of the medical & healthcare sector, building on the sector analysi s within the 'Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors' report. This will take account of the needs of indigenous businesses that Plymouth City C ouncil (PCC) seek to retain, as well as factors that could help to attract furth er potential inward investment to the city from footloose innovative businesses withi n the healthcare and medical sector. Qualitative and quantitative research methods have been employed to establish whether sufficient suitably located land and premis es are available to support the forecast levels of healthcare and medical employmen t growth anticipated within Plymouth over the lifetime of the emerging Plymouth Plan, which will cover a time horizon to 2031. 1.2 Planning policy context & study objectives 1.2.1 National Planning Policy Framework (March 2012) The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) sets out the policy and guidance that must be followed by PCC during the pr eparation of a Local Plan. This research has therefore been undertaken in acco rdance with the requirements for local authorities to have a clear understanding of its business needs as set out below: Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 2 Local authorities should \"work closely with the business community.to unders tand their changing needs and identify and address barri ers to investment, including a lack of housing, infrastructure or viability\" (Para 160). \"Local authorities should use this evidence base to assess: The needs for land or floor-space for economic deve lopment, including both the quantitative and qualitative needs for all fore seeable types of economic activity over the plan period...... The existing and future supply of land available fo r economic development and its sufficiency and suitability to meet the ide ntified needs. Reviews of land available for economic development should be undert aken at the same time as, or combined with, Strategic Housing Land Availabili ty Assessments and should include a re-appraisal of the suitability of previously allocated land.\" (Paragraph 161) 1.2.2 Plymouth Core Strategy (April 2007) The Plymouth Core Strategy (adopted in April 2007) sets out the overall planning vision and framework for the city from 2006 to 2021 and beyond. This includes an outline for delivering strategic development nee ds for Plymouth's future, including housing, employment, leisure and retail. The Core Strategy pre-dates the NPPF, but remains the extant development plan f or Plymouth. An aspiration set out within the Core Strategy is f or Plymouth to unlock its economic potential, to secure the city's long term future and fulful its role as the economic hub for the far South West. The key growt h sectors in Plymouth were projected to generate a total of 17,675 jobs by 202 6 in the Plymouth Travel to Work Area (PTWA). This equates to the change in jo bs per sector and demand for land in the Plymouth Principal Urban Area (PUA) by 2021 as set out in the table below. Table 1 - Plymouth Core Strategy: Change in key sec tor jobs (2006 - 2021) Key growth sectors Change in jobs Demand for land Advanced engineering -3,480 Negligible Business services 8,520 5.8ha Creative industries 1,560 0.8ha Marine industries 520 0.6ha healthcare 6,080 6.9ha Tourism and leisure 4,475 3.1ha Source: Plymouth Core Strategy, Chapter 6, Table 2 The table shows that, out of the six key growth sec tors, the medical & healthcare sector has been expected to generate the second hig hest number of jobs and the largest land requirement during the Core Strategy p eriod until 2026. This report seeks to refresh the employment projections and lan d use requirements for the medical and healthcare sector to take account of cu rrent economic circumstances and forecasts, as well as the impacts of NHS servic e delivery and procurement reforms (see chapter 4). Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 3 Broad employment land allocations were also present ed in the Core Strategy, dividing the employment land requirements between t he city centre and waterfront; business parks; locations on the A38 co rridor; and elsewhere in the city. Table 2 below summarises the employment land allocation. Table 2 - Plymouth Core Strategy: Employment land r equirements Location Category By 2016 By 2021 City Centre and Waterfront 6.3ha 3.96ha Source: Plymouth Core Strategy, Chapter 6, Table 3 The Area Action Plans supporting the Core Strategy provide a further breakdown of employment land allocations. In moving towards a Local Plan setting out specific site allocations, it is important to revie w why certain types of businesses are locating in certain areas. A further objective for this report therefore is to provide an appreciation of the spatial distribution of existing medical and healthcare businesses in Plymouth and the reasons b ehind these locational choices (see section 3.4). A strategic objective of the Core Strategy has been to develop \"the concept of a bi-polar economy with strong and complementary cent res of employment at the City Centre and Derriford\" (see Strategic Objective 6 of the Core Strategy, 'Delivering the Economic Strategy' and Policy CS04 'Future Employment Provision'). This strategic planning objective is o f particular importance for the medical & healthcare sector given the emphasis plac ed on attracting businesses in the sector to business parks around Derriford Hospi tal. The strategic importance of the Derriford area to the healthcare and medical sectors future growth and diversification is highlighted in the 'Plymouth's P riority Sectors Report': \"There is a concentration of activity around Tamar Science Park which is home to the headquarters of the Peninsula College of Med icine and Dentistry and numerous medical, science technology and knowledge- based companies, including spin out companies from the Plymouth Univ ersity and Derriford Hospital.\" (page 54) 1.2.3 Derriford & Seaton Area Action Plan The high-level principles for the development of Pl ymouth set out in the Core Strategy are expanded in supporting Area Action Pla ns (AAPs). A Submission AAP for Derriford and Seaton was published in Decem ber 2012 and, consistent with the Core Strategy, this covers the period from 2006 to 2021, but with a long term horizon to 2026 and beyond. The role of Derriford is supported by Strategic Obj ective 2 of the AAP, which confirms the key considerations of promoting econom ic flexibility and innovative capacity through the provision of a diverse mix of commercial, office and service uses at Derriford (making provision for in the regi on of 8,000 new jobs), together Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 4 with homes and community facilities to ensure a mor e sustainable form of development. The AAP describes that Derriford has become a major employment destination, but with limited housing and services to support th e workers. The area is characterised by large isolated, single use develop ments that are inefficient in land use terms. The challenge for the Council, therefore, is to sup port the area's strategic employment role, by providing sufficient, suitable sites to meet future needs, as well as matching jobs with homes and services, in a n attractive environment, to meet the needs and expectations of the local commun ity. PCC's vision for the Derriford & Seaton area is as follows: To create a thriving, sustainable, mixed-use new ur ban centre at the heart of the north of Plymouth, which is well connected to s urrounding communities and to the city's High Quality Public Transport net work . The Core Strategy makes it clear in paragraphs 6.18 and 6.21 that it is the role of the AAP to determine the actual proposed quantums a nd nature of employment provision for particular sites and locations. Poli cies/proposals DS06 to DS11 therfore support Derriford's existing health, educa tion and employment uses and encourage new investment, particularly in relation to the medical and healthcare sector, as well as transforming Derriford into the city's secondary office location after the City Centre. Derriford's main employment proposals are summarised in the table below. Table 3 - Employment floorspace of potential propos al locations (gross floorspace) Proposal Location Employment Floorspace Potential (gross floorspace) DS06 Plymouth International Medical & Technology Park 40,000 sqm DS07 Tamar Science Park 20,000 sqm DS08 sqm DS09 Derriford sqm DS11 Christian Mill Business Park 1,500 sqm The following employment developments will be provi ded on non employment led mixed-use sites.

When preparing the Plym outh Plan it will be important for the Council to help achieve economic growth, by planning proactively to meet the development needs of business and support an ec onomy fit for the 21 st century (NPPF, paragraph 20). This is the first of a series of addendum reports t o the 'Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors' report 2 (Arup, July 2011), which deals specifically with the medical and healthcare sector. To be NPPF compliant, it is necessary for PCC to consider the quantitative and qualitative ne eds of the sector and appraise the suitability of previously allocated land (namel y the strategic employment sites in the City) for the purposes of this sector. To contribute to the Council's knowledge base, this study seeks to address questions of particular relevance to the medical an d healthcare sector such as: What does the existing spatial pattern of medical a nd healthcare businesses look like across the City? Does the sector as a who le cluster in certain strategic locations? Do sub sectors within the sect or have specific physical needs and attributes that influence business locati on? How are the macro changes in NHS funding and procur ement of healthcare services likely to impact on the sector's land requ irements in Plymouth? How important is proximity to Derriford Hospital fo r businesses in the medical & healthcare sector? What inward investment and relocation activity has occurred in the City over the last decade? Is there a need for proximity to other healthcare o r non-healthcare businesses for specific products or services? What role(s) do Tamar Science Park and Plymouth Int ernational Medical and Technology Park play in supporting the medical and healthcare sector? Is the existing land supply adequate? Will existin g supply meet forecast growth in the sector? 1.3 Methodology & structure of report The paper adopts a number of research approaches in order to provide PCC with sound background information on the medical & healt hcare sector and provide NPPF compliant evidence base informing the preparat ion of the Local Plan. The research steps taken are summarised in the diagram below and further details are provided in the report sections referenced here: Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 6 2. Defining the Medical & Healthcare Sector This section provides background information on the sector and defines the types of organisations and business activities covered by the st udy. Importantly it also identifies closely related business ac tivities that are not within the definition of the sector for the purposes of the Loca l Economic Strategy. 1. Introduction, Planning Policy Context and Study Objectives This chapter provides an introduction to current Plymouth Core Stra tegy, the Council's Area Action Plan objectives for Derriford and Seaton , and the emerging task of Local Plan preparation. 3. Current and Past Trends GIS analysis showing the spatial distribution of existing medi cal & healthcare businesses and employment across the city (based on Companies House and ONS data). The PCC Inward Investment Register (2001 - 2012) has been analy sed to provide a picture of thetype and scope of inward investment enquiri es over the period from healthcare businesses, both indigenous and from outs ide Plymouth. Details of existing employments sites are provided and business case studies are utilised to illustrate important locational dri vers for businesses. 4. Future Forecast Growth in Plymouth To provide a projection of future employment floorspace needs, for ecasting based on Oxford Econometrics is utilised. The floorspace requir ement for the sector is appraised against the remaining employment land available at strategic employment sites to understand whether there is suff icient space to facilitate the forecast growth of the sector to 2031. 5. Conclusions The final chapter presents conclusions and recommendations on employm ent land requirements for the medical and healthcare sector to inform the preparation of the Plymouth Plan. Figure 1 - Structure of report and methodology Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 7 2 Defining The Medical & Healthcare Sector 2.1 Overview This section provides an overview of the sectoral d efinitions for the medical & healthcare sector that has informed the data analys is that underpins this report. Within the both the Local Economic Strategy and the ' Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors' report, the medical and healthcare sector has been described as the provision of health services by bo th public and private sectors together with manufacture and distribution of pharm aceutical products, medical and surgical equipment and medical research.. For the purpose of this report, the statistical def initions used are based upon Standard Industrial Classifications (SIC codes). T here have been a number of changes in the SIC codes which means that trend dat a can only be reliably and robustly examined from 2008 on-wards. The time lag in national data collection also means that 2011 is the latest data currently a vailable. 2.2 Defining the sector In summary, the SIC codes examined are the followin g at the four digit level (the most detailed available): Medical and Healthcare SIC 2007 class (4 digit) 2110 : Manufacture of basic pharmaceutical products 2120 : Manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations 2059 : Manufacture of other chemical products n.e.c . 2680 : Manufacture of magnetic and optical media 8610 : Hospital activities 8621 : General medical practice activities 8622 : Specialist medical practice activities 8623 : Dental practice activities 8690 : Other human health activities Appendix A1 provides a full breakdown of the Office for National Statistics SIC codes, sub-classifications and exclusions used for the analysis in this paper. There are some caveats to SIC code analysis in gene ral that are important considerations: SIC codes do not neatly match whole sectors in real ity; and firms' economic activities will over-lap industrial sectors. For example, firms undertaking the advanced manufac turing of medical technologies are likely to include some over-lap in to other technologies and sectors too. Firms often operate in more than one sector and it is difficult for this kind of SIC code analysis to distinguish these, ind eed, SIC code data is suppressed at lower levels to protect the confident iality of individual firms to prevent identification of individual business units . Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 8 2.3 Implications for this study The main implication for the analysis in this paper is that the trend data based on SIC code data is limited to a four year timescale, ideally trend data over ten years would enable a comparison of employment change loca lly that covers the entire economic cycle. However, the available data does p rovide for robust, local empirical evidence which is cost-effective to assem ble and compare with national trends. Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 9 3 Current & Past Trends in Plymouth 3.1 Overview This section of the report seeks to establish trend s in the medical and healthcare sector during the period 2001 to 2012, utilising va rious data sources, and looks at the current spatial pattern of organisations and bu sinesses across the city. The Employment Land Review (2006) that was prepared to support the Core Strategy set out predicted growth in the sector of 1.6% for the period 2003 and 2006. This forecast was revisited in 2011 for the ' Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors' to consider the impacts of the late 2000s recessio n on the sector. A combination of Annual Business Inqui ry employment data for 2008, PCC quarterly job monitoring data for 2009 and 2010 , and a bespoke Arup Business Survey for the 2011 research study was ut ilised for the analysis. The main conclusion drawn was that growth in medical an d healthcare had continued, albeit at a more sluggish pace, during difficult ec onomic circumstances. Most of the growth in jobs had occurred in lower skilled em ployment in the residential care home hospice and nursing home market, with a r ange of providers refurbishing and opening new facilities. Neverthel ess, there had also been jobs gained in higher skilled areas, such as medical sup plies, although these were relatively small scale. 3.2 Employment growth trends The headline finding from further up to date analys is of the available trend data for the medical and healthcare sectors in Plymouth is that employment remains strong locally, despite some challenges with the ec onomic conditions. Set in the regional and national context, employment in the me dical and healthcare sector also continues to make up a relatively large propor tion of jobs in the city (around 11%). The position of the sector in underp inning the economy and providing the potential for future growth therefore remains valid. Employment (as measured by the strength of the loca l employment base and location quotient) in Plymouth in the medical and h ealthcare sectors is greater than that both nationally and regionally and is sti ll growing, despite some contraction in 2008/09 according to the official da ta. Outlined below is the headline analysis followed by the sub-sector analysis. Total employment in Plymouth, the region and nation ally has declined over the four year period according to the Office for Nation al Statistics BRES data.

Source: BRES, ONS data Feb. 2013 Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 10 The table below highlights the employment total for the sectors which contribute towards medical and healthcare jobs.

Source: BRES, ONS data Feb. 2013 In total, the concentration of medical and healthca re employees in Plymouth makes up 11% of all local jobs. The location quotient for Plymouth against both reg ional and national strengths in medical and healthcare related employment is 1.5, i ndicating a much stronger local employment base. The linear trend line employment change is illustra ted below. Figure 2 - Plymouth medical and health related jobs The relative change in the employment base for medi cal and health related employment is set out in the table below.

Gene ral medical practices also offer reasonably strong local employment.

In terms of composition of employment, manufacturin g (C), wholesale and retail (G), education (P) and human health and social work activities (Q) are the four sectors that offer the most local jobs. These are the only sectors above 10% of local employment and are at least twice the strengt h of other sectors.

Source: BRES, ONS data Feb. 2013 Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 13 Within this context, it is clear that medical and h ealth related employment can be considered vital to underpin the economic competiti veness of the local economy and to offer the potential for growth in the future . 3.3 Inward investment Investor enquiries received during the period 2002 to 2012 show a steady decline. The healthcare and medical sector only re presented a small proportion of total enquiries during this period (3%), however , the 61 enquiries received help to demonstrate the diverse nature of locationa l and floorspace requirements for businesses in this sector. Over 50 % of enquiries to PCC were made from businesses expanding or relocating from e lsewhere in the UK, with smaller numbers of overseas (9%) and new business e nquiries (15%). A broad range of preferences for locations are iden tified by companies, including city centre sites, local or district cent re locations, business park premises and small offices within residential areas . Floorspace requirements also vary markedly, with the majority (68%) requiri ng smaller premises typically less than 500 sqm (5,000 sqft). Contrary to what m ight be expected, the majority of enquiries did not specify a requirement for specialist floorspace to include lab space, patient treatment facilities, sp ecialised or sterilised environments. PCC received approximately 2,020 enquiries with reg ards to development opportunities and inward investment prospects acros s all sectors in the period between 2002 and 2012. On the whole there is a down ward trend in the number of enquires taking place with a clear drop in interest taking place in the period of 2008 to 2011 (the double dip recession).

The number of enquiries peaked in 2005 a nd has since followed a general downward trend. Typically the council is receiving no more than 5 enquiries from the sector annually. 35 of the enquiries specified floor space requireme nts, which covered a wide range from 40 sqm to 40,469 sqm (400sqft - 435,600s qft). The enquiries demonstrate development and inward in vestment interest for Plymouth from a range of local, regional, national and international companies and sources. SWRDA played a significant role direc ting UKTI overseas investor enquires to the City, notably between 2008 -2010 , although none of these actually resulted in an positive inward inves tment decision. Figure 4 - Medical and healthcare enquiries Figure 5 - Investment and development interest in m edical and healthcare sector (2002-2012) Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 15 3.3.2 New business enquiries There were 10 recorded new business enquiries and i n many cases these enquiries were made by individuals. Interest was expressed in various locations and for ms of commercial floorspace provision, including industrial units an d office units. Enquiries were also made for very small units (2 rooms). 3.3.3 Expansion and relocation of existing business withi n Plymouth 11 enquiries were made relating to the relocation o f existing business in the Plymouth area. These were made for varying reasons such as parking, centralising computerised records and opening distr ibution premises. Indigenous business enquiries were for a range of s paces including admin office and training facilities, general office spac e and workshops. The space requirements for local businesses tended to be smal ler than those relocating and the majority less than 200 sqm. These enquiries indicate that a range of locations in the City are likely to be suitable for the differing medical and healthcare s ector employment land requirements, from relatively small office units in local or district centres and residential areas on the fringes of the City Centre through to serviced plots or larger business/industrial park units in locations such as Tamar Science Park and Plymouth International Business Park. 3.3.4 Expansion and relocation enquiries from outside Plymouth (UK) Approximately a third (32%) of all the enquiries r elated to opportunities for inward investment and premise relocation from elsew here in the UK. As with the enquiries from Plymouth based companies, the buildi ng requirements varied markedly. Examples of enquiries include: Interest expressed in ground floor level DDA compli ant sites with sterilising room. City centre office space (self-contained with parki ng) of around 100 sqm. 20 seat call centre space. Location flexible. A company specified an interest in building premise s on a serviced plot within the Derriford area coupled with temporary warehousi ng and office space for 1- 2 years whilst this took place. 3.3.5 Expansion and relocation from outside Plymouth (overseas) 9% of enquiries relating to medical and healthcare facilities and development opportunities in Plymouth were from overseas partie s. Enquiries included: Interest expressed in warehousing facilities (non-h azardous chemicals) near a port with access to Europe and capacity for future expansion. Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 16 International company interested in what incentives are available for development in the UK. Specific drivers considered for location included skills of the workforce, IP protection, proven trac k record in the companies specialism to develop the R&D capability, cost and financial assistance in the region, ease of access to headquarters in Boston. The enquiry identified a need for warehousing, office and R&D and manufactur ing space and an approximate site requirement of 4,645 sqm (50,000 s qft). Company interested in moving R&D out of the US inte rested in creating a centre of excellence for laser technology and wishe d to know where other companies with similar products are located. One of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies expressed interest in a high specification building (classified as a cell c ulture business), the main project driver is stated to be the condition of the building. 3.3.6 Floorspace requirements The floor space requirements stated in the enquirie s indicate the diversity of site size required. 34% of all the enquires specified a n interest in sites smaller than 100 sqm (1,000 sq ft) in size and a further 34% of enquiries related to sites lower than 500 sqm (5,000 sqft) in size. The case study of FTR Mobile, located at Tamar Scie nce Park, provides an example of an indigenous company that has recently relocated within the City and only required small premises during the start-up pe riod, but where space to expand in the future may be beneficial. Case Study 1: FTR Mobile Support Services FTR Mobile Support Services provide telecare, tele health, assistive technology and easy-to-use phones to people in the community w ith care needs. FTR is a Figure 6 - Site and premises enquiries - floor spac e requirements (2002 - 2012) Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 17 recent start-up company that was established in Ply mouth and has recently moved from the Cattedown area to Tamar Science Park. As the FTR product combines elements of the healthc are and communications/digital sectors the company was keen to locate at Tamar Science Park to take advantage of the networking and busine ss development opportunities presented by a clustering of like-minded organisati ons within the advanced engineering and healthcare sectors. It was noted t hat the Science Park has relatively strict entry criteria and FTR were willi ng to wait for suitable accommodation to become available, rather than loca te elsewhere. The company currently employs less than 5 staff, so space requirements are limited although space for expansion may be require d in due course. Looking ahead, the company sees the location close to Derriford Hospital as advantageous in building links with the healthcare sector, although PCC and the emerging GP Clinical Commissioning Groups are also potential client groups. 3.4 Spatial distribution of the medical and healthcare sector in Plymouth An exercise of mapping medical and healthcare secto r companies registered in Plymouth using Companies House Data reveals that th ere are two main concentrations of activity: one in the southern par t of the city around the periphery of the city centre; and a northern cluste r at Derriford. This spatial pattern is highly consistent with the Core Strategy objective of a bi-polar economy and reinforces the importance of the medica l and healthcare sector in achieving this ambition. The Tamar Science Park in particular has been successful in attracting a large cluster of high pr ofile organisations to the northern regeneration area. Business case studies show that the close proximity to Derriford Hospital, the opportunity to collabora te with companies with common interests, and the quality of the built envi ronment, have all been important in attracting organisations to locate at the Science Park. Nevertheless, the concentration of companies furthe r south remains significant and the interests of those organisations should be safeguarded through the preparation of the Plymouth Plan. These groupings appear to be made up predominantly of primary and specialist healthcare providers that take advantage of increased footfall and accessible loca tions around the city centre. These principal concentrations of activity are bala nced by a broader spread of organisations providing care to the community, in p articular those organisations in the 'Other Human Health Activities ' and 'Hospital Activities' SIC sub-sectors. Mapping data also shows that not a ll specialist medical practice activities are located within the main act ivity clusters described above, such as those at Parkway Industrial Estate. This s uggests that for some companies a location within the city is sufficient to take advantage of the critical mass in the sector, without needing to be co-located on a single business park. It is anticipated that mapping of public sector NHS premises would follow a broadly similar pattern, with a concentration of sp ecialist secondary medical Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 18 care at Derriford in particular, supported by a bro ad distribution of primary care facilities serving the communities in which th ey are located (see section 4.4 also). 3.4.1 Spatial distribution of registered companies Companies House data 3 (Mint Orbis) records 156 medical and healthcare registered companies within the PCC administrative area. The proportions of organisation type making up this total by SIC code is illustrated in the pie chart below. Over half (55%) of the registered businesse s sit in the 'Other human health activities'4 digit SIC Code (8690) which cov ers human healthcare services not performed by hospitals, doctors or dentists, fo r example practitioners in the fields of optometry, hydrotherapy, occupational the rapy, speech, chiropody chiropractice and homeopathy. It should be noted that there are important omissio ns from this data as it does not pick up public sector healthcare and medical organi sations. For example , the National Health Service (NHS) is of course a major employer in the city, but as a public sector organisation it is not registered wit h Companies House. Nevertheless, mapping of the information available is helpful in revealing where concentrations of medical and healthcare activity a re occurring in the City. Map 001 at Appendix B1 shows the location of each r egistered office by post code and names those post code areas where there ar e concentrations of medical and healthcare organisations. The study area for t his exercise was extended to include the Langage Energy Park, which is located o utside the PCC administrative boundary but recognised as strategic employment sit e for the city.

This is what would be expected, with companies offering services directly to the communi ties within which they are located across different parts of the city. There are five concentrations of activity in the so uthern part of the city, around the City Centre and on the waterfront, namel y: at Mill Fields Trust; Sutton Harbour; the University and Mutley & Manname ad. There are two concentrations of activity in the nor thern part of the city, in the Derriford area, namely: Tamar Science Park and Plym outh International Medical & Technology Park; and Darklake Park. Langage Energy Park does not currently accommodate a high concentration of activity in the sector, with no companies with a Co mpanies House registered address located at the Park, but it does have sign ificant potential to support the sector's locational requirements. Companies kn own to have located at the Park to date include: Algram, a manufacturer of hig h quality plastic components for the aerospace, automotive, medical a nd industrial sectors; and Advanced Medical Solutions, who develop and provide woundcare products to a global market. The distribution of organisations and occurrence of southern (central Plymouth) and northern (Derriford) concentrations o f activity is broadly consistent with the objective of a 'bi-polar' city set out in the Core Strategy (see section 1.2.1). Mapping of organisations suggests that employment a reas around the city centre are of importance for the sector, along with those in the north around Derriford, albeit of a different nature. The futur e needs of organisations in the south of Plymouth should therefore be taken into ac count when preparing the Plymouth Plan. 'Hospital activities' representing 6% of the emplo yment sites have a dispersed distribution. Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 20 'Specialist medical activities' representing 12% of the employments sites are commonly grouped in cluster locations such as the U niversity area and Tamar Science Park. However, there are also stand alone c ases where they are located away from other medical and healthcare uses . Map 002 at Appendix B2 shows total medical and heal thcare employment levels in different parts of Plymouth (2011 data). This h ighlights the northern concentration of medical and healthcare activity in particular, suggesting that companies and organisations typically employ larger numbers of people than the groupings of companies closer to the city centre. 3.4.2 The characteristics of Plymouth medical and healthc are clusters The following sub-sections consider the main charac teristics of different areas of Plymouth where medical and healthcare activities id entified through the mapping exercise. Three main groupings of sites are discus sed: Southern Plymouth, covering concentrations of medic al and healthcare activity around the city centre and waterfront area . Northern Plymouth, covering the high profile busine ss park locations around the Derriford Hosiptal. Rest of Plymouth, to ensure the positive aspects of sites elsewhere in the city are considered. Case studies are also used to explore the factors t hat have influenced businesses when deciding where to locate. 3.4.3 Southern Plymouth Map 001 (Appendix A1) indicates that there are four main clusters of activity in the south of Plymouth, as set out below. A review of the types of businesses locating in these locations around the city centre show that they are predominantly primary medical and dentistry practices and special ist clinics serving the community. These locations potentially enable them to take advantage of high population densities and footfall, but lower rental s, in secondary retail and office premises close to the city centre. Sutton Harbour - The majority of companies at Sutton Harbour prov ide community care, with practices including a doctors' surgey, dental surgery, a knee and foot clinic, an orthodontist and chiroprac tor. OI Sciences Ltd, also registered at Sutton Harbour, are a company that sp ecialise in the development and supply of customised, high value injectable dru gs for hospital and specialist applications. Millfields Trust - The Millfields Community Economic Development Tr ust rents commercial premises across two sites in the S tonehouse neighbourhood. Map 001 indicates that six medical and healthcare c ompanies are located here. The University - Companies registered at the University area post code and neighbouring North Hill are specialist practices pr oviding community healthcare. Examples are: the Ridgeway Clinic offe ring Chiropractic Care, massage, podiatry (chiropody), hypn otherapy and psychotherapy; Bowden Physiotherapy and two dental practices. Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 21 Mutley & Mannamead - Businesses located in the Mutley & Mannamead area are made up of primary and specialist medical care practices serving the community, including Sound Medical Practices and Pr emier Eye Surgeons. 3.4.4 Northern Plymouth The Derriford area of Plymouth is an established in dustrial, business and academic area of the city. In recent years the area has seen a growth in medical and health related activity and has also been an ar ea of focus for public sector led regeneration activity. There is a notable differen ce in the types of businesses making up this northern concentration of medical an d healthcare organisations. Map 001 (Appendix A1) indicates that there are two main clusters of activity in the north of Plymouth at Tamar Science Park and Dar klake Park. Tamar Science Park. The science park was established through a collab oration of the University of Plymouth and Plymouth City Cou ncil and is located adjacent to the main Derriford Hospital campus. The park has successfully incubated and grown a number of medical technology and biotech re lated companies. Resident medical and healthcare business include: Cardio Analytics Centre for Health and Environmental Statistics iNet Biomedical Medical Education National Blood Service NHS Education South West Occupational Health for primary care Peninsula Medical School Plymouth Hospital NHS Legal Trust Plymouth Hospital NHS Trust Research and Developmen t PMS Clinical Neurology Research PMS Diabetes Clinical Research Centre PMS Respiratory Research Unit S & S Dental Services South West Care Homes This represents a substantial cluster of organisati ons with common areas of interest. The FTR Mobile (see section 3.3.6), Squi rrel Medical and Plymouth Wound Care case studies illustrate why these three companies decided to locate at Tamar Science Park. Case Study 2: Squirrel Medical Squirrel Medical are specialists in the design, man ufacture and distribution of alternating air mattresses and pressure ulcer preve ntion cushions. Their dynamic mattresses have been created to meet the needs of t he clinician and patient within the modern care home as well as those in domestic s ettings. The company was established in Plymouth and moved i ts headquarters to Tamar Science Park in 2008. The most important decision- making factors for the move to the Science Park were the quality of the buildin gs and environment, which create a good impression for visitors. The floorsp ace was also considered to be Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 22 good value. A location close to the hospital and o ther businesses in the sector was recognised as having some benefit, but this was not a key driver for the company. Squirrel Medical plan to maintain their headquarter s in Plymouth, but also have manufacturing facilities located elsewhere in the U K. Case Study 3: Plymouth Wound Care Plymouth Wound Care is a small company linked to th e Diving Diseases Research Centre (DDRC), a charity which aims to pro mote and take part in medical treatment, training and research associated with the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the treatment of diving diseases and other medical problems. Plymouth Wound Care is a relatively recent initiati ve to provide private wound care services to the public. Formally located at Fort Bovisand on the eastern co astline of Plymouth South, the DDRC relocated to its own purpose-built premises cl ose to Derriford Hosiptal in 1996. The building is now located in the Tamar Sci ence Park, which has grown up around it. Close proximity to Derriford Hospita l is the fundamental locational driver for the DDRC as they are regularly involved in the treatment of critically ill patients. A location close to the hospital is also of benefit as the charity seeks to grow the Plymouth Wound Care business. The closure of Plymouth Airport has been damaging f or the DDRC as it has meant the loss of a helipad with re-fuelling facili ties that was of essential importance for bringing in patients. This means th at flights are often now diverted to other treatment centres, resulting in a substantial loss of revenue. The DDRC and Derriford Hospital are currently exploring options for the reprovision of a helipad suitable for landing and re-fuelling l arge helipcopters such as Sea Kings. Plymouth International Medical and Technology Park (PIMTP) Plymouth International Medical and Technology Park (PIMTP) is another strategic employment allocation within the Derrifor d area. The site of approximately 29 hectares is located on the former Seaton Barracks, to the east of the A386, close to Derriford Hospital and the Tamar Science Park. The AAP proposes the use of approximately 9.5 hectares of t he site at its north western end as a location for a new mixed use district centre ( Proposal DS16 in the Derriford & Seaton AAP). It also proposes incorporating new l and at the eastern and southern edges of the existing site, which contribu tes in the region of 6.5 hectares of additional land. The overall site area covered b y Proposal DS06 is approximately 26.5 hectares. PIMTP is owned and marketed by the Council followin g its transfer from the South West of England Regional Development Agency ( RDA) in 2011. The site is of strategic importance for employment and this is its primary purpose. Given its central location within the Derriford growth ar ea the site could play a secondary role in supporting the wider objective of sustainable growth through provision of necessary community infrastructure. T he district centre allocation Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 23 reduces the total employment land provision margina lly but does re-provide 8,000 sqm for commercial users within the centre. The di strict centre format will be complimentary to the medical and healthcare sectors floorspace requirements as not all businesses in this sector require serviced plots in a business park layout. Some services are likely to prefer a distr ict centre location given the pedestrian footfall and ease of access and parking provision. The commercial floorspace within the district centre should be con sidered an appropriate element of the land supply for the medical and healthcare s ector and it has the potential to enhance the marketability of PIMTP by providing ser vices as well as floorspace suitable for the medical and healthcare sector. PIMTP is promoted as a'flagship' employment site wh ich will play a crucial role in growing Derriford's reputation as a centre of me dical excellence. It provides for B1 and B2 employment uses, with a focus on the heal th/medical sector. Its close proximity to the expanding Derriford Hospital, the Nuffield Hospital and the new headquarters for the Peninsula Medical and Dental S chools, put it close to the heart of one of Europe's largest medical communitie s, making it a critical component in supporting the city's future prosperit y. As an established centre for medical excellence, PIMTP was chosen as the ideal l ocation for one of only three new Radiology Academies in the country, as well as a new Peninsula NHS Treatment Centre, specialising in orthopaedic diagn ostic treatment and rehabilitation. The NHS has also acquired some 7 he ctares of land within the site for a planned Care Centre , however this seems to h ave been on hold since the site was acquired in 2004. The site also accommodates a range of other organis ations including occupational health specialists IMASS, HSBC, Hellermann Tyton, P DSA veterinary care and the Land Registry, which is one of Plymouth's bigge st employers and hosts one of the largest databasesin Europe. The major private hospital proposal - Circle Health - gave up their contract to purchase a 5-acr e site, even though they had obtained outline planning permission, due to restru cturing and stock flotation of the company back in 2011. Biovault Technical, the UK's largest private tissue bank are also located at PIMTP. As a private tissu e bank working directly with the NHS the company is seeking to establish a regio nal human tissue storage and processing facility with low start up costs. Further notable companies located in the northern a rea around Derriford include BD. BD is based at Belliver Industrial Estate to th e north of the hospital and Plymouth airport. BD is a leading global medical t echnology company that develops, manufactures and sells medical devices, i nstrument systems and reagents. The company's plant in Plymouth manufact ures a broad range of blood collection products and systems including BD Vacuta iner\u00ae tubes for haematology, coagulation and special chemistries, a nd supplies markets both across Europe and around the world. The Plymouth fa cility, which employs approximately 720 associates, also manufactures BD Biosciences - Discovery Labware products which are used by medical research ers. The company also has premises in Oxford, Swindon and Dublin. 3.4.5 Rest of Plymouth The exercise of mapping medical and healthcare comp anies shows that there is a broad spread of individual companies, including tho se locating at other smaller Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 24 business parks such as the Parkway Industrial Estat e, Wolseley Close Business Park and Scott Business Park. Companies based at the Parkway Industrial Estate in the east of Plymouth at Longbridge are: Plymouth Consultant Radiologists & Easy Imaging - T he Plymouth Consultant Radiologist Partnership is one of the la rgest independent partnerships providing radiological expertise, repo rting and consulting services. It has been established for over 25 years and no employs 13 consultant radiologists. Plymouth Radiology Consul tants also run Easy Imaging, which provides MRI and Ultrasound services . Peninsula Urology Ltd - Peninsula Urology was estab lished in 2008 to provide an efficient service for patients with spec ific urological problems. Based at Wolseley Business Park to the north west o f the city centre, Knight Scientific Limited is the world exclusive manufactu rer of ABEL\u00ae Oxidative Stress Kits with Pholasin\u00ae for measuring antioxidan t capacity and free radicals. The case study of the County Chiropractic provides information on a company that has established its business outside of the ma in concentrations of medical and healthcare companies, in the west of Plymouth at Sc ott Business Park. Case Study 4: County Chiropractic - family care County Chiropractic was established in 2003 in orde r to deliver chiropractic care to the Plymouth community. The customer base is ma de up primarily of private customers located within Plymouth, although some pe ople travel from locations outside the city such as Tavistock. Currently located at Scott Business Park in the wes t of Plymouth, key factors driving the identification of suitable premises wer e access to the main road network and ample provision of car parking. Many p atients have limited mobility and therefore ease of access is of great importance to the company. When asked what other areas of Plymouth might be co nsidered suitable, a City Centre location was not considered to be appropriat e. It was recognised that a location with improved visibility from the public m ay be helpful from a business development perspective (the company plans to place a sign on the main road) but this would only be one element of a broader marketi ng strategy. Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 25 4 Future Forecast Growth in Plymouth 4.1 Overview This section undertakes an analysis of the future f orecast employment growth in the Medical & Healthcare Sector in Plymouth and con siders the implications for future floorspace demand based on employment growth forecasts to 2030 produced by Oxford Economics. The purpose is to identify the potential quantum of future floorspace demand by the sector for space in Plymouth. This, together w ith the analysis of spatial patterns of demand, provides an indication of the f uture floorspace requirements of the sector in Plymouth. This section also considers future drivers for the location of medical and healthcare businesses, including the potential impl ications of the reform of the NHS for land requirements in the sector. 4.2 Forecast employment growth Employment forecasts have a tendency to be influenc ed by prevailing economic circumstances and therefore the forecast for modest job creation of 967 additional jobs in the period 2013 to 2031 should b e considered as a benchmark for future analysis only. The double dip recession and short term economic outlook creates uncertainty and the forecasts are p olicy neutral, so do not take account of local aspirations for the sector. 4.2.1 Approach Oxford Economics have produced economic forecasts f or the Plymouth area. These include forecasts of employment growth to 203 0. We have used these forecasts, along with our analysis of the sector us ing ONS BRES data (see chapter 2) to establish the potential scale and shape of fu ture employment growth in the sector to 2031. The forecasts are based on a policy neutral environ ment in Plymouth to 2031. The forecast is derived from Oxford Economics' suit e of economic forecasting models. The modelling generates outputs which enab le an analysis and understanding of the economic outlook at the local level. These forecasts are driven largely by macroeconomic factors at the glob al and national level, alongside more local historic trends. It should al so be noted that forecasts have a tendency to be influenced by short-term shocks and by prevailing economic circumstances. It is for this reason that forecast s produced in times of relative economic prosperity are typically over optimistic i n the long run, with the converse observed for forecasts produced in times o f lower economic prosperity. At the current time, as a result of the double dip recession and the short term economic outlook, there is currently a greater degr ee of uncertainty than usual about future economic projections over the longer t erm. This means that further care than usual is needed in the interpretation of the forecasts. Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 26 The forecasts produced by Oxford Economics also do not reflect local aspiration and pipeline investment. For this and the other rea sons identified above, the forecasts should only be considered as a benchmark for further analysis. 4.2.2 Applying the forecasts The latest Oxford Economics forecasts available for Plymouth provide a picture of projected employment growth broken down by broad industrial sector. At the time of the analysis, forecasts at the requisite 4 digit SIC code categories comprising the medical & healthcare sector were not available. Whilst the category for the health sector ('Q: Human Health an d Social Work Activities') does not exactly match the definition of the medica l and healthcare sector applied in this paper, we can undertake some useful analysi s by making some pragmatic assumptions. With reference to the 4 digit SIC code categories d efining the medical & healthcare sector in this paper, categories 8610, 8 621, 8622, 8623 and 8690 all fall within 'Q: Human Health and Social Work Activities' . Examination of the BRES data suggests that these categories make up approxi mately two thirds of the employment in the Q category, with residential care and social work without accommodation making up the remainder. The BRES da ta examined in Section 2 has also shown that the remaining 4 digit SIC codes (primarily manufacturing), that make up the applied definition of the medical & healthcare sector, contribute only a small proportion of total employment in the sector. Accordingly, the employment projections for the 'Q: Human Health and Social Work Activities' category provide a broad indication of the future d irection future of growth in the medical & healthcare sector as defined. The following table provides a summary of the total projected employment growth in the medical & healthcare sector over the period 2013 to 2031. On the basis of the forecasts only modest growth of 967 ad ditional jobs is projected. Table 10 - Projected jobs growth, 2013-2031 Sector Jobs Growth Projection 2013-2031 2110 : Manufacture of basic pharmaceutical products - 2120 : Manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations 5 2059 : Manufacture of other chemical products n.e.c . - 2680 : Manufacture of magnetic and optical media - 8610 : Hospital activities 615 8621 : General medical practice activities 55 8622 : Specialist medical practice activities 6 8623 : Dental practice activities 16 8690 : Other human health activities 269 Total pharma, medical & health related jobs 967 Note: The above estimates are based on a uniform g rowth rate across sub-sectors from their base. Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 27 4.3 Implications for future floorspace requirements Applying a floorspace standard of 26 to 36 sqm for each projected full time job in the period 2013 to 2031 results in an estimated requirement for medical and healthcare buildings in the range 28,000 to 31,000 sqm. The projected employment growth in the medical & he althcare sector will have implications for future floorspace requirements in Plymouth. By applying some assumptions in respect of average employment density, the additional employment projected by the Oxford Econo mics forecasts to 2030 has been translated into estimated floorspace requireme nts. Clearly, the averages for floorspace density per medical technology worker wh ich will vary substantially between a major hospital, wet lab and surgery for e xample. These varying needs also have implications for the height and configura tion of building requirements. Section 3.3 outlines the wide range of location and floorspace requirements for the sector, based on enquiries to PCC. Evidence provided in guidance published by the Home s and Communities Agency (HCA) provides a starting point for informing assum ptions in relation to average employment density. This provides comparative evid ence by use class, although not by specific sector. Estimating a simple averag e across the range of use types associated with activities in the medical & healthc are sector indicates an average employment density of 1 FTE job for 25 sqm of floor space. In addition, in specific reference to the medical & healthcare sector in Plymouth, we have examined floorspace densities on parts of t he Plymouth International Medical and Healthcare Technology Park (PIMTP) as a local benchmark. This evidence, although based on a small sample, suggest s an employment density figure of 29 sqm to be a reasonable assumption. The estimated floorspace requirements when applying the density figure of 26 - 32 sqm (applying a 10% interval either side of the central estimate) are shown in the following table. This suggests a range of 28,0 00 to 31,000 sqm of additional space for the sector in the period 2013-2031. This is equivalent to an average annual requirement of between 1,280 and 1,560 sqm. As identified in Section 2, it is noted that the SIC codes applied to define activ ity in the medical & healthcare sector do not fully capture all activity, in partic ular that in relation to advanced manufacturing (the requirements of which are consid ered in the requisite addendum paper to the Priority Sectors Study).

Public health care structures are in a period of transition in response to the Government's healt h reform plans and the full implications for the sector can not be predicted. From a spatial planning perspective, a drive to provide routine healthcare closer to or at home is of importance, with central facilities such as the hos pital providing specialist treatments at the regional level. Commissioning st ructures may also introduce further competition in the healthcare sector, with the potential result that further privately operated healthcare centres and c linics seek premises in the city. 4.4.1 Reform of the National Healthcare Service (NHS) Healthcare structures across England are in a perio d of transition as a consequence of the Coalition Government's health reform plans t hat are being described as the most radical changes in the history of the NHS 4. In accordance with the changes proposed by the Health and Social Care Act 2012, th e Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) previously responsible for the commissioning of pri mary and secondary care from providers are being phased out. By April 2013 the responsibility for commissioning healthcare services and the managemen t of healthcare estates will fall to the following organisations and groups: National NHS Commissioning Board - Formally established in October 2011 as an independent body, at arm's length to the Gove rnment, the Commissioning Board's first responsibility has been the authorisation of locally based Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) across England. From April 2013 the Board will be responsible for commis sioning primary healthcare from Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in ways that support consistent, high standards of quality across the co untry. Clinical Commissioning Groups (GCCs) - CCGs comprise clusters of GP surgeries delivering local primary healthcare services. From April 2013, CCGs will become responsible for commissioning seco ndary healthcare services from the Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust and other providers. During December 2012, General Practitioners (GPs) i n Devon voted on the final configuration of the emergent CCGs that would proceed through the approval process. In Devon there will be one county -wide Devon Shadow CCG, and three Locality CCGs; namely the Northern, Eastern and Western 4 Western Locality Clinical Commissioning Handbook ( not dated) Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 29 Locality CCGs. Plymouth is located in the area cov ered by the Western Locality CCG. These Locality CCGs comprise cluster s of GP surgeries delivering local primary healthcare services. Secondary Healthcare providers - The principal secondary healthcare providers in the Plymouth area is the Plymouth Hosp itals NHS Trust PropCo - A Government-owned limited company, NHS Property Services, is to take ownership of, and manage that part of the e xisting primary care trust estate that will not transfer to NHS community care providers under the healthcare reform plans. It is intended that PropC o will: hold property for use by community and primary care services, including s ocial enterprises; cut costs of administering the estate overall by consol idating the management of over 150 estates; deliver and develop cost-effectiv e property solutions for community health services; and dispose of property surplus to NHS requirements. 4.4.2 Western Locality Clinical Commissioning Group The Western Locality Clinical Commissioning Group ( CCG) covering Plymouth has developed the Healthy System Model to improve u nderstanding of how sustainable high quality services can be delivered. Under this model three strategies or action plans have been developed, as set out below: Strategy 1 - This is to ensure that all clinicians and clinic al managers understand that the system is unsustainable and tha t they align to take ownership of the costs of care. Strategy 2 - To develop a system and processes that ensures t hose we serve get the right care first time, every time. Strategy 3 - To refocus our commissioning resources and plans on the prevention of ill health, and the improved care of those with enduring long term illness. Strategy 3 is of particular interest from a spatial planning and future land requirement perspective, as the Western Locality gi ves the following examples of supporting plans: \"Investment in library services to act as health an d social care hubs and promote wellness.\" \"Virtual Diabetic clinics brining consultant expert ise closer to the patients. In essence the CCG will be increasingly looking to deliver wellbeing focussed services at the point of need within local communit ies which may have an impact on the demand for healthcare space within local and district centres across the city as the focal points for community service provision generally. 4.4.3 Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust Plymouth Hospitals is the largest hospital trust in the south west peninsula and is a teaching trust in partnership with the Peninsula Me dical School. The Trust has its base at Derriford Hospital, a central component of the nothern medical and healthcare cluster referred to in section 3.4, and is a major employer within Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 30 Plymouth. Preparation of the Plymouth Plan should therefore be informed by the plans of the Trust for its Derriford campus and oth er satellite facilities. To provide further background on the organisation, Plymouth Hospitals provides comprehensive secondary and tertiary healthcare to people in the South West Peninsula and also has an integrated Ministry of De fence Hospital Unit. It has also developed rapidly as a centre for research in partnership with the Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry and Plymouth and Exeter Universities. It received one of the first National Institute of Hea lth Research grants in the south west and staff are an active part of one of the fir st clinical trials units to be registered by the UK Clinical Research Networks. Th e Trust is also a successful partner in the designated Peninsula Collaboration i n Applied Health Research and Care (PenCLARHC). 4.4.3.1 The Hospital Trusts Strategic Plan 2009-2019 The Trusts strategic plan for the period 2009 to 20 19 5 highlights a number of trends in healthcare provision and future opportuni ties and challenges for the Trust. While the publication of the plan predates the Coalition Government's reforms of the sector, the following factors are co nsidered to remain applicable: Community Services - The Department of Health has set out a new direc tion for community services to reduce reliance upon acut e hospitals. In response to this, local Primary Care Trusts have worked to unde rtake routine interventional work closer to a patient's home. Move to Regional Centres - The Government is keen to provide specialist care and care for the most critically ill patients in regional centres. The phrase \"localise where possible, centralise where necessar y\" is often used and supported by the Trust. This could potentially lea d to either an increase or decrease in local provision and the Trust is widely recognised as the specialist for the Peninsula for a number of services and is c ommitted to further developing this role. Competition for Elective Care - The establishment of Independent Sector Treatment Centres and private provision of communit y care has increased capacity and competition. This is recognised as a challenge to the Trusts routine elective and diagnostic services by reducin g market share, increasing alternatives for patients and forcing down prices. The Trust concludes that healthcare can now been se en as a market-place, with providers in some instances competing to attract pa tients. A competitive environment can help improve services and drive dow n costs by encouraging providers to offer more efficient services. The Tru st recognises the need to maintain and develop its share of this market and i n summary defines its competitive position as follows: Focusing on expanding the range of complex speciali st elective care it offers to patients locally and regionally through investme nt in research and development and attracting specialist staff. 5 Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust (version 2, January 2 009) 'Our Plans 2009 to 2019: Safety, quality, efficiency and health in everything we do.

Improving care of the elderly services. Further develop ophthalmology services by building a new ophthalmology unit. Grow as a centre for children's and young people's services, working in partnership with other agencies concerned with the care and welfare of children, including plans to develop a Children's H ospital. 4.4.3.2 The Hospital Trusts Developments The strategic plan also introduces the Hospitals Tr usts Vanguard Estates Plan (VEP), through which the Trust intends to transform its buildings and facilities. Objectives include improving the environment for st aff and patients, modernising infrastructure and co-locating services to improve patient and traffic flows. The recent development hospital facilities can be summa rised as follows 6: 2007 - the Terence Lewis Building, Derriford is ope ned housing a cardiothoracic unit and Discovery Library 2008 - a state-of-the-art general intensive care un it in the Terence Lewis Building, Derriford is opened The Royal Eye Infirmary is relocated from it's hist oric site at Mutley Plain to state-of-the-art facilities at Derriford. The Haemodialysis Unit is moved from Derriford to a purpose-built unit at Eastover. The trust intends that the new 'satellit e unit' will be the first of several run by the hospital across the region, with the aim of reducing travel times for patients. A dedicated Children's Area is created at the Derri ford Emergency Department A dedicated Children and Young People's Theatre Uni t is provided at Derriford. The Trust plans to further transform its buildings and facilities to ensure they are fit for 21 st Century healthcare. The following developments ar e planned, alongside investment in new medical technology: Stem Cell Transplant Unit - the Trust is investing \u00a32.7mil in new facilities that will include 10 new single rooms for patients who need protective isolation because their immune systems are depleted due to chemotherapy treatment. The Gateway Programme (main entrance) - The main entrance is the facilitator to the urgent care pathway. The Trust is undertaking work to look at how the urgent care pathway works, between the e mergency department, diagnostic and interventional imaging, clinical dec isions unit (CDU), medical assessment unit (MAU) and the surgical assessment u nit (SAU). This will enable the Trust to see how they work as they are n ow, if they could be 6 Information sourced from: http://www.plymouthhospitals.nhs.uk/ourorganisation /DevelopingOurHospitals/Pages/Home.aspx Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 32 reorganised within their current space or whether t hey would need to move into the space currently occupied by the main entra nce on level 6.This is one of the crucial factors determining the need for a n ew main entrance. If it is deemed that the urgent care needs to move within th is space, then a new main entrance would be required. 4.5 Investment activity in the healthcare sector The healthcare sector is viewed as relatively stabl e by property investors, with expectations that rental growth will be maintained in the short to medium term. It is a common view of the regions commercial prope rty agents that the healthcare property sector will remain an attractiv e prospect due to a combination of the ageing population of the far Sou th West peninsula, increased life expectancy and the ability to secure long leases from prospective tenants. Market commentators have suggested there are also potential opportunities for private providers to partner with the NHS Foundation Trusts, with the potential result that existing public sect or land is a focus for investment in the short term. The last few years has torn up the property investm ent rule book with the steepest and deepest decline counteracted by the sharpest re covery, and even now, still the greatest future uncertainty. Whilst some investors are bracing themselves for further warning signs one sector that has not been shy of the spotlight in recent years is the healthcare sector. At the national le vel it seems to have bucked the trend and is attracting investors from all over the globe. Healthcare has established itself as a property asset class in its own right, albeit parts are in their investment infancy. With a political will to upgrad e, the economic and structural changes ahead there is no doubt UK healthcare, both public and private, requires new capital, new infrastructure and new ideas but w ithout equity and expert advice, they will remain only ideas . A concern for the property investment market over t he short to medium term is the lack of rental growth. The traditional commerci al sectors will not be offering rental growth for the next few years, however this is not the case with the healthcare sector. With the prospect of longer leas es and rents often linked to fixed annual increases or Retail Price Index (RPI) there is more optimism about guaranteed growth in this sector. Careful consider ation needs to be applied to the starting rent and to the business to ensure it can sustain the rent, however these rental uplifts can significantly enhance an investo r's internal rate of return and make the healthcare sector an attractive investment prospect. 4.5.1 Primary Healthcare Much of the current healthcare related investment a ctivity can be attributed to the care home, primary healthcare and private hospital markets. As care homes don't fall under our definition of the sector we have not covered this asset type. The primary care market is dominated by a number of spe cialist investors such as Assura, MedicX, PHP and GPI. They all either have t heir own in-house development companies or are affiliated to such com panies which endeavour to procure new schemes let to GP doctors or, up until the current reforms, Primary Care Trusts (PCTs). The market has continued to per form well with most investment properties having the following attribut es: Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 33 Long leases (typically 20 - 25 years) No tenant break clauses Excellent tenant covenant strength (PCTs or GPs) Rent reimbursement through the PCTs. Schemes are not generally procured on a speculative basis as the buildings are typically fitted out to a high standard to meet cur rent NHS requirements which makes them unsuitable for alternative uses such as office use or residential. 4.5.2 Private Hospitals The ageing and uneven quality of the UK hospital in frastructure and consultants' growing dissatisfaction with the limitations of exi sting healthcare facilities are creating a demand for modern, dedicated and high-qu ality facilities that allow for higher-quality and more efficient delivery of healt hcare. As of 2008, 12% of the UK population was covered by some form of medical insurance. While UK private medical insurance cover age rate has been increasing, the total UK private medical insurance spending is substantially below the spending in other developed countries, providing si gnificant opportunity for further growth. There have been a limited number of transactions in the private hospital market to date as lot sizes tend to be lar ge which limits the investment market interest, further exacerbated by the special ist nature of the asset class and building specification. That said there has been in creasing investment interest as the sector benefits from long leases, generally wit h RPI or fixed % uplifts which providing guaranteed rental growth in a market wher e this is now uncommon. Circle Healthcare are a key player in this market a nd was selected in 2010 as the first private company to run an NHS hospital. In 20 11 the financial robustness of Circle Health was under close scrutiny as its paren t company Circle Holdings floated the company. The company is regarded as t he 'John Lewis of health' as it is 49.9% owned by clinicians, and has been describe d as 'at the cutting edge of reshaping healthcare'. However, Circle's accounts reveal it was forced to delay a number of key hospital building projects as finance dried up, incurring hefty interest charges in the run up to the flotation. Wh ile the company secured \u00a350m institutional funding for a hospital that was recen tly completed in Reading, in 2010 it was forced to put a project in Edinburgh on ice after the collapse of its developer. A development at Plymouth International Business Park achieved outline consent but has also been put on hold by th e developer. Looking forward there is anticipation that there wi ll be significant changes to the financing structures in the market over the coming few years, which will provide opportunities for capital growth to investors who t ruly understand the sub sector of the industry and the corporate structures. Market commentators have suggested there are also p otential opportunities for private providers to partner with the NHS Foundatio n Trusts. In summary, it is a common view of the regions comm ercial property agents that the healthcare property sector will remain an attra ctive prospect for property investors for the foreseeable future due to: the ageing population of the far South West peninsu la Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 34 the ability to secure long leases from prospective tenants the potential for fixed (often annual) rental uplif ts growing covenant strength; and increased life expectancy. Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 35 5 Findings and Recommendations The Council has to take forward the findings of thi s paper to positively inform the development of the Plymouth Plan and assist in refr eshing the spatial strategy for Plymouth for the plan period to 2031. There are bot h broad strategic employment land issues that need to be addressed as well as sp ecific healthcare and medical related objectives that need to be considered when addressing the policy review for the Plymouth Plan. In summary: There are two main concentrations of healthcare and medical activity in the City: one in the southern part of the city around t he periphery of the city centre; and a northern cluster at Derriford. This spatial pattern is highly consistent with the Core Strategy objective of a bi -polar economy and demonstrates that the medical and healthcare sector is a key driver for achieving this ambition. The Tamar Science Park in particular has been succe ssful in attracting a large cluster of high profile medical organisations to th e northern regeneration area. Business case studies show that the close pr oximity to Derriford Hospital, the opportunity to collaborate with compa nies with common interests, and the quality of the built environment , have all been important in attracting organisations to locate at the Science P ark. The secondary concentration of healthcare companies further south around the City Centre remains significant and the interests o f those organisations should be safeguarded through the preparation of the Plymo uth Plan. These groupings appear to be made up predominantly of pri mary and specialist healthcare practices, which take advantage of the i ncreased footfall and accessible locations around the city centre within secondary retailing areas and employment locations such as Sutton Harbour. Not all specialist medical practice activities are located within the main activity clusters of Derriford and the edge of City Centre areas. For some private practices a location within the city is suf ficient as they are there to serve the local population of the city and its hint erland in general. There are also examples of individual medical research and pr oduct development companies that are located at other business park l ocations, including Wolseley Close Business Park and Langage Energy Par k. It is anticipated that mapping of public sector NHS premises would follow a broadly similar pattern, with a concentration of sp ecialist secondary medical care at Derriford in particular, supported by a bro ad distribution of primary care facilities serving the communities in which th ey are located. Investor enquiries received during the period 2002 to 2012 shows a steady decline. The healthcare and medical sector only re presented a small proportion of total enquiries during this period (3 %). Over 50% of enquiries to PCC were made from busines ses expanding or relocating from elsewhere in the UK, with smaller n umbers of overseas (9%) and new business enquiries (15%). A broad range of preferences for locations are iden tified by these companies, including city centre sites, local or district cent re locations, business park premises and small offices within residential areas . Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 36 Floorspace requirements also vary markedly, with th e majority (68%) requiring smaller premises typically less than 500 sqm (5,000 sqft). Contrary to what might be expected, the majority of enquirie s did not specify a requirement for specialist floorspace to include la b space, patient treatment facilities, specialised or sterilised environments . The National Health Service is a major employer in Plymouth and Derriford Hospital is a central component of the northern con centration of medical and healthcare activity within the city. Public health care structures are in a period of transition in response to the Government's healt h reform plans and the full implications for the sector can not be predicted. From a spatial planning perspective, a drive to provide routine healthcare closer to or at home is of importance, with central facilities such as the hos pital providing specialist treatments at the regional level. Commissioning st ructures may also introduce further competition in the healthcare sector, with the potential result that further privately operated healthcare centres and c linics seek premises in the city. The interest from Circle Health, albeit on h old at present, is a demonstration of this change. The healthcare sector is viewed as relatively stabl e by property investors, with expectations that rental growth will be maintained in the short to medium term. It is a common view of the regions commercia l property agents that the healthcare property sector will remain an attractiv e prospect due to a combination of the ageing population of the far Sou th West peninsula, increased life expectancy and the ability to secure long leases from prospective tenants. Market commentators have sugg ested there are also potential opportunities for private providers to pa rtner with the NHS Foundation Trusts, with the potential result that e xisting public sector land is a focus for investment in the short term . Plymouth is likely to see investment activity in this area. The strategic employment al locations in the Derriford area are likely to be the focal point for this inve stment activity Employment forecasts have a tendency to be influenc ed by prevailing economic circumstances. The 2006 Employment Land Re view forecast for the healthcare sector of 6,080 jobs over the 20 year pe riod (2006-20026) was in part driven by the optimistic approach taken to gro wth at that time. The 2006 forecast also took a broader definition of the heal thcare sector than the sector as now defined by the Local Economic Strategy which results in a higher absolute number of jobs defined as healthcare and m edical. The 2013-2031 period forecast produced as part of t his addendum paper is much more modest than the 2006 estimate at 967 addi tional jobs . The double dip recession and short term economic outlook creat es uncertainty and the forecasts are policy neutral (i.e.they do not take account of the local aspiration for the sector and its promotion as a key employmen t sector by the City). The estimated floorspace requirement for the sector between 2013-2031 is between 28-31,000 sq metres. The employment land a llocations within the Derriford area at Tamar, Plymouth International, De rriford North West Quadrant and the District Centre are in excess of 9 0,000 sq m which is more than three times the predicted need for the healthc are sector to 2031. There is sufficient employment land at sites in the Derriford area alone to accommodate projected growth in the sector, althoug h in reality not all of this additional space will be required in the northern c luster area, given the profile of this sector and the dispersed nature of the busi nesses across the city. Plymouth City Council Prospects for Plymouth's Priority Economic Sectors Addendum 1: Medical and Healthcare Sector 001 | Issue | 28 February 2013 Page 37 Furthermore, it is likely that a degree of churn wi ll occur within the existing commercial floorspace stock within the City to acco mmodate the demands of the sector, and therefore not all of this forecast space requirement will need to be provided as new employment space. Many of the s maller healthcare practices will seek to utilise vacant space within existing local or district centres, and some may choose to locate within the n ew district centre proposed for Derriford, given the complementary nat ure of surrounding businesses and organisations. Other secondary emplo yment areas or industrial parks across the city that provide adequate parking provision and roadside visibility are also expected to remain attractive t o medical and healthcare companies.
