The authors use a hybrid simulation framework to address the following objectives and challenges: a) reduce and control operating rooms' level of inventory; b) stabilize scrubs' demand and c) improve infection control and prevention of cross-contamination (through scrubs over manipulation and hoarding). Design/methodology/approach The authors adopt a Design Science approach. This methodological approach is used to design, develop, create and evaluate information technology \"artifacts\" (e.g. constructs, models, methods and instantiations) intended to solve organizational problems and make research contributions (Peffers et al., 2007). More specifically, the authors follow the Design Science Research Methodology process model which includes six steps: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. Findings To assess the realistic impacts of implementing an RFID-IoT uniforms' distribution system for managing medical personnel's scrubs in operating rooms, the authors adopted a design science approach and initiated the research by documenting the business case and reviewed the existing literature to build a comparative analysis of existing uniforms' distribution systems. The authors used a hybrid simulation model to assess the impact of three business cases: present mode of operation, implementing smart shelves or the smart distributors. The authors show that smart dispensers allow a greater control on scrubs' utilization while eliminating the cross-contamination of the medical personnel. Practical implications Through this research study, the authors provide hospitals' managers a scientific support for uniforms' (scrubs) distribution process improvement. The authors use a hybrid simulation model to compare innovative solutions for uniforms' distribution systems in the form of \"smart cabinets\" supported by Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)/Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and choose the most appropriate design for the hospital to meet two main challenges: a) inefficiency of uniform replenishment-distribution system and b) noncompliancy with infection control regulations caused by the distribution system. Originality/value From a methodological perspective, this paper addresses concerns from researchers calling quantitative research methods and using case-based research strategy to address IoT issues and assess the system in practice. From a broader point of view, this work confirms the predominant interest of RFID-IoT research work in the arena of supply chain management and logistics as the technology is used for tracking purpose and for monitoring applications. It is also one response to the research community suggesting that \"hospitals should evaluate the medical effectiveness of the new technologies as well as the cost before adoption\".
