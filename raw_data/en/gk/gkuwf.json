A year-and-a-half and countless tests later, Middletown resident Ron Ling received the devastating diagnosis: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as ALS and Lou Gehrig's disease. There is no cure for the neurodegenerative condition, in which muscles waste away until even swallowing and breathing become problems. The average life expectancy after diagnosis is two to five years. A desperate Internet search for potential remedies led Ron and his wife Kris to the Deanna Protocol, a metabolic therapy of natural substances designed by an orthopedic surgeon to help his daughter fight ALS. After two years, the Lings strongly believe it is helping to slow the effects of ALS. \"Has it progressed? Yes. But everyone we started with (at a local support group), they're all gone now,\" said Kris Ling, who has a chemistry degree. \"Ron has a wheelchair, but he's still able to push himself up, shower himself, put his clothes on. Do I think it's made a difference in the quality of his life? Absolutely.\" They're not alone. Ocean Township resident Jim Sintic lost his dad, John Sintic, to ALS in February. But he saw enough from the Deanna Protocol to convince him to spread the word. \"Unfortunately for us, we didn't start the protocol until a full year after he was diagnosed. We didn't know about it,\" Jim Sintic said. \"(The ALS) progressed significantly from the time he was diagnosed until we started the protocol. And we felt like he plateaued for a period of time due to the protocol.\" Both Kris Ling and John Sintic echoed the same sentiment: There was nothing to lose. The supplements are natural substances \u2014 things the body should be producing anyway \u2014 and available over the counter. Deanna Protocol's creator, Dr. Vincent Tedone, freely dispenses the regimen's formula. It's named after his daughter Deanna, who was diagnosed at age 30 in 2007. \"In her eighth year she still walks, she still talks, she still has use of her hands \u2014 though not complete use,\" Tedone said via phone from his Florida home. \"When she went to the Mayo Clinic (in 2007), they gave her two years to live.\" Spreading the word When Tedone embarked on his quest to save his daughter, he focused on boosting her cells' energy. At its core, ALS is a matter of cells dying off. \"I researched all the literature, came up with substances that I thought might work and tried them on my daughter,\" he explained. \"Some worked and some didn't. The ones that worked are naturally occurring substances within the body. The philosophy behind this is similar to the way we treat HIV/AIDS. We haven't found a cure for it, but we're able to keep people alive with a good quality of life.\" Tedone has written a book, \"The Deanna Protocol: Hope for ALS and other Neurological Diseases.\" He's launched a website, [www.winningthefight.org](http://www.winningthefight.org/). There has been some media coverage, but mostly his work has spread by word of mouth. \"What made Dr. Tedone so appealing to people is he has no motivation other than helping his own daughter,\" said Sintic, who worked directly with Tedone as he helped his father take the protocol. \"He's not selling anything. He never pushed a brand. He just wants to help his daughter. I think he's onto something, if he could just catch a break and get a grant or find a university partner.\" Tedone expressed frustration with how little medical industry money goes into treating ALS patients compared to how much is poured into research for a cure. While last summer's Ice Bucket Challenge craze netted the ALS Association more than $100 million, \"we collected $10,000,\" he said. Sintic compared the Deanna Protocol to early AIDS research. \"This is the kind of stuff that used to go on underground before a (widely accepted) treatment came out,\" he said. \"Every little bit helps. It's an evil, evil disease.\" Hope and help Ron Ling is fighting the good fight. Once 250 pounds, he's down to 165. He no longer can speak, but he uses an iPad to communicate. The business he's owned since 1988, Hazlet Electric Company, is still going. He's a 55-year-old father of two, and under his wife's guidance he's taking the protocol supplements dutifully. \"Up until last November he was doing all of it by mouth \u2014 swallowing all those pills,\" Kris Ling said. \"Then he had to switch to a feeding tube, which made it a lot easier for him. He's still on board with it . . . We were just at the pulmonologist and she said his lungs were clear.\" On the first Tuesday of each month, Ron and Kris attend a support group at Riverview Medical Center in Red Bank, run by Joan Dancy and PALS, a nonprofit foundation that aims to improve the lives of ALS patients and their families in Monmouth and Ocean counties. \"Ron is a great guy. Unfortunately the disease is progressing,\" said Kate Sperring, a registered nurse who helps run the support group \u2014 and another one designed specifically for caregivers and family members. \"Some of our families use the Deanna Protocol, some do not. We give them the information.\" Sperring noted that there is one medication formally approved for treating ALS \u2014 Ritulek (also known as Riluzole) \u2014 and \"it only prolongs your life three months.\" The Joan Dancy staff recommends Ritulek, but their main business is support. They offer home visits, guidance, equipment and, perhaps most important, kinship. \"I couldn't survive without their support,\" Kris Ling said. \"They know what to say and how to say it. If you believe in angels on earth, that's what these people are.\" Sperring does not offer an opinion on the Deanna Protocol. \"We don't say yea or nay,\" she said. But she understands the quest for something, anything, that might help. \"There's a lot of good research going on, but stem cells are the way we're going to go,\" she said. \"Our neurologists tell us that's 10 years away. People with ALS don't have 10 years.\" For more information on Joan Dancy and PALS, visit "}
