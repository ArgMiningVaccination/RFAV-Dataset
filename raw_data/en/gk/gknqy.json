Crossing the T's L., the plural of life The name of this magazine encompasses the lives of those who make up the UMMS community, for which it is published. They are students, faculty, staff, alumni, volunteers, benefactors and others who aspire to help this campus achieve national distinction in education, research and public service. University of Massachusetts Medical School The University of Massachusetts Medical School was created in 1962 by an act of the Massachusetts Legislature and today is comprised of three schools. Since accepting its first class in 1970, the School of Medicine has provided students with an accessible, comprehensive and personally rewarding medical education of the highest quality, one which optimally prepares them to excel as physicians. The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, opened in 1979, is a faculty-initiated PhD program that trains scientists in a specialty area with a broad background in the basic medical sciences, in preparation for conducting research with direct relevance to human disease. Opened in 1986, the Graduate School of Nursing, through its master's, post master's, doctoral degree and Graduate Entry Pathway programs, provides professional educa-tion and training for advanced practice nurses within three specialties: adult acute/critical care nurse practitioners, adult ambulatory/community care nurse practitioners and advanced practice nurse educators. Commonwealth Medicine Commonwealth Medicine is UMass Medical School's innovative public service initiative, provid- ing expertise to public sector agencies so they may optimize their efficiency and effectiveness. By offering access to its unparalleled breadth of academic, research, management and clinical resources, Commonwealth Medicine assists agencies to enhance the value and quality of expen-ditures, and improve access and delivery of care to at-risk and uninsured populations. UMass Memorial Foundation The UMass Memorial Foundation, established in May 1998, is the charitable partnership created through a merger of the former University of Massachusetts Medical Center Foundation and the Memorial Foundation. The mission of the Foundation is to support the academic and research enterprises of UMass Medical School and the clinical initiatives of UMass Memorial Health Care. Worcester Foundation for Biomedical Research The Worcester Foundation for Biomedical Research is a nonprofit organization devoted to the support of research and the education and training of tomorrow's scientists at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Founded in 1944 as an independent basic biomedical research institute, with research accomplishments that include the birth control pill and the work that led to in vitro fertilization, the Worcester Foundation merged with UMass Medical School in 1997. UMass Memorial Health Care UMass Memorial Health Care is Central Massachusetts' largest nonprofit health care delivery system, covering the complete health care continuum with teaching hospitals, affiliated com-munity hospitals, free-standing primary care practices, ambulatory outpatient clinics, long-term care facilities, home health agencies, hospice programs, a rehabilitation group and mental health services. UMass Memorial is the clinical partner of the University of Massachusetts Medical School.News and Notes 2 Features 8Grants and Research 21Alumni Report 23 The Last Word 28 Contents Beyond the Routine 13 Programs designed to improve and maintain the health of infants and young people in Central Massachusetts reach the most vulnerable of them in unique and effective ways.Revisiting the Brudnick 8 Investigators at UMass Medical School's Brudnick Institute are pursuing a common interest in addiction while they continue to explore the origins of schizophrenia, affective disorders and dementia.

UMMS Researcher Enhances Gene Silencing Technology 2News and Notes The ability to silence genes by RNA interference (RNAi), co-discovered by UMass Medical School researcher and Howard Hughes Medical Institute In-vestigator Craig C. Mello, PhD, the Blais University Chair in Molecular Medicine, has emerged as one of the most impor-tant advances in biomedical research, giving scientists a method to understand what genes do in the body and a means to interrupt how they direct the creation of proteins that regulate biologic func- tions\u2014theoretically blocking the effects of disease-causing genes. As effective as RNAi has proven to be, some genes are hard to silence. Now, a UMMS research team, led by Tariq M. Rana, PhD, profes-sor of biochemistry & molecular phar-macology and director of the Program in Chemical Biology, has made the genes in question more susceptible to silenc-ing by making the messages they send more readable by the RNAi machinery. Some of those messages are easy to read, like a memo typed on a fl at piece of paper, while others are harder to see, as if the memo were folded and placed in an envelope. Dr. Rana's lab developed a way for the RNAi tools to \"open\" the envelope, then read the message inside. If the message matched the one the RNAi tool was trying to silence, it was destroyed. \"We are pleased that this concept seems to work in a dramatic way,\" said Rana. \"By improving the target accessibility of the messengers the genes make, we increased the silencing effect from just two percent to 65 percent in the targets we studied. That's enough to make a difference.\" The results of the experiments were recently published in the journal Nature Structural & Molecular Biology. New PhD Program in Clinical & Population Health Research Attracts Established Scientists Tariq Rana, PhD, and his lab have increased the effectiveness of RNAi gene silencing from two percent to 65 percent in their targets. The rst courses of the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences' new PhD Pro-gram in Clinical & Population Health Research (CPHR) are underway this fall, and, judging by the backgrounds of its stu- dents, the program is attracting a variety of established scientists as they embark on the next phases of their careers. The CPHR program prepares students to conduct research on issues of health care access, screening, treatment, quality and outcomes. It develops researchers with strong core competencies in statistics, epidemiology and research method-ologies applicable to clinical trials and population health studies, and has a speci c emphasis on public sector issues and vulnerable populations. Mayra Tisminetzky and Ginny Briggs are two examples of active research-ers whose knowledge and skills will be broadened by the new program. Tisminetzky practiced psychiatry in her native Buenos Aires before she came to the United States with her husband, a psychiatrist at Worcester State Hospital. She began work as a research assistant at the New York State Psychiatric Insti-tute, where she helped design protocols for clinical trials and collaborated on research into the gender differences in responses to antidepressants. \"I was Associate Dean Carole Upshur, EdD, established the CPHR faculty, curriculum and program policies and contributed to recruitment efforts for the rst class, whose members are now taking courses.3 UMMS Advances Potential New Approach in Cancer Therapy Calling it \"an exciting development in an area of great need,\" Dario C. Altieri, MD, UMMS professor and chair of Cancer Biol-ogy and director of the UMass Memorial Cancer Center, along with colleagues in Italy and at the Mof tt Cancer Center in Florida, announced the development of a molecular anti-cancer agent, called shepherdin, that selectively kills tumor cells while sparing normal cells nearby. Shepherdin was described in a study published in the journal Cancer Cell. In 1997, Dr. Altieri discovered survivin, a protein abundant in cancer cells, which contributes to uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells and tumor growth. He sought a way to interfere with the function of survivin and its partner protein\u2014Heat shock protein 90, or Hsp90\u2014that chaperones survivin to ensure its du-rability and its delivery into cells. He engineered the compound shepherdin to bind to Hsp90 and block its ability to work with survivin, resulting in destruction of cancer cells and inhibition of tumor growth. The anti-tumor activity of shepherdin does not affect normal tissues and organs, and prolonged use of shepher-din in animal models is tolerated with no signs of toxicity. These features may make shepherdin an attractive drug for targeted cancer therapy. Altieri, noting that traditional cancer treatments do not distin- guish between cancerous and non-cancerous cells, said, \"We have learned so much about how cancer works and yet we have few targeted therapies for patients. This may be a very effec-tive model through which therapeutic agents can seek out and destroy only the malfunctioning, cancerous cells, leaving normal, healthy cells unaffected.\" always interested in combining my clini-cal practice with the development of a deeper knowledge in research,\" Tismi-netzky said. \"It was during my work in New York that I realized the importance of epidemiology to developing a career that joined clinical and statistical work and led to a deeper comprehension of mental illness.\" Tisminetzky earned her master's in public health from UMMS. Ginny Briggs' vast knowledge of epide- miology comes from her master's course work at UMass Amherst and experience at Liberty Mutual Research Center in Hopkinton, where she has been involved in several studies of workplace injury. The CPHR program will prepare her to explore a new focus in her research, that of the health-related problems of people with spina bifuda and other related dis-abilities. \"From orthopedics to learning disabilities, I am anxious to begin the search for answers that will ultimately help this population live longer, health-ier and happier lives,\" wrote Briggs in her personal essay when applying to the CPHR program. \"The program offers a unique curriculum that will...allow an opportunity to participate in an intel- lectually rigorous pursuit of the deeper understanding of epidemiological sci-ence and research methods needed to accomplish my goals.\" Briggs and Tisminetzky join ve other students, including two MD/PhD students, who will start CPHR doctoral course work after completing two years of medical school. \"We're truly excited by the caliber of this class and by the potential of these students to expand clinical research at UMass Medical School,\" said Associate Dean Carole C. Upshur, EdD.Dario Altieri, MD, and colleagues engineered shepherdin, represented in red in the image above as it binds to and inhibits the tumor-facilitating protein Hsp90. Shepherdin kills tumor cells while sparing nearby normal cells, making it a potentially attractive drug for targeted therapy.Of ce of Technology Management Welcomes New Executive Director Fitchburg-native James P. McNamara, PhD, an experienced leader in biomedical technology development and commercialization, recently joined UMMS as the new executive director of the Of ce of Technology Management (OTM). \"I'm happy to come home to Massachusetts at a time when so much world-class research is happening right here at the Medical School,\" he said. In his new role, Dr. McNamara will lead the UMMS team that works to commercially develop the many innovations produced by faculty and staff, as well as secure funded partnerships that support the work of the research enterprise. McNamara came to UMMS from his position as senior director of business development for the Biosciences Divi-sion at SRI International, the prestigious California-based research and technol-ogy development organization originally af liated with Stanford University. After earning his bachelor's degree in chem-istry from the College of the Holy Cross and both a master's in organic chemistry and a doctorate in medicinal chemistry from the University of Connecticut, Mc-Namara headed west for a postdoctoral fellowship in the bio-organic chemistry program at SRI, staying on after com-pleting his fellowship. He eventually rose to direct the business development and intellectual property functions for SRI's Pharmaceutical Drug Discovery Division and was most recently respon-sible for a division with annual revenue of $30 million. 4In ndings that may lead to a more cost-effective, easier-to- produce biologic that can be given to people who have been bitten by rabid or potentially rabid animals, a team of scientists at UMass Medical School's Massachusetts Biologic Laborato-ries (MBL) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has developed a novel human monoclonal antibody called HuMAB 17 C7 that can neutralize multiple variants of rabies virus. Details of the new antibody and the results of the tests\u2014in which the antibody neutralized 25 different rabies viruses in culture\u2014were presented in June at an international conference in Kiev, Ukraine. Six to 10 million people worldwide are exposed to rabies every year and as many as 70,000 die. Ideally, individuals exposed to rabies receive a vaccine regimen that includes ra-bies vaccine and human rabies immune globulin (hRIG). But because hRIG is derived from human blood, it is expensive and often in short supply, especially in developing countries. Researchers are hopeful that HuMAB 17 C7 addresses both the supply and side effects issues since monoclonal antibod-ies can be produced in large quantities at much lower costs than blood products and are easier to distribute and store. \"We were pleased to join with the CDC to search for a better and more accessible product for people who are exposed to rabies, which continues to be a major health problem around the world,\" said Donna Ambrosino, MD, director of the MBL and professor of pediatrics at UMMS. Looking ahead, the team at MBL and CDC is evaluating potential collaborations to prepare for a phase 1 clinical trial to test the safety and tolerance of the antibody in otherwise healthy people. A Better Solution for Rabies Treatment Through MBL/CDC PartnershipNews and Notes James McNamara, PhD, has returned to Central Massachusetts from a position in business development at SRI International, originally af liated with Stanford University. UMass Medical School students are trained to be compassionate caregivers to their patients and advocates for the communities they serve. Their advocacy and compassion were evident in their responses to victims of Hurricane Ka- trina, and, closer to home, their wishes for UMMS Chancellor and Dean Aaron Lazare's speedy recovery from recent surgery. At their annual Arts Night (left), students gathered donations to the American Red Cross toward a goal of $10,000 by Thanksgiving. At right, they gathered with members of the faculty to send a special message to Dr. Lazare.UMMS Students Say 'We Care' UMMS Study Reveals Marker for Alzheimer's Disease Investigators from the UMMS Depart-ment of Neurology have discovered that levels of a protein in spinal fl uid that is a known marker for Alzheimer's disease are abnormally low at least four to 12 years before the expected onset of symptoms in a group of subjects with a gene mutation that gives them an almost 100 percent risk of developing the early-onset familial form of the disease. The study, conducted with colleagues from the University of Toronto and called \"Familial Alzheimer's disease: Decreases in CSF A\u00df 42 levels precede cognitive decline,\" appeared in the July 25 issue of Neurology. Researchers have previously determined that the earliest detectable signs of the brain pathology in Alzheimer's patients are deposits of amyloids such as the protein A\u00df 42, which may interfere with normal brain function. The most com-mon early-onset familial form of the disease is caused by an inherited muta-tion in a gene identi ed as PS1, which increases the level of A\u00df 42 in the brain, with a concurrent decrease in the level in the spinal fl uid. While such purely genetic cases of Alzheimer's disease comprise perhaps ve percent of the total number of cases, the expectation is that treatments for this form of the disease will eventually apply to all forms as well. This new nding pro- vides a window of opportunity for researchers to investigate the impact of therapies in the years before such high-risk individuals might develop symptoms of the disease. The study was designed and conducted by Majaz Moonis, MD, associate profes-sor of neurology, and Daniel A. Pollen, MD, professor of neurology. \"We were surprised to nd the same low levels of A\u00df 42, seen in individuals with advanced disease, in people many years younger than the age at which they could expect symptoms to appear,\" noted Dr. Moonis. \"This nding should lead to numerous clinical trials to identify interventions which will correct abnormalities in the metabolism of A\u00df 42 long before symp- toms would otherwise occur, potentially delaying the onset of symptoms and improving the length and quality of life for individuals faced with early-onset familial Alzheimer's.\" 5\" We Care \" 'Pulling Together' for New Emergency Department Cancer Walk Reaps Thousands in Walkers and Funds 6The annual Walk to Cure Cancer, held Sunday, September 25, 2005, brought a record 10,000 walkers to the UMass Medi-cal School campus and approximately $800,000 to the coffers that help sup-port cancer research programs at UMMS. Members of the Department of Pediatrics walked with teams of patients and their families this year, including Ali and Dad's Army (above), led by team captain Anna Ling Pierce; Greg's Gang, with captains Chris and David Mandara; Jessica's Journey, led by Marion Mauro; Eddie's Echelon, with Jen and Ed Urbanowski; and Drew's Crew, captained by Nancy Stassi.News and Notes UMass Memorial Medical Center's $40 million Emergency Care Campaign to support the state-of-the-art emergency facilities currently under construction overlooking Lake Quinsigamond on the University Campus was of cially launched at a gala on June 29. The campaign features a \"pulling together\" theme that uses rowing as a metaphor for the teamwork encouraged amongst hospital leadership, staff and the Central New England community. The kick-off event, emceed by WCVB-TV news anchor Liz Brunner, was hosted by John O'Brien, president and CEO of UMass Memorial Health Care; Chancellor and Dean Aaron Lazare; Sumner Tilton Jr., chair of the UMass Memorial Board of Trustees; and Arthur Pappas, MD, the Emergency Care Campaign chair. The highlight of the evening was the formal announcement of a $10 million gift from the Remillard Family Foundation, a gift that underscores the sentiment behind the campaign theme and con-tinues the momentum created in January by Commerce Bank and Trust Chairman David \"Duddie\" Massad, who gave $12.5 millionto the campaign. On behalf of the foundation, Arthur Remillard Jr. said, \"It is our hope that this gift will contribute to the im- portant relationship between this remarkable medical center and the people of the region who have come to rely on UMass Memorial.\" CEO O'Brien called the gift a \"gesture that will resonate for generations.\" In recognition of the leadership gift, the main entrance and lobby of the Medical Center's University Campus will be named the Remillard Family Pavilion. At the June campaign kick-off gala, Arthur Remillard III, a director of the Remillard Family Foundation and a UMass Memorial F oundation board member, received a water color painting representing the new main entrance and lobby of the Medical Center's University Campus\u2014the Remillard Family Pavilion.UMass Medical School's sixth annual Investiture Ceremony, held at the Hoagland-Pincus Conference Center on the Shrews-bury Campus on June 4, celebrated the extraordinary research of faculty and the generosity of supporters who champion their work. Three faculty members were formally invested into endowed professorships and the establishment of two new endowments was announced. Azra Raza, MD, professor of medicine and chief of the Division of Hematology/Oncology, was invested as the Gladys Smith Martin Chair in Oncology, established in 2001 to honor the late Gladys Smith Martin, sister of Worcester Foundation for Biomedical Research benefactor H. Arthur Smith. Dr. Raza was recognized for her dedication to the cause of treating and curing cancer. Peter E. Newburger, MD, professor of pediatrics, cancer biology and molecular genetics & microbiology and direc-tor of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology for the Department of Pediatrics, was invested as the Ali and John Pierce Chair in Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, established in memory of Ali Pierce, who succumbed to liver cancer in 1996, and her father John Pierce, who died less than a year later while rais-ing funds in Ali's name. Dr. Newburger is well-known for his dedication to the health and well-being of young people and provided compassionate care to Ali. Also honored was Linda F. Weinreb, MD, professor and chair of family medicine & community health, who was selected as the rst Joy McCann Professor for Women in Medicine for her role as a mentor, advisor and leader. The three-year professorship is funded by the Joy McCann Foundation and honors female fac-ulty for excellence in medical education leadership, research, patient care and community service. The two new endowments announced at the ceremony are the Gretchen Stone Cook Chair in Biomedical Sciences, which is to be held by an outstanding faculty member chosen by the UMMS Chancellor/Dean without restriction, and the Leo P. and Teresa M. LaChance Chair in Mental Retardation and Behav-ioral Health, which will support research into the causes and treatment of mental retardation, pending University of Massa-chusetts Board of Trustee approval. Refl ecting on the increase in the number of endowed posi- tions from just seven in 1997 to 28 today, Chancellor Aaron Lazare said, \"This dramatic growth is a clear indication of the maturity the University has attained along its path to national distinction in research, education and public service.\" Investiture Honors Researchers, Physicians; Provides Forum for Announcement of New Endowments 7The three esteemed scientists and physicians who received endowed professorships at the ceremony are (front row) Peter Newburge r, MD, Linda Weinreb, MD, and Azra Raza, MD.

BishopRevisiting the Brudnick Investigators at UMass Medical School's Brudnick Institute are pursuing a common interest in addiction while they continue to explore the origins of schizophrenia, affective disorders and dementia.Long considered a consequence of personal weakness, addiction to drugs or alcohol has historically been viewed as a social rather than a medical problem. But while personality, peer pressure, stress and curiosity infl uence the decision to experiment, these fac-tors become less important over time as the physiological effects of drugs and alcohol cause profound changes in the brain. Many scientists now believe that these signi cant alterations to brain chemistry and function\u2014rather than social factors\u2014are what make the treat-ment of addiction so challenging. The scienti c faculty of UMass Medical School's Irving S. and Betty Brudnick Neuropsychiatric Research Institute believe that research into the neuro-biology of addiction is critical to the development of successful therapies that can block the reinforcing charac-teristics of drugs and alcohol, eliminate an addict's craving and even mediate the neurological changes associated with abuse. Led by Director Steven N. Treistman, PhD, professor of psychiatry and neurobiology, Brudnick Institute faculty are pursuing a common interest in addiction. In addition to disease-re-lated research, they are also researching normal neurological function and basic biological processes with the hope that this research will provide the basis for understanding psychiatric disorders. The Brudnick Institute opened in May 2000 for the comprehensive study of the brain and behavior through basic and clinical research, and was made possible in great part by the generosity of Betty Brudnick and her late husband Irving, whose struggle with depression inspired a dedication to neuroscience research. \"Addiction is a psychiatric disorder.\" Dr. Treistman said. \"Although it is somewhat dif cult not to blame addicts for their actions, if you take the reasons 9 Brudnick Institute faculty are known for their range of expertise and collaborative spirit, according to Director Steven Treistman, PhD. They Melikian, PhD; of the Center for Comparative Neuroimaging; CCNI Director Craig Ferris, PhD; Paul Gardner, PhD; and Schahram Akbarian, PhD.10why someone rst tried a drug out of the equation, you nd that there are signi - cant reasons to treat addiction as an ill-ness.\" One is that the brain and nervous system are changed in response to expo-sure to a drug. In addition, research has demonstrated that there may be a genetic predisposition toward substance abuse. When naturally activated\u2014for example, through exercise\u2014the brain's reward systems produce changes ranging from slight mood elevation to euphoria, di-recting an individual's behavior toward future natural rewards. However, addic-tive drugs work in much the same way: they activate brain reward mechanisms directly and chemically alter the natural functioning of these systems, often lead-ing to compulsive drug use. Brudnick Institute investigator Haley E. Melikian, PhD, assistant professor of psychiatry and biochemistry & molecular pharmacology, explores how addictive drugs change the brain at the molecular level. She studies neurotransmitter trans-porters, a family of proteins that regulate the chemicals that transmit information across the junction (synapse) that sepa-rates one nerve from another. Drugs such as cocaine, amphetamine and Ecstasy target these transport-ers. For example, cocaine inhibits the uptake of dopamine, a neurotransmitter involved in the brain's reward systems, by blocking the transporter; the re-sult\u2014an abnormal buildup of dopamine in the synapse that produces the elation associated with cocaine use. Dopamine has garnered particular atten- tion from researchers because of its role in the regulation of mood, motivation and reward. Because of this, the study of dopamine and addiction often has bear-ing on the study of other mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression. A practicing clinician and basic scien-tist, the Brudnick Institute's Schahram Akbarian, MD, PhD, associate professor of psychiatry, is interested in the long-term changes that dopamine and other neurotransmitters create in neuronal gene expression and how drugs induce chemical changes in the brain. Many of these critical changes take place in the portion of the cell nucleus that contains DNA, affecting gene ex-pression and the process of DNA repair. Dr. Akbarian's lab examines changes in the cell nucleus after administration of stimulant drugs. \"Genetics can only give so much infor- mation,\" Akbarian explained. \"We need to look at the changes that can result in psychosis and addiction.\" Like Akbarian, Treistman is interested in the neurological changes wrought by drugs of abuse, speci cally the effect of alcohol on the brain and the long-term consequences of alcohol consumption. Because alcohol affects many molecules within the brain, identifying a speci c molecular target for it has been more dif cult than for drugs such as cocaine and heroin, for which targets are less In the Treistman laboratory, Research Assistant Professor of Neurobiology Gilles Martin, PhD, has perfected techniques to recor d electrical signals from individual dendrites of neurons (seen in magni ed image below) isolated from the reward pathway of the rat brain. This knowledge may be vital in the development of therapeutic treatments for craving and addiction.abundant, and better de ned. Treistman has centered his research on \"ion chan-nels\"\u2014brain proteins that are critical for normal brain function\u2014that may provide insight into alcohol's action on the brain. The Treistman lab has found that prolonged exposure to alcohol has two effects on these channels\u2014 rst, they become less sensitive to alcohol, and second, channels located in the cell membrane are internalized (where they are nonfunctional), so more alcohol is required to produce the same response. The adapted brain is now \"dysfunction-al\" in the absence of alcohol, possibly contributing to relapse. Treistman hopes that by de ning the action of alcohol on channels, researchers can develop a therapeutic agent to block the craving that accompanies alcohol addiction. Neuroimaging is also playing a vital role in the research into addiction. With the imaging technology and faculty exper-tise of the Center for Comparative Neuroimaging (CCNI), a collaborative effort of the Brudnick Institute and Worcester Polytechnic Institute, addic-tion research can be visualized, not just studied at the cellular and molecular levels. Researchers can examine a drug's pattern of activation globally over the en-tire brain, identifying those areas that are speci cally affected by drugs of abuse. CCNI Director Craig F. Ferris, PhD, professor of psychiatry and physiology, is interested in both the short- and long-term effects of these drugs and conducts a number of developmental studies that are shedding light on their impact. A unique strength of non-invasive imaging is the ability of investigators to identify and locate brain activity without harm-ing the organisms with which they are working; scientists can also detect the changes wrought by drug use and addic-tion over time. In recent years, for example, the use of Ecstasy has become more pervasive, par-ticularly among young people who view the substance as a harmless \"club drug.\" To determine the cumulative impact of Ecstasy on the brain, Dr. Ferris and colleagues are conducting a National Institute on Drug Abuse-funded study, based on research that found Ecstasy users typically take two doses on both Friday and Saturday evenings. Investi-gators reproduce this usage pattern and image both the effect of the drug shortly after use and the organism's social and cognitive behavior during the remainder of the week. \"Imaging is another powerful tool in the study of addiction,\" said Ferris. \"Each investigative tool, whether it examines action at the molecular, cellular or sys-temic level, is an important part of the overall effort to understand the physi-ological and behavioral changes that result from addiction. That is where the Brudnick Institute allows for the highest level of integration.\" 11Brudnick Institute research into the neurobiology of addiction is critical to the development of therapies that can block the reinforcing characteristics of drugs and alcohol, eliminate craving and mediate the neurological changes associated with abuse. \"Addiction is a psychiatric disorder,\" says Director Steven Treistman, PhD (above). The CCNI's non-invasive imaging equipment allows researchers to detect the changes wrought by drug use and addiction over time.12Although the interest in addiction is a common one among Brudnick Institute faculty, it is far from the only area of study. Current investigations are underway to identify the genes and mutations that underlie schizophrenia, depression and other affective disorders, and dementia, while others are continuing to determine how biological and environmental factors influence the onset of mood disorders such as fear and anxiety. As a large segment of the American population ages, Alzheimer's disease has evolved into a major area of interest in the research community, and Brudnick Institute investigators want to uncover the molecular mechanisms for Alzheimer's disease as well as its risk and protecting factors. Professor of Psychiatry Evgeny I. Rogaev, MD, PhD, is interested in the regulation of proteins called \"presenilins.\" Presenilins, which were discovered by Dr. Rogaev and his col- leagues, are critically important genes in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease; they bear mutations that are evident in the early onset of the disorder. Rogaev is pursuing the theory that it is not only these mutations, but also the regulation of the activ-ity of these presenilins that may modulate the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Rogaev is also searching for specific genes and DNA variations that may be risk factors for schizophrenia, depression and other diseases of abnormal behavior. Associate Professor of Psychiatry Paul D. Gardner, PhD, has focused his research on the molecular analysis of ion channels, with implications for neurological development in a variety of disease states. Ion channels play a central role in signal genera-tion within the nervous system, and disruption of this signaling can lead to severe consequences in terms of neuronal func-tion. Dr. Gardner is particularly interested in understanding the molecular events that control the expression of a particular class of ion channels that have been implicated in a variety of brain processes and pathologies, including nicotine addiction, learn-ing and memory, aging, anxiety, nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, schizophrenia, analgesia and dementia. \"With our focus on addiction, and research on such diverse areas as neuronal development, Alzheimer's disease, obesity, schizophrenia and mood disorders, the true strength of the Brudnick Institute and its faculty is our range of expertise, cou-pled with a synergistic and collaborative spirit,\" said Brudnick Institute Director Steven Treistman, PhD. The late Irving Brudnick and his wife Betty (above) contributed $2.5 million to help fund construction of the Brudnick Institute, one of only a handful of facilities in the country devoted to studying the biological causes of mental illness. Mr. Brudnick said at the time of the Institute's opening in 2000: \"Betty and I have long wished to establish such a facility that would have as its mission the objectives of not only seeking the causes of and cures for mental illness, but also advancing the latest in effective treatments for patients and their families.\"FPOMind Matters at the Brudnick Institute 13 13 By Lynn C. BorellaBeyond the Routine Programs designed to improve and maintain the health of infants and young people in Central Massachusetts reach the most vulnerable of them in unique and effective ways. There are a number of UMass Medical School and UMass Memorial programs designed to improve and maintain the health of infants, children and teenagers in Central Massachusetts that go far beyond routine studies and visits to the doctor. These programs reach into the community, exemplifying the definition of public service by promoting public health and educational awareness in distinctive ways. The following highlights three such initiatives.Mariann Manno, MD, is co-principal investigator for the Worcester site of the national Injury Free Coalition for Kids, an organ ization dedicated to reducing childhood injuries, the leading cause of childhood death and hospitalization in the United States. Dr. Manno holds a scale mode l of one of the Coalition's most popular teaching tools, the mobile Safety Streets museum (pictured here and on page 16). The life-size museum on wheels can be driven into any parking lot to unfold into a mini-town that promotes safety behaviors to children. 1414Confronting the challenge of infant mortality What's behind the higher than predicted mortality rate of children under the age of 1 in Central Massachusetts? It has re-mained above both the state and national averages for more than a decade, according to the Commonwealth's Department of Pub-lic Health. This galvanized a group of community agencies and advocates, including faculty and clinicians from UMass Medical School and UMass Memorial Health Care, who came together in the mid-1990s to nd answers. In doing so, they formed the foundation for today's Worcester Infant Mortality Reduction Task Force. The Task Force's recent ndings have it poised to make a signi cant impact on the city's youngest residents. \"Infant mortality is, to many, a refl ection of the health of a community and, therefore, of great concern to us,\" said Marianne E. Felice, MD, professor and chair of the UMMS Department of Pediatrics and chair of the Task Force. \"My initial thought wh en I became chair of the Task Force in 2002 was that we had to nd answers to two predominant questions: Why are our rates higher than predicted and who is dying?\" The Task Force began by averaging statistics in three-year blocks rather than on an annual basis to improve data collection. (While the rate of infant mortality is higher than predicted, one death can raise the rate signi cantly: In 2002, the rate in Worcester was 8.8 deaths per 1,000 children younger than 1 versus 4.9 in Massa-chusetts and 7.0 in the United States.) Members also looked at the known risk factors for infant mortality\u2014being a smoker, a teenager, a single mother and/or poor\u2014and were taken aback when it turned out that these risk factors did not apply to the population of women whose babies were dying. Finally, Task Force member Dale B. Magee, MD, MPH, clinical assistant professor of obstetrics & gynecology, single-handedly exam-ined each death certi cate of an infant from the region who died before age 1. From this data, the Task Force determined that the majority of infants who died in sample year 2003 were in their rst month of life and resided in Worcester. In addition, many of these babies had been born to immigrant women from Western Africa \u2014pre- dominantly Ghana. The Task Force organized focus groups of Ghanaian women of child-bearing age to try to understand the high rate of infant death. While these focus groups were fruitful, Dr. Felice\u2014who presented the Task Force's ndings to the Health Committee of the Worcester City Council at the close of 2004\u2014now believes that a full-scale scienti c study is needed to analyze the heart-wrenching problem. And, she is turning to the Ghanaian community for insight. \"Whatever we do, we have to attack this problem in many different ways and get out the message that the best way to healthy babies is to ensure that women are healthy before they become pregnant. This is not just a challenge for the Task Force, or for a subset of women, but also for the community at large.\" Dr. Felice (pictured) believes that a full-scale scientific study is needed to analyze the heart-wrenching problem [of infant mortality]. \"This is not just a challenge for the Task Force, or for a subset of women, but also for the community at large.\" 15The state's Department of Social Services (DSS) requires that every child entering foster care have a medical exam within seven days of entering a new home and a full evaluation within 30 days. But many children don't receive these exams for several reasons, including unavailability of previous medical records, transportation and child care concerns and dif culty scheduling timely medical appointments. Prompted by this lack of medical attention given to foster children\u2014arguably some of the most vulnerable of pediatric patients\u2014Linda D. Sagor, MD, MPH, associate professor of pediatrics and director of General Pediatrics at UMass Memorial Medical Center, became impassioned by their plight. \"According to DSS, only 11 percent of these children were receiving the health care screenings required in 2001; even fewer were receiving dental or mental health consultations,\" said Dr. Sagor. \"This made me wonder why we couldn't develop a system that met the needs of these kids and made sure that, at the very minimum, we started their health care in foster care the right way.\" In her capacity as chair of the Foster Care Committee for the Massachusetts Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Sagor met with many concerned individuals in the Worcester community. Their commitment, coupled with signi cant logis- tic and philanthropic support from the Children's Leadership Council of United Way of Central Massachusetts, Fleet Bank, Allmerica, Fallon Community Health Plan, UnumProvident and the UMMS Of ce of Community Programs, produced the Foster Children Evaluation Services Clinic (FaCES), which opened at UMass Memorial in fall 2003. FaCES\u2014an ongoing collaboration of the Department of Pedi-atrics, the Of ce of Community Programs, DSS, and the Mas- sachusetts Department of Medical Assistance\u2014provides foster children up to age 11 with a repository to house their medical records, as well as a clinic, staffed by Dr. Sagor and Heather For-key, MD, for evaluations and screenings that promote consistent and streamlined health care. All children under age three are re-ferred to the UMass Memorial Medical Center Early Intervention and Family Support Program. Children over three are referred for mental health and dental evaluation and treatment. Labora-tory evaluations are also completed and immunizations updated as needed. \"A key bene t of the FaCES program is that all information, including previous medical information and immunization records, is kept at the clinic. A copy is sent to the primary care physician who will follow the child while in foster care,\" said Sagor. \"Our clinic also addresses dental and behavioral and developmental issues, and that's really important to this population.\" Sagor particularly credits the work of Ta\u00edna Pab\u00f3n, the adminis- trative coordinator of the program's operation. \"Ta\u00edna is really a case manager for these kids, with responsibilities that range from nding missing medical records to providing toys for the children who attend their rst exams.\" The UMass Center for Adoption Research is conducting an eval- uation of the clinic to study the program's success in meeting its objectives. Sagor hopes that this analysis will quantify how the clinic is ful lling its mission and lead to expansion of services to adolescents in foster care. She also hopes that the program will eventually be replicated statewide. \"Wouldn't it be great that it started with UMass Medical School?\" Sagor enthused. As part of her daily pediatric practice, Linda Sagor, MD, MPH, sees many patients, including four-year-old Bobby Duquette of Sh rewsbury. She and many health care and community partners developed the FaCES program to ensure that the state's foster children, arguably some of the most v ulnerable of patients, receive the comprehensive care they deserve, as well. 1516Keeping kids safe through education Injury is the leading cause of childhood death and hospitaliza- tion in the United States. Each year in Worcester alone, hun-dreds of children under age 19 are injured seriously enough to require medical treatment. Michael P. Hirsh, MD, joined UMMS and UMass Memorial ve years ago with an aim to address these statistics through education. Armed with experience at two Pitts-burgh hospitals, the pedi-atric trauma surgeon set out to establish an Injury Free Coalition for Kids in the region that would pro-vide educational aware-ness programs designed to keep kids safe. \"The concept of wearing seat belts was foreign 25 years ago; it took lots of education and legislation to make it an accepted practice. That's the kind of long-term focus on education about injury prevention that I wanted to initiate in Massachusetts,\" explained Hirsh, a professor of surgery and pediatrics at UMMS. The Injury Free Coalition for Kids is a nationwide organization of hospital-based injury prevention programs aimed at reducing the number and severity of childhood injuries by providing education to parents and caregivers about health hazards, eliminating dangers in the community and providing children with free or low-cost social activities led by adult role models. The Coalition currently has 40 sites in cities through-out the country, all supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation; Worcester was the 15 th site, designated in 2001. Hirsh works collaboratively with co-principal investigator Mari- ann M. Manno, MD, clinical associate professor of pediatrics and emergency medicine, and recruits medical students and resi-dents to make the Injury Free Coalition for Kids a success for the community. Following are several highlights of the program: \u007f Goods for Guns - Established in 2002 to promote gun safety, this two-day annual program gives the public an opportunity to turn in operable rearms to the local police department in exchange for a gift certi cate redeemable at retail stores. Over the last three years, the program, sponsored by Wal-Mart, has collected about 800 rearms. \"The purpose is not to be anti- gun, but instead to get unlocked, loaded, improperly stored guns out of homes where there are children,\" explained Dr. Manno. \"In addition, Goods for Guns offers us tremendous op-portunity to raise community awareness about gun violence.\" \u007f Ski Helmets - Initiated in 2004, this effort to promote helmet use among skiers was galvanized by a teenage patient cared for at the Medical Center who suffered a severe head injury. Manno created a video incorporating footage taken by the child's family\u2014documenting his ordeal from the ED through rehabilitation\u2014that is mailed to ski schools, along with offers to speak to students about helmet use and safety on the slopes. \u007f Safety Streets - This mobile museum is based on a stationary exhibit established by Hirsh in Pittsburgh. Developed with the assistance of a bioengineer from the UMMS Department of Surgery, as well as funding from corporate and public sponsors, the mobile unit is pulled by a school bus and can drive into any parking lot to unfold into a mini-town that promotes 40 safety behaviors, including pedestrian and bike safety. Another feature of the \"street\" is Safety Home , which teaches children how to avoid injuries such as burns, furniture tip-overs and stairway falls. \"One of the hallmarks of this program is that it's very visible,\" Hirsh explained. \"It 'puts a face' on what injury-free is all about. We're hoping it will take off and be a model for other Injury Free sites nationwide.\" In addition to these and many other programs offered through the Coalition, Hirsh and Manno are teaching injury preven-tion as a model of preventive medicine to rst-year medical students through a standardized clerkship. \"Injuries kill more children under 21 than all other causes combined, yet they are considered 'accidents' rather than a preventable, public health concern,\" said Manno. \"These programs give us endless oppor-tunities to teach patients and the public about risky behaviors and ways to prevent injury.\" Michael Hirsh, MD, brought the educa- tional programs of the national Injury Free Coalition for Kids to Worcester. 1617 By Andrea L. BadrigianCrossing the T's Discoveries at UMass Medical School reveal the complexity of the human immune response to infection and drive new strategies for treatment and vaccination. 1718 18Liisa Selin, PhD, (below) and Professor that infection- ghting CD8+ T-cells speci c for one virus can become activated during infection with an unrelated virus, a discovery that changed the elds of immunology and virology. This \"cross-reactivity\" of T-cells, as well as the se- quence of infections over time, Dr. Selin later found, plays a key role in whether an outcome is immunity or sickness. About two weeks after fall orientation at UMass Medi- cal School's sister campus in Amherst\u2014and at colleges and universities around the country\u2014the symptoms start to show in the student body: severe fatigue, headache, sore throat, chills, fever, muscle aches. Like the colors of autumn, acute infectious mononucleosis has arrived: swollen lymph nodes, jaundice, a measles-like rash and soreness in the abdomen due to an enlarged spleen. Though a miserable experience, the \"kissing disease\" still provokes snickers and rolling of the eyes as it symbolizes a rite of passage for many college students. But for researchers at UMMS involved in a National Institutes of Health program project grant, the onset of \"mono\" season brings fresh opportunity to analyze human antiviral immune responses, particularly those to Epstein-Barr virus, the causative agent of acute infectious mononucleosis. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is one of the largest of the viruses to infect humans, with over 200 genes (as compared to, for example, HIV, which has only nine genes). Over 90 percent of the world's population acquires EBV at some point in their lives. EBV is classi ed by virologists as \"persistent\" because it remains in the body's B lymphocytes\u2014one of the immune system's groups of infection- ghting white blood cells\u2014after a person's rst exposure. Yet, the title of the NIH grant at UMMS, \"Evolution and Main- tenance of Memory CD8+ T-cells,\" reveals something intrigu-ing: There is a key dimension to this immune response that has valuable implications for the treatment of infection and the development of vaccines. The current study of mono in students at UMass Amherst builds on discoveries at UMass Medical School that have revolutionized the elds of immunology and virology. The research, led by Liisa Selin, PhD, Katherine Ruiz de Luzuriaga, MD, and Alan Rothman, MD, is particularly excit-ing because it addresses one of the oldest puzzles of the immune system: how your body recognizes an infectious substance and orchestrates a response. Immune system cells\u2014the B-cells and T-cells and a host of others\u2014each have a highly speci c origin and purpose, but all work together to help an organism recognize and ght infections. T-cells are a type of white blood cell, that, like B-cells, are born in the bone marrow. T-cells then migrate from the marrow to mature in the thymus gland, after which T-cells can respond directly to the part of an infectious agent called an antigen, or they can help B-cells to produce antibodies. CD8+ T-cells, in particular, play an important role in antiviral immunity by at-tacking and clearing virus-infected cells. \"The original theory about CD8+ T-cells and how they saw anti- gens was that when you had an infection, your immune system generated T-cells that were very, very speci c for the original antigen they saw,\" explained Dr. Selin, an associate professor of pathology. So speci c, in fact, that it was widely held that the CD8+ T-cells retained a \"memory\" to react to that infection and that antigen alone. \"So if the infection was fl u, then the T-cells should only be reactivated if you had fl u again, and those T-cells 19 would only work against fl u, in a lock and key fashion.\" When Selin arrived at UMMS in 1991, she began a collaboration with Professor of Pathology Raymond Welsh, PhD, who had recently discovered that he could activate the memory CD8+ T-cells for one type of infection in a mouse by infecting it with a second, unrelated, virus. \"This was surprising,\" said Selin, as the nding went against the traditional notion about CD8+ T-cell responses to speci c antigens: Welsh and Selin went on to demonstrate convincingly in mice that memory CD8+ T-cells speci c for one virus can become activated during infection with an unrelated virus. Selin started working on what the mechanisms could be for that activation and how those mechanisms might infl uence disease outcome. \"In fact,\" she continued, \"that's just what we found\u2014that these mice had immune protection against a second, powerful, virus. Not total protection, the way they would if they had had a vaccination and then were exposed to an infection, but they did have partial protection.\" Selin also found, however, that some of the mice, instead of developing protection against infection, got sick with a rare condition called acute fatty necrosis. According to Selin, it took almost ten years for most immunol- ogists to accept the idea that memory CD8+ T-cells developed from one infection could be activated by a different infection. \"Why would memory cells to one infection infl uence the outcome of another infection?\" she said. \"One of the reasons, it turns out after the studies we've done, is that some CD8+ T-cells are cross-reactive.\"Selin and Welsh invented the term \"heterologous immunity\" to describe this phenomenon. And not only have they been able to show that CD8+ T-cells are not nearly as speci c as previous- ly thought, Selin has also discovered that the order in which mice are exposed to infections is key to whether they develop immunity or get sick. \"For instance, in the lab, we do experiments with two different viruses\u2014one called LCMV, and the other, vaccinia. It turns out that a mouse that has LCMV rst is protected against vaccinia, but a mouse that has vaccinia rst is not protected against LCMV,\" said Selin. Selin and Welsh's work in mice led them to collaborate with Dr. Katherine Luzuriaga, professor of pediatrics and molecular medicine, to study whether heterologous immunity may help to explain the variability of disease severity observed after many viral infections. Selin and Luzuriaga are studying the UMass Amherst students with acute infectious mononucleo-sis with the hypothesis that pre-existing cross-reactive CD8+ T-cells may provide some protection against EBV infection but may also contribute to some of the symptoms of mono. CD8+ T-cells scan the surfaces of infected cells for little pieces of protein (\"peptides,\" made up of building blocks called amino acids) that are produced when the virus infects the cell. \"When cells are infected with a virus, these peptides of about 8 to 10 amino acids in length are expressed on the cell surface along with self proteins\u2014this combination provides a signal to the immune system that an infection is present,\" explained Luzuriaga. \"With Epstein-Barr virus, for example, we have now de ned several peptides that elicit huge CD8+ T-cell responses in patients \"heterologous immunity\" \u2014the activation of memory T-cells for one infection during infection with an unrelated virus\u2014 helps explain the variability in the severity of symptoms experienced by persons infected with mononucleosis. 20But what is amazing is that some of those CD8+ T-cells, once thought to be highly particular in what they responded to, can in fact, cross react with CD8+ T-cells that respond, for example, to a nine-amino acid peptide in infl uenza. Work conducted under the auspices of the program project has demonstrated that these EBV-fl u cross-reactive CD8+ T-cells are expanded in individuals experiencing mono. \"It turns out that hundreds of different T-cell receptors can recognize one single part of the antigen on a virus, and viruses can have 15 or more of these recognizable parts,\" said Selin, meaning 15 chances for cross-reactivity. Moreover, patterns of reactivity can differ from per-son to person, so each individual will have different patterns of cross reactivity. \"Our hypothesis is that outcome following infection is determined by an individual's pattern of cross-reactivity,\" said Selin. \"Understanding how cross-reactive CD8+ T-cells can contribute to protection or disease following viral infection is not only important to understanding disease pathogenesis but also has important implications for vaccine development,\" said Luzuriaga. \"As our ability to develop vaccines against a wide variety of pathogens grows, we have to know how to combine or sequence these vaccines to optimize protection and minimize potential side effects.\" To further explore how cross-reactive CD8+ T-cells may be activated by vaccines, Selin and Luzuriaga have collaborated with Dr. Alan Rothman, a professor at the UMMS Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research and an expert in studying memory CD8+ T-cells to viruses and vaccines. \"Our research is interested in the issue of how your body is able to maintain memory for a long time when it's not constantly getting nudged,\" said Rothman. How are CD8+ T-cells generated to vaccines? Are the mecha-nisms surrounding T-cell memory the same in persistent and non-persistent viruses? \"How does a vaccine affect the memory your body has for other viruses you had before?\" he said. \"One of the challenges is now that we know how complicated the system is and how many different things can affect the response in the end, we as immunologists need to start draw-ing the lessons from those observations and make an effort to predict what's going on, to someday guide vaccination or treatment strategies,\" said Rothman. \"All of this research will in essence feed into that\u2014once we know how the sequence of viruses you get exposed to over time affects your immune response, how your body reacts to one exposure versus ongoing exposure to the virus, we will hopefully have a better picture of all of these processes.\" Alan Rothman, MD, an expert in infectious disease and vaccine research, explores how cross-reactivity may be activated by vaccines in order to advance development of those that provide optimal protection with minimal potential side effects. \"How does a vaccine affect the memory your body has for other viruses you had before? All of this research will in essence feed into\" guiding vaccination or treatment strategies. 21Grants and Research New and competitive renewal grants of $100,000 or more are listed here according to department or center and funding sources.

Our dedicated faculty, innovative programs of study and accomplished student body combine to make their diplomas uniquely valuable. Now we've opened another door, so to speak, that beckons everyone who visits our campus into an improved facility for learning. Campus Modernization continues on the Worcester campus, and this fall a major milestone of the project will be reached\u2014our opening of the new Medical School entrance and lobby, as well as the opening of a new south hospital entrance and lobby for patients and visitors. The Medical School entrance and lobby, easily distinguishable and immediately noticed with its impressive awning and accents in blue, will usher faculty, students, staff and visitors into a modern foyer that leads to new and renovated areas within. The new UMass Memorial entrance and lobby, which will be called the \"Remillard Family Pavilion\" to acknowledge the generous $10 million gift made by the Remillard Family Foun-dation to the UMass Memorial Emergency Care Campaign, is a distinctive and functional entrance for the hospital and a beau-tiful complement to the new emergency department, scheduled to open in 2006. The emergency department will be known as the \"Duddie Massad Emergency and Trauma Center,\" in acknowledgement of a $12.5 million gift by longtime Worcester businessman David \"Duddie\" Massad. The opening of the Medical School entrance and lobby and the Remillard Family Pavilion will make a marked improvement in the accessibility to educational programs and health care ser-vices. We thank our students, faculty and staff for the patience and cooperation they have shown during Campus Moderniza-tion. Throughout it all, they've helped us uphold our national reputation for distinction in education, research, public service and clinical care. On the following pages, you'll learn about three alumni who are making a difference in their communities everyday. Pediatrician Cara Kaupp, MD, specializes in caring for internationally adopt-ed children at her practice in New Hampshire. This summer she traveled to China with a group of adoptive families to medically prepare their new children for life in the United States. Graduate School of Nursing alumna Kristine Ruzycki is chief of nursing services at MIT Medical, which delivers care to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology community. She was instrumental in MIT Medical's decision to offer patients a choice of designating a nurse practitioner as their primary care provider, as an alternative to a physician, and in September 2004, was the rst nurse to be appointed director of student health at MIT. Finally, Dr. Thomas Fabian met a need in his community by opening a free-standing imaging center\u2014Advanced Imaging of Port Charlotte, Florida\u2014earlier this year. \"The lack of medical services in this region of southwest Florida was creating a great hardship for patients,\" he says. Dr. Fabian found that his medi-cal education was directly relevant to his business endeavor. \"I remember taking a community medicine class that focused in part on evaluating the health care needs of a community with an eye toward developing and providing services. The knowledge from that class was essential... .\" Aaron Lazare, MD MESSAGE FROM THE CHANCELLOR/DEAN Alumni Report 23 When Dr. Thomas Fabian opened his free-standing imag-ing center\u2014Advanced Imaging of Port Charlotte, Florida\u2014earlier this year, it was the realization of a professional dream. \"The motivating fac- tor was need in the community,\" Dr. Fabian said. \"When my father-in-law was suffering from cancer, he had to travel 200 miles for treatment. The lack of medical services in this region was creating a great hardship for patients.\"The 12,000-square-foot facility, with its $10 million in equip- ment, is a world show site for cutting-edge imaging technology and attracts patients from as far away as Miami and Orlando. Through partnerships with GE, Siemens and Hologics, Dr. Fabian is able to offer a comprehensive range of services, in-cluding bone density scanning, mammography, ultrasound and breast MRI, as well as general imaging services such as X-ray and nuclear medicine exams. \"With a full range of diagnostic tools under one roof, patients in the surrounding communities now have much quicker access to services they normally had to wait months for.\" In addition, the lm-less Picture Archiving BC, Nursing alumna Kristine Ruzycki has enjoyed expand-ing roles in diverse health care settings, serving a spectrum of patient populations from hospital- to community-based, employees to students, adolescents to elders. Each stage of her education prepared her for the next step: \"The GSN paved the way for me to be innovative and experimental, learning from experience and outcomes, and applying them to practice,\" she said. \"Having worked with nurse practitioners from every graduate nursing school around, I've discovered that the educa-tion and preparation I received at UMass Worcester is equal to or better than any other.\" A 1972 diplomate of Worcester's St. Vincent Hospital School of Nursing, in 1980 Ruzycki earned her bachelor's degree in nurs-ing from Worcester State College, where future GSN Professor and Dean Lillian Goodman founded the rst baccalaureate nursing degree program in Central Massachusetts. Upon decid-ing to pursue a master's degree, Ruzycki called Dr. Goodman for a reference. \"She told me UMass Worcester was starting its own nurse practitioner program, so I decided to wait.\" A member of the GSN's rst class, Ruzycki graduated with a concentration in nursing administration/management, one of three tracks the school originally offered. As she advanced in management, there was just one problem: \"I missed the direct patient care, which is why I became a nurse in the rst place.\" So she returned to the GSN in 1992, again as one of an inau-gural class, this time in the school's post-master's certi cate program for community health/adult nurse practitioner. She supplemented her educational activities with a role as the GSN's rst Alumni Association president, an of ce she held for ten years, and eventually received the Association's award for signi cant contributions to the GSN. Today Ruzycki blends clinical care with management as chief of nursing services at MIT Medical, a multi-specialty ambula-tory group practice, an inpatient unit and an HMO serving stu-dents, faculty, staff and retirees of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology community. In addition, in September 2004, she was appointed director of student health, the rst nurse to hold that position at MIT. (Prior to joining MIT, Ruzycki served as director of Employee Health Services at UMass Memorial, as well as executive director of the UMass Memorial Home Health & Hospice Department.) In another rst, Ruzycki was instru- mental in MIT Medical's decision to offer patients a choice of designating a nurse practitioner as their primary care provider, as an alternative to a physician. \"People are starting to understand nurses' unique abilities to provide primary care,\" she said. \"Those of us with advanced degrees have contributed to this.\" -SLG 24Thomas Fabian, MD '76 Perhaps one of the most strik- ing aspects of the scene Dr. Cara Kaupp witnessed this summer in a Chinese govern-ment building was the silence. Nannies passed babies to dozens of their new adoptive parents in one massive transfer, yet few of the children cried. Dr. Kaupp realized this unexpected reaction was a result of the children's time in an orphanage, where the human bond rarely forms. When no attention would be paid, \"the children learn very quickly that crying doesn't help,\" Dr. Kaupp explained. But the lack of attention is over for the children Dr. Kaupp met as the pediatrician traveling with parents adopting through China Adoption With Love, Inc. Her trip was her rst to China, but instrumental in preparing the children medically for their new lives in America. Dr. Kaupp says that the experience transformed her as well, adding \"so much depth to me as a pediatrician and a person...a family doesn't have to be biologi-cal; giving birth is a small part of being a parent.\" At Partners in Pediatrics in Nashua, New Hampshire, Dr. Kaupp specializes in the care of internationally adopted chil-dren. She medically evaluates them on behalf of agencies, and patients include children who were born in Romania, Ethiopia and China. During her time in Changsha, Hunan Province, her skills as a pediatrician were put to the test, as she had no advanced medical equipment to use during exams. \"I brought a stethoscope, otoscope, growth curve charts, a basic rst aid kit and donated antibiotics. We used the hotel bathroom scales to weigh the babies. It was frustrating because with one of the sick children, I had to ask myself, 'Where do we go from here?'\" The rural hospital posed the danger of new infection. The parents and Dr. Kaupp expected the babies would have problems, but some were more severe than even she had anticipated. Yet, one grateful parent, Leslie Granese, director of marketing for the University of Massachusetts President's Of ce, says Dr. Kaupp was key to enabling her to take her baby home. \"Maya had gotten sick at the orphanage and lost about a third of her body weight. She was emaciated and dehydrated,\" said Granese. \"But Cara was able to discern that Maya could be healthy again with the right care. Cara was unrelenting in her commitment to Maya [pictured with Dr. Kaupp] and deserves much of the credit for her recovery.\" Dr. Kaupp developed her interest in international adoption while a resident at University of Rochester, but her love of pediatrics grew from the example of her UMMS faculty advisor, Dr. Linda Sagor. As a student, Dr. Kaupp enjoyed the commu-nity outreach and patient advocacy programs UMMS exposed to her\u2014and she met her future husband here, Gregory Kaupp, MD '98. He also has a practice in Nashua, Medicine Pediatrics, where he sees adult and pediatric patients. The couple plan to adopt internationally when they start their own family. \"We always knew we would adopt, but this experience in China really cemented it for us.\" -ALB Cara Douville Kaupp, MD '00 and Communications System (PACS) technology gives patients and their doctors access to test results quickly. \"A radiologist from UMass Medical School could log on to our system and view their own patient's scans on a monitor immediately after an image is created.\" As Dr. Fabian was developing the business side of Advanced Imaging, he found that his medical education was directly relevant. \"I remember taking a community medicine class [now the Community Health Clerkship] that focused in part on evaluating the needs of a community with an eye toward developing and providing services. The knowledge from that class was essential in setting up this business and complement- ed the expertise my business partners brought to the project.\" He also credits Dr. Carl D'Orsi with teaching him about strong leadership by example. And he built lifelong relationships while at UMMS, including with Robert Leone, MD '77, with whom Dr. Fabian worked in Massachusetts prior to developing Advanced Imaging. \"I had opportunities to go to med school in Boston, but I chose UMMS because I knew I would be a part of a community and be known by my professors and classmates. It seemed like the ultimate education.\" -EC 25MORE1975 Erica E. Johnson, MD, was appointed chief of the Division of General Internal Medicine at Newton-Wellesley Hospital in January 2005. With nearly 100 internists in the division, she has several immediate challenges, the most pressing being uni-versal implementation of an electronic medical records system. Dr. Johnson, an assistant professor of medicine at Tufts Univer-sity and adjunct assistant professor at UMass Medical School, was pro led in the Wellesley Townsman on February 3 regard- ing her new role and her career as a primary care physician and teacher. She was quoted in the article, \"I'm convinced that my patients get better care when medical students and residents are involved because they are looking at patients and illnesses in a new light.\" Dr. Johnson was the 2004 recipient of Newton-Wellesley's Locke Award for Excellence in Primary Care Teach-ing in Medicine. She has served on the Partners Community Healthcare, Inc. Board of Trustees for the last ve years. Anita Karcz, MD, MBA, is chief medical of cer for the Insti- tute for Health Metrics (IHM), a nonpro t organization she co-founded. IHM automates the process of extracting data from hospital information systems for quality and operational indi-cators, allowing clinical personnel to spend their time improv-ing clinical practice rather than gathering data and generating reports. Dr. Karcz also serves as an advisor or board member for early medical companies and is an active volunteer in entre-preneurial business organizations such as the Commonwealth Institute and the MIT Enterprise Forum. 1977 Robert A. Klugman, MD, clinical associate professor of medi- cine at UMass Medical School, is vice chair and chief quality of cer for the Department of Medicine and medical director for managed care at UMass Memorial Health Care. He keeps a busy practice in Westborough, Mass. and is active in local commu-nity organizations. Dr. Klugman's daughter, Ashley, attends law school in New York City, while daughter Allison is a senior at Providence College. Robert G. Leone, MD, is chairman of Northeast Radiology As- sociates, serving Anna Jaques Hospital in Newburyport, Mass., as well as two radiology of ces and two free-standing MRI cen- ters. He and his wife, Janet, celebrated their 32 nd wedding an- niversary July 14. Their 24-year-old daughter, Melissa, teaches computer science at a private boys school in Asheville, North Carolina, as she studies for her master's degree in information technology at George Washington University. Their son, An-drew, is 21 and nished his junior year at Boston College with a 3.8 GPA. \"Despite my telling him all about current medical practice, he is in the process of applying to medical schools,\" says Dr. Leone. 1979 Eric D. Leskowitz, MD, recently received a two-year grant from the Langeloth Foundation to establish the Spaulding Rehabili-tation Hospital Integrative Medicine Project. \"I'm doing a lot of talking and writing about various forms of energy medicine,\" he says. His daughter, Shari, moved to San Francisco and son, David, to Boulder, Colo., so Dr. Leskowitz and his wife, Doreen, look forward to visiting some \"nice places in the months ahead. All is well.\" Christopher H. Linden, MD, professor of emergency medicine at UMass Medical School, practices emergency medicine at Milford Regional Medical Center and covers the toxicology service at UMass Memorial one week per month. The service, which now has four fellows and ve faculty, provides physi- cian-to-physician telephone consults and outpatient evalu-ations, and can accept inpatient transfers, both adults and children. Dr. Linden encourages physicians to call the service regarding their patients with real or suspected poisoning (in-state: 800-441-4131; out-of-state: 800-242-1554). Andrew J. Miller, MD, in his 23 rd year as a primary care physi- cian in Douglas, Mass. and whose practice trains third-year UMass Medical School students and post-graduate residents in internal medicine, serves as associate professor of clinical medicine at UMMS and is chief of the Division of Commu-nity Internal Medicine in the Department of Medicine. He has served on multiple committees at the institution in order to en-hance its primary care mission and continues to enjoy an active Class Notes 26Dr. Johnson before her of ce shrine to the Red Sox.Photo by Ed Wozniak.

Their son, Matt\u2014born during Dr. Miller's fourth year in medical school\u2014recently married and works as a computer engineer for Sun Microsystems. Daughter Jen recently graduated from Wheelock College with her master's degree and is a kindergarten teacher in Shrewsbury. \"If this sounds too much like a Marcus Welby-like dream...it really is! And I owe it all to UMass Medical School!!\" says Dr. Miller. 1980 Spouses Abigail Adams, MD, and Brian Hennessy, MD, both recently received promotions to the rank of clinical associate professor at UMass Medical School, she in internal medicine and he in anesthesiology. \"We are very happy in our work here,\" they report, adding that outside the job, they have had recent visits with their daughter, Christy, and grandson, Cole, 6, who now live in Tanzania. Ronald J. Hurley, MD, is newly appointed executive vice chair- man of the Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital. His daughter, Meghan, just graduated from Boston College, while daughter Emily is a junior at Boston University. \"Neither shows any inclination to follow dad's slowing footsteps,\" Dr. Hurley says. His wife, Beth, a former ICU nurse at UMass, runs a thriving garden design business. 1994 Jeffrey Cukor, MD, assistant professor of emergency medicine at UMMS and an emergency medicine physician at UMass Memorial Medical Center, was recently honored by the Worcester Police for his extensive involvement in the city's annual \"Give Kids a Fightin' Chance\" Celebrity Boxing Night held at the Worcester Palladium. Dr. Cukor, who was recognized for coordinating a volunteer team of 36 emergency department residents to help him with the boxing program, said he was surprised and humbled by the award. \"I feel honored to have received this plaque, and I'm proud to participate in a program that reaches out to kids in the Worcester community. The vision for the project comes from the Gang Unit, and I respect their enthusiasm and com-mitment.\" The boxing event was created by the Worcester Police to raise money for programs that bene t inner city children\u2014 $250,000 has been raised over a three-year span. This year's fundraiser featured a 12-bout card of grudge matches between local celebrities, business leaders, politicians and law en-forcement of cials. \"The biggest hurdle we faced putting this program together was medical clearance for the kids to ght and to have medical personnel on site,\" Police Sgt. Steven Roche said. \"Jeff Cukor from day one has been there when we needed him and has gone above and beyond for these kids.\" 1998 Patrick McEnaney, MD, a specialist in minimally invasive sur- gery, has been appointed to the active medical staff at Milford Regional Medical Center and performs laparoscopic surgical procedures at the Medical Center's new Surgical Center. While a resident at UMass Memorial Medical Center, Dr. McEnaney received numerous awards, including the H. Brownell Wheeler Award for exceptional performance as a surgical resident, twice; the Outstanding House Of cer Teaching Award; and the Resident Teaching Award.

Finberg, MD, the Richard M. Haidack Professor of Medicine and Chair of the Department of Medicine at UMass Medical School 28If we de ne plague by one of its more common usages, \"a highly infectious, usually fatal, epidemic disease; a pesti-lence\" (The American Heritage \u00ae Diction- ary, Fourth Edition), then we have had plagues since we have had life. How, as a species, have we dealt with this kind of adversity? As doctors, what is our record? In 1346 at the battle of the Genovese trading post of Caffa on the Black Sea, an army from Mongolia was being decimated by a mysterious disease. The Mongol commander catapulted bodies of the dead soldiers into the besieged city. In 1347 sailors on Genovese trading ships arriving in Sicily were noted to be dying as the ships docked. These sailors had a disease characterized by swellings in the armpits and groin and their clinical course was characterized by fever and hemorrhage. Within 18 months this disease would spread across the European continent and kill 20 million\u2014one-third of the popula-tion. Whether the \"Black Death\" was actually bubonic plague is still debated. (A recent popular book argues that it was actually caused by an unusual strain of B.antracis , the cause of anthrax.) Regardless of the actual cause of the horri c calamity that overwhelmed Europe, the exhibition \"Hope and Heal-ing\" illustrates, literally, the response of humans, and to some extent, doctors to an infectious disaster. What can we learn from this experience, and how has it changed the way we face (and will face) such plagues? Medical thought in the 14th century was still based on the concepts of Hippocrates, whose theory of Medicine was based on the body's own healing powers: he taught that it was the task of the physician to aid this natural process. This concept, which was a thousand years old in medieval times, led to the advice of the Greek physician Galen, who suggested that in times of plague, it was best for the physician to leave the area as quickly as possible. Many did exactly that. At the time, many of these distant medical scholars suggested that \"miasmas,\" or unhealthy air, was the cause of the pesti-lence. Galen's Book of Fevers, which dealt with the interactions of different biles and humors in determining health, and still widely read at the time, was of little use. Fortunately, the observation that the disease spread with people and animals was made by the people of the time. As a result, many walled cities acted to prevent the entrance of plague suffer-ers. The concept of quarantine, a 40-day prohibition on entry, was introduced, and the rst public health board was founded in Florence in 1347. The plague years resulted in the institution of sanitary measures, the building of hospitals and importantly, in the understanding of the notion of \"contagion,\" or the infectious nature of epidemics. In our own time, the advent of the plague of HIV has led to fuller understanding of basic immunology (host defense) and virology, to the point that when two new plagues, Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome and SARS, were described in the late 20 th and early 21st century, the organisms were identi ed within weeks and largely controlled within months. It is hoped that as we face plagues in the future, such as the infl uenza epidemics likely to come, we will be able to learn enough to advance medical knowledge and aid in the triumph over plagues. Giovanni Andrea Sirani, oil on canvas from the Bob Jones University Collection, Bob Jones University Museum and GalleryDr. Finberg was a featured speaker at the September symposium, \"Plague, An Abiding Scourge,\" presented by UMMS and the Worceste r Art Museum in conjunction with the museum's celebrated exhibition, Hope and Healing: Painting in Italy in a Time of Plague, 150 0- 1800, which concluded on September 25. The symposium examined the responses to medical and economic catastrophes wrought by the plague\u2014relevant today as the threat of contagion by disease persists.
