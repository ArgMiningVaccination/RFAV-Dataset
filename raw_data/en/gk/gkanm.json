While guidance for the hepatitis B vaccine has changed, this change was made after it became clear there was a high rate of childhood infections. Hepatitis B is most commonly transmitted from mothers to babies during birth. The vaccination of newborns has caused the rate of acute hepatitis B infections in the U.S. to decline dramatically, according to health experts. Change in vaccine recommendations due to hepatitis B rates, not profit Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus that can either be short-term or chronic, according to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hbv/index.htm). Those with chronic hepatitis B can develop serious health issues, such as liver disease and liver cancer. Since the hepatitis B virus is transmitted through bodily fluids, such as blood or semen, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [initially recommended](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5125a3.htm) it for those considered high-risk, such as heterosexual people with multiple partners, intravenous drug users and health care workers. But over time the committee noticed many members of those groups were not getting the vaccine because they either were unaware of the risks of the disease, didn't know about the vaccine or weren't able to afford the vaccination, according to the CDC. The committee also recognized the abundance of childhood infections, which impacted about [18,000 children each year](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/vaccine-hepatitis-b-vaccine), half of which caught it from their mothers during birth. As a result, the committee switched to a more comprehensive recommendation of universal childhood vaccination.

Tate III, a spokesperson for the Hepatitis B Foundation, told USA TODAY in an email that the post's claim that the change in the vaccine's marketing was due to profit is false. Dr. [Chari A. Cohen](https://www.hepb.org/news-and-events/news-2/dr-chari-cohen/), president of the foundation, told USA TODAY that acute hepatitis B infections [declined](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5803a1.htm#:~:text=Acute%20hepatitis%20B%20incidence%20has,among%20children%20aged%20%3C15%20years.) by 82% in the U.S. between 1991, when the vaccine was first recommended for infants, and 2009. \"This is evidence that vaccinating babies prevents hepatitis B infection and is necessary if we are to eliminate a disease that causes [820,000 deaths](https://www.hepb.org/what-is-hepatitis-b/what-is-hepb/facts-and-figures/#:~:text=Two%20billion%20people%20have%20been,of%20infected%20individuals%20are%20diagnosed.) each year worldwide,\" Cohen said in an email. Vaccinating newborns critical to fight hepatitis B infections Cohen said hepatitis B is most frequently transmitted from mother to child through blood exchange during birth. The [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-b#:~:text=The%20virus%20is%20most%20commonly,or%20exposures%20to%20sharp%20instruments.) reports the same information. \"Infant vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, including the birth dose, is necessary to protect newborns, babies and children from a chronic lifelong infection that increases the risk of liver cancer as much as tobacco increases the risk of lung cancer,\" Cohen said. Tina Proveaux, a spokesperson for the [Institute for Vaccine Safety](https://www.vaccinesafety.edu/), told USA TODAY in an email many mothers infected with hepatitis B are asymptomatic and not tested, which makes vaccination at birth necessary to reduce transmission of the virus. Children are also more likely to go undiagnosed and be carriers of the virus, according to [Michigan Medicine](https://med.umich.edu/1libr/IMMS/RecommendHepBUM.pdf), the University of Michigan's academic medical center. In fact, Cohen said only [10% of the 300 million](https://www.hepb.org/what-is-hepatitis-b/what-is-hepb/facts-and-figures/#:~:text=Two%20billion%20people%20have%20been,of%20infected%20individuals%20are%20diagnosed.) people chronically infected with the virus are diagnosed.

USA TODAY was unable to locate the source of the quote featured in the post. The user who shared the post told USA TODAY that though they don't believe newborns need the vaccine, they never outright said so in their post. They also directed USA TODAY to [a study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3092064/#:~:text=In%20the%20decade%20following%20hepatitis,and%20later%20still%2C%20all%20newborns) that evaluated the shifting perspective of the hepatitis B vaccine throughout the years. But the study doesn't claim children were a fallback market for the vaccine. Rather, it explains how the vaccine's original marketing failed to lower infection rates and mobilize adults. It also states how the vaccine's original marketing made critics view the virus as a sexually transmitted disease and, therefore, not something children needed to be vaccinated against.
