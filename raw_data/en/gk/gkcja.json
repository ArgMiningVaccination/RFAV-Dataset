The president's budget aims to cut the federal deficit -now at a record $427 billion -to $233 billion in 2009.

Yalom will kick off the opening session at the 2005 American Counseling Association Con- vention in Atlanta on April 8. In line with this year's theme, Yalom, a professor emeritus of psychiatty at Stanford Universi- ty, will address the importance of creativity in counseling and the role it has not only in coun- selors' lives, but also in the lives of their clients. Yalom has em- phasized the creative force inhis existential and group text- books and in his Very successful nonfiction works, which cap- ture the essence of therapy. In his presentation, Yalom, will discuss clinical material from Is practice and address the general topic of using htera- ture as a form of teaching psy- chotherapy. He will focus par- ticularly on his new teaching novel The Schopenhauer Cure, meant to clarify the following themes for students: N The strategies and tactics of the group therapist E The use of process in group psychotherapy* The meaning of existential psychotherapy * How clients undergo change in the therapy group N The relevance of Arthur Schopenhauer's philosophy for the field of psychotherapy a Strengths and weaknesses of the field of clinical philosophy 0 The impact of death aware- ness upon the conduct of life Yalom has been a widely hon- ored expert and teacher of this medium for the past 30 years.

Public School Board voted to eliminate five ele- mentary school counseling posi- tions in the district as part of an effor to reduce the budget for the 2005-2006 school year. Current- ly, the Rochester School District has 7.8 elementary school coun- selor positions for 15 buildings -five funded through the school board's \"regular fund\" and the remainder through Title IV and compensatory funds. At press time, the Rochester School Counseling Coalition was attempting to rally support m an effort to get the school board to reconsider its decision. The American Counseling Associa- tion is among the organizations that wrote letters in support of RSCC and compiled information demonstrating the essential need for elementary school coun- selors. Other groups supporting RSCC include the AmericanSchool Counselor Association, the Minnesota Counseling Asso- ciation, the Minnesota School Counselors Association, Trans- forming School Counseling: Education Trust and the National Center for School Counseling Outcome Research. While five school counselors will lose their jobs if the Roch- ester school board stands by its verdict, the impact of the deci- sion will be much more wide- spread, said RSCC and its sup- porters. Most of the services in the district's elementary schools will be gone, said RSCC repre- sentatives, virtually eliminating a connection with at-risk students and community agencies, assis- tance to students through prima- ry interventions and support for parents with needed services for their children through a referral and follow-up process. \"Coun- seling services are a necessity in schools -not an extra that canbe cut:' RSCC said in a letter to area education leaders. The ramifications of the school board's decision could also ex- tend well beyond the borders of the Rochester School District. \"Statewide, since Minnesota does not have mandated K-12 counseling, we may see the same thing happening in other districts where there is already a low number of elementary 6oufi- selors,\" said Mary Fawcett, who serves on the faculty in the Coun- selor Education Departnient at Winona State University in Winona, Minn. \"Ngtionally, there could (also) be a trend with President (George W,) Bush's budget proposal to cut all K-12 school counselors?'

The lack of a compromise may lead the state's legislators to try to resolve the issue. Indiana law requires the state's psychology board to devel- op a list of \"restricted tests\" that can only be psed by psycholo- May, then-governor Joseph Keinan rejected the psy- chology board's most recent proposal, which would have placed 235 different tests and assessments off limits to counselors. Indiana psychologists have been trading proposals with a coalition of state and national organizations (including the American Counseling Association) representing counselors, marriage and family therapists, speech-language pathologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists and social workers. The most recent proposals under discussion would eliminate the call for a restricted test list but stipulate that individuals using psychological tests and assessments either have a doctoral degree or complete coursework focusing on testing issues in addition to accumulating specific post-degree experience. The coalition is attempting to ensure that any resolution to the testing issue does not create other restrictions on the scopes of practice of counselors and other providers, such as prohibiting the use of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis- orders. State Sen. Patricia Miller, chair of the Senate committee with jurisdiction over health care professional issues, introduced a \"placeholder\" bill (S. 591) this year that includes such a pro- vision. The coalition continues to work with Miller and Indiana psychologists in an attempt to reach an acceptable compromise. Committee considers Dx/Tx authority The Nebraska Licensed Mental Health Practitioners Technical Review Committee is considering a proposal by the Nebraska Counseling Association and others to allow the state's Licensed Professional Counselors, marriage and family therapists, and clinical social workers to diagnose and treat individuals with major mental disorders. The NLMHP Technical Review Com- mittee held a public hearing on the proposal Feb. 4. Supporters point out that large areas of Nebraska suffer froni a shortage of mental health professionals and contend that cur- rentregulations requiring physician or pgychologistreferral and - supervision significantly exacerbate the problem. Supporters also stress that their -professions' ethical codes prohibit them from practicing outside their areas of expertise. ACA is working in support of NCA's effort.In a memo sent to NCA Executive Director Kevin Kaminski and shared with the Technical Review Committee's chief of staff, ACA Director of Public Policy and Legislation Scott Barstow compared the pro- posal to the framework governing other professionals: \"Many physicians are unfamiliar with the DSM-IV ... and are hence arguably unqualified to see patients presenting with symptoms of a mental disorder. State laws, however, do not prevent physi- cians from doing so. It is instead physicians' code of ethics and standards of practice which require them to decline to treat, and to instead refer to a colleague, those patients with a mental dis- order, should they not be qualified through education, training and experience to diagnose and treat in this area. This same reliance on -practitioners' codes of ethics, standards of practice and on licensing boards -not on state laws -to prevent inap- propriate diagnosis and treatment should be adopted for Licensed Professional Counselors?' The NLMHP Technical Review Committee is eipected to issue a recommendation on the proposal later this year. 0EWS UPDATE 0 Cc.J a C, U 'U Db C 0)'a Cz 0 U 3 Letters Focus on terrorism misses significant area of trauma January's article in Counsel- ing Today on terrorism and trau- ma (\"Repairing lives affected by terrorism\"), while interesting and informative, was disap- pointing to me as a professional who has worked in the field of trauma prevention and treatment for the past 20 years. I was dis- mayed that an article on trauma focused solely on terrorism, when interpersonal violence af- fects a greater number of people in our country and throughout the world. Over the years I have experi- enced the many challenges, changes and skepticisms that have occurred within the field of trauma diagnosis and treatment. In my practice 4 specialize in working with individuals who have experienced the trauma of sexual abuse and related interper- sonal victimization such as do- mestic violence and physical and emotional abuse. I have also worked with individuals who have experienced workplace accidents that resulted in dramat- ic changes to their lives, natural disasters where family died and homes were destroyed, automo- bile accidents-resulting in injury or death, and trauma related to crimes such as robbery and mur- der. But the most frequent aid long-lasting of traumas that peo- ple experience are those that occur within their family rela- tionships and the home, where they are supposed to be safe. From my perspective, I find that what our country may not. realize is that before the Okla- homa City bombing, the Columbine shootings, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and interna- tional terrorist events such as the siege of the school in Russia, interpersonal violence was already affecting the lives of people -women, children and men -and had been for a num- ber of years and at a much more significant' level for a much longer period of time. To bring this reality home let me give an example of the childhood trau- ma of sexual abuse. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates that 12 percent of our children are sexually abused in the United States each year. This figure indicates that more than 500,000 children are sexually abused each year-when we use current population trends (Cen- sus Bureau, 2000). This esti-matti would indicate that during the past two years approximate- ly I million children have expe- rienced the trauniatic crime of sexual abuse. And that figure is likely understated considering that there has not been a univer- sally accepted definition of sex- ual abuse, along with the fact that this is the most underreport- ed type of child abuse. When we' again use the prevalence studies and census information, 24.5 million women in the age range of 20-54 are reported to have experienced the trauma of sexu- al abuse when they were chil- dren. The majority of women report the sexual abuse occur- ring before the age of 14. As with other interpersonal traumas, the consequences of sexual abuse continue to disrupt the child's life and the adult she becomes without appropriate intervention and treatment. How- ever, unlike terrorism and other manmade or natural disasters, interpersonal traumas often con- tinue for years rather than for hours or days. There are also dis- tinct differences in working with people who have experienced specific kinds of trauma, as not all trauma is the same, nor are the people who have experienced it. This means that while there may be similarities, the education, training, background, experi- ence, skills and treatment approaches that work with one type of trauma (terrorism, auto accidents, war) may not work with other types of trauma (child sexual abuse, physical abuse, rape, sexual assault) when expe- rienced by a particular individ- ual. Also, gender is always a fac- tor with regard to trauma, espe- cially interpersonal trauma. Women are more likely than men to experience the specific symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder'because women experience more interpersonal trauma by the people they know -family members, spouses, partners. So when the article mentions that 7 percent to 20 percent of people develop full- blown PTSD from traumatic events, it is important to know that gender will make a differ- ence, as will the traumatic event. But also important to recognize is that PTSD does not include the spectrum of symptoms and effects that women and children will experience from interper- sonal violence. Complex-PTSD is being considered for inclusion in the next Diagnostic and Sta-tistical Manual ofMental Disor- ders, as it expands the symp- toms of the current PTSD diag- nostic category and is more inclusive of interpersonal trau- ma. Long after the nightmares, intrusive images, hypervigilance and flashbacks have ended, the consequences of interpersonal violence continue, which is the reason we often see co-disorders of substance abuse, eating disor- ders, depression, suicide, health problems and disruption to rela- tionships. These later conse- quences of sexual abuse trauma and other forms of interpersonal violence are among the reasons that we see as much as 75 per- cent of women presenting with a history of sexual trauma 'who seek mental health aid sub- stance abuse services. Traumila is a growing field that is filially receiving the recogni- tion it has long deserved. We do need education at the under- graduate and graduate levels as well as continuing education, as few programs offer the educa- tional programs to prepare our profession and other health care providers to work with adults and children experiencing trau- ma. But as this field continu'es to develop, we also need to be clear on where this training needs to be focused, what kind of training is needed, what the qualities of a therapist who is considering working in the field of trauma should be, what the psychological and neurological impacts are of trauma (brain structures and memory) and who the people are that have experienced the kinds of trauma with which we will be working. I hope to see an article on interpersonal trauma in the near future for American Counseling Association members. I also ask that this significant area of trau- ma be included in the third edi- tion of ACAs publication oh trauma, as it was not included in the first two. To leave out inter- personal violence when it is occurring and has been occur- ring within our nation's homes and throughout the world for years and generations means that the most. frequent type of trauma that human beings expe- rience is not addressed within our field or for our membership. Terrorism has occurred in the last few years within the United States. Thankfully, there has not been another act of terrorism on our soil since Sept. 11, 2001.

Mission Statement The mission of the American Coun- seling Association is to enhance the quality of life in society by promot- ing the development of professional counselors, advancing the counsel- ing profession, and using the pro- fessign and practice of counseling to promote respect for human dignity and diversity.S From the President -BY SAMUEL T GLADDING From before graduation to maturation: Stay with ACA I can still remember being so excited that my hands trembled. It was March 1971 and, as a grad- uate student in a master's pro- gram in counseling, I had just received my first copy of The Personnel and Guidance Journal (now the Journal of Counseling & Development). The periodical was compact in size but packed a punch with articles on all aspects of counseling. I literally could not put the journal down, and in one of the university lounges, I read, no! ... I devoured each page. Then, with a sigh that comes only after digesting a good meal or excellent food for thought, I walked back to my residence hall with a smile of contentment that I am sure resembled drawings ofthe Cheshire Cat in Alice in Won- derland. Granted, my experience was unique. After all, who gets emo- tionally charged from receiving a professional journal? Yet the feeling of exhilaration I had that brisk spring day was genuine. I fell in love with the profession of counseling long before I fell in love with my wife. In reflect- ing on that time 34 years ago, I realize the value of becoming a member of the American Coun- seling Association and how it has impacted my life. First, membership in ACA has brought me a deeper awareness of the people who have shaped the counseling profession. The authors, editors and creators ofbooks, journal articles and theo- ries frequent ACA conventions. Most are friendly, open and willing to share their insights. For instance, in 1982, my first year as a counselor educator, I met and talked with Gerald Corey at the ACA Convention. He did not know me, but he was approachable and engaging. Since then, I have had discus- sions with other well-known and interesting professionals such as Sunny Hansen and Courtland Lee. These encoun- ters have left a lasting mark in my memory that transcends time and place. Another motivation for joining and continuing to be an ACA member is an increased depth in the knowledge of counseling. Becoming a counselor is devel- opmental. It takes time to master skills, and trying to do so alone is like attempting to have a party without guests. Individuals who are most satisfied in their careers are those who grow from year to year through a variety of experi- ences. Maturity in a profession does not come with years of liv- ing; it requires effort -specifi- cally, lots and lots of reading, writing, viewing, reflecting andexperience! I have found that ACA events and products offer me the opportunity to learn how to work with a variety of clients. I am challenged in my thinking by reading ACA books and viewing our association's videotapes and CDs on subjects ranging from theories to ethics. I find my mem- bership has brought me increased understanding of counseling in general as well as specialized skills and enabling abilities. Finally, there is the matter of being able to give to others and to receive services. Explore the ACA website (www.counseling. org). There you will find a wealth of information, including opportunities to provide and ob- tain services. For instance, the website can help you assist oth- ers in times of crisis by providing you information on how to vol- unteer for or donate to reputable relief organizations such as the American Red Cross, an organi- zation with which ACA has a strong relationship. Likewise, there are periodic calls for volun- teers to join ACA committees or run for ACA offices on the web- site. There are continuing educa- tion courses offered on the site. Ways to order stimulating newproducts in counseling are there as well. Career announcements are also listed, along with ways to join one or more of the 19 divisions within the association. I hope the thrill I felt when my first ACA publication arrived never fades. It is a sensation that counters temptations to see life from a jaded perspective. The people, conversations, publica- tions, conventions, continuing education experiences and other opportunities that are part of counseling and the ACA experi- ence have value that goes way beyond the moments in which they occur. For me, they have been well worth my time and money. Through my continued investment, I have learned much and grown as a result. However, it has been a gradual and some- times uneven process akin to the following lyrics by Ringo Starr: \"Got to pay your dues if you want to sing the blues, and you know it don't come easy.\" Easy? \"No!\" Exciting? \"Yes!\" Well worth it? \"Definitely!\" It is why, in maturity, I look back to a March of many years ago with gratitude and thanksgiving. 0 DISCOVER THE DIFFERENCE!

The staff and I were very pleased when, just before Valen- tine's Day, we received our 2,500th registrant for next month's American Counseling Association Annual Convention in Atlanta. Having this many reg- istrants so many weeks out cer- tainly lets us know that this will be.one of the best attended con- ventions in several years. In fact, compared with the last several years this many weeks out, the Atlanta convgntion has eclipsed all those other events in terms of pre-convention registrations! Why would so many people be interested in this year's con- vention? There are many rea- sons. For example, this year'sevent is being held in a good location that is incredibly' easy to fly into directly 'from hun- dreds of cities both inside and outside the United States. Cou- ple that with what seems like the ongoing airfare Wars and rea- sonable hotel ratds, ind all of a sudden, this has become an affordable, content-filled con- vention full of all sorts of net- working ahd career enhance- ment opportunities! The other major reason for the spike in attendance has to do with ACA's attempts to meet your needs as professionm counselofs, counselor educa- tors, emerging professionals or graduate students. Let's face it.The reason we exist is to serve you! If you have been toying with the idea of attending an ACA Convention, let me encourage you to seriously consider our gathering in Atlanta early next month. With the accessibility to Atlanta, the more than 400 Edu- cation Sessions and a new and enhanced career services center, why let this opportunity pass you - up for yet another year? Visit the convention area of the ACA web- site at www.counseling.org/ convention to read all about what has been planned with you in mind. You'll find great aniouhts . of information about the tipcom- ing convention throughout this issue of Counseling Today as well. Over the years, I have gone from never asking for directions when I am driving in a new area to often asking for directions (even when I have been in the area before!). ACA has a long and proud tradition of serving the profession. However, at times it may have appeared that 'we were not asking for direc- ions. We were not responding as quickly to the needs of mem- bers because of other -issues,such as being too focused on operational or structural issues of the organization. At the end of the day, when it is time to renew your member- ship in ACA, does the structure of our governance really out- weigh the need for you to have the resources, materials or net- working opportunities to be the best possible counselor? I don't think so, and I want to openly congratulate the leadership of ACA for realizing this impor- tant fact. The ACA leadership, along with the staff, knows that our responsibility includes how best to represent and meet'the needs of the profession, and to instill public confidence' and trust in the profession. Your rep- resentatives on the ACA Gov- erning Council, divif sion leaders and branch offi- cials, have been doing a great job-of listening -and respond- ing -to your needs. In this column, I have often asked you to share with me your thoughts, comments and. sug- gestions. In fact, I will do so again as I close. For those of you who have communicated with me, thank you. For those who have not but have some-thing to say, I encourage you to share that information. While we, as an association of nearly 45,000 -members, may not be able to say \"Yes\" to every request, we can at least look at how 'best to meet the many needs of our members. This is our commitment, and it makes our need to hear from you that much more important! Oier the next several months, ACA will be featuring more new products, services andresources designed specifically for the counseling profession. And these resources will not be limited to those who are at the midpoint of their-careers. We will have opportunities for stu- dents, new professionals and those of you heading into retire- .mentas well.

The robber punched one of the women twice and slapped another to the ground while taking their money. There were several African-American men close to the scene, watching the incident. \"No, no, please, no!\" one of the women repeatedly screamed at the robber and to the men. When she saw the Isilent eyes of the men, she picked up a handbag on the ground that belonged to one of the women and urged her companions to run. I was one of the women. After the incident, I began experiencing physical tension whenever I saw an African- American male approaching whose appearance reminded meof the robber. To make matters worse, I experienced two addi- tional attempted thefts and a pickpocketing in the next month, all committed by young African-American males. My African-American friends tried to give me some explanation for my unfortunate experiences: \"You get picked because you don't look mean. You just look like an easy target:' I tried to take my friends' ad- vice. I started wearing tough- looking sunglasses and became very cautious when walking by myself, yet a generalized fear of African-American males who were strangers was building in- side of me. Still trying to resist the fear and negative stereotyp- ing of African-Americans, I re- ceived another shock when I learned that one of my best friends, who happened to be anAfrican-American male, had been lying to me for years. I felt rejected and traumatized by African-Americans at large, es- pecially as I was seeking accep- tance from their community. Saying I was conflicted would be an understatement. Before arriving in the United States, I had positive stereotypes of African-Americans based on my love of soul music and the warmth I had felt through limited interactions..Now, the more con- tact I was having with African- Americans in the United States, the more I was wondering about some of the behaviors and char- acteristics I had experienced. There were everyday behav- iors in addition to the traumatic ones that perplexed me. For example, people in the city where I lived would smile and greet strahigers on the street. It was a new custom'for me that I liked and so began practicing. Then I found that the African- American people I encountered were less likely to smile back than the Americans of European descent. One of my African- American friends laughed andexplained that it was because many African-American people, \"in their minds,\" automatically think that those of other races do not like them. I learned later that racial minorities sometimes in- ternalize prejudice and negative stereotypes, which possibly cor- relates to their reactions to me. Nonetheless, these racial issues were clearly more complex than I had ever expected. I spent my first year in the United States improving my English proficiency in an English as a second language program. The next year, I was admitted to a counseling program that pro- vided various opportunities to reflect and learn about my own fultural identity, values and assumptions, which were con- stantly bumping up against American cultural norms. Ex- pectations surrounding class- room behavior (for example, active verbal participation in class discussion) and relation- ships with my peers and the fac- ulty were very different from those of my own culture. This leaming process, coupled with my adjustment to a new culture,fundamentally impacted both my personal and professional identi- ty development. The program's emphasis on multiculturalism helped me fur- ther my own cultural identity, which in turn brought increasing resolution to my developing cul- tural mistrust of African-Ameri- cans. I learned about African- American culture in general and the diversity within their com- munity by interacting with class- mates, reading books and watch- ing movies about slavery and its enduring effects. After reading about pervasive poverty, unbal- anced access to resources and the harmful effects of racism, I became enlightened to the histor- ical and social context of the problems that many African- Americans face. I was stunned by the disproportionate poverty and unemployment rates, along with the high incarceration and homicide rates, for young African-American men.

CALIcCHIA Developmental theory and communicating effectively with young children As a counselor of young chil- dren, many parents frequently ask me how to communicate effectively with their children. Similarly, as a counselor educa- tor, students often ask me how developmental theory informs and guides counseling practice. These seemingly disparate ques- tions essentially have the same Ritswer:Developmental theory isnecessary to understand not only critical stages but, more impor- tant, what modalities of ex- pression and communication the child is able to use. To effective- ly communicate with children and permit developmental theo- ry to guide our practice we must understand the \"languages\" chil- dren speak as they mature. The purpose of this article is to sharea framework for understanding and using developmental theory to speak to children in the non- verbal language they know best: action-based play and fantasy. To simplify the multidimen- sional complexity of human psychological and physical de- velopment, theorists have at- tempted to describe matura- tional processes in one domain at a time. Students routinely study developmental theorists that have examined cognitive, psychosocial, moral, psychosex- ual and interpersonal develop- ment, to name but a few. The problem students have with developmental theory is that they tend to view only a single domain of the child's develop-ment at a time. As good coun- selors we seek to view a child from a holistic lens and uniler- stand a child's thoughts, emo- tions, personality and world- view concurrently. If we ask ourselves what commonalities most or all developmental theo- rists share in their view of chil- dren, we begin to understand and conceptualize a mega- developmental model to guide our work with children as par- ents and therapists. If we look at the world of the very young child between birth and 2 years of age we see a vari- ety of maturational progressions that theorists have described using stages and issues. Where theorists share common groundis that the child experiences all of these developmental issues in the same modality of body-based action. During this early develop- mental level a child does not have access to language or to play, therefore he or she experi- ences and constructs meaning of the world through rituals of phys- ical action. Regardlesh- of the developmental issue being nego- tiated, the child at this age has only one venue from which to engage the world. To effectively communicate with a child of this age we don't need language or even pretend play. We need to physically interact ma nonverbal manner to communicate with the Continued on page 24 AT ARGOSY UNIVERSITY THE POWER OF THE MIND IS LIMITLESS.

Contentedly consumed by his latest book project, he had got- ten up at 4 a.m. to write and was now in a groove. The phone call threatened to inferrupt his cre- ative flow. And besides, he thought, who could be galling this e'arly in the morning? Only after* he answered \"the phone did he realize that it Was- n't as early as he had thought. It was 8 a.m., the time Kottlerbim- self had instructed the intertview- er to call. Without realizing it, he had been Writing for nearly four hours straight, totally absorbed by his subj&t matter -the sometimes fine line between cre- ative genius and madness. Kottler, professor and chair of the Counseling Department at California State University- Fullerton, is also the author of 65 books. \"Each has arisen from an intensely persofal issue or ques- tion that I have,\" he said. \"Each book starts as a personal search to find answers in my life?' The book he is currently working on (working title, The Art of Madness) is no different. Kottler admits that, as a coun- 2 seling professional, one of his.0 deepest fears is going crazy. 2 That fear has led him to explore the stories of numerous creative a geniuses who struggled with mental illness, including Ernest s Hemingway,,Sylvia Plath, Char- g lie Parker, Judy Garland, Lenny Bruce, Brian Wilson and others. But what also engrosses Kot- L) tler is the potential for healing and growth that creative outlets 10 provide, both to counselors andtheir clients. As moderator of the American Counseling Asso- ciation Keynote Panel at the ACA Convention in Atlanta, Kottler will join panelists Janice L. DeLucia-Waack, Courtland C. Lee, Daya Singh Sandhu and Ann Vernon to discuss \"Giving Creativity Form and Substance\" (April 9, 9:30-10:30 a.m. in the Omni Hotel Grand Ballroom). Creativity is an often over- looked aspect of counseling that deserves more focus, said ACA President Samuel T. Gladding. That's why he chose \"Counsel- ing: A Creative Force in the Fab- ric of Life\" as the theme of this year's convention. \"We, as coun- selors, have the ability and opportunity to not only help clients but society at large in regard to thinking in more diverse ways and generating realities that will make society better,\" he said. \"In counseling, we look at the transition from choice to change. People don't change unless they have choices, and the more choices they have, the more opportunity they have.\" The idea behind this year's ACA Keynote Panel, Gladding said, is that couhelors both~piofessionally and per- sonally, from learning thore about the creative process and its .thgrapeutic benefits. He also hopes that, through hearing tle personal stories of the five pan- elists, more counselors will be encouraged to find their voice and pursue their own creative endeavors. \"I believe that there are a lot of ACA members who want to share their insights with others:\" Gladding said, \"but they do not know how or they are intimidated by what a person - must go through to come outwith a text or manuscript that is substantial and publishable.\" The panel should offer some insight on how to take an idea through the process from \"inspi- ration to perspiration to prod- uct,\" Gladding said. Gladding knows each of the panelists personally and admires their work. \"When I thought about this panel, I envisioned a group of exemplary individuals who were diverse in their per- sonalities, backgrounds, writing styles and interests,' he said. \"I thinkthe authors ... are by far among the best in the profession of counseling. Each has a unique story to tell and an interesting way of telling it. Each has been successful and contributed to the American Counseling Associa- tion and the profession of coun- seling?' Examining links between counseling and creativity The multiple connections be- tween the creative process and the practice of effective counsel- ing aren't lost on any of the pan- elists. For instance, Kottler noted that counselors often encourage their clients to be- come more creative problem- solvers to deal with issues in their lives. One of the best ways to help clients do this, he said, is to model creativity for them and to inspire them. When counselors ask him what it takes to write a book, Kottler tells them they must make it a major priority in their lives. If it's something they 'think they really want to do, he said, they must ask themselves, \"What's stopping me?\" He pointed out that a counselor might use a very similar ap-proach to help clients move beyond the self-imposed excus- es that are holding them back from making positive changes in their lives. Would-be writers in the counseling field have to challenge their own negative thinking, Kottler said, just as they challenge their clients not to make excuses. \"Everyone has a lot of good ideas,\" Kottler said, \"but what does it take to turn those ideas into reality?\" Kottler also noted another par- allel. \"Being creative is about taking risks, investing time and energy and, sometimes, operat- ing without a net,\" he said. \"That's what creative counsel- ing means, too.\" DeLucia-Waack, an associate professor in the Department of Counseling, School and Educa- tional Psychology at the UniVer- sity at Buffalo-SUNY, cited two reasons why she thinks it is im- portant for counselors to give their creativity form and sub- stance. \"One is that creativity, and creative interventions, are very useful in counseling,\" she said. \"People can sing, dance, draw and write down thoughts, ideas and feelings about how they want to be that they. can't verbalize. Thus, it is important for counselors to understand their own creative processes in order to help our clients and our stu- dents. Second, counseling is an art form, and people can learn from each other new and creative ways to intervene in counseling?' Said' Sandhu, professor and former chair of the Department of Educational and Counseling Psychology at the University of' Louisville, \"I strongly agree with the creativity panel's theme for many reasons.. Counseling is considered essentially both a science and an art. The scientif- ic knowledge about our field helps Counselors become com- petent, but they can't become effective unless, like an artist, they have the creativity and sen- sitivity to enter their clients' inner world. It also takes a coun- selor's creativity to generate multiple and varied strategies and solutions to help clients solve their problems?' He continued: \"I believe that the counseling process is a series of creative steps- From the beginning to the end, a counsel- ing session demands creative thinking in deVeloping and maintaining rapport with the client, exploration of issues, cre- ative problem-solving skills and emphasis on construction of new and alternative options. Somuch so that even strategic questioning requires a lot of cre- ativity. For all these reasons, counselors must reach their untapped resources of creativity to give it an artistic form to access their clients. Hopefully, the resolution of their clients' problems in the form of success should become the very sub- stance of counselors' and clients' creativity.\" Tapping into many sources of motivation Each of the panelists has a slightly different motivation for pursuing their ideas from \"inspi- ration to perspiration to prod- uct.\" Lee, professor and director of the Counselor Education Pro- gram at the University of Mary- land and a life member of ACA, has written numerous books, book chapters and articles on multicultural counseling, coun- seling African-American males and adolescent development. \"My writing is based on my vision of what the counseling profession could be and my pas- sion for the issues that I believe in:\" said Lee, a past president of ACA. \"Although there is much perspiration involved in writing, the impact that my creative efforts have had on the profes- sion has been my inspiration.\" DeLucia-Waack said she has always had the desire to be cre- ative. Her first attempt at pro- fessional writing came when she was in the fifth grade. She ,rewrote the lyrics to , Don the environment. Read- er's Digest chose not to publish the fledgling writer, but that didn't dampen DeLucia- Waack's creative spirit. At the same time, she said, her creative pursuits remain pragmatic. \"I see a need:' she said, \"usually from working with my students or from counselors in the field, and I think, 'I know about that, and no one else seems to have written about it.\"' For example, her friend had written songs and music for children of divorce, DeLucia-Waack said, \"but was too busy as a middle school counselor to turn it into group interventions. I said, 'I can do that.\"' The result was one of her two solo book projects, Using Music in Children of Divorce Groups: A Session-by-Session Manual for Counselors. \"I struggle when I write,\" she said, \"but I do think that I enjoy the process and that there is something therapeutic for me about putting it down on paper. It helps me to organize and brings some clarity to what I do, especially around counseling practice.\" ForVemon, professor and coor- dinator of counseling at the Uni- versity of Northern Iowa and author of several emotional edu- cation curriculums for children and adolescents, the creative process offered her a refreshing new view of both herself and her career. \"I realized early on in my career that empirical research was not where my passion was,\" she said. \"But when I can be creative and write more informally, I am more motivated and it doesn't seem like 'work.' ... I never con- sidered myself to be a very cre- ative person, but when I started writing emotional education cur- riculums, I surprised myself by being more creative than I ever had imagined possible. And I had fun thinking of innovative ways to facilitate optimal mental health in cluldren aid adolescents.\" Kottler said his motivation is usually derived from his own curiosity and his attempts to resolve issues that are a source of discomfort in his life. In those instances, he said, the books almost seem to write themselves because he is so engaged in a journey of personal discovery. \"Part of me doesn't care whether it's even published (as I work on a book):' he said. 'I never feel more alive than when I'm creat- ing. ... I'm so excited to find out what is going to happen next in my own story.\" Kottler also acknowledged two other motivating factors. The first is altruistic -the excitement of helping not just one person but, potentially, thou- sands of clients or counselors with the publication of a book. The second reason-boils down to simple ego needs, he said. \"To hold an article in your hand and see your name on it is really sat- isfying,\" Kottler said. Sandhu has also tumed to writ- ing as a source of comfort and knowledge throughout his life. As a young man he authored poems, songs and short stories that dealt with romance and heartache. As he matured, he wrote books about the violence, prejudice and inequities that he had witnessed or experienced. Recently, he has been exploring spirituality through his writings. \"I believe creative process has played a significant part in my life, both personally and profes- sionally,\" he said. \"At the per- sonal level, any time when life,with all its ifs, became difficult and unbearable, I found emo- tional catharsis in creative writ- ing, especially in Punjabi poetry. ... In a similar way, when my professional life came to a cross- roads due to the lack of opportu- nities in my native land, India, it was the creative process or my divergent thinking that opened the new vistas, new hopes and the refreshing prospects for me in the United States?' He continued, \"In the face of both micro and macro frustra- tions, unpleasant and many wrenching experiences in both my personal and professional life, I dare to say that creativity has been the source of strength that not only helped me to sur- vive but also to prevail. It is due to the creative force that .my hurts were positively trans- formed into inner tranquility, peace and personal growth. I strongly believe that through the creative process, my inner pain was restructured and crystallized into spiritual yearning, develop- ing and maintaining more love for my life and for my work?' Goals of the panel Sandhu hopes that those who attend the ACA Keynote Panel will emerge with a greater appre- ciation of the pivotal role that creativity plays in counseling. \"I am also hoping that the partici- pants will be more convinced that it is their creativity that can help them to become more effec- tive in their personal lives and in the lives of their clients:' he said. \"It is creativity that helps hu- mans cope with crises, view their problems differently and activate the zest of life?' Vernon said she wants those who attend the panel to leave knowing \"that there are many ways to write and that it doesn't seem like drudgery if you are able to be creative and innovative?' Kottler, who has helped more than 100 first-time writers tell their stories in the \"Finding Your Way\" column (published month- ly in Counseling Today), believes that the ACA Keynote Panel will embolden others in the counsel- ing field to find their creative voice. He encourages counseling professionals interested in telling their stories to submit a column for consideration to jkottler@ fullerton.edu.

Aside from programs getiing the ax and a few presidential initia- tives, all other DOE programs would be frozen at FY,2005 levels or slightly reduced. Overall federal spending on education programs would be reduced by $530 million, thefirst time in more than a decade that total funding has been cut. More significant than the FY 2006 cuts in domestic discre- tionary programs are the more than $200 billion in cutA called for during the following four years. The budget proposal does not detail how these huge cuts in spending from FY 2007 through FY 2010 would be made. The reductions would be locked in through annual caps. Simultaneously, any new spending on \"mandatory\" pro- grams (such as Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security) would have to be offset by spending reductions in other programs. The budget calls for $45 billion in net reductions in spending on Medicaid during the next five years. While sharply curtailing do- mestic spending, the budget proposes tax cuts that wouldcost the U.S. Treasury $129 bil- lion during the next five years (until the FY 2009 target for reducing the deficit) and more than $1 trillion during the five years after that. In contrast to capping domestic spending and requiring offsets for new spending on entitlements, the Bush administration proposes exempting tax cuts from any such budget enforcement rules. It is unclear how closely Congress will follow the presi- dent's lead. While some mem- bers of Congress are committed to deficit reduction, others have expressed reservations about the cuts. The fate of this sum- mer's appropriations battles will be predetermined by the outcome of deliberations on congressional budget targets and the budgetary rules by which Congress chooses to live.

Lee, PhD University of Maryland These counselors are not attempting to prescribe one way of meeting professional goals, rather their aim is to challenge readers to examine what they most hope to accomplish in their own professional careers. The diversity ofperspectivespresented in this book will encourage readers to search for their own paths.\" --Gerald Corey, EdD, ABPP, Fellow, ACA California State University at Fullerton Fifteen leaders in the counseling field share their personal and professional stories in this refreshingly honest and deeply moving book. Through powerful and revealing narratives, these esteemed counselors disclose how they chose their career paths, what challenges they have faced, what factors contributed to their successes and failures, how they balance work and their personal lives, and what advice they have for those entering the profession.

Soon to'be released in its fifth edition, the book has sold more than half-a-million copies in hardback. This standard text in counseling education covers aspects of group therapy such as interpersonal learning, group cohesive- ness, transparency and transference, patient selection, problem patients, spe- cialized therapy groups and training the group therapist. \"The majority of people in our profes' sion have read at least one of his books, especially in the group area,\" said ACA President Samuel T. Gladding. \"He writes like a poet.- just beautiful prose and very practical but descriptive. He is a New York Times best seller in regard to books that deal with the therapeutic process, so he reaches people on two levels -the professional level and the popular level. Those levels converge in emphasizing what counseling is all about, how it's done and how people benefit?' Yalom has developed a highly distinc- tive brand of fiction that he refers to as \"teaching novels?' In his 1989 best seller Love's Executioner and Other Tales of Psychotherapy, he meshed psychotherapy with storytelling, and in his 1993 novel When Nietzsche Wept. A Novel of Obses- sion, he used fiction and history to explore voids in philosophy and psychotherapy. Yalom has a unique skill for presenting complex ideas and theories in a clear and engaging writing style. Many of his stu- dents and peers agree that his textbooks read more like novels, enticing the reader to keep the pages tuining. Both those in the mental health profession and the general public have praised his works of fiction. Love's Executioner and Other Tales of Psychotherapy is a collection of 10 in- triguing tales in which Yalom uncovers the mysteries, frustrations, pathos and humor at the heart of the therapeutic encounter. In recounting his patients' dilemmas, Yalom gives the reader a rare and enthralling glimpse into their person- al desires and motivations. His most suc- cessful work of fiction, When Nietzsche Wept, is set in 1882, with Josef Breuer, ar eminent physician and mentor of Sig- mund Freud, striving to apply his recently discovered \"talk therapy\" to the philoso- pher Friedrich Nietzsche. The original tale portrays a cleverly imagined relationship between the philosopher and one of the founding fathers of psychoanalysis. The book won the Commonwealth Gold Medal for best fiction of 1993. \"I intended them as pedagogical works,\" Yalom said. \"They have been widely translated -each into about 15 to 20 languages -and have had consider- able distribution abroad; When Nietzsche Wept, for example, was on top of the Israeli best-seller list for over four years.\" From bookworm to novelist Yalom was born in Washington, D.C., 'to Russian immigrants in 1931. He livedin the inner city in a meager apartment, upstairs from his parents' 'grocery store. During his childhood, Washingtonr was a segregated city, and he lived in the midst of a poor, black neighborhood. Life on the streets was often perilous, so he sought refuge and fantasy in books. Twice a week he would make a hazardous bicycle trek to the central library to stock up on supplies. \"My book choices were capricious, directed in part by the library archited- ture; the large, centrally placed bookcase on biography caught my attention early, and I spent an entire year going through that bookcase from A (John Adams) to Z (Zoroaster);' he said. \"But it was mainly in fiction where I found a refuge, an alter- nate, more satisfying world, a source of inspiration and wisdom. Sometime early in life I developed the notion -one which Ihave never relinquished -that writing a novel is the very finest thing'a person can do.\" As a young man Yalom knew his career choices were limited to either taking over the family business or going to medical school. \"Medical school seemed closer to Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky, and I entered upon my medical training already having decided to go into psychiatry,\" he said. \"It's always been the human encounter that has interested me the most.\" Creative counseling Yalom said in a past interview for an online magazine that \"What feels most central for me is being creative and look- ing at the way in which I have creative talents and gifts that I haven't used. I basically see myself as a storyteller engaged in ideas that have to do with an existential, deeper approach to life. I feel very uncomfortable with the idea of these gifts being unused?' - His work fuels his own creativity, which he uses as a means to give back to his patient. \"Nothing inspires me more than working hard and good in hour ses- sions with a patient. Seeing something come to life in another person (during therapy) is very inspiring,\" he said. Yalom strongly believes that creativity and counseling are related and that good counselors are creative in their practice. \"In one section bf The Gift of Therapy, I say to create a new therapy for every client. I mean to be provocative in a way as an opposition to the idea thatwe use a manual or a set way to work with each patient\" he said. \"You need to engage the patient and be creative. You have to try to see what it is that this patient really needs in therapy to move, and you try to facili- tate that. One has to be creative in one's work as a therapist. You can't really do. that immediately as a young professional, but as you get older and wiser you can find different ways to approach clients. That is one of the things about our field - as you get older you get better. That's not true in a lot of professions.\"Group work Although Yalom has done extensive research with gropp work, he doesn't pre- fer one setting over another. \"I really like to do both group and individual work, and I see strengths in both,\" he said, noting that while he respects the power of thera- py groups, he hasn't been involved with them as much as he would have liked dur- ing the last few years. \"One of the reasons why I wrote The Schopenhauer Cure is to try to get across to people how powerful groups can be and try to illustrate the magic that occurs:' he said. \"Therapy groups tend to get some bad press from the media, and often they are presented in mocking or ridiculing ways. I think that in a lot of the ways in a contemporary' practice, you are using 'groups for psycho-educational groups and behavioral-modification groups, but you are not using the groups' major strength -the power of the interpersonal interac- tion in the group?' He hopes The Schopen- hauer Cure will exemplify his view of group therapy to the public and to the young therapist and noted that his latest novel is almost like a companion volume to the fifth edition of The Theory and Practice of Group Psychotherapy. The newly revised edition often references The Schopenhauer Cure for further explana- tions or illustrations of concepts present in the text.The future of counseling , Yalom said he credits much of his abil- ity as a therapist to being in tlierapy him- self, and he encourages those new to the profession to do the same. \"I have a very strong urging for young therapists (to) know as n'iuch as they possibly can about themselves;' he 'said. \"It's their most powerful tool -to know their own self and personality. I urge them to be in ther- apy early on in their career add perhaps many times throughout their life. Therapy is the most powerful kind of education they can attain?' He also advises young mental health pro- fessionals to continue their education and exploration of the field. \"I want to draw as much as I can from all the various thera- pies;' Yalom said. \"I tend to be very plural- istic. I think you need wide education, not just in one form of therapy, but as wide of an array of therapies as possible. Young counselors should never stop learning about the field. The more training, the more supervision, the better. It's very important educating yourself and learning. The kind of material we are dealing with is infinitely deep. You can never lea'm enough?' The opening session of the ACA Con- vention is from 9:30-11 a.m. in the Omni Hotel Grand Ballroom. Yalom will be signing books immediately after the opening session. Many of his books can be purchased beforehand at the ACA Pre- convention Bookstore and in the ACA Book Shop in the Exposition Hall, -as well as outside the Grand Ballroom beginning at 8:30 a.m.f 15Yalom Hypnosis Certification IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY For Mental Health Professional Only Two Categories are Available for Qualified Applicants 1) National Board Certified Clinical Hypnotherapist (NBCCH) 0 Yes, I am in private practice.

As it stands flow; counselors who move out of the state in which they are licensed cannot take that credential with them. They must apply for another license in the state of -their iew residency. They' are faced with the hassle of digging out old school documents, supervisor evaliations and test scores to start the application process all over again. The AASCB Portability Plan and the National Credential Registry would make it easier for licens- ing boards to allow counselors to move in and out of a state. The future of reciprocity lies in the hands of the state licens- ing boards. AASCB recognizes the many differences of state -licensure requirements and has provided its mhembers with two options. Eligibility requirements for registrants of the PortabilityPlan fall into either Tier I or Tier II, based on AASCB members who require 48 semester hours for licensure (Tier 1) or 60 hours (Tier II). For the complete list of Tier I and H requirements on mandatory supervised hours and post-license experience, visit www.aascb.org and click on the \"Portability Plan\" link. Once the state has designated itself as a Tier I or Tier II state, counselors registered under that tier will have the option of mov- ing to another state listed under the same tier structure, The biggest obstacle to states accept- ing the portability plan is the inconsisteit licensure require- ments from state to state. Cur- rently, 19 states require 60 gradu- ate credits, 13 states require 48 graduate credits abd 15 states require only a master's degree. Many states also vary on the re- quired number of hours of clini- cal experience. Several states are working to change their current licensure laws to facilitate adop- tion of the tier plans. \"The tier structure has nothing to do with one state being better than the -other,\" Wilson said. \"But that is one of the criticisms we are getting from the states. We want to clarify that (the tier system is) more of a designation rather than a ranking. This has the potential to be a very power- ful tool to counselors, potential employers, state licensure boards and, ultimately, the public. We are also looking into having a national directory where some- one could go online and verify a counselor's licensure.\" ACA President Samuel T. Gladding agrees that both the portability plan and the registry will be very valuable to coun- selors nationwide. \"WhatAASCB is doing is really addressing the future of counseling in regard to the portability of heensure,\" he -said. \"Since- we live in a mobile society, it's good to see what is happening pow and view what is planned. I think young profession- als, or those who are more mobile, could benefit greatly from this Education Session. It's a work in progress, but it really is exciting. AASCB has come a long way in helping the counseling profession and its professionals:' This Presidential Featured Ses- sion is scheduled for Friday, April 8, from 1:15-2:45 p.m. in the Georgia World Congress Center, room A412.

Ready to take on the day with hot coffee in one hand and a highlighter in the other, they feverishly mark which Education Sessions they want to see. With more than 300 sessions to choose from (plus special activities, luncheons and meetings), scheduling your day can be a bit overwhelming. ACA allots Eduction Session time slots to each of its divisions, allowing them to select or \"spon- sor\" topics of discussion. The sessions can be broken into 90-, 60- or 30- minute sessions. Many of the divisions call for proposals for these sessions and choose the best ones. Others select the best presentations from their own convention sessions. Following is a glimpse at what ACA divisions have planned for Atlanta. Think of it as the Cliffs Notes to the all inclusive-pro- gram guide.

It was begin- ning to. make sense to me how childhood poverty, which I never experienced, might adversely affect people's physical and psy- chosocial conditions. Immediately after the robbery, I was 'preoccupied with the question, \"What can create a monster like the robber?\" But the disturbing social and ecological environ- ment pervasive for some African-Ameri- cans began to change my picture of the attacker. He was not bom evil. But at least in some sense he was a victim of an oppressive societal system where a vicious cycle of deprivation can exist from generation to generation. If he grew up lacking the care and safety that I expe- rienced, how could he be expected to care about my'velfare? New cultural knowl- edge and perspectives were helping me to at least cognitively work through my trau- ma related to African-Americans, but in -other ways much more personal growth was needed. Interactions with clients, classmates, supervisors and faculty members gave me firsthand experiences with diverse groups and helped me work through cultural conflicts both on the emotional and expe-riential level. Working with adolescents in a residential treatment center during my internship gave me another form of insight. \"K\" was a sturdy 16-year-old African-American youth with severe anger problems. He was born out of wed- lock, and his mother terminated parental custody when he was still young. His psychosocial history documents men- tioned an imprecise report of sexual and physical abuse by his mother's live-in boyfriend. The history also indicated that he had experienced more than 15 place- ments, including group homes and foster care families. He was understandably dis- trustful of adults, including mental health professionals, and was angry at how life and the state had treated him. I realized I would feel very angry myself if I were in his situation. K was never talkative, but one day he began telling me about slavery in a very personal way. He said, \"You know, we were forced to live here, and now they don't want us no more.\" He continued to talk about what could have been a peaceful life in Africa living off the land iif a loving community of people like himself \"if my ancestors didn't get caught by traders.\" I had hopes that my interventions would work with K, but his physical aggression toward peers and staff members contin-ued. It seemed clear to me that he needed more than we could provide, so I set myself to convincing the administration and staff that he would benefit from long- term interventions and stable placement. Just when I convinced them that this was the thing to do, I received a final notice that he would be removed from the center if he caused another incident. A few days later I came upon K physi- cally confronting another resident. Other staff members were not intervening, so I ran up to K and tried to stop him from further approaching the resident by putting my hands against his body. The power difference was obvious. He picked me up and tried to approach the resident while holding me off the floor. Over his shoulders, I heard some of the staff screaming, \"Don't do this! You can't hurt this lady!\" I heard myself screaming, \"What are you doing? K, think! Don't you remember? You need to think!\" After carrying me a few feet more, he stopped, put me on the ground and turned his back to the resident, spitting out some curse words. Within a week, he was involved in another incident and was sent to a differ- ent facility. I felt powerless over his placement decision as it involved the administration, staff, social worker and the state. They were beyond my control. It seemed clear to me that K's anger had accumulated over the years and that he did not know what to do with it. As such, I also felt powerless to deal with his enormous anger, because I could not find a means to directly access it or work with it within the short period we had together. .I was disappointed in my attempt to physically stop K because it could have put him in a position to receive even more severe consequences-had he actually hurt me. On the other hand, I was desperate to stop him because I knew he didn't have another chance before being sent away. I wanted so much to show him that he had my full trust, that I cared about his future and that there were adults with whom he could place his trust. I seemed to know instinctively that he would not hurt me under any circumstances, but the question of how to act on that instinctive feeling is not so easily answered. Although I must have thought and felt many things during that moment, there seemed to be internal as well as external forces that moved my whole being to take action. I -was again finding out just how complex this helping profession and cross-cultural relation- ships can be. K taught me about his culture and helpbd me to eventually overcome my generalized fear of African-American males. The experience convinced me that the best way to break through negative stereotyping, prejudice and cultural mis- trust is to directly and personally interact with culturally different people on an individual basis. These experiencestaught me about the range of cognitive, experiential and emotional learning nec- essary to truly come to grips with the issues surrounding race and culture, where each domain interacts with the other to intricately weave the nature of human experience. I have experienced intense emotion fear, anger, sadness -since my arrival in the United States, particularly related to my trauma around African-Americans. .But by learning various cultural concepts (for example, historical hostility and racial identity development) from read- ings and workshops, I was able to con- ceptualize and reframe the experiences, resulting in a better understanding of spe- cific behaviors and emotions. Having learned these lessons, both emotionally and cognitively, I was able to translate these concepts into reality through my work with K. Based on personal experience, I have spme recommendations for other gradu- ate students who Wish to further develop their multicultural understanding and skills: N First know that there can be great dif- ferences between your reactions to the world and those of others from different cultures. M Plunge into different cultures and experience discomfort to the point where you feel the need to do something about it. * Be prepared for strong emotional reactions whei dealing with racial issues and resolve the emotional conflicts before working with clients. * Search for multicultural conceptual frameworks that give you insights and new perspectives on your personal expe- nences. The relatively homogeneous cultural and racial composition iri Japan never gave me the opportunity to experience the diversity found here in the United States. Theorists and researchers have linked racial, ethnic and cultural identity devel- opment with self-actualization. I can now see how it has been critical to my own personal and professional development. Rather than, being taken for granted or simply tolerated, the diversity in the Unit- ed States should be seen as offering valu- able opportunities for expanding human development. Beyond tolerance and ac- ceptance of differences, proactive explo- ration of diversity may well be a key to acquiring our truest forms of multicultur- alism.

We tend to forget that we experienced the world for our first two years without using lan- guage or play. This nonverbal, action-oriented mode of expres- sion in understanding is available throughout one's lifetime but is dominant during this phase of development. Around the age of 2, children are beginning to understand and use language. However, their preferred mode for engaging the world is based in fantasy and pretend play. During this period children are compelled to sym- bolize and animate as they con- struct meanings of the world around them. Eventually, chil- dren of this age group began to use the rich environment of pre- tend play-and -fantasy to learn and negotiate developmental challenges. During this phase children still actively make use of the action-based mode previ- ously discussed. They also-have access to some use of language, but this mode does not become fully dominant until the teen years. If you observe children inthe age range of 2 to 6, it is obvi- ous that action and imaginary play are the preferred languages that they \"speak.\" To effectively communicate with a child of this age we don't need much lah- guage. We do, however, need to recall and use our earliest forms of communication: action and imaginary play. As with the non- verbal, action-oriented mode, this \"imaginary play\" form of expression is available through- out one's lifetime but is domi- nant during this phase of devel- opment. Around the age of 6, when children are entering first grade, they become more focused on the outer world and are domi- nated less by play and fantasy themes. At this age children have developed solid language skills and become enamored with industry and production as they advance in school. Howev- er, the modes of action and imaginary play are still very active. Children of this age will rarely sit idly and talk. They still prefer to speak and to communi-cate while in action and play. To effectively communicate with a child of this age we heed to inte- grate action, play and language. As a parent or counselor we now see the world of the pre- adolescent child filled with developmental stages that all need to be negotiated through action, imaginary play and lan- guage. Children have little diffi- culty speaking guages because they are devel- opmentally pre-wired to do so. In my experience it is often adults who have forgotten their abilities to communicate in other ways because they have been so long dominated by the language mode. Parents and novice counselors often don't realize that their dominant use of language is not effective in communicating with young children. Children I have worked with often express their impression of the adult world as being filled with language they do not understand. Often chil- dren will draw pictures or play to show that adults are speakingto them in a language they do not understand. Do you remem- ber the teacher in the Charlie Brown cartoon? Do you remem- ber the voice with unintelligible, droning language? Children I have worked with have drawn pictures of adults with \"big mouths\" who are perceived in the same way. Is it any wonder that I fre- quently hear this statement from parents about their children: \"I don't understand. It seems as if they're not listening to me or don't understand what I am say- ing.\" Could it be that we are not speaking to children in a lan- guage they can understand? I frequently tell my students that exclusively using language (no action or play) to speak to a child is akin to counseling an adult by using a foreign lan- guage they did not understand. Let's turn to a brief common- sense strategy that counselors and parents can use to effective- ly communicate with young children. - First, when attempting tocommunicate with a child, don't focus on language. In fact, don't say anything. Observe what the child is doing by attending to their actions and imaginary play without speaking. (As a guide- line, I often tell beginning coun- selors to observe themselves on tape and limit themselves to the same number and type of words the child is using. The tapes usu- ally reveal the adult counselor using far too much language and not enough action and play.) As you observe, you should eas- ily be able to determine what developmental modes of expres- sion and themes a child prefers using. Second, using body-based actions and imaginary play, nat- urally integrate the issues you wish to convey to the child with- out resorting to language or rup- turing the child's interactive play. Let me share an example from a personal rather than clin- ical perspective that illustrates these two points.

We tried \"speaking\" to our daughter about the various reasons why a big girl should not use a pacifier. Despite our well-intentioned and creative verbal attempts, we were unsuccessful and became frus- trated. As I thought of the situa- tion from the perspective of a professional counselor, I felt foolish. I also felt that my daughter was \"tuning me out\" since I didn't have the courtesy to speak to her in a language she understood. The next day I sat down for five minutes and just watched my daughter play with her ani- mal farm She was taking the farm animals and other assorted toys, showing them the way home and making them a proper bed on the farm. After my daughter understood that I was not going to say anythipg (much to her relief I might add) she invited me to play with one of the farm animals. We had fun, and I felt connected with my daughter. I still needed to pro- mote my agenda for discontinu- ing use of the pacifier, but now I had a new modality to commu- nicate my concerns. Rather than saying a word, I looked for a way to use the play farm charac- ters and the theme of taking them to bed. A small brown beaver with large front teeth grabbed my attention. I aptly named him \"Bucktooth Beaver\" and grabbed a play pacifier from a doll's crib. We made a bed for him on the farm and I put him to bed while imploring Bucktooth to give up his \"binki\" (pacifier) like a big beaver should. Soon Bucktooth began spitting out his binki before he went to bed because it was bad for such beautiful teeth. My daughter thought this was hilarious and entertaining. She recruited me daily to play Buck- tooth Beaver. Not surprisingly, after a wdek iy daughter relin- quished her pacifier, noting that it was bad for her teeth. In retro- spect, had I hoted her develop- AMERiCAN COUNSEUNGIASSO CIATIONmental need for play early on I would have had much better suc- cess and less stress trying to rid her of the pacifier habit. In summary, developmental theory not only informs us of stages, issues and needs, but ofthe child's ability and prefer- ence to communicate in a modality other than language. Children negotiate develop- mental issues through action, imaginary play and language. Each child's unique makeupdetermines the balance and preference for these modalities because development is in- escapable, and all children will need to act, play and speak as they construct meaning for their world.

KOTT1ER Whose story is this? .It was another gorgeous day in the Himalayas. There were 10 of us strung out along the ridge, part of a team that had spent the previous weeks doing work- shops on behalf of the Mimistry of Health in Nepal. We were also distributing scholarships as part of the Medhav Ghimire Trust, a foundation I established to help support young girls who are at risk for recruitment in the sex trade because their families can't afford to keep them in school. It had been a tough few weeks moving from one venue to the next, to remote villages in far- flung regions and in front of a variety of audiences, including doctors, nurses, teachers and policy advisers. We had worked well together and felt deserved- ly proud of what we had accom- plished in so short a time. Now it was time fot our reward. I had arranged for the10 of us to go trekking together in the Annapurna region of the Himalayas. We hired an outfit- ter, several dozen Sherpas and porters to handle the logistics and campsites, and off we went into a remote wilderness area in the mountains. After a few days adjusting to the altitude, the group seemed to have found its stride. We had nat- urally gravitated into two groups composed of the \"fast walkers\" and the \"relaxed strollers.\" We were halfway through the day's walk, having completed a grueling clirpb from our camp to a clearing with spectacular views of the snow-covered peaks on both sides. Although physically demanding, it had been a peace- ful morning in which we had encountered no one outside of our own group. Group A (as we called our- selves) stopped for lunch to takein the view and gather our breath for the final ascent into camp. There were five of us together, with the second group perhaps an hour behind. When it came time to \"saddle up\" and begin walking again,, Nicole elected to remain behind and continue her nip. She decided to wait for Group B to catch up, while the rest of us were anx- ious to forge ahead. As the day neared its end, we arrived in camp weary but proud. We had made good time and now had an extra hour to relax before the second group arrived. When Group B finally stumbled in, we didn't have to count heads to notice that some- one was missing. \"Where's Nicole?\" I asked. \"What do you mean?\" they answered. \"We thought she was with you:. \"What are you talking about? The last time we saw her she was taking a nap at the lunch spot waiting to join you?' After sorting things out, we discovered to our horror that Nicole was missing. Somehow, somewhere along the route, sheKottler's team poses for a photo on a bridge in the Himalayas. had wandered off the trail. Or perhaps she'd been injured. We spent hours and hours that night sitting around a fire talking about all the possibilities. The Sherpas and porters had sent out seafch parties but had found nqo sign of Nicole whatsoever. The most optimistic among us insist- ed that she might have wandered into a village, but we knew this was a relatively remote possibil- ity. Throughout the long day we had not passed a single settle- ment or even encountered anoth- er human being:As the night dragged on, it became colder and darker. Our hopes diminished with the fire fueled by green wood.-Maybe Nicole had fallen. Perhaps she was unconscious,. lying in a gully, atid that's why she hadn't responded to the calls. Some of us considered the likelihood that Maoists operat- ing in the area had captured her and were holding her for ran- som. This was, after all, a coun- try in the midst of civil war.

The tremendous amount of diversity that exists in the area is the most surpris- ing aspect of Atlanta. The metro area is more populated than you think. Most people that live in Atlanta are not natives. Tourist tips for ACA Convention attendees: Please be considerate to tem- porarily adapt to the \"Southern way\" and realize that faster is not always better and that being friendly is not a precursor to a hustle. Don't be afraid to ask people questions if you need assistance. Atlanta has some great spots. Take time to visit neighborhoods such as Vir- ginia-Highland, Little Five Points, East Atlanta and Grant Park. Do a city tour if you have time. What makes Atlanta unique? The mix of big city-small town appeal. Atlanta is unique because it has been able to maintain the \"country town feel\" while provid- ing Atlanta's most over- looked treasure? I think the social and political history of Atlanta is one of its most overlooked treasures. The state of Georgia was one of the original 13 colonies. During the Civil War, Georgia and Atlanta played a major part in many piv- otal battles. Remember, Gone With the Wind is all about how Georgians took part in the Civil War. GenW.T. Sherman burned a path of destruction from Atlanta allthewayto Savannah. He did spare Savannah and gave itto President Lincoln as a gift to the Union. Atlanta played another major part in the battle for civil rights in the South. Then through this struggle Martin Luther King Jr., a man from Atlanta, led the nation through a nonviolent change that the world had yet to see and proba- blywon'tsee again. Even though Atlanta has seen many battles in its history, we still have learned to be tolerant of each other and learn from our differences. What one place best sums up Atlanta's spirit? Piedmont Park, Centennial Olympic Park and LenoxSquare.Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site 460 Auburn Ave. N.E. www.nps.gov/mplu/ This national historic site includes the birthplace and grave of the famed civil rights leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, as well as Ebenezer Baptist Church (407-413 Auburn Ave.), where King's grandfather and father were ministers and King was a co- pastor. A visitor center houses exhibits pertaming to King andthe civil rights movement.

POTTER-EFRON, MISWI PH.DT This book can change the life of the angry person and the lives of those around him. Strong practical advice. Clear Answers.

What's on your must-see list? You're in luck The Atlanta Braves' opening night atTurner Field is April 81 In my opinion, the other must-sees are the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site and the Jimmy Carter Library and Museum. Also of interest are the CNN StudioTourthe High Museum of Art and, across the street from the ACA Convention, Centennial Olympic Park. It's great for an outdoor lunch after getting your food in the CNN Center. A few miles north of downtown is Buckhead, one of Atlanta's toniest suburbs and the center of nightlife in Atlanta. It has great restaurants and clubs. What's your favorite restau- rant in the area? For the experience, there are two perennial favorites: The Varsity for Southern hot dogs, and Mary Mac's Tea Room for a Southern meal. The finest restaurant in town in my opin- ion is Nikolai's Roof. For inter- national fun, try out your belly dancing moves atthe Imperial Fez. Another great restaurant is the Sun Dial Restaurant atop the Westin Hotel. What's the most surprising aspect of Atlanta? Most people only see Harts- field-Jackson International Airport as they transfer through going somewhere else. There is a joke that even when you die you have to go through Hartsfield-Jackson. Surprising to some people is the sprawl of the city (90 miles from one edge to the other),thetraffic,the diversity andthe green beauty of the South. Tourist tips for ACA Conven- tion attendees: For Internet tips go to www.AccessAtlanta.com For transportation, use our MARTA mass transit system (wwwlits marta.com/). Try grits for breakfast (put butter and salt on them) at the Waffle Housel You really will find Southern charm and hospitality -prac- tice saying \"Y'all.\" It's Uya-all in one syllable. Please do not say \"You all\"I The area around the convention center and the hotel has a lot to offer. If you want a day trip go to Plains/ Pine Mountain and see peanut country and Calloway Gar- dens, ortake a trip outto Stone Mountain (it's not a politically correct place and may be offensive to some). Or try Helen, a faux German village nestled in the North Georgia Mountains about two hours north of Atlanta. What makes Atlanta unique? Its history. Atlanta was once called the \"City too busy to hate.\" The city's diversity is rich and welcoming, We are a major metropolitan city with Southern charm. Atlanta has a symbol of a Phoenix rising from the ashes -triumphant and hopeful for the future! What is Atlanta's most over- looked treasure? Barbeque and ribs along Auburn Avenue. What one place best sums up Atlanta's spirit? Probably while the ACA Con- vention is in town, the opening of the Braves baseball season at Turner Field.League Baseball's Atlanta Braves in action here (the team's opening home stand runs from April 8-13), or enjoy a one-hour tour of the 50,000-seat ballpark. Tours take in the field, a Braves luxury suite, the press box and broadcast booth, the dugout and the players' clubhouse. You'll also visit Scouts Alley, a hands- on educational/ entertainment area where you can test your own hitting and pitching skills. Exhibits in the museum include Atlanta's 1995 World Series tro- phy and the bat Hank Aaron used to break Babe Ruth's all- time home run record. Underground Atlanta 50 Upper Alabama St. www.underground-atlanta.com/ It's said that locals prefer the eating, shopping and entertain- ment options found in the Buck- head and Virginia-Highland neighborhoods, but Underground Atlanta also has its appeal, espe- cially for convention-goers and tourists in the downtown area.The 12-acre urban marketplace, which marks the original down- town area, is so named because in the 1920s, concrete viaducts were built to elevate the street system above the market, allow- ing for better traffic flow. Mer- chants moved their wares to the new \"second level;' leaving the \"underground\" storefronts most- ly for storage. Underground Atlanta experienced a rebirth in 1969 (and a re-rebirth in 1989) as an entertainment complex complete with stores, restau- rants, nightclubs, special events and history tours. World of Coca-Cola 55 Martin Luther King Jr Dr. S.W. www.woccatlanta.com/ Adjacent to Underground Atlanta, the World of Coca-Cola allows you to learn everything you ever wanted to know about the beverage created in Atlanta more than 110 years ago.

What are some highlights? And what do I need to do to sign up? A: You betcha! ACA's Career Center in Atlanta, located in the exhibit hall at the Georgia World Congress Center, willoffer a myriad of opportunities to counselors interested in addressing their own career development. Of course, there will be inter- view opportunities. The list of employers is beginning to take shape, and we'll have more interview space than in previous years to accommodate our grow- ing program. R6sum6 referralwill be available for employers who are unable to interview can- didates during the convention. Volunteer career counselors from the National Career Development Association and the National Employment -Counseling Association will be on hand to answer questions and provide job search assis- tance. And refreshment breaks in the exhibit hall will double as networking opportunities in the space reserved for the Career Center. ACA is excited about its new private practice initiative, and we will welcome Bob Walsh and Notm Dasenbrook for a special presentation on Friday afternoon, April 8, to helpintroduce this new program. An informal question-and-answer period will follow. There will, no doubt, be many questions about the new American Association of State Counseling Board's License Portability Plan, and we'll have -experts on hand during the Sat- urday morning coffee break in the Career Center to answer those questions on an informal, individualized basis. Additional programs are in the works to address a variety of professional concerns ex- pressed by counselors.

Magoon, 82, a retired University of Maryland psychology professor and direc- tor of the school's counselifng center, died Jan. 1 at Riderwood Village, a retirement community in Silver Spring, Md. He had pneumonia and coronary artery disease. Magoon, a life member of the American Counseling Associa- tion, was also the founder of the National Counseling Center Data Bank in 1962. The data- bank, -an annual survey of coun- seling center directors, cata- logued innovative programs and activities. In the late 1950s, he was responsible for forming the American Board of Professional Standards in Vocational Coun- seling, which later became the International Association of Counseling Services. Magoon was born in Lancast- er, N.H. and served in the Army in the Pacific during World War II. He also spent time in the Army's specialized training pro- gram in personnel psychology, studying with psychologists at the University of California- Berkeley. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1947 with degrees in psychology and edu- cation. After working as a psy- chology instructor at Colgate University, he earned his mas- ter's degree in psychology and a doctorate in counseling psy-' chology, both from the Univer- sity of Minnesota. ACA's execu- tive director from 1971-1983, met Magoon when both were graduate students at the Univer- sity of Minnesota. \"He was one of the most creative and enthusi- astic persons I have known,\" Lewis said. 'Tom had a full life career at the University of Mary- land and served in many very significant leadership roles inour profession as well. He was, in my perception, a founding father of college-based counsel- ing, and he created and main- tained an incredible research- focused database used by hun- dreds of sister institutions of higher education.\" Magoon joined the University of Maryland Counseling Center in 1955. In 1960, he was named the center's director, a position he held until 1988. He also joined the faculty at the Univer- sity of Maryland and was involved in both the Counseling and Personnel Services Depart- ment and the Department of Psychology. He was professor emeritus in both departments and director emeritus at the counseling center. \"I am here today in large part because, more than 30 years ago, Tom Magoon appointed himself my mentor,\" said Vivian S. Boyd, director of the University of Maryland Counseling Center. \"He possessed great vision and an endless spirit of innovation. Tom saw the university as a com- munity, and at the heart of that community he saw the counsel- ing center. He very much believed that the counseling cen- ter was the moral compass of the community and that it existed to enrich the university.\" She continued, \"It was Tom who forced counseling center staff out of our offices in the Shoemaker Building and onto the campus. He would devise ingenious ways to achieve his proactive agenda. In this in- stance, his handy dandy project, known as the \"Habit Breakout,' in essence got counseling center staff out onto the campus where they could experience firsthand, and hence better understand, the many barriers confronting students.\"A tribute in the newsletter of the University of Maryland Counseling Center also touted Magoon's innovative nature: \"Dr Magoon's ... innovations included 'alternative (counseling beyond the one-to-one), campus outreach and consultationt (or, as he called it, 'upstream from the counseling center') and the development of a uniquely structured counseling center. He recognized students' need for services beyond the psychologi- cal and vocational before many of his colleagues. The result was his overseeing the development of a counseling center that now inchides a Learning Assistance Service, a Disability Support Service, a Testing and Research Unit, and a Parent Consultation and Child Evaluation Service?' Said Boyd, \"As an agent of change, Tom set the bar high. He leaves a magnificent legacy for academic and applied psy- chology as well as education. It was our former vice president of student affairs, William L.* Thomas, who in my view de- scribed it best: 'Tom came to the University of Maryland in those days when counseling centers were just beginning to emerge on college and university cam- puses across the country, and he simply hung the moon.\" - Said Jim O'Neil, a professor of family studies and education- al psychology at the University of Connecticitt, \"Tom was my mentor, colleague and friend for 35 years. ... He was a pioneer in the professions of counseling and counseling psychology. He made major contributions to the professioi, (and) his annual databank survey of counseling centers in the United States sig- nificantly shaped how today's mental health services are deliv-ered at all our colleges and uni- versities nationwide.\" He continued, \"Tom was an inspiration to everyone he met. He believed in hard work and creative innovations to help people help themselves. He was a wise inentor to many and had a dedp compassion for those who were hurting and marginalized in society. His mission was to infuse people with hope and optimism. He personally touched people with his energy, brilliance and sense of humor. He will be sorely missed, but the differences he made in the profession and individual people's lives will last for many years into the future.\" Magoon's honors included theUniversity of Maryland Chan- cellors Award, the Maryland Psychological Association's out- standing psychologist award and a lifetime achievement award from the American College Stu- dent Personnel Association. -Survivors include his wife of 55 years, Mary Constance FroAss Magoon; five children, Peter G. Magoon; Daniel J. Magoon, Kenzie M. Raulin, John B. Magoon and Steven T. Magoon; a sister, Jean Frances Hubbard; six gratidchildren and a great-grandson. Contributions in Magoon's memory can be sent to the Uni- versity of Maryland Founda- tion/Counseling Center, '2108 Mitchell Building, College Park, Md. 20742-5221. E Leters Continued from page 4 But let us all recognize that the tdrror experienced from inter- personal violence is not caused by a. stranger -for a political cause, but rather it is caused by the people who live in the home of the victim. \"We as professionals can give a voice to interpersonal trauma and, in doing so, we can work to provide therapeutic interven- tion and education for preven- tion. I have long believed and-practiced that when we com- bine treatment with prevention we are increasing the likelihood 'that abuse and other fornis of violence do not reoccur to the very people who entrust their health and well-being to us. I would also like to share that-the Association for Traumatic Stress Specialists is an excellent organization for our member- ship to consider if they' are working or want to work in thefield of trauma.

What should you do when you recognize that you've engaged in an ethically questionable practice that doesn't qualify as an egre- gious violation of the American Counseling Association's or American Psychological Associ- ation's codes of ethics? In Fallibility: Personal Responsibil-. ity for Nonegregious Ethics Infractions\" (Counseling and Values, January 2005, pages 120- 131), Elizabeth Reynolds Welfel presents a useful guide for repair- ing and learning from ethical missteps. She uses three coun- selors' situations to demonstrate the process. One counselor has allowed personal problems to interfere with his treatment ofclients. Another counselor has slipped into discussing clients' personal issues (without identify- ing information) while chatting with a friend at a restaurant. The last counselor has given a client to whom he was attracted fee considerations that he would not usually offer (though she was unaware of this and left satisfied with her course of counseling). Welfel explains how these counselors can go through four steps: recognizing the error rather than dismissing or trivial- izing it, experiencing regret or remorse that mobilizes them to address the problem, making restitution in direct and indirect ways, and taking action to pre- vent recurrence of the ethical infraction. Welfel's advice is sen- sible and sensitive, and could apply to, a much broadei audi- ence than counselors.Family patterns as career exploration topics Themes and patterns in family history influence an individual's career decision-making process. ,Counselor educators Krista Malott and Sandy Magnuson detail an interesting use of fam- ily genograms in a career explo- ration class for undergraduates (Career Development Quarter- ly, December 2004, pages 178- 186). Students constructed tra- ditional family genograms, fol- lowing directions and examples provided by the instructor. They then used the genograms as a basis for exploring questions te- lated to career development, including questions about gen- der roles, attitudes toward mon- by-w6tk/career values, relation- ships, beliefs about education, leisure, role models, and family successes and failures. The instructor followed up with 50-minute individual meet- ings with students to examine family dynamics and patterns relevant to each student's career decisions. Student comments reflect their conviction that the genogram activities were valu-able and engaging. An appendix to the article lists suggested questions for reflection and dis- cussion. An anxiety scale tailored for college students Chronic, manifest anxiety shows up in different ways among different age groups across the life span, though some elements remain the same throughout life. Counselors in collegiate settings will be glad to learn of. the- Adult Manifest Anxiety Scale-College Version, which reflects developmental variations specific to college students and also uses item con- tent relevant to the college set- tint. Besides the usual behav-, iotlrl, cognitive and physiologi- cal areas, the AMAS-C includes the important dimension of test anxiety. In the January 2005 issue of Measurement and Evaluation in Counseling and Development (pages 220-227), educators Patricia Lowe, Elena Papanasta- siou, Kimberly DeRuyck and Cecil Reynolds report their study of test score stability andconstruct validity of the AMAS- C. Test-retest reliability over a four-week interval was adequate to excellent. When correlated with the Coping Scale for Adults, Multidimensional Anxi- ety Questionnaire and Test Anx- iety Inventory, the AMAS-C displayed the expected conver- gent and discriminative patterns, supporting its construct validity. The authors suggest that the AMAS-C can be used as a screener to identify anxious col- lege studenti, and the four sub- scale scores can be used to spec- ify targets of treatment (test anx- iety, worry/oversensitivity, physiological anxiety and social concerns/stress). fl Susan X Day is a edunseloi educator in Houstoi and ' writes grpduatelevel text- books in counseling.

Regardless of what had hap- pened, it was clear that Nicole was in deep trouble. When last -we'd seen her, she had been wearing only a light parka and had limited food and water. Even more frightening, we knew that Nicole had never been trekking in her life. As a matter of fact, she had never even spent a night in the woods. She had no survival skills and absolutely no experience with finding her way in the wilderness. It went mostly unspoken, but we silently real- ized there was a good chance she wouldn't survive the night. Worse still, we knew she might be alone, huddled underneath a tree, literally shivering to death. When the search parties re- turned with no word, we had lit- tle choice but to head to our tents and wait for the morning. We couldn't imagine the situa- tion becoming any more dire - until we were awakened by waves of thunder, lightning and then freezing rain. Now we were convinced there was no way she could survive the night without protection and resources. In the morning, when we finally emerged from our tents, hoping Nicole had shown up, we saw only a layer of snow covering the ground. Our guide tried to reassure us that Nicole was OK. She was probably ahead of us. Maybe she'd even meet us at the next campsite. But we knew this was grasping at straws. Even our guide and the Sherpas began to lose hope las the next day wore on with no sign of our lost friend. As we trudged along the trail, I fought back tears of grief. I pictured Nicole during lunch, thought of how peaceful she'd seemed. I had even taken a pho-Three of the girls who were awarded scholarships from the Medhav tograph of her lying on the ground with the mountains in the distance as a backdrop. What would I tell her family? I didn't even know what had happened to her. Would they ever find her body? Would we ever discover where she went astray? Somehow, I felt responsible. I should have taken better care of her, of all of us. Why had I let her out of my sight? I knew, ratio- nally, that it was the job of our guide and the Sherpas to keep a watchful eye, yet I still couldn't help but think that this was somehow my fault. And I knew I wasn't the only one who felt that way. The whole awful situation reminded us of how we each walk through life alone much of the time. We might sometimes have companions -family, friends, co-workers -along with us, but there are times when we long for time alone. I felt angry with Nicole for being such a loner. Why was she so darn independent? Why couldn't she stick with the group? How could she have got- ten lost like this? These recrimi- nating questions dissolved in more tears. Nicole was uncon- scious or kidnapped or perhaps even dead. What could we do about it now? The day dragged on, maybe the worst one of my life. We dispensed with any illusion that we'd find Nicole. Even if she somehow could have managed to survive one night alone in the Himalayas during the winter, there was no way she could last another.We crested over the last ridge and headed down toward our camp. We could see the six blue tents from a distance and the usual bustling activity of the staff preparing meals and orga- nizing the area. We could also see someone standing alone in the middle of a rice paddy, wav- ing a T-shirt in circles above her head. It was Nicole! Somehow she'd found our camp! I raced down the slope of the mountain without regard for my balance or safety. Each of us was whooping and hollering until we surrounded Nicole in a group hug, all of us crying and sobbing with relief. It was only after 10 solid minutes of such catharsis that we finally heard Nicole's story, and it was quite a different version than any of us had imagined. While we had been living in pure hell for the previous 24 hours, grieving the loss of our friend, berating our- selves for neglect and inepti- tude, Nicole had been safe - even more than that, she'd been comfortable. It turned out that throughout most of the previous afternoon Nicole didn't even know she was lost. Somehow, she'd taken a wrong turn and ended up on another trail. Shb walked happi- ly and contentedly through the day, believing that we were all just up ahead. She loved the time alone to think about her life, to consider new decisions she'd like to make when she got home. She enjoyed walking at her own pace. And she loved the silence, broken only by the sound of her breath.Ghimire Trust. As night started to fall, without sign of our camp, Nicole grew a bit concerned. She started calling out for help, hoping one of us would answer. Finally, two peo- ple approached from the woods. She supposed they were our guides coming to retrieve her. As they got closer, she noticed their machetes and automatic weap- ons. Nicole realized they were, in fact, Maoists on patrol. They looked dangerous. \"I'm lost,\" Nicole called out to them in careful English. \"Can you help me? I need to find my friends. Do you know where they are?\" The two men signaled for her to follow them. Nicole did so, mostly because she had little choice. Not too many minutes later, they arrived in a village where she was directed to a home occupied by someone who spoke English fairly well. The gracious hosts invited Nicole in and offered her a place to sleep, as well as a lovely dinner con- sisting of local delicacies. Nicole knew we'd be worried about her so she had little appetite. She heard the thunder and the sound of the rain and sleet during the night, but she was tucked comfortably into a warm bed by a fire. She felt terri- bly guilty knowing we'd be dis- tressed, but she had no way to get word to us. She didn't even know where she was, much less how she got there or how to find us. In the morning her host escorted her to the camp where we were to arrive later in the day. That's where we found her. What strikes me as mostintriguing about the struggle to find my way is that this story is so different from that of Nicole's experience. She was the \"vic- tim,\" the one who was lost, but the rest of us were the ones who were traumatized. Nicole actual- ly had a fairly interesting \"home stay\" in a remote Himalayan vil- lage. She met some wonderful people and enjoyed an exotic adventure. Her only real concern was that we would be worried about her. Weeks later, each of us is still trying to process the experience. I think it is so interesting that while this was Nicole's adventure, her story, each of us reacted in quite a different way according to the information we had at the tithe. There are clients and students I worry about in a similar manner. I assume they are lost, struggling to find their way, just because I can't follow their trail. I sometimes delude myself that students and clients must follow my lead in order to grow and change. As I talk to Nicole now and hear about her adven- tures, I realize it was the act of becoming lost that taught her to feel more resourceful and inde- pendent. She came back from the trip determined to make changes in her life. I already notice dramatic results. There are times when clients need to wander off on their own. They need time to find their own way or even get lost on occasion. For that to happen more often, I have to surrender some of my own need to be in control, to be the guide. This was Nicole's story, but it was also mine. E Jeffrey A.

As a result, it is forging a paradigm shift that is causing many coun- seling professionals to rethink the way they provide mental health services to people in diverse cultural populations. The multicultural counseling movement is also changing the way counselor educators ap- proach their work and the types of professional training strate- gies used to prepare their stu- dents for the challenges they will predictably face when working in the field. Counseling researchers are also being challenged to use new investigative approaches that will expand our under-standing of the unique strengths and needs that people from diverse populations present to counselors in school, rehabilita- tion and community counseling settings. Clearly, the multicultural counseling movement has achieved much during the past 35 years. And yet, much more needs to be done to move the counseling profession beyond the various types of-ethnocen- trism that continue to be per- petuated in many of the clinical practices, counselor education programs and research endeav- ors implemented in the field. One of the multicultural movement's most significant accomplishments is develop-seling competencies. Initially developed by leaders in the Association for Multicultural Counseling and Development in 1992, these competencies were operationalized in 1996 and formally endorsed by the American Counseling Associa- tion in 2003 (along with a com- plementary set of advocacy competencies). For those indi- viduals who have not yet reviewed these competencies, you will be glad to know that they are available on the ACA website (www.counseling.org). Although the development and endorsement of these com- petencies represent major ad- vancements for our profession, we are reminded that there is a difference between \"institution- al endorsement\" and \"profes- sional advocacy:' Although ACA's formal endorsement symbolizes the organization's approval of the multicultural counseling competencies, it does not guarantee that these competencies will be effectively implemented in the work of counselor educators, practition- ment of the multicultural coup- ers and researchers. To bridgethe gap that currently exists between the organizational en- dorsement and the professional implementation of the compe- tencies, multicultural advocates need to work together to plan and implement strategies that will build a mass grassroots movement within the counsel- ing profession. This movement should be intentionally aimed at getting large number of coun- selors to effectively implement the multicultural competencies in their work settings. Leaders in ACA have recently joined representatives of the Counselors for Social Justice association and members of the National Institute for Multicultur- al Competence to build this sort of movement in the fields of counseling and psychology. What follows is discussion of a series of events deliberately designed to build a mass grassroots move- ment composed of a growing number of counselors, psycholo- gists, social workers and other mental health practitioners who are committed to implementing the multicultural competencies into their daily work.The 2005 National Multicultural Summit -Leaders in ACA, CSJ and NIMC participated in a series of events at the 2005 National Multicultural Summit aimed at organizing and mobilizing counselors willing to state how they specifically intended to implement one or more of the multicultural counseling com- petencies into their professional practices. One of the events involved a presentation in which several multicultural counseling advocates discussed the history of the multicultural movement, presented the advo- cacy competencies recently en- dorsed by ACA and outlined a plan to get large numbers of counselors nationwide to make a commitment to identify spe- cific competencies that they would implement in their work in the future. Among the people who par- ticipated in this unprecedented professional organizational and mobilization event were several longtime ACA members, in- cluding Allen Ivey, Mary Brad- ford Ivey, Rebecca Toporek, Judy Daniels, Bryan Kim, Lewis Schlosser, Pamela Foley, Gisela Lin and Yu-Wei Wang. After briefly discussing differ- ent aspects of the multicultural counseling movement and the ACA-endorsed advocacy com- petencies, they also explained how they were implementing various multicultural-advocacy competencies in their daily work. They then proceeded to invite other people who attended this presentation to join in the effort to create a mass grassroots movement. The audience was then asked to break into small working groups. These groups brainstormed concrete strate- gies that would enable partici- pants to effectively implement specific multicultural-advocacy competencies upon leaving the summit. Finally, all the people who attended this presentation were encouraged to do three things: write down what specifically they were committed to doing to implement one or more of the multicultural-advocacy com- petencies after returning to their work settings, submit an anony- mous copy of their action state- ment to the organizers of the meeting so that an ongoing record could be kept of the spe-L00 0 eN 0 'U 0 C C,Ob C 0 U 40 cific commitments individuals were willing to make and pub- licly state their action plan if they were comfortable doing so before the conclusion of the summit presentation. This activ- ity resulted in more than 100 written statements regarding specific commitments that par- ticipants made to implement one or more of the multicultural- advocacy competencies when they returned to their work set- tings. Giving Back to the Community Project Leaders in NIMC have out- lined a comprehensive plan that is being implemented across the Umted States in a continu- ing effort to expand the sort of mass grassroots movement- building effort described above. One of the ways NIMC plans to build on the efforts initiated at the 2005 National Multicultural Summit is by helping to orga- nize a new project that is being co-sponsored with ACA and CSJ. The Giving Back to the Com- munity Project was initially con- ceptualized by Thomas Parham, one of the leading multicultural scholars and social justice coun- seling advocates in the United States. In describing the impor- tance of institutionalizing this concept in ACA, Parham has repeatedly emphasized that counselors should not simply take advantage of all the conve- niences offered at the host cities where our national conventions are held. We should also give something back to these com- munities as a gesture of our gen- uine appreciation, demonstrat- ing our willingness to make a positive contribution during our short stays in these cities. With this creative suggestion for action in mind, leaders in ACA, CSJ and NIMC are plan- ning a full day of professional development activities that will be held in Atlanta on April 6, just before the annual ACA Convention opens in that city. Although the professional de- velopment services offered dur- ing the Giving Back to the Community Project will focus on a broad range of issues of interest to counselors, psychol- ogists. social workers, educa- tors, administrators, communi- ty organizers and law enforce- ment personnel, all training activities will be anchored instrategies designed to promote the participants' cultural com- petence. With this in mind, the organizers will use the train- ing/organizing/mobilizing model that was effectively im- plemented at the 2005 National Multicultural Summit. The goal is to further build the sort of mass grassroots movement nec- essary to bridge the gap that currently exists between the organizational endorsement and the actual implementation of the multicultural-advocacy competencies on a large scale across the United States. It is important to acknowledge that all of the people offering their services in conducting these and other professional development projects are doing so on a pro bono basis. Because these respected counseling lead- ers are volunteering their ser- vices in these and other projects to create a mass grassroots movement to increase the im- plementation of the multicultur- al-advocacy competencies, min- imal costs will be required to attend such activities.To receive additional infor- mation about some of the ways you can join in the effort to build a mass grassroots multi- cultural-advocacy movement in the United States, contact Michael D'Andrea via e-mail at Michael@hawaii.edu.

The editors of this book have compiled a comprehensive overview of mental health issues and their impact on the American workplace. The work was originally pub- lished in 1993 as Mental Health in the Workplace but has been significantly updated and expanded to create a practical handbook for business professionals as well as behavioral health professionals. pis is hot surprising given tha Alan Lan- glieb has a master's in business adminis- tration in addition to his degree as a doctor of medicine; and Jeffrey Kahn is the head of a business, WorkPsych Associates, as well as being a physician. His organiza- tion's website, www.workpsychcorp.con, includes additional information and links to related sites such as the Academy of Organizational and Occupational Psychia- try and the Society for Human Resource Management. The first of the book's four parts ad- dresses the broad context of both mental health problems and the workplace. Each has had an impact on the other through competing demands. For example, cost containment is crucial to business success but pointless without demonstrated quality outcomes, and the right to confidentiality can be in conflict with the need to know. The editors have included material on the historical perspective of these issues as they have developed from the earliest years of the 20th century and into the new millennium. The second part gives particular atten- tion to problems at the executive level and how those problems can have a ripple effect throughout an organization. At any level of the organization, stress caused by the possibility ofjob loss or the maneuver- ings of office politics can have mental health consequences, and chapters are de- voted to each area. Today's global econo- my also requires inclusion of a chapter on the effects of sending employees and their families overseas. The book's third and fourth parts ad- dress common organizational issues and employee problems. Both sections include good information on specific concerns, for example, the Americans With Disabilities Act and the Family Medical Leave Act on the. organizational side and substance abuse on the employee side. In addition, the editors have highlighted how organiza- tions have personalities just as individuals 2 do. The interplay of an organization's cul- 2 ture and ethics with the strengths and a weaknesses of individuals can give rise to M high individual and organizational perfor- 12 mance or create barriers to productivity. Taken as a whole, the book provides the information and insight necessary to assist business and mental health professionals with creating organizational structures, policies and benefits that will help individ- 42 uals achieve optimum performance andhelp organizations achieve maximum pro- ductivity.

Tyson, Rachelle Perusse and Jim Whitledge (Eds.), 2004, Alexandria, VA: American Counseling Association, 309 pages, $27.95, ISBN 1-55620-190-7. Community and school-based coun- selors alike are eventually presented with the notion that they must lead a group counseling session. This is usually an overwhelming and unset- fling experience for entry- level group workers, who fre- quently exhibit that \"deer-in-the-headlights\" look. No won- der, especially when considering that in forming a group, a counselor invites mul- tiple individual variables to join forces with a multiplicity of group variables. This collision of individual and group vairiables provides ample fodder for potentially destructive events. As the title suggests, the editors use crit- ical incidents to organize the book. Key concepts in group theory and dynamics are illuminated through specific critical inci- dents in group counseljng. To amplify and expand on these incidents, leading practi- tioners within the field provide commen- tary. The editors focus on group leadership skill development and understanding of such issues as negotiation, power, contro- versy, ethics and performance. The book is divided into three sections, the first addressing the concerns of group leaders, the second those of group mem- bers and the third, leadership issues. Each of the 41 chapters fbatures critical inci- dents introduced with background infor- mation, a description of the incident and questions aimed at investigating the con- tributing factors. Each chapter allows two practitioners to respond to questions about ethical guidelines, theoretical criteria and appropriate intervention strategies. This book can help the reader to effectivelyhandle several potentially destructive inci- dents within a group setting. The value of this resource extends from the novice group leader to the seasoned practitioner. The editors have assembled a collection of authors who focus on key ele- ments important to running a group that simultaneously satisfies and protects the individual member. The use of questions guides readers' understanding of the issues at hand and enhances the development of relevant skills. Responses from the chapter authors flesh out ways to take critical inci- dents that appear to be the most potential- ly destructive and use them to draw a group closer, come to a better resolution and work more effectively on future chal- lenges. This reader-friendly book would be a useful supple- mentary resource for any student or counselor work- ing within a group setting. Reviewed by Christopher P.

Miller (Eds.), 2003, Washing- ton, DC: 462 pages, $39.95, ISBN 1-55798- 557-. For decades, mental health theorists have touted new ways of understanding clients. Typically, theorists trouble them- selves to highlight how their theories are different and unique. These efforts often lead to competition and divisiveness among theorists and their proponents, thus distracting from the real issue of counsel- ing clients through meaningful change. Now in its sixth printing, this book builds a case for the idea that effective therapy has more to do with similarities in ap- proaches than with differences. The common factors of therapeutic change highlighted in this book were pro- posed by Michael Lambert in 1992. The editors cite several factors common to change: extratherapeutic, relationship, expectancy or placebo, and techniques. An assortment of authors reviews research and literature relating to each factor. Each chapter ends with questions centered on the implications and applications of the current research findings.The common factors thme.transcends multiple facets of the mental health field. A case in point is Chapter 8, \"How Do People Change and How Can We Change to Help Many More People?\" In this offer- ing, author James 0. Prochaska integrates Lambert's common factors of therapeutic change into his transtheoretical model. Prochaska's model outlines six stages of change clients experience during the ther- apy process, including pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, main- tenance and termination. Similar to the common factors, awareness and under- standing of the stages of change can help counselors to meet clients where they are and work collaboratively toward change focusing on what is useful for the client at that specific time in his development. Continuing this integrative approach in Chapter 10, Roger P. Greenberg outlines psychosocial factors that are often mini- mized or ignored in the use of psy- chopharmacological treatments for mental illness. He articulates the notion that from a strict biological perspective, psychoso- 'cial factors tend to be viewed as nuisance variables rather than factors that influence client change. Greenberg discusses how, upon discovering the significant power of the client-therapist relationship, medical science began exploring the doctor-patient relationship. Through several studies including incorporation of client feedback, the doctor-patient relationship was found to be an important factor influencingout- comes of treatment. In chapter 12, John J. Murphy draws parallels between the common factors of therapeutic change and those of school- based change. He highlights empower- ment, acceptability and collaboration as the common factors of school-based change, then explains that empowerment is similar to Lambert's belief that client contributions are vital to the success of therapy. Murphy outlines and describes the 5-E Method, a five-step approach to schopl-based change that builds on strengths to work toward successful out- comes: eliciting or identifying resources, elaborating on the resources, expanding or application of the resources, evaluating the effectiveness of what was applied and empowering effective outcomes. I found the book exceptionally useful both as a practicing counselor And coun- selor educator. As a'counselor, it focused more of my attention on nurturing factors that facilitate change and effective out- comes. As a counselor educator, it urged me to revitalize my counselor training pro- gram with cutting-edge, research-driven and treatment-based approaches. Reviewed by Joseph D.

ACES conference to focus on creativity Submitted by Paige Bentley pbentley@tnad.rr.com What happens When we take a break from the ordinary? Many believe that shift helps ustap into our creative reserves, transform our perspective, revi- talize our spirit and promote positive change. The Association for Counselor Education and Supervision rec- ognizes the transformative power of creativity and the potential it brings to counselors, counseling processes and clierits with its 2005 national confer- ence; \"Creativity and Change in Counselor Education and Super- vision.\" The conference will cel- ebrate and highlight the innate creativity of counselors and supervisors and the imaginative approaches they use to facilitate change. \"We are beginning to see our profession opening to new methods:' said ACES President- Elect James Benshoff. \"At the 2005 conference, We hope to cultivate this growing interest in altenative approaches and build on the creativity that is already a part of the counseling process.\" In keeping with these objec- tives, ACES plans to incorporate a variety of artistic elements into the conference schedule, includ- ing music and movement. Ahighlight of the conference will be a performance by the Tambu- ritzaris Dancers at Duquesne Uni- versity's reception for ACES, 6n the evening of Thursday, Oct 20. \"We want this conference to be an energizing and revitalizing experience for all participants, so we plan to offer a diverse mix of creative opportunities,\" Ben- shoff said. The conference will be held in downtown Pittsburgh, opening up even more opportunities for creative exploration. Simply strolling along the downtown streets is a treat for the senses. From the distinctive architecture to the flair of the locals, the city offers an array~ of unique fea- tures. Pittsburgh is home to a number of museums and cultur- al attractions such as the Andy Warhol Museum, the Carnegie Museum of Art and the Pitts- burgh Symphony. The \"almost famous\" Primanti Brothers sandwich, a local tradition for more than 60 years, is a \"must taste\" for any visitor.

ACAIT advice on insurance for your home- BY PAUL L. NELSON .FOR COUNSELING TODAY If you watch the news, you notice how many catastrophes occur each .and every day - tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, mudslides, floods, etc. All m these things can have a major impact on your finances if you -are uninsured or underinsured. It is iinperative to have adequate insurance in the event you face a disaster and it becomes neces- sary to rebuild your home. If you are underinsured, you could end up having to bear a large portion of the costs. It doesn't take a major cata- 0strophe to realize a need for good homeowners protection. If 50 a tree in your yard crashes into aneighbor's house, would your policy cover the damage? If the wind blows a tree through your roof, are you protected from the water damage as the ensuing rain pours in? It is always a good idea to examine your insurance papers to be -sure you have insurance protection for these events. Con- sider how much it would cost to replace your home in today's market. Building costs are con- stantly rising, so the importance of adequale amounts of insur- ance cannot be overemphasized. Many people forget about the value of home improvements when they consider the replacement cost value of their home. If you put an addition on .your home, then you may needto increase the amount of insur- ance. Insurance policies cover almost all types of firelosses, except in the. case where you intentionally cause the fire dam- age. However, yourhouse is not -covered for flood damage unless you purchase flood insurance through the federal government. A flood may be defined as surface water from a heavy rain that seeps into your home. Homeowners policies will not cover this type of dam- age. If you're concerned about floods in your area, call the fed- eral government at 800.323.8603. Homeowner policies usually cover personal items,, but you ..must be able to prove what youown. Take photos of the rooms in your home and the fumish- ings therein. Keep the photos or video in a safe place away from your home. This evidence can be very helpful if the time ever comes when you have to make a claim. Exceptionally valuable items such as jewelry and paint- ings should be insured separate- ly. It is advisable to get these items appraised and add a rider to your policy to cover them. Renters also qualify for homeowners policies, some- times referred to as tenants poli- dies. Many people underesti- itate the value of their personal belongings and regret the lack of insurance when a fire or theft occurs. The American CounselingAssociation Insurance Trust sponsors -homeowners fnsur- ance with a specially priced program through Liberty Mutu- al. Extra savings can be achieved if auto coverage is pur- chased in conjunction with the homeowners policy. If you have questions or concerns about homeowners insurance, call the ACAIT office at 800.347.6647 ext. 342, or Liberty Mutual at 800.524.9400. Please mention client number 8654. Let them know that you are An ACA member, and they will be pleased to assist you. 'PaUl L. Neison is the e*keutive -director of theACA Insurance Trust, Continued from page 32 Atlanta Insider Your tour guide: Catharina Chang, assistant professor, Department of Counseling and Psy- chological Services, Georgia State University. What's on your must-see list? Atlanta is a diverse city with attractions for anyone. Here are some things I personally think are worthwhile: CNN Center, which is right next to the Omni (a tour of the CNN Center is a must); Centennial Olympic Park, which is directly across from the Omni Hotel; Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site; Atlanta Botanical Garden; Jimmy Carter Library and Museum; and the World of Coca-Cola for those who don't mind commercialization at its greatest. What's your favorite restaurant in the area? It's difficult to name just one. Atlanta has some wonderful, and I do mean wonderful, restaurants. No matter what type of food you are looking for you can find it here. The \"hottest\" and \"trendiest\" restaurant right now is probably Two Urban Licks with its stun- ning view of Midtown Atlanta. There is always the Varsity, well known for its hot dogs and onion rings. Of course you can't visit the South without tasting the local barbeque, and for this I recommend Fat Mat s Rib Shack. What's the most surprising aspect of Atlanta? I think some people might be surprised to discover how much Atlanta has to offer. Tourist tips for ACA Convention attendees: Definitely avoid the major highways during rush hour, and if you are going to the airportthe best way to get there is by taking MARTA, which will take you right to the Delta counter. What makes Atlanta unique? I think Atlanta is unique because it is a big city that has been able to maintain its small- town feel -depending on where you are in Atlanta. What is Atlanta's most overlooked treasure? The diversity within the city. What one place best sums up Atlanta's spirit? I don'tthink I can name one place that best sums up Atlanta's spirit. Atlanta is a great city with a diverse population and diverse attractions. You can find something in this cityto get excited about! I'm excited to have ACA here in Atlanta and can't wait to share this won- derful city with all of you.Your tour guide: Lanie Damon, LPC, independent practitioner and career management consulting. What's on your must-see list? The view of the city from the revolving restaurant atop the Westin Peachtree Plaza at dusk; the lights of Centen- nial Olympic Park at night. What's your favorite restau- rant in the area? Carroll Street Cafe in Cab- bagetown more like a Euro- pean tips for ACA Conven- tion attendees: Visit the Michael C. Carlos Museum on the campus of Emory University and the Carter Cehter Museum and Library. What makes Atlanta unique? The lovely neighborhoods and the people. What is Atlanta's most overlooked treasure? The DeKalb Farmers Market. What one place best sums up Atlanta's spirit? The DeKalb Farmers Market overlook, a Tower of Babel, great productb, a little messy, entrepreneurial. N In Brief Former ACA president Feingold passes S. Norman Feingold, presi- dent of the American Counsel- ing Association from 1974-75, died on Feb. 13 at age 90. His specialties in psychology included counseling, career choice, rehabilitation of per- sons with disabilities, job placement and testing. Over the course of his career, which spanned more than 50 years, Feingold provided ser- vices and inspiration to count- less people and many profes- sionals in the fields of counsel- ing and psychology, both in the United States and interation- ally. He was a licensed psy- chologist and continued to practice until his death from pneumonia. In addition to serving as ACA president, Feingold was an active member of organiza- tions such as the AmericanPsychological Association, the National Rehabilitation Asso- ciation, and the Maryland and Washington, D.C., psychologi- cal associations. Feingold was born in Worcester, Mass., on Feb. 2, 1914, and received degrees from Clark University and Indiana University. He earned his doctorate from Boston Uni- versity in 1948. He served as an officer in the U.S. Army during World War 11 and taught in graduate schools at Boston University, American Universi- ty and George Washington University. In addition, he lec- tured at more than 35 other academic institutions. Feingold's family has tenta- tively planned a memorial ser- vice to celebrate his life on Monday, March 28 in Wash- ington, D.C. For additional information, contact his daugh- ter, Lynne Feingold, at 202. 364.0701 or via e-mail atlynne.feingold@mindspring .com. Counseling Today will feature an article that takes a more in-depth look at Fein- gold's life and contributions to the fields of counseling and psychology in its April issue. Interventions get prime-time play Intervention is a new docu- mentary TV series debuting on the A&E Network on March 6 at 10 p.m. EST. Each show spends several days profiling someone struggling with an addiction and culminates in an intervention led by a profes- sional. Family and friends of the person battling the addic- tion are intimately involved in the intervention. At the end of the intervention, if the person with the addiction chooses to accept treatment, he or she will enter a top-notch treatment facility free of charge.The goal of the TV show is to get help for people who are suffering, while also educat- ing the audience about the day-to-day realities of living with addiction. The first episode will feature the dra- matic story of two addicts who are unaware that their families plan to conduct inter- ventions that will force them to choose between treatment or exile and isolation. Family and friends hold interventions to help Tommy, a 38-year-old former executive, and Alyson, a 27-year-old who was once a White House intern. The two featured interven- tionists will be Jeff Vonderen and Candy Finnigan. Von- deren is a highly sought after speaker and consultant both nationally and internationally. Individuals. fimilies and or- ganizations have benefited from his skills and under- standing in the areas of addic-tion, Iamily systems and recovery for more than 25 years. He is the best-selling author of i-red of Trying to Measure Up and The Subtle Power of Spiritual Abuse. Finnigan is a nationally rec- ognized addiction specialist. She received her certification in chemical dependency from the University of California- Los Angeles and did her internship at Cedars-Sinai Hospital, where she worked in addiction services. She was certified in sex addiction and codependency and received her intervention training from the man who developed the process. Vern Johnson. Finni- gan has been involved in all areas of recovery for more than 15 years, not only as an interventionist, but also in relapse prevention and family and individual counseling. She herself has been in recov- ery for more than 18 years. 0Experiencing Atlanta 05a g 0) C a) (0 51 0 Classified Ads: Categories include Calendar; Merchandise & Services; Business Opportunities; Educational Books; Rates: in-colush format: $8.50 per line based on dO per line.

Second quarter ACA fiscal report BY JANE GOODMAN FOR COUNSELING TODAY In an effort to keep the membership fully informed and simultaneously com- ply with Governing Council policy, quar- terly fiscal reports are issued in Counsel- ing Today. This quarterly report (summa- rizing Oct. 1-Dec. 31, 2004) represents the second report for the fiscal year end- ing June 30, 2005. The Balance Sheet, which is presented with this report, is intended to reflect the American Counseling Association's financial position at any given point in time. The Balance Sheet gives a picture of the association's financial position as of Dec. 31, 2004. At Dec. 31, ACA owned $7,467,780 in assets. Of these assets, $5,358,146 was in cash and investments. In addition, ACA holds a $1 million note from its landlord at an above-market rate (8.25 percent). At Dec. 31, the association's liabilities included vendor fees of approximately $992,372, staff salaries and benefits of $376,407 and fees collected on behalf of related organizations of $100,652. Mem- ber benefits to be fulfilled total $3,824,409 and appear as a liability because ACA receives membership rev- enues annually while providing member benefits monthly. As this Balance Sheet indicates, ACA'snet worth at Dec. 31 is $2,173,941. This indicates that the association remains financially positive. However, efforts must continue to be made to ensure the association's long-term stability. At Dec. 31, the association reported $886,705 in excess expenses over rev- enues. ACA's revenues are $146,108 lower than those reported last year due to a decline in membership. Expenses incurred through the second quarter are $321,257 higher. The ACA Financial Affairs Committee will continue to mon- itor ACA's revenues and expenditures on a monthly basis. ACA intends to continue developing more programs as it realizes greater success in its legislative activities and continues to provide established pro- grams and benefits to its members. The ACA Financial Affairs Commit- tee, in collaboration with the administra- tive staff and the Governing Council, convenes monthly to evaluate the finan- cial position of the association and to recommend pertinent action. Quarterly reports are provided to the membership via Counseling Today.
