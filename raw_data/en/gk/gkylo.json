What makes it different western medicine is the fact that it was developed over a long period of time, allowing it to get better with each generation. The core pract ices of Ayurveda remain in sync with soul and nature giving it the mystical aura it possesses . It's been passed down through generations using word of mouth and yet remained pious without adulterations.[3-9] How is Ayurveda Different from Western Medicine ? The difference between Ayurveda and traditional medicine is quite simple. Western medicine relies on the feedback the doctor obtains from the current medical condition of the patient, they consider the symptoms and base their treatment on the possible ca uses of the symptom. In Ayurveda, the symptoms are not such an important factor, they, in fact, observe how the overall condition of the patient's body. In Ayurveda diseases are considered to be highly psychosomatic, their treatment, therefore, is directed to the root cause within the body that is forcing it to react in this particular way while inflicted with any specific disease. In Ayurveda, different people with the same medical disease and symptoms might obtain different medications, this is because A yurveda does not seek to cure the disease, instead it www.wjpr.net Vol 10, Issue 5, 2021. ISO 9001:2015 Certified Journal Kotwal et al. World Journal of Pharmaceutical Research 1114 tries to cure the body thus relieving it from any disease affecting it.

Siddha Siddha is yet another traditional trea tment method from the southern states of India. Mainly practiced in Tamil Nadu, Siddha is an age -old traditional treatment method that offers lasting solutions for many chronic conditions. The Siddha System of Medicine (SSM) is a recognized alternative tre atment in India. Siddha is widely considered as a psychosomatic treatment method as its ruling principles aim at the balance between the five governing factors of one's health. Known as the \"P anchabootham\" it mainly covers the elements of fire, water, eart h, space, and air. Siddha always encourages patients to attain an unbreakable balance between the mind and the soul.

And its extensive practice will make sure that you have a better functioning immune system to fight diseases in the future. When considering chronic diseases like diabetes, normal western medicine heavily relies on insulin supplementation and other strong med ications.

They keep the patient in touch with the surrounding nature, encouraging them to indulge in practices that alleviate stress and normalizes blood function. All extra medications took for treating the disease are derived from natural elements and is in sync with the diet prescribed for the patient.

Siddha treatment for terminally ill people suffering from cancer or AIDs highly benefit from Siddha . The traditional treatments ability to curb the symptoms of these terminal diseases are unmatched with any other fo rm of treatment.[20] 3. Unani Unani is yet another traditional medicine in India, that has foreign roots. It's safe to say that Unani medication was introduced to India during the invasion by the Mughals. Unani is presumed to be originated in Greece, and Hippocrates is deemed to be the father of Unani. It's safe to say that Unani is a Greek -Arab format of medicine, drawing inspiration heavily from both the cultures. Unani is basically another psychosomatic form of medication. It is recognised as an authen tic ISM (Indian System of Medication). There are various methods for the implementation of Unani treatment. The medications used for the treatment under Unani are all derived from natural elements. The authenticity of the medication is often in question ho wever its effectiveness remains unparalleled. Unani medicated follows the principles set by Hippocrates which states that the human body is composed of 4 types of fluid humor. They are blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile, www.wjpr.net Vol 10, Issue 5, 2021. ISO 9001:2015 Certified Journal Kotwal et al. World Journal of Pharmaceutical Research 1117 the correlation and temper amental balance of all four fluid humor are the most basic diagnostic tool the Unani practitioners depend on.[22] According to Unani, optimal health is when one's body is in perfect balance with the six elemental forces that govern it. The six essential e lements of health are: Air Food and Drinks Retention and Excretion Sleep and Wake cycles Retention and tolerance to physical activity Mental activity and adequate rest. Since these are the major governing factors of one's health according to Unani, any di sease will be treated with an approach to get the required balance to attain health. The main three modes of treatment used in Unani are Ilajbil Tadbeer, Ilajbil Dava, and Surgery respectively.[23] Benefits of U nani 1. A high success rate for recurring diseases: Unani medications have some proven track record in being extremely efficient in curing recurring diseases such as asthma and joint pain. Some studies also show that Unani medicines for sk in can heal serious medical conditions such as psoriasis and even skin related leukaemia up to an extent. Its unique effects are also helpful for patients with cardiovascular problems and stomach troubles and mental illnesses. These results go to show the importance given to Unani treatments in India.[24] 2. Highly effective for Aids: Terminal immunodeficiency diseases like aids are very lethal and almost life -threatening all the times. Unani medicine practitioners claim that if given through a proper cour se of treatment, Unani medications can be very effective for patients suffering from Aids. Since Unani deals with the overall health of the patient by attaining a level of mental balance along with physical harmony regarding the elements of life, the overa ll immune system of the patient is set to perform in a better fashion. In aids patients, the immunes system is considerably weak, still with Unani medication, the immune system can perform better and develop a level of resistance that will go a long way in protecting the life of the people affected by it.[25] www.wjpr.net Vol 10, Issue 5, 2021. ISO 9001:2015 Certified Journal Kotwal et al. World Journal of Pharmaceutical Research 1118 3.

Issues pertaining to sexual performance or maladies to your sex organs are bes t cured with Unani medications. Unani powerful medications are prescribed to increase your libido and also to ensure that any nervous issues connected to your sexual prowess in rectified. Unani is also told to be extremely effective in treating sterile co nditions among women, thus eradicating the need for costly medical treatments such as the IVF.[26] Unani medication is administered locally mostly through oral intake like western medicine, this allows easy comparison between the both. While considering t he serious side effects of using allopathic medication, Unani becomes a truly wonderful option. Apart from the above - listed ailments, Unani treatment in India is also said to have powerful effects in treating serious medical conditions such as cerebral pal sy. There are results which shows a great deal of improvement in young patients suffering from cerebral palsy when administered with Unani medication and health practices. The above three are the most famous traditional medication from the various parts o f India. However, there are many more of this magical medical practice that exists in different areas of the country. Naturopathy in Rajasthan and the highly secretive medical practices of the Mishing, a tribal community in the northeast section of the cou ntry are also highly effective forms of traditional medicine, solely based on products derived from the surrounding nature and thus eliminating any chances of side effects.[27] 4. Yoga and naturopathy Yoga is a Sanskrit word, composed and spoken limitedly in India. Sanskrit is popular fundamentally in mainstream Indian ceremonial settings, for example, Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism. The word yoga has changing interpretations yet is most usually comprehended as significance union. Yoga explores preventive and curative aptitudes as a training exercise for people to improve mindfulness. Dialectical behavior therapy has its underlying foundations in cognitive behavior therapy, a different model of mindfulness happens for cognitive therapy practices, known as care based subjective treatment .[28,2 9] Naturopathy is a particular type of essential drugs that balances age - old healing traditions with logical progress and current research. Naturopathy is guided by an interesting www.wjpr.net Vol 10, Issue 5, 2021. ISO 9001:2015 Certified Journal Kotwal et al. World Journal of Pharmaceutical Research 1119 arrangement of the rule that perceive s the body's inborn healing capacity, emphasizes disease prevention, and urges singular responsibility to get ideal well - being. Naturopathic hypothesis, the disease is seen as a procedure of disturbance to well -being and consequent recovery with regard to natural healing systems .[30] 5. Homeopathy The principle of Homoeopathy stays one of the most debatable therapeutic practice and been known Hippocrates from Greece around 450 BCE. The present -day practice of Homoeopathy is better recognized by a German doctor, Dr. Samuel Hahnemann (1755CE -1843CE). The word \"Homoeopathy\" has been derived from Greek words, \"Homois\" which means similar and \"pathos\" which means suffering. Homeopathy is a therapeutic technique utilizing arrangements of substances whose impacts when regulated to healthy individuals match to the appearances of the illness in the individual patient.[31,32 ] The methodology is believed to work on two main principles[33]: 1. \"Like cures like;\" a healthy individual would manifest the same symptom with the drug, that particular drug is the cure for the same illness. 2. \"Infinite dilution;\" therapeutic activity is enhanced by repeated dilution and succession even when diluted beyond Avogadro's number. Homeopathy essentially implies treating illnesses with cur es, which are equipped for producing symptoms identical to the disease when taken. For example, bark extract of Cinchona officinalis , which contains quinine, if administrated by a healthy individual, would then produces exactly the same symptom than that o f malaria. Homeopathic methods are polished since over 200 years in India and are now practiced throughout the world. It has mixed so well into the roots and customs of India and has been perceived as one of the recognized systems of medicine in health -care service.[34] Indian traditional medicine has its origin in India that evolved through a continuous process of transformation from its Vedic period and a single drug or blends in crude shape are favored over many fold formulations. In spite of the fact t hat the starting points and advancement times of these traditional medication process are different, however, there is a common background through this foundation, is in their basic standards and practices by utilizing the plants and plant -based preparatio ns in the medicinal services. The extent of utilization of plants in a different system of medications appears in Fig. 3. Moreover, around 85-90% Indian population depends on the traditional system for essential medicinal services. www.wjpr.net Vol 10, Issue 5, 2021. ISO 9001:2015 Certified Journal Kotwal et al. World Journal of Pharmaceutical Research 1120 DISCUSSION Despite the fact that, 5000 -year-old, Indian traditional medicine, had to face the greatest misfortune when Lord Macaulay settled the argument about whether India should support traditional medicines or western medicines. According to his choice, western medicines should solely cultivate in all zones administered by East India Company. In this manner, Indian traditional medicine was effectively disheartened, and the Western solution was perceived as the main legitimate system of medicine to be taken after .[35,36] However, nowadays, many modern medical practitioners are realizing and starting to recommend alternative (natural) remedies to their patients when modern medicines do not work, it is also because natural remedies have less or no side effects, are less danger ous for prolong use, rather than allopathic synthesized medicines; those endorse toxic side effects and may sometimes lead to death. Conversely, there is a developing confirmation to demonstrate that ingredients of NPs act synergistically which may neutral ize side effects in the proper blend. The civil argument between modern medicine and traditional medicines comes down to a basic truth; each person, regardless of education or sickness, ought to be educated about the actualities concerning their illness an d the associated side effects of medicines .[37] Advancement of Ayurveda and plant -based solutions for medicinal services through everyday experiences i s a part of the social legacy of India . The WHO, additionally, appraises that around 80 -85% of the popu lation living in the developing countries relies on complementary or alternative pharmaceutical for fundamental therapeutic administrations and necessities. In all the conventional frameworks of medication, the medicinal plants assume to play a noteworthy influence and constitute the backbone . It is hard to get exact figures for the aggregate number of medicinal plants on earth; as appeared by some estimation, around www.wjpr.net Vol 10, Issue 5, 2021. ISO 9001:2015 Certified Journal Kotwal et al. World Journal of Pharmaceutical Research 1121 35,000 -70,000 plant species are being used worldwide in human health -care services, and Indian pharmacopoeia alone incorporates more than 3000 drugs of natural origin .[38] CONCLUSION The knowledge of Indian traditional medicine has combined various traditional approaches with similar or different theories and method ologies, which are of import ant significance. After independence, in 1951, planning commission took birth. Much later, in 1995, a different department called Department of Indian System of Medicine and Homoeopathy (ISM&H) was molded. The acronym, AYUSH, which stands for Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy was the new name of ISM&H in 2003 as a detached Department under Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. Due to mastery of current pharmaceuticals notwithstanding open confidence and tr ust, Indian traditional medicines are in inimical hindrances. A need has developed to combined the entire whole traditional medicinal system and s ystematize it with a very strong optimistic approach in spreading our own medical tradition is the need of gre at importance. Consequently, phytochemical and biochemical research with a continuous focus for the revival and spreading of Indian medical inheritance for the welfare of the society at large is needed .
