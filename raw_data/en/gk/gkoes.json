You don't have to rely on liquid meal replacement shakes or fruit juices. You can eat REAL food. And you should. Without real food - real vitamins, real nutrients, protein, healthy fats, antioxidants, and minerals, you will do a poor job cleansing your body. In fact, without a proper cleanse diet, just by fasting or significantly restricting calories, detoxification organs may not remove waste products efficiently. If you're busy, perhaps you're in school, working, or managing a busy household, you'll be happy to know that you don't have to rely on strict liquid cleanses to accomplish better health and a cleaner body. For years, I've been recommending whole foods cleanse diets to enhance detoxification. And they work brilliantly. There's no suffering. No deprivation and no frustration. There are plenty of foods to choose from. Let's dive in and identify the top 5 food groups that are cleanse-friendly.

For years, I've been recommending whole foods cleanse diets to enhance detoxification. And they work brilliantly. There's no suffering. No deprivation and no frustration. There are plenty of foods to choose from. Let's dive in and identify the top 5 food groups that are cleanse-friendly. Food Group #1: Vegetables What would a cleanse diet be without nutrient dense vegetables? Choose dark green leafy vegetables, sweet potatoes, asparagus, broccoli, beets, carrots, and Brussel sprouts. There are so many awesome veggies to choose from and lots of great ways to prepare them. You can have unlimited amounts. Vegetables are high in vitamins and minerals. Enjoy until you're full! Food Group #2: Fruits Fruits are high in vitamins, natural sugar, and antioxidants. Some are an excellent source of fibre to help cleanse the colon and enhance the removal of waste products. I generally recommend 1-2 pieces of fruit per day. Food Group #3: Nuts/Seeds An excellent snack and a healthy source of good fats and protein. A cleanse diet without protein and healthy fat can slow down liver detoxification capabilities, which is the main reason why juice cleanses and detox water fasts are not always the best option. Food Group #4: Protein Choose from a wide variety of natural, hormone-free meats. Great options are lamb, chicken, turkey, wild fish, and bone broth. These supply the body with amino acids, which are necessary in phase 2 liver detoxification. Food Group #5: Legumes and Grains Yes, you can have carbs on a cleanse! Try the following: - kidney beans - mung beans - chickpeas - brown rice - quinoa For a specific list of foods to eat on your cleanse diet, please refer to this FREE "}
