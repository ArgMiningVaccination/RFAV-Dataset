Board-approved trainers offer live and online sessions. If you are employed by a chiropractic clinic, your supervising doctor may provide the training as described in the syllabus. Please utilize the DC Guidelines and Form below. You must complete 12 hours of initial training, including eight (8) hours of lecture and four (4) hours of hands-on training. Hands-on training must cover hydrotherapy, electrotherapy, and physiotherapy. A certificate of completion must be submitted with your application packet. A BLS/AED/CPR certification must be obtained to be a certified CA within the first year of certification : Training Resource Chiropractic Assistant Training Resource - studying the references does not guarantee an applicant will pass the examination. Applicants for chiropractic assistant certification must be fingerprinted, even if recently printed for another Oregon license or certificate. If you are a chiropractic student with an application for your DC license, you do not need to be fingerprinted a second time for the CA application, or pay the fee. Please notify OBCE staff. $46.25 of your initial application fee covers the cost of the background report, not the actual fingerprinting. Felony convictions and a few other serious charges, arrests or convictions will cause the application to be reviewed by the Executive Director and/or full board; this could extend the application process significantly. Although you may not provide any therapies, you can still renew a certificate, however, you must meet the standard renewal requirement, plus: Renewal is annual. Board staff will email the \"renewal notice\" approximately 45 days prior to your renewal date (last day of birth month). The notice will remind you of your education requirements, and provide a link to the online renewal site (also provided below). Continuing Education hours: Six (6) and two of those 6 hours must be training on taking vitals, and one (1) of 6 hours must be cultural competency.
