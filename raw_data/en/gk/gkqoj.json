Nonetheless, supplement use is widespread at all levels of sport. Products described as supplements target different issues, including (1) the management of micronutrient deficiencies, (2) supply of convenient forms of energy and macronutrients, and (3) provision of direct benefits to performance or (4) indirect benefits such as supporting intense training regimens. The appropriate use of some supplements can benefit the athlete, but others may harm the athlete's health, performance, and/or livelihood and reputation (if an antidoping rule violation results). A complete nutritional assessment should be undertaken before decisions regarding supplement use are made. Supplements claiming to directly or indirectly enhance performance are typically the largest group of products marketed to athletes, but only a few (including caffeine, creatine, specific buffering agents and nitrate) have good evidence of benefits. However, responses are affected by the scenario of use and may vary widely between individuals because of factors that include genetics, the microbiome and habitual diet. Supplements intended to enhance performance should be thoroughly trialled in training or simulated competition before being used in competition. Inadvertent ingestion of substances prohibited under the antidoping codes that govern elite sport is a known risk of taking some supplements. Protection of the athlete's health and awareness of the potential for harm must be paramount; expert professional opinion and assistance is strongly advised before an athlete embarks on supplement use. In T rodu CTI on Dietary supplements are used by athletes at all levels of sport, reflecting the prevalence of their use in the wider society. About half of the adult US popula-tion uses some form of dietary supplements, 1 and although there are regional, cultural and economic differences, a similar prevalence is likely in many other countries. Athletes describe a range of different reasons for their supplement choices, 2 and products that fit the description of 'supplement' can target various roles within the athlete's perfor - mance plan. These include the maintenance of good health by contributing to the required intake of specific nutrients, the management of micro-nutrient deficiencies, and the provision of energy and macronutrient needs that might be difficult to achieve through food intake alone. Other specific uses of supplements reported by athletes include direct performance enhancement or the indirect benefits that arise from the provision of support for hard training, the manipulation of physique, the alleviation of musculoskeletal pain, rapid recovery from injury and enhancement of mood. Some sporting bodies now support the pragmatic use of supplements that have passed a risk-ver - sus-benefit analysis of being effective, safe and permitted for use, while also being appropriate to the athlete's age and maturation in their sport. This review summarises the issues faced by high-per - formance athletes and their support team (coach, trainer, nutritionist, physician) when considering the use of supplements, with the goal of providing information to assist them to make informed decisions. WhAT Is A supplemen T ? There is no single definition, either legal or within nutritional science, of what constitutes a dietary supplement. The US Congress, for example, in framing the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA; https:// ods. od. nih. gov/ a dietary supplement as: '...a product, other than tobacco, which is used in conjunction with a healthy diet and contains one or more of the following dietary ingredients: a vitamin, mineral, herb or other botanical, an amino acid, a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total daily intake, or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combinations of these ingredients'. 3 This definition is unsatisfactory, as it depends on whether or not a 'healthy diet' is consumed. For the purposes of this overview, we define a dietary supplement as the following: A food, food component, nutrient, or non-food compound that is purposefully ingested in addition to the habitually consumed diet with the aim of achieving a specific health and/or performance benefit.group.bmj.com on March 20, 2018 - Published by http://bjsm.bmj.com/ Downloaded from 440 Maughan RJ, et al. Br J Sports Med 2018;52:439-455. doi:10.1136/bjsports-2018-099027Consensus statement Furthermore, we recognise that dietary supplements come in many forms, including the following: 1. functional foods, foods enriched with additional nutrients or components outside their typical nutrient composition (eg, mineral-fortified and vitamin-fortified, as well as nutrient-enriched foods) 2. formulated foods and sports foods, products providing energy and nutrients in a more convenient form than normal foods for general nutrition support (eg, liquid meal replace-ments) or for targeted use around exercise (eg, sports drinks, gels, bars) 3. single nutrients and other components of foods or herbal products provided in isolated or concentrated forms 4. multi-ingredient products containing various combinations of those products described above that target similar outcomes. prevA len C e of, A nd r ATI on A le for, use by A T hle T es With such widespread use of supplements in the general popu-lation and with the specific focus of athletes on achieving peak performance, it is not surprising that a high prevalence of supple-ment use is reported in most surveys of athletes. 4 Comparisons between surveys are confounded by numerous factors: these include differences in the definition of what constitutes a dietary supplement; ability to capture irregular use; inappropriate sample selection; and the use of non-validated and non-stan-dardised survey instruments. 5 Nevertheless, surveys generally suggest that supplement use:1. varies across different sports and activities 2. increases with level of training/performance 3. increases with age 4. is higher in men than in women 5. is strongly influenced by perceived cultural norms (both sporting and non-sporting). Although athletes often consume supplements to take advantage of intended/claimed effects or benefits, a range of motives underpin supplement use. 5 For example, athletes use supplements:1. to correct or prevent nutrient deficiencies that may impair health or performance 2. for convenient provision of energy and nutrients around an exercise session 3. to achie ve a specific and direct performance benefit in competition 4. to gain a perform ance improvement indirectly accrued from outcomes such as allowing more effective training (ie, higher intensity, greater volume), better recovery from training sessions, optimising mass and body composition, or reducing risks of injury and illness 5. for financial gain (sponsorship) or because products are provided free of charge 6. as a 'just in case' insurance policy 7. because they know or believe that other athletes/competitors are using the supplement(s). Some supplements may be used for multiple functions. Zinc, for example, may be taken with the aim of promoting wound healing and tissue repair, 6 or reducing the severity and dura- tion of the symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection.7 Carbohydrate supplements are used to enhance performance in many events via the provision of fuel substrate, 8 to support the immune system9 or to improve bioavailability of other supple- ments, for example, creatine.10 Similarly, creatine supplementa- tion may directly enhance performance in strength and power events, and can assist in training harder, gaining lean body mass or maintaining lean mass during periods of immobilisation after injury. 11-13 Decisions on supplement use therefore need to consider both the context of use and the specific protocol employed. Assess Ing T he ev I den C e bA se for supplemen T use Supplements target a range of scenarios of use, so different approaches are needed to assess their effectiveness. Supplements aimed at correcting nutrient deficiencies need to be judged on their ability to prevent or treat suboptimal nutrient status, with the benefit accruing from the removal of the associated impair - ment of health, training capacity or performance. The effec-tiveness of sports foods might be hard to isolate when they are used within the general diet to meet everyday energy needs and nutrient targets. However, benefits may be more easily detected when they are specifically consumed before, during or after an event or training session to provide nutrients that are limiting for performance (eg, to provide fuel for the muscle or brain) or to defend homeostasis (eg, by replacing water and salt losses). Performance-enhancing supplements, which are claimed to achieve direct or indirect benefits, pose a greater challenge in terms of a sound evidence base. With only a few exceptions, there is a scarcity of research, and many of the available studies are not of sufficient quality to warrant their application to elite athletes. Substantiating the claims made about performance supple- ments and sports foods is difficult. 14 To various audiences, 'proof' comes in different forms. Figure 1 provides a proposed hierar - chical model of the relative strength of the evidence provided by different information sources. However, most of the information around supplement efficacy in sport comes from models with the lowest rigour: anecdotes/observations from athletes; and scientific or mechanistic hypotheses that explain how a supple-ment might target a critical/limiting factor in performance, but with little to no evidence. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which synthesise the outputs of many studies to yield a conclu-sive statement of efficacy in a broad sense, are at the top of the evidence hierarchy. While these summaries help to provide information about the general use of performance supplements, scientific trials that are properly controlled and well-conducted provide the basis for these reviews as well as an opportunity to address more specific questions about supplement applications. Thus, meta-analyses are a reflection only of the quality and quantity of the studies that are available for review, and may also be influenced by the inclusion and exclusion criteria applied to the available data. The 'gold standard' for investigating the effects of supple- ments on sports performance is the prospective, randomised, controlled scientific trial, in which subjects are randomly allo-cated to receive either an experimental or placebo treatment (ideally in a double-blind manner) or crossed over to receive both treatments in counterbalanced order, under standardised conditions. Practical issues may cause some variations to ideal design, but sports scientists are encouraged, if they wish their results to be applicable to athletes in competition, to ensure that their studies include the following:1. an adequate sample size and appropriate participant characteristics (eg, event, training status, calibre) to allow the results to have statistical power and to be applicable to high-performance athletes 2. mimicking, as far as possible, the conditions (eg, environ- ment, nutrition preparation, event strategies) that exist in real-life competitiongroup.bmj.com on March 20, 2018 - Published by http://bjsm.bmj.com/ Downloaded from 441 Maughan RJ, et al.

Given the specificity of the information that is required by some athletes and their support staff to assess the effectiveness of a supplement (eg, related to a targeted event and its condi-tions, the specific individual, the combination with other perfor - mance strategies), it is unreasonable to expect that definitive evidence will always be available. Issues that are particularly under-researched and should be considered of high priority include measurement of performance in the field or under 'real-life' conditions, investigation of the combined use of a number of supplements, and the repeated use of supplements as might occur in multiday competition or when heats and finals occur close together. Scenarios that fall outside the scope of the avail - able literature or practical research design may need to be inter - rogated by individual or small group case studies. Recommended methodologies for these studies include repeated baseline perfor - mances before the introduction of the supplement, or an alter - nating series of presentation and absence of the supplement. 15 For the purposes of this overview, we rely primarily on studies of healthy adults that are relevant to athletes. We recognise that data from studies of elite athletes are almost entirely absent. We also recognise that mechanistic studies on animal and cell culture models are useful in identifying mechanisms, but a mechanism is not necessary to demonstrate an effect that may be mean-ingful to an athlete: what we think today to be the mechanism by which enhancement of performance or health occurs might be proved wrong by later studies. It must also be recognised that an individual's habitual diet can affect gene expression and their microbiota, and these in turn can affect response to supplemen-tation. While the variation in the genome between individuals is less than 0.01%, the variation in microbiota is significant (80%-90%), and emerging data suggest that both these factors could affect athletic performance. 16 17 The following sections present an overview of the use of supplements to address different roles in sports nutrition, first by identifying the principles of use and then by examining some of the specific products that have a good or emerging evidence base to support this situation-spe-cific use by athletes. supplements used to prevent or treat nutrient deficiencies Many micronutrients play an important role in the regula-tion of processes that underpin sports performance, ranging from energy production to the manufacture of new cells and proteins. A frank deficiency of one or more of these nutri-ents may lead to a measurable impairment of sports perfor - mance\u2014either directly or by reducing the athlete's ability to train effectively (eg, iron deficiency anaemia) or to stay free from illness or injury (eg, impact of vitamin D deficiency on bone health). Athletes are not immune to the inadequate eating practices or the increased nutrient loss/requirements found in some members of the general population and may even be at greater risk of deficiencies because of increased nutrient turn-over or increased losses. A further challenge is the occurrence of subclinical deficiencies that may be both hard to assess (ie, they lack a clear metric or universal threshold of what is 'adequate') as well as being subject to debate about whether there is an 'optimal' level for performance that differs from the usual classification systems of nutrient status (deficiency/subclinical deficiency/normal). When suboptimal nutritional status is diagnosed, the use of a nutrient supplement to reverse figure 1 Hierarchy of evidence used to establish good practice focused on the issue of nutritional supplements.group.bmj.com on March 20, 2018 - Published by http://bjsm.bmj.com/ Downloaded from 442 Maughan RJ, et al. Br J Sports Med 2018;52:439-455. doi:10.1136/bjsports-2018-099027Consensus statement or prevent further deficiencies can contribute to the overall treatment plan. Nutritional assessment of an athlete involves systematic protocols that obtain, verify and interpret evidence of nutri-tion-related problems, as well as their causes and significance. A complete assessment should ideally include a detailed medical and nutritional history, diet evaluation, anthropometry and body composition analysis, and biochemical testing. 18 Unlike the ad hoc use of nutrient supplements taken by athletes as an insurance policy, this nutritional assessment should ensure that the athlete:1. can address the factors that led to the nutrient deficiency, including ensuring that the athlete's nutrition plan is adequate in energy, macronutrients and micronutrients 2. would benefit from an acute or chronic period of supplemen- tation to correct and/or prevent a nutrient deficiency and can understand the appropriate supplementation protocol 3. is not at risk for health issues associated with supplement use, including interactions with prescription or over-the-counter medications 4. has a baseline assessment against which future measures to assess progress can be compared. Nutrients that often need to be supplemented under these circumstances include iron, calcium and vitamin D (table 1 ). Iodine (for those living in areas with low levels of iodine in foods or not using iodised salt), folate (for women who might become pregnant) and vitamin B 12 (for those following a vegan or near- vegan diet) supplementation may be warranted in these popula-tion groups, but these considerations do not apply specifically to athletes. supplements (sports foods) used to provide a practical form of ener gy and nutrients Sports nutrition guidelines provide clear recommendations for targeted intake of energy and nutrients in a variety of contexts. In some situations, it is impractical for an athlete to consume 'everyday' or normal foods to meet their nutrition goals due to issues around preparation or storage, ease of consuming the foods due to training schedules, gut comfort, or the challenge of meeting nutrient targets within the available energy budget. In these cases, sports foods can provide a convenient, although usually more expensive, alternative option for meeting these nutrient goals. Table 2 provides an overview of products that fit this description and their more common evidence-based uses. supplements that directly improve sports performance A few performance-enhancing supplements might, at the present time, be considered to have an adequate level of support to suggest that marginal performance gains may be possible. These supplements include caffeine, creatine (in the form of creatine monohydrate), nitrate, sodium bicarbonate and possibly also Beta-alanine. The mechanisms of action, typical dose, poten-tial performance benefits and known side effects of each of these supplements are summarised in table 3 . Performance-en- hancing supplements should be considered only where a strong evidence base supports their use as safe, legal and effective, and ideally after adequacy of sports nutrition dietary practices is ensured. Whenever possible, supplements should be trialled thoroughly by the athlete in training that mimics the competi-tion milieu as closely as possible before committing to use in a competition setting. Athletes should do a careful risk analysis to see if the marginal gains would outweigh the risk of inadvertent doping due to contamination. supplements that improve performance indirectly Many dietary supplements claim to enhance performance indi-rectly\u2014by supporting the athlete's health, body composition, and their ability to train hard, recovery quickly, adapt optimally, avoid or recover from injury, and tolerate pain or soreness. Illness is a major problem for athletes if it interrupts training or occurs at a critical time, such as during a selection event or a major competition. Susceptibility to illness is increased in situa-tions where athletes are involved in a high volume of training or competition, and either intentionally or unintentionally expe-rience deficits in energy intake (eg, weight loss (eg, vitamin D insufficiency in the winter). 19 Athletes might benefit from nutritional supplements to support Table 1 Examples of micronutrients often requiring supplementation in athle tes (see Larson-Meyer et al18 for additional information) micronutrient o verview d iagnosis and outcomes of insufficiency p rotocols and outcomes of supplementation Vitamin D It is important in the regulation of gene transcription in most tissues, so insufficiency/deficiency affects many body systems. 42 Many athletes are at risk of insufficiency at various times throughout the year. 43No consensus over the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (the marker of vitamin D status) that defines deficiency, insufficiency, sufficiency and a tolerable upper limit.The need to supplement depends on UVB exposure and skin type.Supplementation of between 800 IU and 1000-2000 IU/day is recommended to maintain status for the general population. Supplementation guidelines are not yet established in athletes. Short-term, high-dose supplementation which includes 50 000 IU/week for 8-16 weeks or 10 000 IU/day for several weeks may be appropriate for restoring status in deficient athletes . Careful monitoring is necessary to avoid toxicity.44 Iron Suboptimal iron status may result from limited iron intake, poor bioavailability and/or inadequate energy intake, or excess iron need due to rapid growth, high-altitude training, menstrual blood loss, foot-strike haemolysis, or excess losses in sweat, urine or faeces. 45Several measures performed simultaneously provide the best assessment and determine the stage of deficiency. Recommended measures: serum ferritin, and mean corpuscular volume. 46Athletes who do not maintain adequate iron status may need supplemental iron at doses greater than their RD A (ie, >18 mg/ day for women and >8 mg/day for men). Athletes with iron deficiency require clinical follow-up, which may include supplementation with larger doses of oral iron supplementation along with improved dietary iron intake. 45 Numerous oral iron preparations are available and most are equally effective as long as they are taken. 47 High-dose iron supplements, however, should not be taken unless iron deficiency is present. Calcium Avoidance of dairy products and other calcium-rich foods, restricted energy intake and/or disordered eating increases risk of suboptimal calcium status. 45There is no appropriate indicator of calcium status. Bone mineral density scan may be indicative of chronic low calcium intake, but other factors including suboptimal vitamin D status and disordered eating are also important.Calcium intakes of 1500 mg/day and 1500-2000 IU vitamin D are recommended to optimise bone health in athletes with low energy av ailability or menstrual dysfunction.45 Note: Indiscriminate supplementation with any of the above nutrients is not recommended. Deficiencies should first be identified through nutritional assessment, which includes dietary intake and the appropriate blood or urinary marker, if available. 17group.bmj.com on March 20, 2018 - Published by http://bjsm.bmj.com/ Downloaded from 443 Maughan RJ, et al.

Table 4 summarises evidence for some of the commonly promoted 'immune supportive' supplements, noting that the most promising candidates to assist in the prevention or treat-ment of upper respiratory symptoms are vitamin D and probi-otics. Vitamin C during periods of heavy exertion and zinc lozenges at the onset of symptoms may be useful, but high doses of single antioxidants, particularly vitamins C and E, may blunt exercise-induced training adaptations. 20-22 Probiotic supple- diarrhoea and gastrointestinal infection. Cochrane reviews have noted the low quality of many studies on nutritional supplements that are claimed to support immunity; specifically, small samples, poor controls and unclear procedures for randomisation and blinding were commonplace. 23 24 Clearly, there is a pressing need for randomised controlled trials in high-level athletes with sufficient participant numbers, rigorous controls and procedures, appro-priate supplementation regimens, and clinically meaningful measures of immunity.Supplements that assist an athlete to train harder, recover more quickly and prevent injury, or accelerate return to play when injury does occur can obviously enhance the athlete's prepara-tion and, indirectly, their competition outcomes. Many prod-ucts claim to provide benefits of this nature; table 5 summarises the evidence for some of the most popular compounds. Finally, the manipulation of body composition, including gaining lean (muscle) mass and reducing body fat levels, can contribute to performance in many events. This explains the large number of 'weight gainers' and 'fat burners' in the general and sports supplement market, although many of these are prohibited in sport. Protein is considered to be the premier ingredient in weight gain-promoting supplements, and evidence-based reviews conclude that protein is effective at promoting lean mass gain when combined with resistive exercise. 25 Evidence of efficacy for 'fat burning' supplements is far from conclusive, however, and there is a complete absence of evidence for the effectiveness of the vast majority of supplements marketed in this category. Table 6 summarises the evidence for some of the most common ingredients or products of this type.25Table 2 Summary of common sports foods and functional foods used by a thletes. sports food form T ypical composition Common sports-related use Sports drink Powder or ready to drink liquid 5%-8% CHO 10-35 mmol/L sodium 3-5 ostexercise and refuelling Energy drink Ready-to-drink liquid or concentrated shotCarbohydrate, especially in typical ready-to-drink varietiesCaffeineNote: may contain taurine, B vitamins and other ingredients with variable supporting evidence and some level of concernPre-exercise caffeine supplementCarbohydrate and caffeine intake during exercise Sports gel or sports confectioneryGel: 30-40 g sachets confectionery: jelly-type confectionery g)~25 g CHO per sachet or ~5 g CHO per confectionery pieceSome contain caffeine or electrolytesCarbohydrate intak e during exercise rehydration following dehydration undertak en sodium losses during ultra-endurance activitiesRapid postexercise rehydration following moderate to large fluid and sodium deficits Protein supplement Powder (mix with water or milk) or ready-to-drink liquidProtein-rich bar, usually low in CHOProvides 20-50 g protein in a single serve from high- quality types of animal (whey, casein, milk, egg) or vegetable (eg, soy) originNote: may contain other ingredients, some of which are not evidence-based and may increase the risk of contaminationPostexercise recovery following key training sessions or events where adaptation requiring protein synthesis is desiredAchievement of increase in lean mass during growth or response to resistance trainingPortable nutrition for busy schedule or travel Liquid meal supplementPowder (mix with water or milk) or ready-to-drink liquid1-1.5 protein RDI/RD diet (especially during training/competition or weight gain)Low-bulk meal replacement (especially pre-event meal)Postexercise recovery (CHO and protein)Portable nutrition for busy schedule or travel Sports bar Bar 40-50 g CHO 5-10 g protein Usually low in fat and fibreVitamins/minerals: 50%-100% of RDA/RDIsNote: may contain other ingredients, some of which are not evidence-based and may increase the risk of contaminationCHO source during exercisePostexercise recovery\u2014provides CHO, protein and micronutrientsPortable nutrition for busy schedule or travel Protein-enhanced food Milk, yoghurt, ice cream, cereal bars and other food formsIncreased protein content from normal food variety achieved by adding protein sources or filtration of water from productTypically allows normal portion to provide ~20 g protein to meet sports nutrition targetV alue-added food able to achieve protein target for postexercise use or to improve protein content of other meals and snacks in an athlete's diet CHO, carbohydrate.group.bmj.com on March 20, 2018 - Published by http://bjsm.bmj.com/ Downloaded from 444 Maughan RJ, et al.

Protocol of use Loading phase: ~20 g/day (divided into four equal daily doses), for 5-7 days61 Maintenance phase: 3-5 g/day (single dose) for the duration of the supplementation period62 Note: concurrent consumption with a mixed protein/CHO source (~50 g of protein and CHO) may enhance muscle creatine uptak e via insulin stimulation.10 Performance Impact Enhanced maximum isometric strength63 and the acute performance of single and repeated bouts of high-intensity exercise (<150 s duration); most pronounced effects evident during tasks <30 s13 61 Chronic training adaptations include lean mass gains and improvements to muscular strength and power.58 59 Less common: enhanced endurance performance resulting from increased/improved protein synthesis, glycogen storage and thermoregulation64 65 Potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects are noted.66 Further considerations and potential side effectsNo negative health effects are noted with long-term use (up to 4 years) when appropriate loading protocols are followed.67 A potential 1-2 kg BM increase after creatine loading (primarily as a result of w ater retention66 68) may be detrimental for endurance performance or in events where the BM must be moved against gravity (eg, high jump, pole vault) or where athletes must achieve a specific BM target. n itrate Overview Dietary nitrate (NO3) is a popular supplement that has been commonly investigated to assess any benefits for prolonged submaximal exercise69 and high-intensity, intermittent, short-duration efforts.70 71 Mechanism Enhances nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability via the NO3-nitrite-NO pathway, playing an important role in the modulation of skeletal muscle function72 Nitrate augments exercise performance via an enhanced function of type II muscle fibres73; a reduced ATP cost of muscle force production; an increased efficiency of mitochondrial respiration; an increased blood flow to the muscle; and a decrease in blood flow to VO2 heterogeneities.74 Protocol of use High nitrate-containing foods include leafy green and root vegetables, including spinach, rocket salad, celery and beetroot.Acute performance benefits are generally seen within 2-3 hours following an NO3 bolus of Prolonged periods intake (>3 days) also appear beneficial to performance70 76 and may be a positive strategy for highly trained athletes, where performance gains from NO3 supplementation appear harder to obtain.77 Performance impact Supplementation has been associated with improvements of 4%-25% in exercise time to exhaustion and of 1%-3% in sport-specific TT performances lasting <40 min in duration.73 78 Supplementation is proposed to enhance type II muscle fibre function,73 resulting in the improvement (3%-5%) of high-intensity, intermittent, team-sport exercise of 12-40 min in duration.70 71 Evidence is equivocal for any benefit to exercise tasks lasting <12 min.76 79 Further considerations and potential side effectsThe available evidence suggests there appear to be few side effects or limitations to nitrate supplementation.There may exist the potential for GI upset in susceptible athletes, and should therefore be thoroughly trialled in training.There appears to be an upper limit to the benefits of consumption (ie, no greater benefit from 16.8 mmol (1041 mg) vs 8.4 mmol (521 mg)).80 Performance gains appear harder to obtain trained athletes.77 beta-alanine Overview Beta-alanine augments intracellular buffering capacity, having potential beneficial effects on sustained high-intensity exercise performance. Mechanism A rate-limiting precursor to the endogenous intracellular (muscle) buffer, carnosine; the immediate defence against proton accumulation in the contracting musculature during exercise 81 Chronic, daily supplementation of Beta-alanine increases skeletal muscle carnosine content.82 Protocol of use Daily consumption of ~65 mg/kg BM, ingested via a split-dose regimen (ie, 0.8-1.6 g every 3-4 hours) over an extended supplement time frame of 10-12 weeks82 Continuedgroup.bmj.com on March 20, 2018 - Published by http://bjsm.bmj.com/ Downloaded from 445 Maughan RJ, et al. Br J Sports Med 2018;52:439-455. doi:10.1136/bjsports-2018-099027Consensus statement Adverse effe CTs Adverse effects from the use of supplements may arise from a number of factors, including the safety and composition of the product per se and inappropriate patterns of use by athletes. Poor practices by athletes include the indiscriminate mixing and matching of many products without regard to total doses of some ingredients or problematic interactions between ingredients. Even commonly used products may have negative side effects, especially when used outside the optimal protocol. For example, iron supplementation in those with already adequate iron stores can result in symptoms that may begin with vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain, and develop to haemochromatosis and liver failure. 26 Bicarbonate may cause gastrointestinal distress when ingested in amounts sufficient to enhance performance; this can impair rather than improve performance and may coun-teract the benefits of other supplements taken at the same time. 27 The 'more is better' philosophy, when applied to caffeine, may result in side effects, including nausea, anxiety, accelerated heart rate and insomnia, that outweigh the performance bene-fits. 28 Unwanted outcomes become more common with caffeine doses 9 mg/kg body mass, but maximal benefits are usually achieved with intakes of 3-6 mg/kg.29 The possibility of more serious outcomes is illustrated by adverse, and potentially fatal, responses in two separate incidents in which very large doses (up to 30 g) of caffeine were administered to healthy volunteers participating in laboratory studies (http://www. due to errors in the dose calculation: if this can happen in a university research environment with supposed oversight by experienced staff, the potential clearly exists for similar errors by athletes and coaches. Athletes and members of their support team should be aware of the regulations that govern the manufacture and marketing of supplements. According to the 1994 DSHEA (https:// ods. od. nih. gov/ About/ DSHEA_ Wording. aspx) passed by US Congress, nutritional supplements sold in the USA that do not claim to diagnose, prevent or cure disease are not subject to regulation by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA). Similar regulations apply in most other countries, where supplements are regu-lated in the same way as food ingredients and are therefore not subject to the stringent regulations that are applied to the pharmaceutical industry. This means that there is no require-ment to prove claimed benefits, no requirement to show safety with acute or chronic administration, no quality assurance of content, and liberal labelling requirements. It is well-recognised that there are problems with some of the dietary supplements on sale, but the options open to those responsible for food safety are limited by the legislation that applies. The FDA regularly uses its powers to recall products in breach of the regulations, although they fully admit that their resources are insufficient for comprehensive monitoring, and recalls generally occur only after many people are harmed they have recently recalled supplement products containing excessive doses of vita-mins A, D, B 6 and selenium because of potentially toxic levels of these components. Examples of product complaints have included the presence of impurities, including lead, broken glass and metal fragments, because of the failure of the producers to observe good manufacturing practice. The risk of gastrointes-tinal upset because of poor hygiene during the production and storage of products is also of concern. Although this may seem a minor inconvenience, and of similarity to food safety issues, the coincidence of problems around a crucial training period or competitive event may significantly interfere with the athlete's performance goals. It should be noted, though, that all of these problems are also regularly reported in normal foods. Some supplements may actually cause harm to health, but these can be difficult to identify, and products are usually with-drawn only after a significant number of adverse events have occurred. For example, a range of products containing hydroxy - citric acid were withdrawn from sale, but only after they were linked with the death of one consumer and with a substantial number of other cases of liver toxicity, cardiovascular problems and seizures (https://www. fda. gov/ downloads/ safety/ recalls/ enforcementreports/ ucm169089. pdf). The extent of the problem is illustra ted by the fact that, in the USA in 2015, approximately Performance impact Small, but potentially meaningful performance benefits (~0.2%-3%) during both continuous and intermittent exercise tasks of 30 s to 10 min in duration82-84 Further considerations and potential side effectsA positive correlation between the magnitude of muscle carnosine change and performance benefit remains to be established.82 Large interindividual variations in muscle carnosine synthesis have been reported.85 The supplement effectiveness appears harder to realise in well-trained athletes.86 There is a need for further investigation to establish the practical use in various sport-specific situations.82 87 Possible negative side effects include skin rashes and/or transient paraesthesia. s odium bicarbonate Overview Sodium bicarbonate augments extracellular buffering capacity, having potential beneficial effects on sustained high-intensity exercise performance. Mechanism Acts as an extracellular (blood) buffer, aiding intracellular pH regulation by raising the extracellular pH, and HCO3 concentrations81 88 The resultant pH gradient between the intracellular and extracellular environments leads to efflux of H+ and La from the exercising muscle .88 89 Protocol of use Single acute NaHCO3 dose of 0.2-0.4 g/kg BM, consumed 60-150 min prior to exercise90 91 Alternative strategies include the following:Split doses (ie, several smaller doses giving the same total intake) taken over a time period of 30-180 min92 Serial loading with 3-4 smaller doses per day for 2-4 consecutive days prior to an event93-95 Performance impact Enhanced performance (~2%) of short-term, high-intensity sprints lasting ~60 s in duration, with a reduced efficacy as the effort duration exceeds 10 min90 Further considerations and potential side effectsWell-established GI distress may be associated with this supplement.Strategies to minimise GI upset include the following:Coingestion with a small, carbohydrate-rich meal (~1.5 g/kg BM carbohydrates)96 Use of sodium citrate as an alternative97 Split dose or stacking strategies93-95 Given the high potential for GI distress, thorough investigation into the best individualised strategy is recommended prior to use in a competition setting.Table 3 Continued group.bmj.com on March 20, 2018 - Published by http://bjsm.bmj.com/ Downloaded from 446 Maughan RJ, et al.

Br J Sports Med 2018;52:439-455. doi:10.1136/bjsports-2018-099027Consensus statement 23 000 emergency department visits annually are reported to be associated with dietary supplement use.30 This figure can be viewed as substantial, or it can be seen as small compared with the total number of adverse responses associated with the use of medications. 15 However, minor problems that do not require acute medical aid may still be sufficient to interrupt training or prevent participation, so this statistic probably underestimates the risk for athletes. The biggest concern for athletes who compete under an anti- doping code (usually the World Anti-Doping Code, as published by WADA) is that supplements can contain prohibited substances that result in an antidoping rule violation (ADRV). Athletes\u2014and their support teams\u2014may be at risk for an ADRV if there is evidence that they have used or attempted to use products containing ingredients on the Prohibited List (www. wada. ama. org). A common problem is the recording of an adverse analyt- ical finding (AAF) of a prohibited substance in a urine sample ('positive drug test') as a result of supplement use. 31 Millions of athletes may be subject to antidoping testing, although these are mostly professional-level, national-level or international-level athletes. For these athletes in particular, even if the ingestion of the prohibited substance was unintentional, the rules of strict liability within the World Anti-Doping Code mean that an AAF will be recorded, and may mean the loss of medals won or records set, and financial sanctions as well as temporary or permanent suspension from competition. It also damages the athlete's reputation and may lead to loss of employment and income through failed sponsorship opportunities. Where there has been deliberate cheating or benefit accrued from the use of a prohibited substance, these penalties seem entirely appropriate, but it is undoubtedly true that some ADRVs can be attributed to the innocent ingestion of prohibited substances in dietary supplements, with catastrophic results for the athlete. One cause of an AAF arising from supplement use relates to an athlete's failure to read product labels to recognise the presence of prohibited substances. Many athletes consider supplements to be 'natural' or 'regulated' and therefore safe. Other athletes are confused by the number of chemical names for some prohib-ited substances and thus fail to recognise them on the product label. However, the most worrying cause of an inadvertent AAF is the use of supplements that contain prohibited substances as an undeclared ingredient or contaminant. Since the publication of the seminal study on the presence of undeclared prohibited substances in supplements, 32 there have been numerous reports of supplement contamination.31 Recent reviews suggest that this It is difficult to gain a perspective of the true prevalence of supplement contamination. Although the original study reported that ~15% of more than 600 products acq uired from around the world contained undeclared prohormones,32 this and other investiga- tions rarely include a truly random sample of the supplements and sports foods used by athletes. Some individual products or categories of products can be considered inherently more at risk of contamination due to the country of origin, the manufacturer, the type of product and the range of declared ingredients (https://www. usada. org/ substances/ supplement- 411/). Never - theless, it should also be recognised that common supplements, including vitamin C, multivitamins and minerals, have also been found, although rarely, to contain prohibited substances. 34 The range of prohibited substances found as undeclared ingredients in supplements now includes products from many sections of WADA's List of Prohibited Substances and Methods, including stimulants, anabolic agents, selective androgen receptor modula-tors, diuretics, anorectics and 2 agonists. 33 In some cases, the amount of the prohibited substance in a supplement may be high, even higher than the normal thera-peutic dose. For example, Geyer et al 35 reported the analysis of metandienone (commonly known as methandrostenolone or Dianabol) in high amounts in a 'body building' supplement from England. The recommended amount of the supplement would have supplied a dose of 10-43 mg; in comparison, the typical therapeutic dose of this drug was 2.5-5 mg/day ,36 although its medical use has been discontinued in most countries for many years. This amount would certainly have a potent anabolic effect, but would likely produce serious side effects, including psychiatric and behavioural effects, and significant damage to a range of body systems including the liver. 37 Unlike many of the earlier cases involving steroids related to nandrolone and testosterone, this is not a trivial level of contamination and raises the possibility of deliberate adulteration of the product with the intention of producing a measurable effect on muscle strength and muscle mass. Most reports of adverse health outcomes resulting from supplement use have focused on liver problems of varying degrees of severity, but other organs are also affected. One epidemiological case-control study 38 examined the associ- ation between use of muscle-building supplements and testic-ular germ cell cancer (TGCC) risk, with 356 TGCC cases and 513 controls from eastern USA. The OR for the use of muscle-building supplements in relation to risk of TGCC was elevated (OR=1.65, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.46), with significantly stronger associations for early users and longer periods of use. Ironically, supplements that are contaminated with extremely small amounts of prohibited substances\u2014too low to have any physiological effect\u2014may still cause a positive doping outcome. For instance, ingestion of 19-norandrostenedione, a precursor of nandrolone, will result in the appearance in the urine of 19-norandrosterone, the diagnostic metabolite for nandrolone. If the urinary concentration of 19-norandrosterone exceeds 2 ng/mL, an AAF is recorded.39 The addition of as little as 2.5 \u00b5 g of 19-norandrostenedione to a supplement can result in a urinary concentration of 19-norandrosterone that exceeds this threshold. 40 These amounts are close to the limits of detection of the analytical methods currently applied to the analysis of dietary supplements, and are far below the levels of contami-nation deemed acceptable from a health and safety perspective. Various efforts are being made to address the problems, including the use of third-party auditing activities to iden-tify products that athletes may consider to be at 'low risk' of containing prohibited substances.

Enhanced recovery from disuse or immobilisation/extreme inactivity has been reported in some , but not all studies (reviewed in ref 12). Improved cognitive processing is reported in most studies, especially when volunteers were fatigued by sleep deprivation or mental/physical tasks (reviewed in refs 11 123-125). The effects in athletes have not been well-characterised, and only one group attempted to translate these effects to athletic performance, although with a positive result. 126 Decreased damage and enhanced recovery from mTBI are supported by open-label trials in children 127 128 and using animal models.129 These data are not conclusive and more research is warranted. However, athletes at risk for concussion, who already ingest creatine supplements for performance or muscular benefits, may receive important brain benefits as well.A small increase in body mass is common with supplementation. This may be relevant for sports with weight classes/restrictions or where increased body mass may decrease performance. Beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate (HMB)HMB is a metabolite of the amino acid leucine. Manufacturer-recommended dosage is 3 g/day.Enhanced adaptive response to exercise via decreased protein breakdown, increased protein synthesis, increased cholesterol synthesis, increased growth hormone and IGF-I mRNA, increased proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells and inhibited apoptosis (reviewed in ref 130)Beneficial effects of HMB on strength and fat-free mass are small, while the effects on muscle damage are unclear. 131 Recent reports of 'steroid like' gains in strength, power and fat-free mass, and reductions in muscle damage from HMB-free acid supplementation, 132-134 have not been reproduced and seem unlikely.135 Potential use for HMB during extreme inactivity/disuse or recovery from injury, but these effects have only been described in older adults following 10 days of bed rest.136 Benefits of HMB supplementation could most likely be obtained from normal dietary protein or whole protein supplements, 137 so HMB supplements may not be more effective than adhering to the current protein intake recommendations. Omega-3 fatty acidsAbout 2 g/dayImproved cognitive processingDecreased risk/enhanced recovery from mTBIIncreased muscle protein synthesisReduced symptoms of, or enhanced recovery from, muscle damaging exercise (eg, DOMS)Improved cognitive processing following omega-3 fatty acid supplementation shown in healthy older adult with mild or severe cognitive impairment (reviewed in ref 138). It is not known if these benefits would occur in young, healthy athletes, or how this would translate to athletic performance.Animal data show that the structural damage and cognitive decline associated with mTBI are reduced/attenuated with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation when ingested either before or after the injury (reviewed in refs 138-140). Two case studies support these findings,141 142 and large, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are currently under (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT101903525 and NCT01814527).In muscle, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation can increase muscle protein synthesis, 143 144 but this may not occur when protein is ingested after exercise in recommended amounts.143 144 Anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3 fatty acid intake may reduce muscle damage or enhance recovery from intense, eccentric exercise (eg, decrease DOMS), but this is not a consistent finding. 145 146 No indication that decreased omega-3 fatty acids in the body impair performance, and high-dose supplements can cause some adverse effects (reviewed in refs 114 139), so the best recommendation may be to include rich sources of omega-3 fatty acids, such as fatty fish, in the diet instead of supplements. Low risk but unclear if supplementation should be pursued by athletes, in lieu of including fatty fish in the diet as a source of omega-3 fatty acids.Fish oil or omega-3 fatty acid supplement consumption could include heavy metal contaminants, or cause bleeding, digestive problems and/or increased LDL.

Athletes who take supplements often have no clear understanding of the poten-tial effects of supplements they are using, but supplements should be used only after a careful cost-benefit analysis has been conducted. On one side of the decision tree are the rewards, the most obvious of which are correction of nutrient deficien-cies, achievement of nutritional goals, or enhancement of one or another physiological/biochemical function to directly or indi-rectly improve performance. On the other side lie the costs, the possibility of using an ineffective supplement, the possible risks to health and the potential for an ADRV . A flow of questions that could be posed in reaching an informed decision is shown in figures 2 and 3. In deciding whether to use a supplement, athletes should consider all aspects of their maturation in, and preparation for, their event to ensure that the supplement under consider - ation provides an advantage that no other strategy can address. Whether the supplement is practical to use should also be assessed: is the product available, affordable, tolerated and compatible with the athlete's other goals? The input of the athlete's coaching team and medical/science support network is important. Athletes who do not have regular access to such a network should consider decisions around supplement use as an important reason to consult an independent sports nutrition expert as well as a physician. Analysis of the evidence around the effectiveness of supplements and their safety is often difficult. A complete nutritional assessment may provide an appropriate justification for the specific use of nutritional supplements and sports foods. For a small number of sports supplements, there is good evidence of a performance effect or indirect benefit for some athletes in some specific situations with little or no risk of adverse outcomes. 28 41 Professional advice is often important in figure 2 Flow chart to guide informed decision making and reducing risk of antidoping rule violation during nutritional supplement use.

Furthermore, the situation in which the athlete wishes to use the supplement may differ in important ways from its substantiated use. Repeated trials may be necessary to establish whether a true effect, rather than just random variation, is seen in response to use of any novel intervention. Some trial and error may also be involved in fine-tuning the supplement protocol to suit the needs of the specific situation of use or the individual athlete. Evidence to support the effectiveness and safety of many of the supplements targeted at athletes, however, is largely absent. There seems to be little incentive for those selling supplements to invest the substantial sums needed to under - take detailed scientific evaluation of their products. Even where some evidence does exist, it may not be relevant to the high-performance athlete because of limitations in the study design (such as the specificity of the exercise tests), the study population or the context of use. Failure to verify the composi-tion of the supplements used may also give misleading results. It seems sensible to exercise caution when using supplements, as any compound that has the potential to enhance health or exercise performance by altering physiological function must also have the potential for adverse effects in some individuals. Athletes should see good evidence of a performance or other benefit, and should be confident that it will not be harmful to health, before accepting the financial cost and the health or performance risks associated with any supplement. Finally, the athlete should be sure, if supplements or sports foods are to be used, that they have undertaken due diligence to source prod-ucts that are at low risk of containing prohibited substances. ConClusIon Dietary supplements can play a small role in an athlete's sports nutrition plan, with products that include essential micronutrients, sports foods, performance supplements and health supplements all potentially providing benefits. Some supplements, when used appropriately, may help athletes to meet sports nutrition goals, train hard, and stay healthy and injury-free. A few supplements can directly enhance competi-tion performance. However, it takes considerable effort and expert knowledge to identify which products are appropriate, how to integrate them into the athlete's sports nutrition plan, and how to ensure that any benefits outweigh the possible negative side effects, including the potential for an ADRV .
