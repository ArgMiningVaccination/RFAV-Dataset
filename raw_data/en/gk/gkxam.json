The Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Vanderbilt is responsible for assuring that the rights of human subjects are protected when pati ents are involved in research. The IRB follows the federal guidelines for the protection of human subjects required in research-intensive institutions. (The institution's policies, procedures and pr ocesses (including the IRB) that protect the rights of participants in research are provid ed in Organizational Overview Question 27.) The IRB has protocol analysts, many of whom are nurses, who complete a pre-review of each application submitted. The protocol analysts provide explicit feedback to investigators on content in the application that requires modifica tion. This service is invaluable as an application that has been revised based upon pr otocol analyst's recommendations typically is approved with the first review by the IRB committee. The Vanderbilt IRB is composed of 4 co mmittees, 3 for Health Science and 1 for Behavioral Science. Each committee meets week ly for approximately 2 hours and has nursing representation, who are voting members. IRB applications are reviewed by member(s) of the committee with expertise in the content of the proposed research. Therefore, applications directly related to nursing resear ch and/or nursing issues will have a nurse reviewer from the IRB. Exhibit NK 2.1below lists the IRB membersh ip for each of the committees with their areas of expertise. Nurse members are highlighted.

New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Research (4) 4 Research Source of Evidence 4 Describe and demonstrate the structure(s) and process (es) used by the organization to develop, expand, and/or advance nursing research. The mission of VUMC encompasses patien t care, research, and education. Nursing research is supported to meet our research mi ssion for the delivery of quality nursing care. In 2009, the Nursing Executive Board (NEB) identified 3 strategic goals for nursing. One of the 3 strategic goals is to support evidence-based pr actice and development of research by nurses across the Medical Center. To support this strategic goal, nursing admini stration has resources in place to assist nurses to engage in scholarly activities. This infr astructure that is available to nurses who would like to conduct research, evaluate current practice or translate recent evidence into practice includes: (1) a nursing research office staffed by a Director and a program coordinator, (2) the Nursing Research Committee, (3) the EBP & Nurs ing Research website, and (4) the Evidence- based Nursing Practice (EBNP) fellowship progra m. To support dissemination of findings, an annual poster session is held during Research Day and a series of Writing for Publication workshops are offered every year. Nursing Administration Resources Nursing Research Office Central to the structure of the nursing research office is the role of the Director of Nursing Research. A program coordinator also provides support to nurses conducting and disseminating research. This office pr ovides consultation to staff on: Designing research studies Identifying potential sources of funding Identifying data collection methods Developing spreadsheets for data entry Providing preliminary statistical advice Disseminating results through internal and external presentations and publications New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Research (4) 5 The Director, Nancy Wells, is a doctora lly-prepared nurse scientist, who provides consultation on all aspects of the research pr ocess: problem identification, research design, protection of human subjects, data collection pr ocedures, data entry, analysis and integration into current literature. One of the most importan t roles of the Director of Nursing Research is to identify and refer staff to internal resear ch resources. The program coordinator, Troy Simpkins, assists nursing staff in use of the Es kind Biomedical Library, database development, on-line survey preparation, marketing for proj ects and surveys, and po ster preparation. Nurses at all levels of the organization acce ss the services of the Nursing Research Office at any phase of the process; some come at the be ginning with just an idea or a question; some come for assistance in data entry and manageme nt, and others at the end of the project to prepare abstracts and/or posters for presentation. Nursing Research Committee (NRC) This committee was formed in January 2008 and approved as a standing committee in the Nursing Bylaws at the November 2008 convention. [ NK4-Exhibit A-1-Research Committee Charter ] The committee consists of nurses from all le vels of the organization, VUSN faculty, and representatives from the EBM program. [ NK4-Exhibit A-2-NRC Membership ] The purposes of the committee are listed. Our primary purpose is to facilitate the inte gration of evidence-based nursing practice to improve patient outcomes A secondary purpose is to facilitate research activities that generate nursing knowledge This committee has accomplished much in its first 2 years of operation. [ NK4-Exhibit A- 3-NRC Minutes ] In May-June of 2008, the committee conducted an initial survey on EBP (see results below). Results from this survey guided the committee in developing our website. The NRC also hosts an annual Research Day during our week-long Oktoberfest. Research Day provides nurses at Vanderbilt an opportunity to showcase the work they have done to improve nursing practice. Following a keynot e address, concurrent sessions are held and nurses who have completed present them to their colleagues. Research Day also hosts a poster session, where presenters submit abstracts th at are reviewed by a sub-committee of NRC members. [ NK4-Exhibit A-4-Research Day Program, NK4-Exhibit A-5-Poster Presenters ] Research Day provides learning opportunities for the pr esenter and audience. Three posters of the 33 presented in 2009 have been disseminated external ly - 2 at national conferences and 1 through publication.

Th e results of this survey gave us baseline data on EBP for nursing staff and provided us with kn owledge deficits that were used to plan our website and education programs. The survey was repeated in June 2010, to allow the NRC to evaluate the effects of their work. Table 4.1 shows the results from 2008 and 2010. Table NK 4 - 2: Direct Care Nurses A ttitudes Toward EBP 2008 and 2010 Comparison Selected Survey Items 2008 N = 744 M (SD) 2010 N = 1164 M (SD) p I am willing to change practice based on evidence. 3.40 (0.63) 3.57 (0.51) <.001 I use research to guide my practice. 2.92 (0.58) 3.04 (0.58) <.001 Using evidence is not practical. 1.91 (0.63) 1.76 (0.63 <.001 I have access to evidence for practice. 2.97 (0.67) 3.11 (0.66) <.001 I have time to read evidence. 2.38 (0.68) 2.46 (0.67) .01 My supervisor encourages me to use evidence. 2.69 (0.77) 2.81 (0.76) .001 There are limited resources for EBP. 2.38 (0.71) 2.32 (0.72) .06 NS I do not have the authority to make changes based on evidence. 2.30 (0.73) 2.19 (0.74) .001 Note: Possible range for each item 1 - 4 These data suggest that the direct care nurses at Vanderbilt have positive attitudes toward EBP and research. Areas for improvem ent include: access to EBP resources, time, supervisor support and perceiving you have the authority to make changes in practice. Each one of these items except limited resources show ed a statistically significant improvement from 2008 to 2010 Graph NK 4-1 below shows the percent of respondents who used the resources (weekly, 2-3 times a month, monthly) and those who had never used the EBP resource. Following the 2008 survey, we discussed the low use of the EB L with the librarians. We also developed a New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Research (4) 11 Search Tips and Tools tab on the website to assi st nurses in using EBP resources. In working with ZYNX, we launched a campaign to improv e the use of this resource that included distribution of small pocket cards on how to access and use ZYNX. Graph NK 4 - 1: EBP Re source Use 2008 - 2010 There was a statistically significant improvem ent in the use of ZYNX over time, but the actual percent change is small (from 6.4 to 9.7%). The only other significant change in resource use was in the opposite direction indicating a decrease in the use of practice guidelines from 2008 to 2010. One possible explan ation for this declin e is the higher proportion of nurses employed for less than a year in 2010 when compared to 2008. To further evaluate the impact of our webs ite, respondents in 2010 were divided into never used the website to used the website (wee kly, 2-3 times/month, < once a month). There were significant differences in attitudes and resource use between th e two groups. In all instances, nurses who used the website had more favorable attitudes and used the resources for EBP. Thus, the EBP survey has allowed us to evalua te our progress toward the primary goal of the Nursing Research Committee, which is to facilitate the integration of evidence-based nursing practice to improve patient outcomes. One of the most striking aspects of this survey is New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Research (4) 12 the high level of participation of direct care nurse s in 2010. We interpret this as an indication of the value and/or interest of the direct care nurses in EBP. In addition to internal dissemination of these findings, the results of the 2008 survey were presented at the Tennessee Ho spital Association (THA) annual meeting in the fall of 2009. In the fall of 2010, these data will be presented at the 7 th Biennial Joanna Briggs International Colloquium. [ NK4-Exhibit B-1-THA EBP Abstract, NK4-Exhibit B-2-Abstract for Atlanta EBP Conference ] EBP & Nursing Research Website The Vanderbilt Nursing EBP & Nursing Rese arch website was developed to improve knowledge deficits uncovered with the 2008 EBP survey. The website has 6 major tabs that address resources and activities at Vanderbilt related to EBP. http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/root/vum c.php?site=vanderbiltnursing&doc=9019 Table NK 4 - 3: EBP & Nursing Re search Web Site Home Page New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Research (4) 13 There are 3 areas particularly relevant to re search. The first is the \"got a question\" tab, which is an on-line PICO form to be filed out by the nurse. The question posed is researched by an EBM specialist or an EBL librarian, depending on the complexity of the question. These questions may form the basis for research projec ts when little or no evidence is found about the topic. Since the website opened in August 2009, 52 questions have been posted. ( See Table of EBP Questions in OO28, folder EBP Questions-NK4) The second area relevant to research is the \"search tips and tools\" tab. This includes links to many synthesized sites, such as ZYNX. This site also has \"cheat sheets\" to help the nurse use the database. The third area relevant to conducting rese arch is the \"Toolkit\". This tab contains education modules to increase knowledge and understanding of EBP and research. To date, we have 3 programs available to Vanderbilt staff: (1 ) EBP in Nursing, (2) The PICO Process, and (3) Is it Quantitative or Qualitative? Is it Qualitative or Quantitative, which pr ovides basic information about both research approaches, is the starting point for a series of short educational videos on how to critique research studies. The initial video provides the le arner with tips on how to determine what type of research was conducted. We ha ve identified 6 research designs and are currently selecting articles for critique. The designs include: Qualitative research - grounded theory Single group descriptive design Cohort design Quasi-experimental design Randomized clinical trial Meta-analysis This work will lay the foundation for the de velopment of journal clubs. There are several journal clubs currently in place ( see example in NK 7 ), and the NRC is working with a perioperative area to start a journal club. This initial work will provide a template for other units/clinics who wish to begin a journal club. Th ere are also tools and support that support the staff in learning how to critically evaluate re search literature, as well as begin to design research. New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Research (4) 14 Evidence-based Nursing Practice (EBNP) Fellowship This year-long program provides 25 nurses (fe llows) an opportunity to identify practice problems and search for the best evidence availa ble to solve the problem. When little evidence exists to guide practice, the nurse may conduct a study to (1) describe cu rrent practice or (2) investigate potential solutions that have not been published in the literature. The majority of fellows select problems wh ere evidence may be applied to practice; implementation of the new practi ce typically is evaluated using a pre-post test design. The EBNP Roadmap displays the content and learni ng activities included in this program. [ NK4- Exhibit D-1-EBNP Road Map ] Additional description of the EBNP Fellowship program is provided in NK 7.0. Examples of EBNP fellow projec ts are described below and in NK 4.0 and NK 7.0 EO and are listed on the Research Table. Medical Center and University Resources Vanderbilt received a Clinical and Translat ional Science Award (CTSA) award. This award has supported the Medical Center to develop a num ber of core facilities and resources to assist investigators conducting research. Resources funded completely or pa rtially by the CTSA include Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Tr anslational Research (VICTR), and Research Support Services (RSS). Nurses also have access to consulta tion services from the IRB, Vanderbilt School of Nursing, and the wide vari ety of content-specific experts who work at Vanderbilt University. Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (VCTR) VICTR was developed with funding from the CT SA. This Center provides consultation on research design, statistics, IRB application prep aration, poster development and publications. Small grants (< $2,000.00) are available and ca n be reviewed and processed within 2 days. Larger grants require peer review before a f unding decision is made. These funds will pay for supplies, participant payment, and other resear ch-related expenses. They will not, however, pay salary. A new program was la unched in May 2010 to provide re search assistant support for behavioral research projects. This is jointl y funded by the CTSA grant and the Vanderbilt University School of Nursing. The following tabl e provides examples of the support nurses have received from VCTR in the past 12 months.

RSS programs assist research ers with protocol development, IRB navigation and study organization. RSS st affs coordinate research staff training, and contribute to the identification and developmen t of tools and resources to assist research New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Research (4) 16 processes. Through the VICTR, RSS has assisted nurse researchers in receiving priority status for VICTR funding support, staffing for unfunded rese arch, and expert consul tations. Currently, at least 13 nursing projects have received support through RSS/VICTR programs; examples below: Table NK 4 - 5: Examples of Nurses Using RSS Name Project VCTR Resource Used Transplant Nurse Coordinator Practices: Talking with patients about sexual functioning Funds for mailed survey using national distribution list $2000.00 Terri Cesar, RN, MSN; VUSN PhD student Renal Salt Handling in Postural Tachycardia Syndrome Following Dietary and Pharmacological Dopa Administration Use of CRC resources $61.624 Vanessa Briscoe, RN, NP Diabetes/Endocrinology - project in development Consultation of evaluation component for proposed project $200.00 IRB Consultation Service IRB Consultation Service assists any Vande rbilt investigator in preparing the IRB application. In addition, every application that is submitted for review receives a pre-review by one of the protocol analysts. This pre-review is invaluable as the analysts pick up many of the problems or issues the committee would identify in a full review. With the feedback from the analysts, full review IRB applications typically are approved on the first review by the IRB committee. New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Research (4) 17 VUSN Research/Grants office VUSN Research/Grants office provides a ssistance to nurse investigators from the Medical Center who are submitting for external funding. The grants manager helps in grant preparation, budget preparation and justification, and grant funds disbursement. In addition to the grants manager, nursing staff in the Medical Center have access to a statistician (5% time and effort) who can assist with file manipulation, statistical analysis and interpretation of data. The statistician (Dr. Dietrich) has assisted wi th the analysis in 3 studies conducted by nurse investigators in the past 12 months. Projects Using VUSN Statistical Consultation: Sandy McGill, RN, MSN, MBA - Up for Meal s; consulted Dr. Dietrich on number of subjects needed for replication ( NK 7.0 EO) JoAnn Jones, RN, MSN - Use of the Smith and Nephew silver dressing to reduce wound infections following cesarean section (C-sectio n); Dr. Dietrich converted data from Excel to SPSS and completed analysis Debbie King, RN - Reducing IV Placement Pain; Dr. Dietrich consulted with Director of Nursing Research on analysis ( NK 4 EO) Bette Moore, RN, PhD - The effects of medica l play on young children's pain and distress during burn wound care; Dr. Dietrich wrote the statistical plan for the VCTR grant application and will conduct the analysis when we have completed the study. Content-specific consultation As a Research 1 academic Medical Center, we have faculty in many departments and disciplines who are content experts. One particul arly rich source of expertise is the Owen Graduate School of Management. In addition, investigators focusing on children have the opportunity to consult with experts on child development at Peabody College and the Kennedy Center for Human Development. The Process of Conducting a Nursing Research Study The following brief description of research pr ojects provides examples of research that is currently under way at Vanderbilt. Georgette Smiley, RN2 and Theresa Holmes, RN2, who work in the Otolaryngology Clinic, examined the pain experienced after tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy (T & A) in adults and children. A structured telephone interview format was developed to identify New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Research (4) 18 the preparation patients' receive to manage their pain at home and their actual experiences. Twenty-three telephone interv iews have been conducted and data are currently being analyzed. These data will be used to revise pre- and post-operative patient education to manage pain after T & A. This project wa s developed during the EBNP Fellowship program, with me ntor Kyle Rybczyk, RN, FNP. The impetus for this study came from th e Case Manger's observations of wound infections following C-section. JoAnn Jones, RN, MSN is the case manager in obstetrics and gynecology. With the assistance of the infection control department, she noted that obese women (Body Mass Index > 30) seemed to have more wound infections than non- obese women. She was also becoming familia r with a new type of wound dressing, the Smith and Nephew silver dressing, through consultation with WOCN Sheree Lee RN, BSN. Use of this type of dressing seemed to reduce the number of wound infections in chronic wound management studies. In collabo ration with Elizabeth Fritz Banks, RN, MSN and the obstetricians, the team decided to change standard care so that women with BMI > 30 would routinely receive a S&N silver dressing following C-section. After consultation with the Director of Nursin g Research, the 2 investigators developed a spreadsheet with the relevant variables and co llected data from the patient record. The outcome of interest was presence of a wo und infection within 30 days post op (CDC criteria). Once the data were collected, the Excel spreadsheets were sent to the VUSN statistician (Mary Dietrich, PhD) for file conversion and analysis. Preliminary data analysis indicates no significant differe nce in wound infection rates between women with and without the S & N silver dressing. Data are currently being analyzed. Results will be presented at a national conference (AWHON) in the fall of 2010. [ NK4-Exhibit E- 1-AWHONN Abstract ] Appropriate age-specific preparation for pa inful and anxiety-provoking procedures has short- as well as long-term benefits for ch ildren and their parents. This IRB-approved study will test the effects of medical play pr ovided by a Child Life Specialist versus standard preparation by a clinic nurse in children aged 3 - 7 receiving their 1 st burn wound care in the outpatient clinic. Outcomes include child self-reported pain, ob served pain behaviors, and parent stated anxiety and satisfaction with burn wound care. A sample of 50 dyads (parent and child) will be enrolled. This project is a collaborative effort between the PI (Bette Moore, RN, PhD, a faculty member from VUSN), co-PI (Katherine Bennett, MEd, CCLS, Child Life Specialist, and co- investigators Angela Baker, RN (burn clinic nurse) and Nancy Wells (Director of Nursing Research). Support for a research nurse from th e Research Support Serv ices Clinical Trials New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Research (4) 19 Center was obtained in July 2010. This study will begin enrollment in Sept. 2010 and should accrue the sample population within a year's time. [ NK4-Exhibit F-1-Protocol for Medical Play ] The literature describes patients' perception th at the health care team fails to discuss sexual functioning before or after organ tran splantation. To more fully understand this phenomenon, a national survey was constructe d by Jerita tician from the Transplant Center, Irene Feurer, PhD, is also working on this project. Survey items were piloted and converted to electronic form and include: 1) basic demographic data; 2) transplant subspecialty and practice volume; 3) practices related to conversations with patients about sexual functi oning; and 4) whether health-related quality of life survey data are routinely collected. An initia l announcement card was sent to all transplant nurse coordinators in the UNOS mailing list. Pre liminary results were reported at the national UNOS conference. [ NK4-Exhibit G-1-UNOS Abstract ] This study is currently in the data collection phase. A small grant ($2,000.00) was obtained through the VICTR funding mechanism to offset the cost of printing a nd mailing the introductory cards.

Reducing IV Placement Pain Purpose/Background The Clinical Research Center (CRC) provid es nursing care to patients and healthy volunteers who participate in research. Intrav enous (IV) access is typically required of any participant who receives outpatient or inpatient care on the CRC. This means at least one and sometime more, peripheral IVs must be inserted. Minimizing pain associated with IV insertion is a goal of the direct care nurses in the CRC. The literature suggests that IV insertion pain may be minimized by use of (1) a saline bleb adjacent to the IV insertion site, or (2) a local anesthetic spray. The purpose of this study was to comp are the effectiveness of a saline bleb versus Pain Ease spray in reading IV placement discomfort. Methods/Approach A randomized cross-over design was used to determine if one method of pain control was more effective than the other. This study was an add-on to one of 2 VICTR-CRC studies using healthy volunteers who required multiple CR C visits. Participants were randomized to receive the bleb or spray for their first IV plac ement. Upon their return to the CRC, the other method of pain reduction was used. Participan ts reported pain on a standard 0 - 10 Visual Analog Scale (VAS).Upon completion of the seco nd IV placement, participants completed a brief questionnaire to determine their preference. The in itial development of this project took place while Debbie King RN3 was an EBNP fellow. This study was approved by the IRB.

The mean age of the sample was 34.8 years (S.D = 8.98). 10 men and 10 wome n participated. Seventy-five percent (15/20) of the sample were Caucasian. Each particip ant had the IV placed using a saline bleb and Pain Ease spray. The majority of participants had a #20 catheter (65%; 13/20) in the antecubital space (75%;15/20) had peripheral IV. The same nurse (the PI) pe rformed all 40 IV insertions. The grouping variable was order of interv ention, which was randomly assigned. Groups were evenly matched on gender, age, catheter gauge and placement of IV. Data were not normally distributed (see below) and therefore were transformed into ranks for data analysis. See Graphs below. New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Research (4 EO) 22 Graphs NK 4 EO - 1 & 2: Distributi on of pain scores by intervention There was no main effect for order or in teraction between order and intervention. There was a significant main effect for intervention ( p = .02). Participants reported less pain when receiving the saline bleb than the Pain Ease spray (Table NK 4 EO - 1). Sixty-five percent (13/20) preferred the saline bleb; 35% preferred the Pain Ease spray.

This kind of creation of practical knowledge about care is a crucial part of our mission. Congratulations! David\" [NK4EO-Exhibit A-1-IV Place Protocol, NK4 EO-Exhibit A-2-IV Place to Basics: A Focus on Post-operative Ambulation Purpose/Background Ambulation after surgery is a basic requirement to support recovery and return to daily life. As nursing becomes more technologically driven, these basic nursing care practices have become lost. The case managers on two of our general surgical units, in collaboration with a nurse in systems support, developed this IRB a pproved project to increase post-operative ambulation for their colorectal and urology surgery patients. Methods/Approach Several strategies were implemented to re-f ocus nurses on the importance and need of early and frequent ambulation during the post-operative period. These included: New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Research (4 EO) 24 Review and revision of the medical order sets for the patient populations to make sure ambulation orders were present, clear and specific Measure and post distances for accu rate documentation of ambulation Agreement upon 1 section of the EMR where ambulation and the distance walked is charted Staff education at unit board and in 1-1 co mmunication on the changes in ambulation documentation Create a dashboard for ambulation on the clinical work station screensaver Collaborated with a Bioinformatics nurse to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention Documentation of ambulation, complications, le ngth of stay and cost were examined for all patients hospitalized on these 4 general su rgery units for 6 months before implementation (7/0/08 - 12/31/08). The interven tion was launched in Jan. 2009 . Post-intervention data were examined from 7/1/09 to 12/31/09.

Graph NK 4 EO - 3: Ambulation Do cumentation Pre- Post Intervention Patients had a higher acuity level (using UHC acuity scores) in the post-intervention period. Despite the increased acuity, complicat ion rates and rate of paralytic ileus were reduced in the post-intervention period (figure). Le ngth of stay and cost of hospitalization were similar from pre- to post-intervention. Most importantly, the nurses on these units felt empowered to provide good, basic nursing care, including ambulation. A cost analysis showed that each paralytic ileus cost the institution $5,780 per case. Given the reduction in ileus post- intervention, we estimate a cost savings (avoidance) of $829,430 annually.

This project will be presented at the fall 2010 UHC Quality conference in San Diego. It has been submitted for peer review to AJN. [ NK4EO-Exhibit B-1-UHC Abstract ] Pain during Arterial Sheath Pulls Fo llowing Invasive Cardiac Procedures Purpose/Background Pain control during the removal of femoral sheaths is a primary nursing concern. There are a number of interventions that may be used to reduce pain during sheath pulls following invasive cardiac procedures. A short-acting local anesthetic injection, such as lidocaine, is one method that may reduce the pain during the sh eath pull. However, the lidocaine injection procedure itself may cause pain. A literature review revealed no \"best practice\" for pain control during femoral sheath pulls. Since our physicians varied on the use of lidocaine to control pain, we were able to evaluate the effectiveness of lid ocaine injection around the arterial sheath site to control pain during sheath pulls following in vasive cardiac procedures in adult patients. Methods/Approach An IRB approved nonrandom 2- group design was used to determine the effectiveness of lidocaine injection to control pain. Pati ents were allocated to group based upon the physician's prescription. Patients reported thei r pain on a 1-10 point numeric rating scale (NRS) before the sheath pull, 5 minutes after the pull wa s started, and at the end of the procedure. Type of analgesic was recorded as well as an y complications. This project was conducted while the Co-PIs were enrolled in the Evidence-based Nursing Practice Fellowship.

Forty-two percent (42%) of the patien ts received opioids alone to control 47% alone, and 11% rece ived both opioids and lidocaine. Complications during the sheath pull occurred equally in th e opioid and lidocaine groups. Patients who received lidocaine with or without opioids report ed greater pain at all 3 data collection points. The pattern differed, with lidocaine injection increasing pain prior to the procedure but decreasing it at 5 minutes; whereas patients rece iving opioids had an increase in pain from pre= to 5 minutes into the sheath pull (Figure 4.4). Graph NK 4 EO - 4: Pain during and after sheath pull with & without lidocaine Lidocaine Yes No Pre 5 min Post2.02.53.03.54.0Pain Intensity Pain Related to Sheath Removal The results of this project were shared with the interventional cardiologists and nursing staff in the department. This has led to a change in practice. Where lidocaine was used by some cardiologists during sheath pulls, the results of this study indicated it was not necessary to relieve pain during this procedure. The interdisci plinary team met and agreed to limit the use of lidocaine for simple sheath pulls following cardia c catheterization. This reduction in the use of lidocaine represents a $100.00 co st savings per procedure. [ NK4EO-Exhibit C-1-Sheath Pull Poster-PPT ] New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Research (4 EO) 28 Nursing Ethics Survey Purpose/Background Nurses at Vanderbilt frequently face et hical dilemmas. There are numerous resources available to all health care providers when deal ing with patient and family issues. The Ethics Department keeps some statistics, however, th e history is not good and they developed a new system for tracking. A brief review of the past us e of the ethics consultation services suggested lower use by nursing staff, even though they are intimately involved with patients and their families. Nursing and the Ethics Department were inte rested in learning which kind of situations are ethically troubling for the nursing staff and what it is about those situations that is viewed differently by nurses as oppose d to the other members of the healthcare team. The bottom line was what is needed to better support the nur sing staff through the consult service and with education. The purpose of this IRB approved study was to examine direct care nurses perceptions of the types of ethical dilemmas they face, awareness and use of ethics services at Vanderbilt and other resources needed. Methods/Approach After an initial literature search examin ing other programs, potential questions and education programs; it was determined that the first step was a survey to determine the issues and needs. A 15 item survey was developed in cons ultation with ethicists from the Biomedical Ethics Department. This survey was develope d after extensive literature determined there were no other such surveys to choose from. It ems addressed ethical issues encountered in practice, need for education about ethical issues, awareness of ethics services available and use of these services. Demographic information wa s also included. The survey was distributed through web-based on-line to nurses who have direct contact with patients (e.g., case managers, direct care nurses, APNs) via e-mail dist ribution lists. Data collection opened on July 6, 2009 and closed July 31.

We place a high priority on evidence-based nursing practice. Resources to assist the nurse in validating and revising practice can be found through the Eskind Biomedical library staff, our Evidence-based Medicine (EBM) program, and our Evidence-based Practice Center. In 2009, the Nursing Research Committee adopted the Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-based Practice (JHNEBP) model. Of part icular relevance to direct care nurses, this model outlines an 18-step process to translate evidence into practice . This model is used with permission from the Johns Hopkins Department of Nursing. The Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice Process PET (Practice Question-Evidence-Translation PRACTICE QUESTION STEP 1: Identify an EBP question STEP 2: Define scope of practice question STEP 3: Assign responsibility for leadership STEP 4: Recruit multidisciplinary team STEP 5: Schedule team conference EVIDENCE STEP 6: Conduct internal and external search for evidence STEP 7: Critique all types of evidence STEP 8: Summarize evidence STEP 9: Rate strength of evidence New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (6) 37 STEP 10: Develop recommendations for change in processes or systems of care based on the strength of evidence TRANSLATION STEP 11: Determine appropriateness and feasibility of translating recommendations into the specific practice setting STEP 12: Create action plan STEP 13: Implement change STEP 14: Evaluate outcomes STEP 15: Report results of prelimin ary evaluation to decision makers STEP 16: Secure support from decision makers to implement recommended change internally STEP 17: Identify next steps STEP 18: Communicate findings \u00a9 The Johns Hopkins Hospital/ The Johns Hopkins University All Vanderbilt staffs have easy access to th e PET model on the EBP and Nursing Research web site ( NK 4.0 for more detail). The web site offers many tools to assist nurses in translating evidence into practice. The first 2 phases of the PET model, Practice Question and Evidence, address the structure and processes related to evaluating practice based upon evidence. Practice Question The first step is to pose an EBP questio n. The third tab on the web site is \" Got a Question ?\" This tab is a PICO fo rm, which requests information about population or problem, intervention, comparison and outcome to guide a literature search. If the nurse is not familiar with the PICO format, there is a short (10 min) education video on how to write a PICO question in the Toolkit tab on the web site. In developing a practice question, the nurse also needs to begin building a team for the project. Our shared governance structure provid es an excellent environment for team building. Through participation in unit/clinic board, nur ses and other members of the interdisciplinary team have an opportunity to observe group facilitation, consensus building, and setting accountability for actions. Once the topic area has been defined, the team moves into the Evidence phase. New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (6) 38 Evidence The PICO form on the web site goes to one of our Evidence-based Medicine (EBM) specialists, who is a nurse. The EBM specialist reviews the question and determines if she/he will answer it or send it on to the EBL librari an. This decision is based primarily on the complexity of the question; EBL librarians are more adept at searching complex topics. Within 2 weeks, the nurse will receive a summary of the literature addressing the topic queried (see NK 4.0 Exhibit 6 for questions asked and answered). We also have a number of resources that support nurses in searching for evidence. Mosby's, which is available from any clinical work station, is our resource for nursing practice and procedures. This on-line textbook provides evidence-based recommendation for practice, and the content is frequently updated to ensure current evidence is used. Vanderbilt also subscribes to ZYNX, a proprietary product that prov ides an evidence-based plan of care. ZYNX is of particular interest because there are links di rectly to the evidence, allowing the nurse to review the research upon which the practice is built. The clinical work stations have icons fo r Up-to-Date and MD Consult, which provide evidence-based recommendations for patient care. A nurse can also link directly into the EBL from the clinical work station and search in Medline, CINAHL, and a variety of synthesis databases (e.g., Cochrane). The 5th tab on the EBP & Nursing Research web site is \"Search Tips & Tools\", which provides links to the various re sources as well as information sheets on how to use the sites. To make recommendations for practice, the evidence must be summarized and synthesized. While we encourage staff to se arch for synthesized evidence, there may be instances where the nurse will need to critically evaluate research and synthesize the findings from multiple studies. To assist in the critical evaluation of research, we have critique forms for qualitative and quantitative research available on the web site. A summary table, developed by JHNEBP, is also available on-line. [ NK6-Exhibit A-1-Evidence Rating Scale, NK6-Exhibit A-2- JHNEBP Research Evidence Appraisal Tool, NK6-Exhibit A-3-Overall Evidence Summation ] Thus, Vanderbilt has a number of tools available to any nurse to pose a practi ce question and obtain evidence about that practice. Structures Supporting Evaluation of Practice based upon Evidence New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (6) 39 The structure that supports evaluation of pr actice based on evidence includes practice committees and sources of clinical outcome data , such as SciHealth and the Electronic Data Warehouse (EDW). The Clinical Practice Committee is responsible for review, revision and approval of clinical policies. The committee is chaired by Paige Conatser, RN, Director, Accreditation and Standards and composed of 70 members across the Medical Center. Committee membership includes frontline nursing staff and nursing leaders. Clinical Practice Committee membership is provided in OO 15. The Children's Hospital Clinical Polic y and Practice committee (see below) has representatives on the VUMC Clinical Practice committee. The committee is open to all staff that care for patients. The Clinical Practice Committee meets monthly for 90 minutes. New policies may be submitted by any nurse in the Medical Center using a standard format [NK6- Exhibit B-1-Clinical Policy Template], which incl udes a requirement for evidence to support the new practice. Existing policies are reviewed on a regular basis that is appropriate to the intent of the policy. [ NK6-Exhibit B-2-CL 10-01, Procedures, Users Guide ] Each revision requires a literature search or examination of best practi ces to support the prac tice. Most clinically- focused policies are reviewed every 3 years, which is consistent with industry practice. Examples of recent policies reviewed and revised based upon new eviden ce include: A new lab specimen labeling policy was draf ted based on evidence from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments http://www.cms.hhs.gov/clia/ , College of American Pathologist http://www.cap.org . This new process of specimen labeling will reduce the variability in labeling that results in specimen rejection. CL 30-08.22. The policy on Foley catheters was revised base d on evidence-based national guidelines http://www.shea-online.org/about/compendium.cfm , http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/gl_catheter_assoc.html# , http://app32.webinservice.c om/MosbySkills/skillsMain.asp projects at Vanderbilt ( see NK 7.0 EO for project description ). The new policy identifies clear criteria for Foley catheter removal. (CL 30-15.05). The Clinical Policy and Practice Committee is a chartered committee that reviews all clinical policies, procedures and practices wi thin Children's Hospital. This committee meets monthly and is comprised of members of th e multidisciplinary team, including nursing representatives from all ar eas of clinical practice. Children's Clinical Policy & Practice Committee membership is provided in OO 15. New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (6) 40 Each policy and procedure is reviewed by this committee and content and processes compared with current research and evidence. Wh en scientific evidence does not exist, this committee benchmarks with other Children's Ho spitals across the country through active involvement in various national committees. Tw o examples or organizations with whom we benchmark include the National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Organizations (NACHRI) and Children's Hospital Corporation of America (CHCA). All policies and procedures are reviewed every 3 years and more frequently if evidence is released that warrants a change in practice. The following example describes how a change in national guidelines resulted in local and the hospital-wide practice change. A policy was developed on family presence during procedures and resuscitation in the Children's Hospital based upon the FOCUS valu es and position statements by several national organizations (Emergency Nurses Asso ciation, American Association of Critical Care Nurses and the American Heart Associ ation). The policy, CL 39 19.16, was approved by the Clinical Policy and Practi ce Committee in April 2010 and the Medical Center Medical Group in August 2010 and is currently being implemented in Children's Hospital. [ NK6-Exhibit C-1-CL 30-19.16 Policy fo r Family Presence During an Inv Proc ] The Center for Clinical Improvement (CCI) supports SciHealth, a portal through which nursing-sensitive quality indicators data (e.g., pr essure ulcers) are housed. This portal also contains administrative data (e.g., hours per pa tient day), thus allowing staff to examine the association between 2 variables. CCI also provid es consultation on potential quality and safety issues as a first step in defining current practi ce (see Quality criteria for further detail). Sonya Moore, RN, MSN, Quality Consultant, has worked with VUH committees and individual units to improve performance on pressure ulcers and pati ent falls. She provides data from ScHealth as well as specific prevalence study information to identify potential processes that may be modified to improve quality (see Quality write up for more detail). A quality consultant also worked closely with the Pain Task Force (see ex ample below) to identify percent of patients with a complete assessment-intervention-re-a ssessment cycles documented in the EMR. At an institutional level, the Nursing Quality Committee and MUSIC (pharmacy-nursing- medicine) provide oversight for nursing qualit y indicators and medication safety. The ambulation study ( see NK 4.0), which demonstrated positive outcomes related to post- operative complications, was presented at th e Nursing Quality Committee in March 2010. A follow-up discussion in June 2010 resulted in initia ting this practice change in the surgical units in VUH and VHVI Operative Ambulation in the RW Impact ] New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (6) 41 The MUSIC committee created a sub-committee to assist the Pain Task Force (see example 2 below) in revising the epidural policy based upon current research related to duration of monitoring. Access to Data Vanderbilt is a data-rich environment. Da ta are available to monitor outcomes of nursing care delivery, such as length of stay, cost of care, patient satisfaction and infection rates. These data sources are highlighted below. The Electronic Data Warehouse (EDW) is a repository for many of the electronic databases. For example, a bioinformatics expe rt used the EDW to evaluate the impact of frequent ambulation on the de velopment of complications ( see NK 4). In addition, the bioinformatics specialist is working with the De pt. of Finance to determine the cost saving associated with ambulation resulting in reduced ileus. Patient satisfaction data are routinely collected by PR C through telephone interviews. Items common to the inpatient and outpatient surveys include satisfaction with teamwork among doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals and overall quality of care. ( for more information provided in EP 35 & 35 EO) PRC data are discussed in unit/clinic boards to celebrate excellent performance and identify area s for improvement. When nursing issues arise in patient satisfaction, the board members will id entify possible solutions. These solutions are sought from best practices at high-performing institutions, research literature, and evidence- based practice guidelines. The following ex ample shows how PRC data stimulated further investigation in the VNI clinic in Franklin. Key drivers for patient satisfaction in the ambulatory setting include overall quality of care and teamwork. Reviewing annual data fr om 2006 - 2009, it was evident that there was room for improvement. [NK6-Exhibit E- 1-VHI Franklin PRC Report] In January 2009 the manager from the Franklin Clinics, Ke rrie Lindberg RN, MSN engaged an internal consultant from the Center for Organizati onal Learning, Cindy Wedel, to help with improving the service in this off-site clinic. After reviewing the PRC data and discussing issues with the staff and medical faculty, Cindy made several recommendations to improve the clinic's service to patients. While most of the recommendations centered on the environment, one addressed the time nurses spent with patients. Strategies to increase the time nurses ha d to spend with patients were discussed during staff and clinic board meetings. New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (6) 42 Over the next 12 months, changes were made in number and scheduling of administrative and clinical staff as well as the addition of a nurse practitioner for the clinic. During rounding, the charge nurse of the clinic, Debbie Abbott, RN, heard from many staff that they felt the time spent with patients had increased after th e changes had been implemented. PRC data from 209 and 2010 reflect the improvements that have been made. The Infectious Disease department monitors events such as blood stream infections (BSI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) a nd urinary tract infections (UTI). Infection Control nurses work with the nursing leadership and staff to monitor infection rates. On many units, a review of infection rate data is a standing agenda item for the unit board meeting. [NK6-Exhibit F-1-SICU Aug UB Agenda ] Vanderbilt performance is compared to national benchmarks, such as NDNQI and CDC. When rate s exceed the benchmark, particularly over several months, a search for a better way to manage central lines, catheters, or ventilators is conducted. Typically, staffs look to the literatur e, revisions to practice guidelines and best practices for improvement ideas. The following examples demonstrate the processes used to improve patient outcomes Reducing Blood Stream Infections in the PCCU Blood stream infection (BSI) is a quality, safety and financial issue. The staff nurses in the PCCU developed an interdisciplinary Staff Infect ion Committee, with representatives from PCCU direct care nurses, leadership, Infection Cont rol, Performance Improvement and medicine. In their monthly committee meetings, BSI rates were compared against a benchmark and evidence was reviewed to identify effective interv entions to reduce BSI. Specific strategies were implemented after consensus was reached by the committee. These initiatives included: The 5 questions - a discussion about central lines in daily rounds CVL/Arterial line placement - created a CVL cart with a line bundle to improve sterile conditions during placement The dressing team - dedicated nurses responsible for CL dressing changes Scrub the hub - a campaign to re-educate nurse on how to clean the port before accessing it ( see NK 7.0 for detail about this program) The dressing bundle - a package that has all of the supplies needed to change a CL dressing New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (6) 43 See Graph below. Graph NK 6 - 1: Catheter-associat ed Blood Steam Infections in PCCU. These data are reported regularly to staff during the PCCU Infection committee meeting, physician teams, and recently to the Child ren's Hospital Performance Management and Improvement (PM&I) committee. This example demonstrates how a staff nurse -led initiative monitors Infection Control data to evaluate the quality of patient care in the PCCU. It also illustrates how our shared decision making philosophy and shared governan ce structure is critical to evaluating and improving the quality and safety of patient care. [ NK6-Exhibit G-1-PCCU Infection Comm Minutes, NK6-Exhibit G-2-PCCU Ed Flyer CBL Cart ] Any work done to improve outcomes require s an examination of the processes used in the delivery of care compared to evidence based practice. Many process measures are captured in nursing documentation through our electronic medical record (EMR). An example New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (6) 44 of process measurement in the EMR is pain assessment and re-assessment following an intervention. This example highlights the use of the EMR in gathering data on the process of care. Pain Task Force Acute pain management has a well-estab lished evidence-based practice guideline (Acute Pain Guideline, AHCPR, 1992) that has been incorporated into the Joint Commission's criteria for accreditation. A Pain Task Fo rce was formed in April 2009 to focus on pain management in the Adult and Children's Hospitals. The scope of the work of the task force was Policy congruence, both centralized and unit-based Standardized metrics used to assess and report compliance both internally and externally Development of strategies to driv e and sustain clinical improvement Internal and external data sources were used to determine current practice and compare to national benchmarks. Pain cycle data reported to NDNQI on pediatric patients (AIR cycles) Patient satisfaction with pain control externally reported to HCAHPS Re-assessment within 2 hours after pain intervention collected by CCI NDNQI and HCAHPS provide be nchmarks for performance.

The task force revised and consolidated the pain management policy [ NK6-Exhibit H-1- CL 30-02.14 Policy for Pain Management Guidelines ] and disseminated these changes to staff. An on-line survey of nurses from Adult and Children's inpatient clinical areas identified barriers to pain documentation. The results of this survey led to changes in the location and the format of pain documentation in the EMR. Percent compliance with pain re-assessment within 2 hours was adopted as a standard metric, and a tool to assist charge nurses in giving real-time feedback to nurses on their re- assessment performance was revised and implemente d in June 2010. This \"Fix it Now\" report shows the patients receiving pharmacologic pain interventions and the nurse's compliance with re-assessment documentation. This report is us ed by managers and charge nurses to provide feedback to the direct care nurse on his/her performance. Table NK 6 - 2: Revised Fix it Now Report New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (6) 47 The Pain Task Force used multiple sour ces of data to examine current pain documentation practice across the inpatient c linical areas. In addition to reviewing performance against a criterion (re-assessment within 2 hours), the task force reviewed pain management chapters in Mosby's and Patent Safety and Quality; An Evidence-based Handbook for Nurses (Hughes, 2008) http://www.ahrq.gov/qual/nurseshdbk/ . The Pain Task Force also consulted with MUSIC to review current literature and recommendations before revising the policy related to epidural analgesia. [ NK6-Exhibit I-1-CL 30-06.16 Policy for The strategies adopted to improve docume ntation relied heavily on modification of information technology to better fit th e staff and charge nurses work flow. [ NK6-Exhibit I-2-Pain Management Task Force Update ] Using the Clinical Unit Boards Our shared governance structure provides an excellent vehicle for monitoring current practice, benchmarking against local and nati onal performance, and identifying possible strategies to improve outcomes. For example, Infection Control data are routinely reviewed and discussed at critical care unit boards. Many unit/clinic boards have EBP and/or quality sub- committees to focus on evaluating and improving practice in the clin ical area. This evaluation of current practice has led to projects by the EBNP fellows on UTI rates in the Trauma Center ( see NK 8.0 EO ) and BSI in PCCU (described above). Th e following example de monstrates how the New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (6) 48 unit board In the Psychiatric Hospital was used to implement a change in admission documentation. Admission to the Adolescent Unit of the Vanderbilt Psychiatric Hospital Admitting a patient to the psychiatric hospital can be stressful for the patient, family, and nurse. Admission includes searching the patient and personal effects for physical assessment and removal of contrabands, completi ng and documenting an admission history, and orienting the patient and family to unit routines. Evidence suggests that the admission process is an important part of the hospitalization as it lays the foundation for care. Nursing sta ff admission performance on the Adolescent Unit was assessed by a manual chart review conducte d by a direct care nurse. A manual chart review was necessary because the Psychiatric Ho spital had not yet implemented the EMR. Forty random patient records were reviewed and revealed incomplete documentation in seven out of ten selected criteria. Based upon these results, an Admission Checklist was developed for staff nurses to use during hospital admissions. The data and the newly developed checklist were shared with the Adolescent Unit staff at a unit board meeting. A PowerPoint presentati on on the admission checklist was also made available electronically to nursing staff. [NK6-Exhibit J-1-Adolescent Unit Admission Checklist] Following the implementation of the checklis t, forty more random patient records were reviewed to detect change in performance base d on the criteria. Increased awareness and use of the Admission Checklist improved admission criteria compliance and documentation in seven of ten areas measured. The other three areas remained unchanged after implementation of the checklist. Table NK 6 - 3: Completion of Psychiatric Ad mission Criteria Before and After Admission Checklist Implementation. Admission Criterion % Pre (N = 40) % Post (N = 40) Patient admission search with documentation 95 97.5 Handbook and orientation provided; patient worksheet completed 95 97.5 Patient identification armband provided; name label on door 90 95 Admission vital signs, height weight documented in medical record 90 97.5 Nursing admission history documented 100 100 Observation status initiated upon admission 95 95New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (6) 49 Name, viral information, summary of patient history and reason for admission documented on staff room census board 90 90 Physician's orders obtained and noted on admission 90 95 Elevate form documented, placed on front of patient chart 75 80 Medical record chart form stamped with patient ID 70 75 These findings were presented to the VPH administrative group. This resulted in a recommendation to implement and disseminate the Admission Checklist to all units in the Psychiatric Hospital. New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (7) 50 Evidence-Based Practice Source of Evidence 7 Describe and demonstrate the structure(s) an d processes used to translate new knowledge into nursing practice. The Practice Question-Evidence-Translation (P ET) model we adopted is used to guide all nurses in the process of translating new know ledge into practice. Resources to support translation into practice have b een described in NK 4 and NK 6. One method of exposing direct care nurses to new knowledge is though a jo urnal club. The first section describes the development and operation of se lected nursing journal clubs. The following section highlights the EBNP Fellowship program as a mechanism to educate staff nurses in the EBP process and support them in developing projects to transl ate new knowledge into their own practice. Since its inception in 1999, 76 nurses have completed the program. [ NK7-Exhibit A-1-List of EBMP Fellows 08-09, NK7-Exhibit A-2-List of EBMP Fellows 09-10 ] Searching for new knowledge Journal clubs bring a team together to begi n the translation process through a review of existing evidence and new knowledge. The NRC reviewed the literature on journal clubs to generate ideas on how to develop sustainable and successful journal clubs. Perioperative Services In 2010, a direct care nurse approached the NRC for help in starting a journal club in the peri-operative area. A small sub-committee of the NRC facilitated the development of a journal club by introducing 3 entry level discussion s about EBP to this group of nurses as a pilot test. Each session was embedded within the no rmal meeting time of a unit board. Contact hours were given for completion of these 3 education sessions. The perioperative services is now working to develop independent study modules that will be discussed at each unit board. The topi cs are selected by the nurses on unit board and the discussion led by 2 of these nurses. Contac t hours have been granted for independent study as well as the unit board discussion of the cont ent. This process was so successful it will be replicated across the organization star ting with the case manager council. Cancer Clinic Journal Club The Quality Consultant, who serves on the NRC and the Nurse Educator in the Cancer Clinic facilitated a Journal Club for oncology -specific topics. A planning committee, which includes 4-6 direct care nurses, selects the topi cs and supporting articles for discussion. The New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (7) 51 first journal club meeting was held in July 2009. Attendance has ranged from 3- 20 direct care nurses. Usually 6-8 direct care nur ses attend. Topics have included: Novel oral chemotherapy regimens in clinical trials Adherence to oral chemothe rapy and patient safety Complementary and alternative therapies Healthcare literacy Hand - foot syndrome /palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia As a result of the second meeting, an interdisciplinary team was established with participants of the Cancer Clinic Unit Board to evaluate practices and id entify plans to improve care related to patient adherence to nove l oral chemotherapy regimens. The nurses, pharmacists and prescribing physicians for the most common agents will engage in plans to develop enhanced team communi cation, teaching methods and follow up with regard to patient adherence. Initial process and planni ng included agreement on the primary patient education drug information library/resource to be used by the team. This example highlights how a nursing journal club identified a gap in practice through a literature review and developed an interdisciplinary te am to address the problem. Translation The final 7 steps of PET encompass im plementing practice change based upon recommendations from the literature ( see NK 6 for PET phases). This phase involves determining organizational intere st and feasibility, developing an action plan, working the plan, and evaluating the outcomes. Dissemination of findings completes the process. The Nursing Research office assists in finding resources for implementation and evaluation of outcomes ( see NK 6 for evaluation resources). The most robust support for implementation, however, is available through th e EBNP Fellowship program. Nurses have the opportunity to disseminate the findings from their studies at internal poster sessions, held in May and Oct (se NK 4 Exhibit A-5 for poster session presentation list). These sessions are designed to provide begi nners experience in writing abstracts and presenting posters, with an eye toward submission to an external conference. As a result, 2 national posters and 1 manuscript were comple ted on posters presented at Oktoberfest in 2009 ( Refer to Table NK 4 - 1: Nurse Posters/Presentations External ). New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (7) 52 The Nursing Research office also holds a series of writing for publication workshops annually. [ NK7-Exhibit B-1-Writing for Publication Workshops ] Any staff member can attend this series of 4, 2-hour workshops spaced over an 8 month period. If the participant follows the plan and completes the homework assigned be tween sessions, he/she will have a manuscript ready for submission by the end of the 4th workshop. [ NK7-Exhibit B-2-Nurse Publications ] EBNP fellowship program The EBNP fellowship program provides direct care nurses with an opportunity to gain knowledge and skills needed to translate evidence into practice (see NK 4.0 for a description of the program). Nurses in the program follow the PET pr ocess as they develop a project designed to improve patient care. Over the year- long program, the fellows learn to: Use synthesized evidence databases (e.g., ZYNX) Perform literature searches in da tabases available through the EBL Critically evaluate research Make recommendations for practice change based upon the evidence Form a team to plan and implement the practice change Identify potential indicators to evaluate processes and outcomes Develop an action plan Design an on-line survey Create and populate a spreadsheet Write an abstract Prepare and present a poster The fellows are encouraged to work in gro ups to develop and implement their projects. Some work with other fellows who may or may not practice in their clinical area. Other fellows work with colleagues in their patient care area or through their unit/clinic boards. Based upon the recommendation from the Nursing Executive Board and the NRC, fellows are encouraged to select a project in one of nursi ng's priority areas, including: Pressure ulcer prevention Fall prevention Prevention of infection New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (7) 53 Pain management The structure of the EBNP fellowship program includes the Director of Nursing Research, who oversees the content and presentation of the program and 8 nurses who serve as mentors to the fellows. The mentors are assigned a sma ll group of fellows (3 - 6/group), and work in pairs to assist the fellows in working through the PET process. Mentor s are selected from a variety of areas, and receive coaching from the director during monthly planning meetings. Using this type of mentor structure, we are able to develop nurses in key positions who have an in-depth knowledge and understanding of EBP. The mentors for the 2009-10 EBNP program are: Debbie Arnow, RN, MSN, Director of Nursing Education & Professional Development Children's Hospital Cindy Brown, RN, MSN, MCE OR Director, Perioperative Services Gary Howard, RN, MBA, Assistant Administrator, Emergency Services Kathleen Kelley, RN, MSN, NP, Nurse Educator, Operative Services Brent Lemonds, RN, MBA, Administrative Director, Emergency Services Anne Miller, RN, PhD, Faculty member, VUSN Kyle Rybczyk, RN, FNP, Coor dinator, HIV Vaccine Program Gloria Wacks, RN, DNS, Nurse Educator, Outpatient Surgery Each workshop provides 5.0 contact hours; a total of 60.0 for the 12 workshops. We evaluate each workshop in terms of content, delivery, and objectives. The ratings for content and objectives are consistently high, indicating the workshops are meeting the stated objectives. [ NK7-Exhibit C-1-Workshop Evaluation ] Toward the end of the year-long program, we also do an informal evaluation and get suggestions for improvements for the next cohort. A formal ev aluation of each cohort is conducted approximately 6 months af ter completing the program. This formal evaluation has a set of structured questions to determine the fe llow's EBNP activity since leaving the program and their engagement in professional developmen t activities. Table 7.1 present's results from the 2007-08 and 2008-09 EBNP cohorts. See Table below. New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (7) 54 Table NK 7 - 1: Evaluation of EBNP Fellowship Program Evaluation Variable 2007-08 N = 9 2008-09 N = 18 Retention in program 50% (11/22) 71% (26/35) Conducted 3 or more literature searches in past 6 months (%) 88 88 Used EBL/Pubmed in past 6 months (%) 100 94 Discussed research findings with colleagues (%) 89 94 Changed position or unit since beginning the fellowship (%) 33 39 Took a course for credit or entered a program (%) 11 39 Applied for advancement in VPNPP (%) 44 28 Member of a medical center or nursing committee (%) 33 44 Presented a poster at a national meeting (%) 0 5.5 In addition to learning the steps in the translation process, one of the goals of the program is to enhance the fellow's profession al development - during the program and upon completion. These data suggest that the fellows do continue their professional development activities after completing the program. Perhaps the most powerful comment on the benefits of the EBNP program comes from 3 of the fellows, \" in their own words \". \"Your class opened my eyes and mind to the va lue of EBP. My view on the Nursing profession has broadened my practice, and I'm ex cited about future of nursing. Thanks for sharing your knowledge and empo wering me to seek answers .\" \"Our research project kept us from changing ou r practice just because a physician stated it was the best way - our project and the literature that supported our project kept us on the right path as well as decreased the costs to the lab and the patient if we would have pursued these endeavors as well as we would have possi bly induced unnecessary pain to our patients .\" \"The EBNP program has helped me to try so me things I would never have otherwise tried. I made some mistakes, but learned a gr eat deal. I have always wanted to have tight New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (7) 55 control of whatever I do. I have learned that I hav e to invite others to help and listen to what they have to say. I could write a lot more, but I think the program is about more than research (or it was for me). It is about focusing on so mething you want to improve, listening to others, figuring out the best way to approach the sit uation, learning who is there for you, being tenacious! , building others up and supporting them, laughing at yourself, etc. After the program, I tried to form a committe e, but I really just wanted to be in control. Needless to say, the committee flopped. But, that is ok. I had gained confidence from EBNP and was able to reflect on why I had failed and I am not afraid to try again. I still have trouble completing projects, but I know that I can do this too. I just might need to ask for help .\" The Process of Translating New Knowledge into Practice Direct care nurses throughout the Medical Center seek new knowledge to improve their clinical practice. The following examples describe some of these activities. Kara Gordon, RN, MSN, Nurse Educator in MICU organized a video conference with a representative of Mosby's Nursing Consult . The goals of this video conference were to increase preceptor awareness of the online resources provided by Mosby's and improve navigational skills using the site. Twelve pr eceptors from MICU attended the conference on July 23, 2009. In a recent communi cation to Kara Gordon, Holdiness, the Mosby representative, reported how ma ny Vanderbilt nurses are using Mosby's Nursing Consult, \"The numbers (approximately 1500 per mo nth) actually look great. I was definitely impressed by how well the program is used.\" Usage of the companion SKILLS site track is still at only 400 -500 hits pe r month, but Holdiness commented that the number of Vanderbilt nurses accessing Mosby Nursing Skills is on the upswing and \"that is a good sign.\" The preceptors now use both Mosby resources during orientation of new nurses to the MICU, which serves two pur poses. First, it provides an opportunity for the new nurses to use these on-line reso urces with guidance from the preceptor. Second, it ensures that the nursing care provided using Mosby's Nursing Consult and Skills modules incorporates new knowledge translated into practice. This story was featured on the EBP & Nursing Research web site in our Spotlight feature. [ NK7-Exhibit D-1-Mosbys EBP Spotlight Story ] Edie Vaughn, RN2 is a member of ANA. As an ANA member, Edie receives the ANA publication six times per year. One of the jo urnals included an article on caring for patients with adrenalectomies. About the same time the journal article was published, 9 South had noticed an increase in the number of patients being admitted with Pheochromocytoma resulting in adrenalectomie s. The journal article contained detailed information regarding the surgical procedure and care of the patient postoperatively. New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (7) 56 The journal article included potential complications and assessment parameters associated with complications. Edie brought the article to work, shared the article with staff through discussions and posted the article for review by all staff. Edie's willingness to share information increased awareness for all staff regarding care for patients with Pheochromocytoma undergoing adrenalectomies. Tanya Boswell, RN, MSN, CCRN (Evidence-Ba sed Practice Team Nurse ) collaborated with 2 infection control nurses, Tracy Louise, RN and Jackie Smith, RN, BSN , to compare catheter-related blood steam infection (CR -BSI) rates in PCCU when chlorhexadine (CHG) was used instead of alcohol to \"scrub the hub.\" A literature review and discussion with several other pediatric intensive care units suggested that CHG may reduce CR-BSI rates better than alcohol wipes. Following e ducation on how to use CHG, the standard of care was changed in PCCU from a scrub with alcohol to a scrub with CHG. This trial of CHG did not show a substantial reduction in CR-BSI in the PCCU. A cost analysis indicated a substantial saving ($617,899 per yea r) using the alcohol wipes. In addition to the cost of supplies, the nurses found the time needed to use the CHG scrub, which required drying the area before accessing th e catheter, was greater than the traditional alcohol wipe method. Because of the lack of difference in CR-BSI between methods, the PCCU returned to the alcohol wipes to scrub the hub. [ NK7-Exhibit E-1-Scrub the Hub - PCCU ] This project was completed while Tanya was an EBNP fellow. Allison Acrey, RN, BSN joined an interdisciplin ary team in the pediatric orthopedic clinic to improve care of infants being frequently casted for club foot. The casting procedure can be painful. Allison worked with the Child Life Specialist to review the literature on patient responses to casting. The literature suggested the stress may diminish the parent and child's ability to cope with the casting procedure. Based upon this evidence, the clinic implemented use of stress-reduction measures during the procedure, such as dimming the lights, playing soft music, and using warm water to prepare the plaster of paris for the cast. To evaluate this change in practice, the team is focusing on (a) increasing the level of parent satisfaction in the care of the newborn's clubfeet casting, and (b) Increasing the level of staff satisfaction as they use these new practices in patient education, infant distraction and stress reduction. An interdisciplinary team, led by Teresa M ilan, RN, manager of the substance abuse unit (VITA) at Vanderbilt Psychiatric Hospital, reviewed the current literature on alcohol withdrawal assessment tools and withdrawal protocols. A more recent approach, outlined in the protocol [ NK7-Exhibit F-1-CIWA Protocol Summary, NK7-Exhibit F-2-CIWA Algorithim, NK7-Exhibit F-3-CIWA Assessment for Alcohol ], involves frequent assessment New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (7) 57 and symptom-triggered therapy. The team co mposed of direct care nurses, the Nurse Educator, and attending physicians, agreed upon an evidence-based protocol. Jon Coomer, RN3, Nurse Educator for VITA, educ ated the staff on use of the clinical assessment tool and use of the symptom-tr iggered therapy protocol. One of the symptoms of withdrawal that changed substantially based upon new knowledge was the prevention of seizures. When a patien t on the VITA unit had seizures, he/she was taken to the Vanderbilt ED. Since the pr otocol was implemented in June 2009, emergency room visits by patients on the VITA unit have decreased. Darlene McCormick, RN4 in MICU, led a pilot study to determine if disposable EKG lead wires would reduce central line- related blood stream infections (CL-BSI) compared to the standard of care, which was reusable EKG lead wires. The idea of using disposable lead wires came from the literature (http://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/arti cles/2009/05/how-to-evaluate-and-justify- the-implementation-of.aspx ) and best practice in another institution. Following discussion and consensus at unit board, Da rlene worked with Sheri Fay, RN, MSN, a Clinical Resource Nurse in the Purchasing De partment, to obtain disposable lead wires from 2 companies for evaluation. In Octo ber and November 2009 each type of lead wire was evaluated in the MICU. At the e nd of each trial, the nurses evaluated the disposable leads, using a standard new pro duct evaluation form tailored to reflect the product being tested. [ NK7-Exhibit G-1-MEOC New Product Request ] The CL-BSI rate n the MICU dropped from 12/1 000 device days in June to 6/1000 device days in November. The MICU's request for purchase of disposable lead wires was presented at the January 2010 MEOC committee. The Vanderb ilt vendor, Philips, is currently working with Vanderbilt on the disposable lead wire products. [ NK7-Exhibit G-2-MEOC Minutes ] Stephen Nelson, RN, MSN Case Manger for the Burn Unit and Gina Turner, RN Case Manger for Palliative Care led an initiative to identify \"triggers\" to refer burn patients to palliative care. The project team included an EBM Specialist, the Director of Nursing Research, a Data Analyst, and attending from the Burn Unit and Palliative Care service. While there are data available on existing systems, such as the APACHE, that may be useful in identifying patients with poor prognosis, none of the published research specially address issues of the burn patient. Through a request from VICTR, the project team consulted with Ted Speroff, PhD, and expert in quality improvement. VICTR resources also were obtained for analysis of existing burn unit data. [ NK7-Exhibit H-1- Request to Load New Data ] The analyst explored variables within the EMR to identify possible triggers for referral. Based upon her data analysis and an article on the SCORTEN severity of illness scale (Bastuji-Ga nn et al., 2000), pote ntial triggers were New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (7) 58 identified. Variables included number of como rbidities, % body surface area burned, age, gender, LOS, and # of ventilator days. Befo re developing an electronic data capture system, we are testing a pape r system to determine the appropriate triggers. Once the project is completed, staff in the Burn Un it will have a decision support system for referrals to palliative care.

Up for Meals: Does it Improve Food Consumption? Purpose/Background Malnutrition is a common phenomenon among elderly patients. Decreased food intake leads to loss of fat and muscle , which increases the rate of complications, and can increase the length of stay for a hospital admission ( DiMaria-Ghalill & Amella, 2005) . The mission of an ACE Unit is to provide evidence-based nursing care for elderly patients. Studies and history suggest that getting elderly patients out of bed during meals has a positive impact on the amount of food patients consume. Anecdotally, on 7RW, we saw that most of our patients are given their meal trays while they are still in bed. In an e ffort to measure the unit's mealtime practices, a study was conducted to determine ho w many of our patients are out of bed at mealtime and if getting patients out of bed (OOB) for meals affects food consumption. [ NK7EO-Exhibit A-1- Nutrition in Older Adults Article ] Methods/Approach A point prevalence observation technique was used to determine the unit's practice pre and post staff intervention. A delayed po st survey was conducted five weeks after the intervention to ensure the unit's reminder system for getting patients into a chair for meals was working. During each 5-day data collection period (pre-, immediately post-, delay post- intervention) observation of all patients were made a meal time. Observations included: Is the patient in a chair during the meal? If not in a chair, why? Percentage of meal consumed Patients were excluded from these observations if they met the followi ng exclusion criteria: Younger than 55 years of age New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (7 EO) 63 Orders for strict bed rest Orders for tube feeding Orders for NPO Active nausea and/or vomiting Following baseline data collection, 7RW sta ff was educated on the positive impact of getting patients out of bed for meals. [ NK7EO-Exhibit B-1-Up for Meals Staff Education ] To promote patient safety and prevent injury to staff, Smooth Moves (safe patient handling) training was provided to all staff. Also, a system was developed to remind staff to offer patients to get out of bed 30 minutes prio r to each meal. Prior to each meal, the Medical Receptionists sent out a universal message on staff pagers re minding them that meals trays were arriving soon.

Outcomes/Impact Only 14% of patients were in a chair for meals at baseline. There was a significant increase immediately post-intervention, with a decrease in performa nce at 5-weeks post- intervention. New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (7 EO) 64 Graph NK 7 EO - 1: Percent of Patients in a Chair for Meals; Pre - Post-intervention During the week-long observation periods, two primary barriers to getting out of bed for meals were identified: (a) general patient refusal and (b) patient refusal due to pain. . These 2 barriers accounted for 60% of the cases in which pa tients did not get out of bed for meals. Both of these barriers can be overcome with a few small improvements prior to each meal. To address the 'general refusal' issu e, we developed scripting to guide conversations with patients when offering to get them out of bed. With the sc ripting, we hope that patients will realize the importance of consuming their meal in a chair versus in the bed. [ NK7EO-Exhibit C-1-Up for Meals Scripting ] To address the second barrier, educat ion and reminders are in place to encourage nurses to assess the patient's pain le vel 30-60 minutes prior to asking them to get out of bed. This should mi nimize the number of times pati ents refuse due to pain. Data were collapsed across all 3 observations (baseline, immediate, and delayed); meal consumption was 20% higher in patients who were in a chair for the meal than those who were in bed. 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90% Baseline Immediate 1 Month Delayed 4 Month DelayPatients in a Chair during Meals Intervention: Staff New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (7 EO) 65 Graph NK 7 EO - 2: Percent of Me al Consumed in Bed and in a Chair In bed M = 49.96% (n=116) (add N to chart + percent in column great In a chair M = 69.79% (n=118) Evaluation of the program is ongoing. The team continues to do random observations to determine how many patients are sitting up for meals. A validation study of meal consumed was completed; agreement among 4 direct care nurses on percent of meal co consumed. Variability among the 40 observations (10 patien ts x 4 nurses) was 7%, indicating adequate inter-rater reliability for this measure. This study clearly demonstrated that patien ts consume more of their meal when up in a chair than when in bed. The practice has b een \"hard-wired\" on the ACE unit and warrants dissemination internally and externally. Pain Champs Program Purpose/Background Even when a successful program from another organization is replicated, PET is used to guide the change in practice. The Pediatric Pa in Champ Nurse program was piloted by 5 nurses (Pediatric Pain Specialist, nurse manager, and 3 direct care nurses) enrolled in the 2007-08 01020304050607080 In bed In a Chair% meal consumed % meal consumedNew Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (7 EO) 66 EBNP Fellowship program. Following a review of the Assessment-Intervention-Reassessment (AIR) cycles submitted to NDNQI and patient/family satisfaction data, it was apparent that there was room for improvement in the way pain was managed in pediatric patients. A review of the literature identified the Pa in Resource Nurse program, developed at the City of Hope, as a possible strategy to improve pain management in children. The project team implemented and evaluated the Pain Champs program on the 8th floor of Children's Hospital, a surgical, trauma and adolescent unit. A pre-post test design was used to detect improvement in: Nurses' knowledge about pediatric pain management Patient outcomes of completed AIR cycles documented in the EMR, and Patent/family satisfaction with pain management Methods/Approach Knowledge deficits were identified us ing the \"Pediatric Nurses' Knowledge and Attitudes Survey Regarding Pain \", developed by Ferrell and McCaffery (1999) and revised in 2005. [ NK7EO-Exhibit D-1-PEDS Knowledge Survey ] Eleven direct care nurses on the 8 th Floor volunteered to become pain champs. These nur ses attended a full day workshop and booster sessions every month for the first year. Contact hours were provided for the initial workshop; evaluation of the content, delivery and objectiv es was highly rated by the participants. To evaluate patient outcomes, we monitored the AIR cycle data submitted to NDNQI and the patient/family satisfaction data from PRC.

Patient outcomes improved. The AIR cycles showed a dec line in documentation in the quarter following implementation; however, this may be attribut ed to a change in personnel doing the chart abstraction rather than a decline in practice. Th e AIR cycles did improve in the first quarter of this year. In contrast, patient satisfaction with pain management by nursing staff did improve following implementation of the Pain Champs pr ogram. The excellent rank maintained a high level of performance until the first quarter of 2010.This dip in patient satisfaction with pain management has increased motivation to increa se the focus on the Pain Champs program.

Accord ing to the Center for Disease Control, CAUTIs account for more than 40% of the total nosocomial infections reported by acute-care hospitals and affect an estimate d 600,000 patients per year. Since 2005, the CAUTI rate in the Trauma Center at Vanderbilt has been above the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) benchmark (Table 7.1) New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (7 EO) 69 Table NK 7 EO- 3: UTI Rates in Trauma Center 2005 - 2007 Year Trauma Center NHSN Benchmark 2005 8.6 5.7 2006 7.2 5.7 2007 7.8 5.7 (Rate based on # of infections relative to # catheter days) In January of 2008, Vanderbilt Trauma Center initiated a new quality improvement project to decrease CAUTIs in our ICU patient population. Methods/Approach We were using the Bard silicone closed sterile system Foley catheters. We made no plans to change the type of catheter we used , but instead altered the amount of time we allowed a Foley catheter to remain in situ. As a team we developed a plan, based on the CDC guidelines, to remove Foley catheters within 5 days of admission if possible. We used the following steps to change this practice in the Trauma ICU: Gain nursing leadership and physician support for the \"5 day rule\" Educate staff on importance of early indw elling catheter removal through unit board discussion and 1-1 communication Collaborate with informatics specialist to develop a computer-based dashboard for use by charge nurses Train charge nurses to use dashboard during daily rounds to alert team to length of time indwelling catheter has been in place Table NK 7 EO - 4: Participants Personnel Title Role Teresa Hobt- Bingham, RN Charge nurse Project co-leader Sondra Blount, RN, RN4 Project co-leader New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Evidence-Based Practice (7 EO) 70 Outcomes/Impact After implementing these changes, the UTI rate at the end of 2008 was 4.5, which was below the national benchmark of 5.7. With this success, we were encouraged to continue and develop a protocol for removal of Foley cathet ers in our trauma patient population. The protocol, developed during the EBNP fellowship, followed these steps: Establish a purpose; to decrease UTIs, over all length of stay and increase patient comfort Identify patients who require an indwelling catheter for more than 5 days to develop exclusion criteria for catheter removal within 5 days. Present protocol to unit board for peer review and feedback Educate staff about new Foley catheter removal protocol The implementation of the protocol in 2009 resu lted in a 3.7 UTI rate, which is well below the national benchmark.

(Details in EP 32 EO) This nurse-led project was well underway and provided the team with valuable information about setting time limits on indwelling catheters. The policy on Foley cathet ers was revised based upo n new guidelines and the work of Teresa and Sondra (See NK 6 for policy). This project was completed while Teresa and Sondra were fellows in the EBNP program. New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (8) 72 Innovation Source of Evidence 8 Describe and demonstrate Innovations in Nursing Practice. In 2004, Vanderbilt launched an initiative called Elevate to move the culture of the organization to one of service. Five pillars we re identified with annual institution-wide goals associated with each pillar. During the executive strategic planning proce ss in 2009 a revision to the existing pillars was made, adding a new p illar of Innovation. Nursing followed with the nursing strategic plan by integrating innovati on into the strategic goals for nursing. See TL1 and OO 3 for the hospital and nursing strategic plans . Innovation in service delivery is defined as \" a novel set of behaviors, routines, and ways of working that are directed at improving heal thcare outcomes, administrative efficiency, cost effectiveness, and / or the user's experiences th at are implemented by planned and coordinated actions \". (Greenhalgh, 2004, ANCC, 2009) The struct ures and processes in place to support nursing research and EBP can result in innovati ons in nursing care. The following examples highlight changes that reflect an innovation in nursing care. Clinic location supports patient care Many Multiple Sclerosis patients receive IV infusions during their visit to the neurology clinic. Moving the MS and IV infusion Clinics to One Hundred Oaks presented an opportunity to design the clinics for easy access for patients and enhanced communication among providers. When the clinics moved to One Hundred Oa ks they were placed side-by-side with multiple connecting hallways so that patients and members of the health care team could easily go between them. This innovation provides for continuity of care for the Multiple Sclerosis patients who are receiving treatment via IV infusions. See NK 9 EO for a description of One Hundred Oaks design development . Innovative Care Delivery Model My Health Team at Vanderbilt (MHTAV), which was launched in June 2009 as an innovative care delivery model with a chronic disease management focus. This care delivery system incorporates telemedicine to improv e timely communication between providers and patients as well as between primary care and specialis t providers. In addition to the clinic staff, several new roles were develope d for MHTAV. This includes a ca re coordinator (RN), a care coordinator assistant (MA), an informatics specia list, who is an analyst for outcomes and quality New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (8) 73 reporting, a Pharmacist and a Dietician. The go als of this new model are to improve patient adherence to prevention and treatment regimens , to help control chronic conditions outcomes, and ultimately to reduce inpatient and ED utilizat ion, ultimately improving overall quality of life for our patients. [ NK8-Exhibit A-1-MHTAV Summary and Charter ] This program explicitly places the nurse at the hub of the healthcare team in the management of selected chronic health conditions. Health care online My Health at Vandy is a web-based portal th at allows patients to access their health records and communicate with clinic staff electr onically. To ensure confidentiality, patients must request access to health records and show photo identification to access the complete system. The nursing staff at the Rheumatology Clinic in Williamson County realized that patients were not aware of the resources availa ble through My Health at Vandy. To solve this problem, the nurses identified a computer that did not meet specifications for typical clinic use. Staff suggested that a computer be set up in a \"c ut out\" area in the clinic hallway that would accommodate a small table and chair. Patients ar e now directed to sign up for MHTAV at this location while in the clinic. Staffs are availa ble to assist and answer questions as needed. Patient response has been positi ve. Many more patients are no w communicating with clinic via MHTAV. Table NK 8 - 1: My Health At Vanderbilt Webpage New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (8) 74 Performance Improvement Office - beta site clinics The Performance Improvement Office (PIO) wa s created to address inconsistencies in clinic operations across the 125 clinics and over 1,000 providers in the VMG. Although many issues were uncovered during an extensive eval uation, the PIO has focused primarily on access issues since its creation in 2008. In addition to the PIO Operations Director, there are 4 nurses who work with interdisciplinary teams to identi fy operations inconsistencies and issues and develop strategies to improve them. Because of th e size of the organization, the PIO selected 2 key clinics (Breast Center and Urology) as \"learn ing labs\". These clinics pilot new ideas, which provide the staff in PIO with valuable inform ation on the viability of the strategy and its implementation. For example, the Breast Center and Urology Clinic staff identified the need for a new role - Access Team Leader. The Access Leader ro le was created to process critical clinical information related to scheduling and pre-appoin tment issues. Therefore, the Access Leaders are experienced NP's or RN's who provide direction to the Central Appointment Schedulers, Pre-Appointment Coordinators, RN Coordinators and Telephone Triage Nurses. Additionally, they are part of the team developing and implemen ting all service-specific access strategies. New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (8) 75 Clinical Workstation Dashboards Technology can be used to shape new behavi ors in the clinical setting. For example, a dashboard on the clinical work stations serves as a reminder to the nurse that that a task needs to be done. In the process of improving ambulation in surgical patients, the direct care nurses provided input into the design of an ambulation dashboard ( see NK 4 EO). If the nurses caring for the patient complete and document the dist ance ambulated on the prescribed schedule, the indicator on the dashboard turns green. If ambulation has not been completed or documented, the indicator turns red, providing a vi sual cue to the nurse that this task needs to be completed. See Table below.

She has been a nursing instructor at the Vanderbilt School of Nursing, Meharry Medical College and at Columbia State Communi ty College. In 1988, Margie worked for the PASS, an Employee Assistance Program for the Na shville Police Department. She is actively involved in the Tennessee Nurses Association. Aromatherapy in the Adult ED The Nurse Wellness committee in the Adult ED launched an innovative program to reduce stress and anxiety in the ED staff ( more info in EP 29) This program was designed for the nursing staff in the Adult ED and involved their engagement with an alternative therapy (essential oils). The Nurse Wellness committee members identified numerous healthcare organizations using aromatherapy to support the replication of a program in the Adult ED. A pre-post survey for the Adult ED staff showed th at the staff's self-reported stress and anxiety declined from aromatherapy Cultural and Linguistic Council The Nurse Ethics Survey ( see NK 4 EO and EP 23 for description) was the impetus to develop an interdisciplinary committee (ethicists and nurses) to address gaps identified from the survey. One of the major i ssues identified in the Nurse Ethics survey was dealing with patients from different cultures and who had diff iculty communicating in English. The Cultural and Linguistic Council was created to meet the ne eds identified form the survey. This council is in the early stages of development; currently the members are developing a charter to address their scope and mid- and long-range goals. ( More info in EP 23 & EP 26) Children's Safety Store Children's Hospital received funding from the National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions to create a safety store within the hospital. Nursing staff New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (8) 79 were involved in the design, setting hours of operation and selecting products for the store. Safety products available range from baby pr oofing to fire prevention to child locator equipment. Nurses' input was sought by sche duling face-face meetings, group meetings and web-based surveys. [ NK8-Exhibit-C-1-Safety Survey, NK8-Exhibit C-2-Safety Store News Feature ] Once the Safety Store opened in March 2009 nurses were one of the major referral sources to the store. Nurses are now able to recommend safe ty items, such as infant car seats and child safety equipment (e.g., helmets) as well as direct the parent s to the Safety Store off the hospital lobby. Exhibit x describes the various child locator products available from the Safety Store.

VUMC has been listed as one of the nation 's 100 \"most wired\" hospitals and health systems for the last 5 years. (Most Wired Survey and Benchmarking Study is conducted by Hospitals and Health Networks Magazine, A ccenture, McKesson Corp. and the College of Healthcare Information Management Executives). [NK9-Exhibit A-1-Healthcare IT News Week] http://www.hhnmostwired.com/hhnmostwired/i mages/design/coverimages/2009MWwinners.jpg This distinction is an honor and our efforts have clearly supported us in utilizing technology to address quality and safety Issues and improve patien t care outcomes. Clinic al applications also bring opportunities for improvement and challeng es for nursing. We have several resources in place to support the nursing staff in utilizing clin ical applications to support the practice of professional nursing. We have also had multiple opportunities for nurses to be involved in the plans for new critical care units, operat ing rooms and off site clinics. Nursing Structures Supporting Clin ical application of Technology System Support Services Systems Support Services is a department within Nursing with a primary goal of enhancing nursing practice through the use of computerized clinical applications. Systems Support provides services to all nursing staff in the inpatient areas. The 19 Systems Support Specialists in the department are members of the Nursing Leadership Staff in the Nursing Bylaws. The department is le d by Karen Hughart, RN, MSN who has expertise in planning and leading organizational change and implementing clinical computer applications. The key functions of this department include: Project Management Consultation/Liaison Services Education User Support Examples of large, hospital-wide clinic al applications that required planning, implentation and on-going user support include transition from paper to electronic medical records (HED) and use of a bar code medication ad ministration system (Admin RX). An example New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (9) 81 of the consultation and project management func tions of Systems Support are provided in NK 4 (ambulation project) and NK 9 Project: 2). There are 22.35 FTEs in System Support Servic es of which 19.35 are nurses. Work of the team consists of centralized efforts that suppo rt nurses in a global fashion (e.g. computer training provided during New Employee Orientation) and decentralized efforts that support needs at the patient care unit level (e.g. ensuring core informatics competencies achieved by the end of unit-based orientation). The centraliz ed functions are covered by Systems Support Specialists (SSS) whereas the local functions are covered by the Clinical Application Specialists (CAPS). Systems Support Specialists (SSS) Registered nurses who are content expert s on electronic clinical systems and nursing informatics who support the nursing staff in use of core clinical systems through education, user support, and consultation se rvices. They also partner with other nursing leaders to lead clinical informatics proj ects and implement technical and workflow solutions that support the strategic goals a nd tactical objectives of nursing and the clinical enterprise. Clinical Application Specialists (CAPS) RN Systems Support Specialists who are assigned to a cluster of units (approximately 80-110 beds each) in the Medi cal Center and spend approximately 60% of their time is supporting end users of co re clinical informatics systems. These specialists make regular weekly rounds to id entify potential or actual issues they can address and also partner with units/clinics/ departments to make improvements in the practice setting. Systems Support and Innovation Team The Systems Support and Innovation Team is the outpatient counterpart to System Support Services. This team falls under The Trai ning and Organizational Department of VMG, and provides support and training for all outpatie nt clinics on and off campus. It is lead by a nurse, Laura Butler, RN, MSN, who is charged to assist in the support and advancement of EMR technology. The key functions of this team mirror that of the Clinical Application Specialists as they are assigned locally to assist specific clinics. New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (9) 82 An example of an outpatient wide project in the works is a new tool that improves the way staff communicates with referring providers and clinic staff in the community called the Provider Communication wizard. The support staff are also assisting with the way clinics document through the use of new forms in the EMR for specialized areas such as the Anticoagulation clinic, or creating documentation tools for generalized areas of nursing such as triage. In each of these examples, clinic nurses are involved in the decisions made about the applications (e.g., form content and layout) as well as implementation. Users groups have been developed to suppor t direct care nurses and other providers in using technology in their practice. Two primar y groups include VUH (adult hospital) and VMG (clinics) groups, led by the respective department described above. Direct care nurses also have input into the selection and implementation of clinical applications through the HED Advisory Group. (Committees memberships lists in OO 15) Clinic User Group The EMR team has monthly user group meetings in VMG. This group is composed of EMR specialists, who are nurses, assigned to the clinics. The VMG User Group meeting is a forum used to: Update users on new releases Provide users the opport unity to ask questions. Provides a forum for the VMG EMR Team to elicit input into new applications The meetings, which take place in VMG on campus, are now being live streamed to One Hundred Oaks. [ NK9-Exhibit B-1-UG Flyer ] Attendance at these User meeting meetings ranges from 4 - 12, the majority of which ar e direct care nurses in the clinics. Information from the User meetings is availa ble on the EMR website. This allows staffs who are not able to attend the meeting to ha ve access to the content presented and/or discussed. The EMR team also has a team blog , which contains up to date information about the EMR and StarPanel. This blog is ac cessed through the EMR Team website. See Table below. New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (9) 83 Table NK 9 -1: EMR Team Blog Systems Support Services User Group This user meeting, also known as \"Computer Talk\", is held on the first Wednesday or each month. Similar to the VMG user meetings , the SSS meetings provide opportunities for two-way communication and collaboration with e nd users. Users bring questions and concerns that are addressed (if possible) or channeled to groups that make decisions on technical and workflow change. Minutes from these meetings are sent to all Inpatient Units and posted on the Systems Support Services website. [ NK9-Exhibit C-1-Minutes from Computer Talk ] See Table below. New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (9) 84 Table NK 9 -2: System Support Services Website HED Advisory Committee Karen Hughart, RN, MSN and Vickie Thomps on, RN, MSN co-chair the HED Advisory Committee that meets twice each month. Nurses who use our clinical computer applications submit recommendations for changes and e nhancements and the HED Advisory Comm. Reviews to either approve or reject. This group also advises on training and support requirements to support various degrees of syst em changes. Members include a cross section of Managers, Assistant Managers, Nurse Educators, Clinical Nurses Specialists, and Staff Nurses from VUH, VCH, and VPH. The Advisory Commi ttee, composed of staff nurses and nurse leaders, makes recommendations for design ch anges in the EMR payout and bring issues New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (9) 85 related to specific clinical area needs. ( See OO 15 for membership list ). For example, Billy Cammeron, RN, a staff nurse in SICU, submitte d a request through the HED Suggestion Box to add a new option for documenting activity. Ange la Swinger-Lockridge, RN, a staff nurse on 4 Round Wing, requested a new option for the drop do wn box of choices for describing how an IV is secured. Both these suggestions were disc ussed by the HED Advisory group and approved. ] Table NK9 - 3: Excerpt of Minutes from Aug 19, 2010 HED Advisory Committee Enterprise-wide Support for Technology Vanderbilt has created a new position, dire ctor of Nursing Informatics, to oversee clinical applications that can support and enhanc e nursing care. This position provides a bridge between the hospitals and clinics - that is, acro ss the entire enterprise. Nurses participate in setting information technology priorities and ha ve been involved in both the development of and participation in design shops. Director of Patient Care Informatics This new position was created to provide a place at the medical informatics table to articulate a strategy to ensure that nursing needs are met as we go forward in a highly automated environment.

For example, the director facilitates a neuro-cognitive workgroup that is working to standardize neurological assessment documentation across the enterprise. Engages patient care providers with varying roles including physicians, nurse practitioners, nursing staff, ancillary dept personnel, and medical records professionals to contribute to the development and use of the CIS. Develops understanding of New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (9) 86 physician needs and works with CMIO's to bu ild relationships with physicians to gain support of Informatics related initiatives. Is highly responsive to customer needs, including training needs, to assure wide spre ad acceptance and provider use of clinical systems. Works across organizational boundaries to a ssure that Clinical customers needs for support are met by actively working with cust omers, their leadership and organizational resources that have learning, teach, and support resources Reviews Nursing Informatics trends, expe riences and approaches; identifies CIS applications that support or enhance nursing practice and other c linical disciplines. Develops technical and applicat ion implementation strategies, and actively participates in the development of strategic plans for CI S. For example, developed the strategic blueprint for nursing documentation. Works in concert with the Informatics Center to plan, prioritize, design and implement systems supporting patient care, research and teaching missions Participates in the design of clinical pathway models with nursing, physician and administrative leadership, and assists in th e modification of these models to gain maximum efficacy and support for patient care . For example, Deborah led a section of a design shop on education for patients with heart failure. [ NK9-Exhibit F-1-Design Shop - Patient Engagement ] Leads development of clinical \"rules\" supportin g patient care and protocol as well as the design of clinical system features support ing protocol management and the use of the system to leverage the clinicians' time and maximize provider communication. The development of a patient education plan fo r heart failure exemplifies the Director's leadership and coloration with staff nurse s, educators, librarians and patent/family advocates. [ NK9-Exhibit G-1-Heart Failure Teac hing Record, NK9-Exhibit G-2-Heart Failure Educ Project Team ] Swim Lanes Medical Center Informatics initiatives, in cluding key nursing informatics projects, are managed through an iterative planning process in which informatics and operations leaders meet jointly to agree on strategic goals requi ring IT support. Based on these goals, the informatics projects are first prioritized based on available resources and then these projects are sequenced to maximize efficiency and minimi ze disruption to the organization. The output of this process tracks projects across a series of horizontal tr acks laid out on a board that New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (9) 87 resemble the parallel lanes in a swimming race - hence the name swim lanes. This year, the 3 swim lanes associated specifically wi th nursing organized around 3 themes: Documentation Framework - implementation of the Saba Clinical Care Classification model as our framework for nursing documentat ion, including use of this ANA approved nursing terminology. Visualization, Communication, and Coordination - development of dashboards, reports, alerts, and other tools to support better colla boration and use of date to drive patient care decision making. Simplification of documentation related proc esses & leveraging technology to create \"Smart Environments \" - Examples might include integration of smart beds, StarLight TV, and/or IV pumps with existing informatic s tools to reduce data transcription and optimize capabilities of all these tools. At any one time, this planning proce ss encompasses a 3-5 year window with more specificity in the initial 12-18 months. For exampl e, we started working toward the goal to have best in class Medication Safety in 2003 but did not have substantial completion until 2010 when bar code medication administration was fully implemented. In addition to serving as the means to do ma jor planning on an annual basis, IT reports out progress against swim lane projects on a qua rterly basis. If there are organizational or environmental changes during a year that would alter priorities, the swim lanes are adjusted to reflect the new reality. Items on the swim la nes are graphically represented to provide an overview of IT activities across the Medical Ce nter as well as the progress made towards each goal. Design Shops A design shop is an event or process in which informatics specialists and clinicians collaborate with the guidance of facilitators to change vague aspirations into actionable plans. Typically \u00bd - 2 days in length, these events are usually held at the Vanderbilt Center for Better Health. Appropriate stakeholders (which have al ways included direct ca re nurses) are brought together to tackle complex chal lenges. The output of these events is one or more actionable plans that clarify: Agreements for work process changes Technical support required Implementation processes New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (9) 88 In the past year, some of these Design Shops have addressed issues such as: Design requirements for an elec tronic nursing \"To Do List\" Patient Education ( as part of Patient Engagement, Exhibit F-1 ) Setting Priorities for Nursing Examples of Nurses Involvement in Decision s around Information Systems and Architecture Numerous improvements have been made through the use of our System Support internal experts. The following examples provide evidence of the integration of technology into staff nurses' daily routines. Adult Surgical Step down Monitori ng of Nurse Sensitive Indicators Charge nurses receive daily electronic reports on nurse sensitive indicators detailing completion of required nursing care and documentation. Modeled after work in the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit where each charge nurse through the EMR and StarPanel, can view timely documentation of restraints, admission history, pre- admission medication list, falls assessment, skin/pressure ulcer prevention, pain and care related to patients on ventilators. These \"charge nurse dashboards\" indicate, through color coding, when nursing activate s have been (green) or not been (red) documented in a timely manner. When ta sks are not documented, the charge nurse follow up on reasons for the dela y; in most instances there is a reasonable explanation that requires no further action. If a staff nurse is consistently late in completing and/or documenting the key nursing assessments, he/she may receive coaching from the charge nurse. Capturing Admission History from ED to Inpatient Units Previous admission history electronic pr ocess did not capture all of the data from the Adult Emergency Department scre ening process into the admission history when the patient is admitted to the unit. The changes now support the continuation of the information captured in the ED. Neonatal Intensive Care Downtime Flow sheet Enhancements New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (9) 89 Working with the nurses to enhance documents needed in the event of a clinical documentation system downtime which would meet the actual documentation needs of this unique patient population. Surgical Intensive Care Unit Discharge Planning When the SICU opened up in the new Critical Care Tower in November of 2006, their increase in bed numbers resulted in the addition of designated \"stepdown\" beds, which means that the SICU nurses are incr easingly discharging patients. CAPS representative partnered with the unit e ducator to create an education module designed specifically for discharging pa tients from the SICU. This included the appropriate identification of electronic t ools, such as Computerized Provider Order Entry (COPE) System, and electronic tools used for discharge teaching. Controlling Hypertension in Ambulatory Care Hypertension is a diagnosis that touches patients in many clinics and departments across the enterprise. An interd isciplinary team of physicians, nurses and IT specialists, led by a nurse, convened to develop and implement an agreed upon strategic plan of care for hypertensive patients across designated VMG clinics (Cardiology, Internal Medicine, Diabetes, Ne phrology, Hypertension). The goal was to improve the percentage of patients within target BP measurement according to The Seventh Report of the Joint National Commi ttee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7) Guidelines. This was accomplished with the development of a clinical algorithm that would be implemented at each clinic visit. The team reviewed current evidence and conducted a gap analysis to identify opportunities to improve the processes of ca re that would meet their ultimate goal (patients with blood pressure within target range). Once the plan of care was agreed upon, IT specialists developed an electronic al gorithm to be used at each patient visit. Pilot testing of this algorithm started December 2009 in two cardiology clinics. The clinic recently opened and has not yet been ev aluated for effectiveness in controlling hypertension. The use of technology can enhance proc esses to integrate new nurses into the environment as well as improve communication between patients and their providers. New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (9) 90 Redesign of Orientation Training fo r Electronic Documentation Systems Evaluations from new user orientation indicated the classes did not meet the basic needs for the nurses to be able to ea sily navigate the systems once they were released from orientation. Systems Suppo rt Services staff who partner with the Department of Nursing Educat ion and Development to provide the training streamlined the classes and the focus was changed to prov ide increased practice and review time. Positive orientation feedback indicates thes e changes have been helpful to the nursing staff. This change supports the ability of th e new staff and preceptors to more quickly help new nurses assimilate the use of electr onic systems into their practice in the units/clinics/departments. A Nursing Informatics Orientation Checklist A checklist was developed by the CAPS Team to help nurses better understand and utilize the clinical applications they were oriented to in the care of their patients. The orientation checklist is utilized with new staff one week prior to the new staff member's completion of unit-based orientatio n. This supports the staff member in utilizing the system over a 6-8 week period and helps to reinforce specific policies and processes. This format supports a more indi vidualized learning approach but with the structure that incorporates required key competencies. Improving Electronic Communication between Patients and Providers My Health at Vandy is a web-based portal that allows patients to access their health records and communicate with c linic staff electronically. To ensure confidentiality, patients must request access to health records and show photo identification to access the complete system. The nursing staff at the Rheumatology Clinic in Williamson County realized that patients were not aware of the resources available through My Health at Vandy. To so lve this problem, the nurses identified a computer that did not meet specifications fo r typical clinic use. Staff suggested that computer be set up in a \"cut out\" in the c linic hallway that would accommodate a small table and chair. Patients are now directed to sign up for MHAV at this location while in clinic. Staffs are available to assist and an swer questions as needed. Patient response has been positive. Many more patients are now communicating with clinic via My Health At Vandy. Patient satisfaction is high. New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (9) 91 The final example describes the interface be tween nurses, architects and technology to design and open clinic space in an off-site building. Designing Clinic Space at One Hundred Oaks In 2008, a nurse administrator, Janice Smith, RN, MSN, was charged with leading the design of clinics to be relocated at One Hundred Oaks. The building was originally built as an urban shopping mall. Her leader ship ensured that the space was designed to facilitate patient care, taking into account nursi ng activities and work flow. Each clinic that moved to One Hundred Oaks had direct care nurses from their area participate in the planning and design of their space. In these design meetings, research nurses were also included to ensure their need s were adequately addressed. For example, the MS Clinic planning team included a clinic nurse (Nora Stark), a research nurse (Jean Simmons) and th e nurse leader (Dan Moreschi) [ NK9-Exhibit H-1- MS Planning ]. Working with architects, genera l and sub contractors, equipment planners, and decorators allowed the nurse leader (Janice Smith) to reflect direct care nurses' perspectives on each detail of the build out. In addition to the design, the nurse leader is responsible for all the non-capita l equipment, furniture, and start up budgets. These budgets include the technology components associated with each practice. Each clinic had nurses at the table as we outlined work flows to determine where computers were placed, where phone s needed to be added, and where the electronic whiteboards were placed to be st serve the needs of the staff. A nurse practitioner was appointed as the point pers on for the medical faculty in the OB/Gyn clinic transition [ NK9-Exhibit I-1-Memo from Beth Huff ] issues about the blood bank in this clinic. [ NK9-Exhibit I-2-Email from Lynn B ] The design and build out of the first c linics to move to OHO took 7.5 months. During this time, the OHO leader also worked with transition teams from each clinic to help them prepare for the move. The first c linic started the move in February 2009. To date, we have opened approximately 400,000 sq feet of new clinical space. Each area is moved in, operational and producing as expect ed or better than anticipated. There has been a substantial increase in volume in many of the clinics. Staff, faculty, and patients all agree the space is lovely, convenient, well designed, and more than adequate for their ne eds. Staffs were initially overwhelmed by New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (9) 92 the improvements in their work environmen t. Through rounding, we hear how much they enjoy the new space, how well it is workin g, and how happy they are to be a part of this endeavor. New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (9 EO) 93 Innovation Source of Evidence NK 9 EO Describe and demonstrate an improvement in practice due to nurse involvement in technology and informat ion system decision-making or due to nurses' participations in architecture and space design. Medication Reconciliation on Hospital Admission Background/Purpose Patient safety is a primary concern of all healthcare institutions. The Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goal number 8 stat es: \"Accurately and completely reconcile medications across the continuum of care\". When a patient is admitted to the hospital the healthcare team begin the proce sses of admission as well as initiating discharge planning. Medication reconciliation is a central part of the admission process, and sets the stage for a safe and efficient discharge process. Tracking admission data, it was clear that the admission documentation and medication reconciliation were not being completed per poli cy (i.e., within 8 hours of admission) on a substantial number of patients. The purpose of this project was to develop an electronic solution to completing medication reconciliation within the 1 st 8 hours of hospital admission. Vanderbilt also felt it was important to involv e all the disciplines responsible for medication safety to work together for a solution that could be incorporated into the workflow of caring for patients. Approach A multidisciplinary workgr oup was convened in the final quarter of 2008 (see Project Team). The workgroup compared \"current practice \" to what was desired to meet the national patient safely goal. A multidisciplinary focus gr oup of end users, including staff nurses, was conducted to identify barriers to medication reconciliation and brainstorm strategies to improve compliance. This group provided feedback on how each discipline could participate in the process. Nurses would continue to assist by collecting th e home medication list from the patient as they were collecting an admission history. Provid ers would review and compare that list when New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (9 EO) 94 ordering medications for the patient at admi ssion. Reporting was completed in January 2010 and our performance was less than expected. Although we noted a dramatic improvement from baseline, our plateau performance of 38% was well short of our target of 90%. Further research and discussions with end us ers highlighted that the current electronic tool was not intuitive and not well placed with in the workflow for nurses or physicians. Because of this feedback, the informatics prog rammer began prototyping a revised tool in the spring of 2010. Although the tool is in the last phases of testing, the intent is to place this tool in the CPOE system, to facilitate all discipline to contribute to the collection process, and within provider's History and Physical notes. These improvements will assist in allowing provider to leverage the list within their notes to decrease double charting and to assist providers in ordering medications from the home medication list. The revise d tool will show the medication list noted in the EMR to assist users with known medication information within ou r electronic systems. The infrastructure for this improvement has been completed to allo w for the improvement teams to the ability to monitor improvements and provide reports to stakeholder on performance.

They were able to provide feedback from the nurses doing the work based on conversati ons, rounding, teaching, and helping staff troubleshoot our current systems. Outcomes/Impact Implementation of the electronic medica tion reconciliation process and system has occurred in stages. The most recent addition to the process is a manager's report, which was implemented in paper format in Oct 2009 and automated in Jan 2010. The team evaluated implementation in each practice area and made mo difications to integrate this activity into the nurse's workflow. Reports have been developed to monitor the outcome - percent of patients with medications reconciled within 8 hours after admission to the hospital (figure 9.2). These data indicate initial improvement compared to our baseline of 19.4% but show we are well short of our 90% goal. Improvement plans and integration within current workflow detailed above should help bring us closer to meeting pati ent safety goal 8, which will reduce the risk of discharging patients without the appropriate medications ordered. Accountability of the providers to reconcile medications throughout the continuum of care will also be a core component once our tools are integrated within the workflow. See Graph below. New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (9 EO) 96 Graph NK 9 EO - 1: Percent Medica tions Reconciliation within 8 Hours of Admission This statistical Process Control chart shows norm al variability that is within control. We are not statistically improving or regressing. This defines the reasons for redesigning our current tools and process. VUH Expansion: Opening the Critical Care Tower Part 1: Nurses Involvement in the Architecture Planning Background/Purpose For several years, Vanderbilt University Hosp ital has faced challenges in regard to inpatient and surgical bed capacities. The Crit ical Care Tower projec t was the response to address the capacity needs, provide facilities th at would support current and future technology and provide an ideal setting for patients/familie s and members of the health care team. The Tower would also need to accommodate future growth. Located along side the north and south towers of VUH, the 11 -story addition would house 12 new operating rooms, New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (9 EO) 97 102 patient rooms for the medical, surgical and neur ological intensive care units and shell space for the potential of 68 additional beds and other future services. The Tower would also have to blend and work with current buildings and patient care space. Approach The VUH Expansion and Transition Team was an interdisciplinary team responsible for the coordination of a number of committees, work groups and task forces that contributed to the success of the Critical Care Tower project. At any given time, literally hundreds of nursing staff and other team members were involved in this process. Both internal and external experts were involved in the process. These teams: Identified \"buckets\" of work Identified relevant \"stakeholders\" Developed a timeline for all processes and work Coordinated the work groups and the timeline Served as the oversight group for communication Monitored the budget vs. actual cost Collated and evaluated feedback to support decision-making Coordinated work of internal ex perts and outside consultants The direct care staffs were involved in every decision that was made: \"Testing\" days were held where patient care items were brought into the Medical Center and nursing staff were able to try them out and provide feedback, such as beds, over bed tables, chairs, etc. Each unit picked their own colors , designs for furniture, etc. They picked their computer systems (see below) Participated with Terrell Smith, RN, MSN Director, Patient Centered Care, to design the family space in the room and the waiting areas Designed \"day in the life\" practice/education sessions Designed mock \"move-in\" day New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (9 EO) 98 Many others Table NK 9 EO - 2: Project Team : This is a sample of VUH Ex pansion and Transition Teams Leaders Team Member Credentials Role on Team Area Charlotte Chaney Leader VUH Associate Hospital Administrator Cynthia Facemire Leader Director, VUH Expansion and Transition Barbara Meriweather RN, MBA Leader Senior Associate, Expansion and Transition Barbara Sanders RN, BSN Leader Senior Associate, Expansion and Transition Cathy Rogers Cross Administrative Manager Brent Lemonds RN,MHA Leader, Operations Planning Adult Emergency Services Lenys Biga RN, MSN Leader, Patient Move and Advocacy VUH Hospital Administrator Devin Carr RN, MSN Leader, Education and Orientation Administrative Director George DeLong Leader, Occupancy Readiness Associate Hospital Director Nancye Feistritzer RN, MSN Leader, Perioperative Associate Hospital New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (9 EO) 99 Services Director Thomas Naslund M.D. Leader, Medical Staff Readiness Surgery Chair Terrell Smith RN, MSN Leader, Patient/Family input Director, Patient/Family Centered Care Ashley Staniewski RN.

The actual transfer of patients from the old to the new units was accomplished in less than 6 hours, which indicates the transition plans were appropriate for \"move day\". Below are a sample of the improvements made to the critical care environment - improvements that occurred as a result of the input from the direct care staff from the units. Enlarged patient rooms (320 square feet, more than 200 square feet larger than existing rooms) with full baths New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (9 EO) 100 Patient rooms have an innovative layout that supports the needs of the patient, family and healthcare team by three different zones Family zone has a sleeper sofa, recliner and sofa bed and internet capabilities Every room has a computer for documentation ICU Smart Beds in the patient zone with enhanced functions and safety features Dialysis hook-up in every room Blood gas lab and radiology room with digital radiography on each unit Alcoves between every 2 rooms for the st aff with computer and physiological monitor so staff can perf orm documentation while observing patients through windows 3 rooms per floor are specially equipped for bariatric patients and each room's ceiling is capable of adding more bariatric lifts if needed Laundry services for families Two waiting areas for families on each floor, quiet and active (TV) Quiet rooms for staff The new Critical Care Tower space would not be as staff and patient/family friendly had it not been for the inclusion of the direct care staff in the design of space, contents and technology. We saw patient/family satisfaction improved in the first quarter after the move to the CCT. For example, teamwork between nurses and physicians and overall quality of care in the SICU showed an upturn in the 1 st quarter of 2010 after the move Nov. 11, 2009 (Graphs below) See Graph below. New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (9 EO) 101 Graph NK 9 EO - 2: Satisfact ion with Teamwork in SICU Graph NK 9 EO - 3: Satisfactio n with Overall Care in SICU New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (9 EO) 102 VUH Expansion: Opening the Critical Care Tower Part 2: Nurses Involvement in th e Selecting of Information Systems Background/Purpose Relocations and expansion of 3 intensive ca re units (MICU, SICU, and NeuroICU) created a need for an increased number of existing clin ical workstations. Nursing informaticists was involved in the preparation of the 3 intensive care units to the Critical Care Tower by testing hardware, supporting practice day (\"Day in the Li fe\"), and supporting the move itself (\"Move in Day\"). Approach The technology in the Critical Care Towe r required testing, planning, and support to ensure clinical applications used would suppo rt patient care. Three major initiatives were launched to prepare for the move into the Critical Care Tower. 1. Testing hardware and clinical applications Working alongside Clinical Workstat ion builders and IT professionals, CAPS representatives formulated testing plans for ea ch major clinical workstation and peripherals associated with it. Technical issues were logged through an incide nt management process that tracked work and resolution of technica l fixes completed by appropriate informatics groups. 2. \"Day in the Life\" An exercise was orchestrated by clinical st aff that incorporated various departments and ancillaries that would directly or indirectly be involved in pati ent care. This exercise tested systems, workflows, response times of info rmation systems and resources available. Ten scenarios were created (3 for ea ch ICU, 1 in the main atrium) that would mimic real life emergencies. CAPS representatives for th ose units were involved to ensure that information systems were up and running and to help participants navigate through the designated scenarios. Issues were identifi ed after the exercises and forwarded onto the appropriate parties for troubleshooting and evaluation. New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (9 EO) 103 3. \"Move In Day\" On move day, embedded clinical applicatio ns specialists (CAPS) and Systems Support representatives provided on-site support during the transfer of patients to the new ICUs. An Informatics Command Center (IRC) was established to monitor Service Manager (Help Desk) for potential informatics related issues coordinate response with appropri ate support groups as necessary liaison with VUH-Emergency Operations Ce nter (EOC) for the Critical Care Tower provide and receive status updates follow up on issues reported by VUH Comma nd Center and coordinate responses to these issues (see CCT IRC Subplan Activity Plan) Measures of success for Systems Support Se rvices included (1) having appropriate and operational clinical application systems in each ICU by the completion of the move and (2) staff encountering minimal (less than 5/day) issues related to the clinical application system. Table NK 9 EO - 3: Participants Team Member Credentials Role on Team Area Sara Seaman, RN, BSN Team member CAPS Systems Support Neuro ICU Lillian McGehee RN, MSN Team member CAPS, system Support SICU Tom Mack RN. BSN Team member CAPS, System Support MICU Sara Winters RN, BSN Team Leader Clinical Application Specilaist, Systems Support New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (9 EO) 104 Outcomes All 3 ICUs completed their transfer of all pa tients to the new CCT, 1 hour and 30 minutes ahead of schedule without major incidents to the clinical application systems involved. As a result, the IRC was able shorten its schedule an d reallocate resources to other projects. Systems Support did maintain around the clock cove rage for five days. Issues reported were minimal (less than 5/day) and were resolved or channeled to appropriate parties in 1-2 weeks. Thus, with the support from Systems Support Se rvices and input from the nurses who would be the end users, the move to the CCT was highly successful. Relocation of the Adolescent Medicine Clinic to One Hundred Oaks (OHO) Background/Purpose The Doctors' Office Tower is crowded. Adol escent Medicine was originally planned to occupy the 10 th floor, but capital had not been releas ed to build that space. Adolescent Medicine was fitted into 8th floor with Primary and Acute care originally as a temporary measure five years ago, but space has become more and more limited as services on 8th floor have grown. Strategic space planning for 10th floor now indicates that other clinics/specialties are priority for that space. Adolescent Medicine could be moved in its entirety to an off-site location. The purpose of this project was to su ccessfully move the DOT clinic from MCJCHV to an off-site location, OHO. Approach An interdisciplinary committee was formed in 2007 to being to plan for the FY2009 move. All members of the committee had a voice in the design optimal clinic space and clinic flow ideas. The architects worked with the direct care staff in all their discussions and decisions. Four initial programming meetings were he ld to set direction. After the programming document was approved by all members of the committee, work began with the architects at Gresham Smith, the Vanderbilt Space and Faciliti es architects, Interior Design Services for furniture, and Balfour Resource Group who coor dinates purchasing of all equipment. Nurses were involved in initial programming, actual layo ut of the clinic, and selection of furniture and equipment. Nursing requested a bathroom be put in the gy necology room so that the girls no longer have to clutch a gown and go down the hall New Knowledge, Innovations and Improvements Innovation (9 EO) 105 Nursing requested a shelf to put hygiene pr oducts on in each bathroom because of hypersensitivity (age appropriate) regardin g personal needs...didn't like having to ask the nurse. Nursing requested a window be put in the medication room which is located across from the patient check in area. They wanted the ability to be able to respond to triage needs even when they were away from the visibility at the nurse station Nursing requested an ice/water machine and nutrition refrigerator be placed in med room since oral meds need fluid and so metimes food in the stomach to give appropriately. This streamlined care. The medication room was also built big enough to accommodate preparation of medications without interruptions from othe r members of the HCT. This amount of space was not something available in their previous location.

The physicians, providers, ancillary team members, and nursing staff can work efficiently and effectively in the new space. Subjective input from patients and parents is very positive. Staff are pleased with the flow. Nurses are pleased with the improved nur ses station, addition of designated medication/nourishment rooms, and efficien t Point of Care testing room. There are more exam rooms and more patient counselin g rooms, which improves flow. There are designated patient intake/vital sign spaces whic h affords more privacy for patients. Physicians are pleased with expanded in-clinic provider work space for documenting and student/resident teaching. The Adolescent Clinic nurses tell us these pr imary care patients feel like this is their own clinic ...\"they are not seen in a space with small ba bies crying and toddlers running around\". The cycle time in the clinic decreased by approximatel y 50% from pre- to post relocation to OHO. Table NK 9 EO - 5: Adolescent Clinic Cycle Time FY Quarter Cycle Time in "}
