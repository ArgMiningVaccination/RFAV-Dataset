Crystal methamphetamine is the crystalline (rock) form of meth. Meth can come in other forms such as powder or pill, but crystal meth is one of the most common. Crystal meth is a manufactured drug (not a naturally occurring one.) It's made using pseudoephedrine, an ingredient in cold medicine. It's combined with dangerous chemicals, which could include: - Battery acid - Drain cleaner - Fuel - Anti-freeze, and more. The chemicals are cooked with pseudoephedrine to form crystal meth. Meth labs, whether in the US or in other countries such as Mexico, are always unregulated. Cooking meth is dangerous and hazardous to the health of those manufacturing it as well, others nearby, and the environment. Meth labs can even explode3. Crystal meth is illegal, always, and dangerous. It's sometimes referred by street names such as: - Ice - Glass - Speed - Tweak - Crank1 Ladies and Gentlemen, Caring for Ladies and Gentlemen. Crystal meth is highly addictive. It affects your central nervous system and wreaks havoc on your body, your mind, and your relationships, from both short-term and long-term use. But there is hope, always. If you or a loved one are held captive by crystal meth, addiction treatment can help you break the chain. Why is Crystal Meth So Addictive? Crystal meth is so addictive because it affects both your brain and body. It increases the production of dopamine in the brain. Dopamine affects movement, motivation, and the sense of being rewarded. Your brain and body quickly become used to this stimulant, embracing the alertness, and craving the drug. It is fast-acting, but also fast-fading2. It is often used repeatedly throughout the day to keep the feelings going. This intense usage of crystal meth makes it easy to become addicted quickly. What Happens With a Crystal Meth Addiction? Crystal meth addiction, much like alcohol addiction, usually spirals out of control quickly and can cause issues with your health, your work or school, and your friends and family. Meth addictions can lead to overdoses and even death. Crystal meth has both short- and long-term effects. Short-term effects include: - Increased wakefulness and physical activity (staying awake for days at a time) - Rapid heart rate - Fast breathing - Decreased appetite - Increased blood pressure - Poor decision-making, leads to risky behaviors Long-term effects may include: - Rapid and extreme weight loss - Intense itching - Confusion - Anxiety - Paranoia - Hallucinations - Memory loss - Violent tendencies Signs Someone is Using Crystal Meth How can you tell if someone is using crystal meth? Some of the short-term effects, such as staying awake for days, constantly being in motion, or even talking non-stop may be indicators. Other indicators may be seen when someone initially stops using crystal meth in what's referred to as the \"comedown.\" During a comedown, they may become increasingly anxious, paranoid, and become excessively hungry and sleepy. The crash after so much time awake may lead to them falling asleep standing, at work, or while driving. They may also enter an incredibly deep depression. Other signs may include skin sores from excessive scratching and failing extreme dental health. Crystal Meth Addiction Treatment Crystal meth is highly addictive.

What to Expect from a Crystal Meth Addiction Detox Program Generally, prior to officially being admitted into a crystal meth addiction detox program, the drug user first receives a medical exam in order to determine any physical or mental health issues that may negatively affect the detox program. Once this exam is complete, the detox program generally creates a treatment schedule for the patient. This schedule generally includes a combination of different therapies and medications that are intended to make detox easier and safer. In addition, some detox programs also control the types of foods that the patient consumes, as links have been found between healthy eating and detox effectiveness. During this entire process, patients are generally limited regarding the types of belongings that they can bring into the program's premises, as programs are generally quite aware that some patients may attempt to bring in drugs and other contraband. Depending on the severity of the patient's addictions, the patient is eventually released from the program and given an aftercare plan. This type of plan generally includes options for the patient to continue their care in 12-step programs and various types of counseling. In conclusion, if you or someone you know may be addicted to crystal meth, it is within their best interest to seek treatment in a detox center in order to become sober.
