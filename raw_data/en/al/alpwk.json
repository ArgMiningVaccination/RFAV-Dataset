Mast, MD1, Harold S. Margolis, MD,1 Anthony E. Fiore, MD,1 Edward W. Brink, MD,2 Susan T. Goldstein, MD,1 Susan A. Wang, MD,1 Linda A. Moyer,1 Beth P. Bell, MD,1 Miriam J. Alter, PhD1 1Division of Viral Hepatitis, National Center for Infectious Diseases, 2Immunization Services Division, National Immunization Program Summary This report is the first of a two-part statement from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) that updates the strategy to eliminate hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission in the United States. The report provides updated recommenda-tions to improve prevention of perinatal and early childhood HBV transmission, including implementation of universal infant vaccination beginning at birth, and to increase vaccine coverage among previously unvaccinated children and adolescents. Strat- egies to enhance implementation of the recommendations include 1) establishing standing orders for administration of hepatitis B vaccination beginning at birth; 2) instituting delivery hospital policies and procedures and case management programs to im- prove identification of and administration of immunoprophylaxis to infants born to mothers who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive and to mothers with unknown HBsAg status at the time of delivery; and 3) implementing vaccination recordreviews for all children aged 11-12 years and children and adolescents aged <19 years who were born in countries with interme- diate and high levels of HBV endemicity, adopting hepatitis B vaccine requirements for school entry, and integrating hepatitis B vaccination services into settings that serve adolescents. The second part of the ACIP statement, which will include updatedrecommendations and strategies to increase hepatitis B vaccination of adults, will be published separately. Hepatitis B vaccination is the most effective measure to pre- vent HBV infection and its consequences. Since they were first issued in 1982, recommendations for hepatitis B vacci- nation have evolved into a comprehensive strategy to elimi-nate HBV transmission in the United States ( 2-6) (Box 1). A primary focus of this strategy is universal vaccination of infants to prevent early childhood HBV infection and to even-tually protect adolescents and adults from infection. Other components include routine screening of all pregnant women for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and postexposureimmunoprophylaxis of infants born to HBsAg-positive women, vaccination of children and adolescents who were not previously vaccinated, and vaccination of unvaccinated adultsat increased risk for infection. To date, the immunization strategy has been implemented with considerable success. Recent estimates indicate that >95%of pregnant women are tested for HBsAg, and case manage- ment has been effective in ensuring high levels of initiation and completion of postexposure immunoprophylaxis amongidentified infants born to HBsAg-positive women ( 7). Hepa- titis B vaccine has been successfully integrated into the child- hood vaccine schedule, and infant vaccine coverage levels arenow equivalent to those of other vaccines in the childhood schedule. During 1990-2004, incidence of acute hepatitis BStrategy to Eliminate Hepatitis B Virus Transmission Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a bloodborne and sexually trans- mitted virus. Rates of new infection and acute disease are high-est among adults, but chronic infection is more likely to occur in persons infected as infants or young children. Before hepa- titis B vaccination programs became routine in the UnitedStates, an estimated 30%-40% of chronic infections are believed to have resulted from perinatal or early childhood transmission, even though <10% of reported cases of hepati-tis B occurred in children aged <10 years ( 1). Chronically infected persons are at increased lifetime risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and also serve as the mainreservoir for continued HBV transmission.2 MMWR December 23, 2005 in the United States declined 75%. The greatest decline (94%) occurred among children and adolescents, coincident with an increase in hepatitis B vaccine coverage. As of 2004, among U.S. children aged 19-35 months, >92% had been fully vac-cinated with 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine ( 8). This success can be attributed in part to the established infrastructure for vaccine delivery to children and to federal support for perina-tal hepatitis B prevention programs. Vaccine coverage among adolescents has also increased sub- stantially. Preliminary data demonstrate that 50%-60% ofadolescents aged 13-15 years have records indicating vacci- nation (with 3 doses) against hepatitis B (CDC, unpublished data, 2003). As of November 2005, a total of 34 states requirevaccination for middle-school entry ( 9). Certain programs provide hepatitis B vaccine to youth who engage in behaviors that place them at high risk for HBV infection (i.e., injection-drug use, having more than one sex partner, and male sexual activity with other males), and adolescent hepatitis B vaccina- tion is included as a Health Plan Employer Data InformationSet (HEDIS) measure ( 10). Despite these successes, challenges remain. Even with improvements in the management of pregnant women, onlyapproximately 50% of expected births to HBsAg-positive women are identified (on the basis of application of racial/ ethnic-specific HBsAg prevalence estimates to U.S. natalitydata) for case which maximizes timely delivery of postexposure immunoprophylaxis ( 11; CDC, unpublished data, 2004). The need for proper management of women with-out prenatal care, including HBsAg testing at the time of ad- mission for delivery and administration of the first dose of vaccine to infants <12 hours of birth, is underscored by thehigher prevalence of HBsAg seropositivity among these women than among women who are screened prenatally ( 12). Even when maternal HBsAg testing does occur, certain infants ofHBsAg-positive mothers do not receive postexposure immuno-prophylaxis because of testing errors and lapses in reporting of test results ( 13), and infants of women with unknown HBsAg status at the time of delivery often do not receive a birth dose of vaccine ( 14). Birth dose coverage in 2004 was only 46% (National Immunization Survey, unpublished data, 2004), and coverage has not returned to levels from before July 1999 (54%), when recommendations were made to tem-porarily suspend administration of hepatitis B vaccines at birth until vaccines that do not contain thimerosal as a preservative became available ( 15). Among adolescents, efforts to prevent HBV transmission are hampered by the low rate of health- care visits in this age group compared with that of young chil- dren and the frequency of initiation of high-risk behaviors. To address these remaining challenges and accelerate progress toward elimination of HBV transmission in the United States, the ACIP has updated the hepatitis B immunization recom-mendations for infants, children, and adolescents and supple- mented the recommendations with strategies for implementation. The recommendations and implementationstrategies address prevention of perinatal and early childhood transmission and routine vaccination of children and adoles- cents. A main focus is on universal infant vaccination begin-ning at birth, which provides a \"safety net\" for prevention of perinatal infection, prevents early childhood infections, facili- tates implementation of universal vaccination recommendations,and prevents infections in adolescents and adults. The second part of the ACIP statement, which includes updated recom- mendations and implementation strategies to increase hepatitisB vaccination among unvaccinated adults, will be published separately ( 16). Major Updates to the Recommendations This report provides updated recommendations and approaches to address challenges in implementing the strat-egy to eliminate HBV transmission in the United States. These include the following measures: \u007fImprove prevention of perinatal and early childhood HBV transmission. Implement delivery hospital policies and procedures, case-management programs, and laws and regulations to improve identification of infants born toHBsAg-positive mothers and to mothers with unknown HBsAg status at the time of delivery, ensure administra- tion of appropriate postexposure immunoprophylaxis tothese infants beginning at birth, and administer a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine to medically stable infants who weigh >2,000 g and who are born to HBsAg-negative mothers.BOX 1.

Implement immu- nization record reviews for all children aged 11-12 years and children and adolescents aged <19 years who wereborn in countries in which HBV endemicity is high or intermediate (Figure 1 and Box 2); adopt hepatitis B vac- cine requirements for school entry; and vaccinate all un-vaccinated adolescents in settings that provide health-care services to persons in this age group. Background Clinical Features and Natural History of HBV Infection HBV is a 42-nm DNA virus classified in the Hepadnaviridae family. The liver is the primary site of HBV replication. After a susceptible person is exposed, the virus enters the liver viathe bloodstream; no evidence exists indicating that the virus replicates at mucosal surfaces. HBV infection can produce either asymptomatic or symptomatic infection. The averageincubation period is 90 days (range: 60-150 days) from exposure to onset of jaundice and 60 days (range: 40-90 days) from exposure to onset of aminotrans- ferase (ALT) levels ( 17,18 ). The onset of acute disease is usually insidious. Infants and young children (aged <10 years) are typically asymptomatic (19). When present, clinical symptoms and signs might include anorexia, malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and jaundice. Extrahepatic manifestations of disease (e.g., skin rashes, arthralgias, and arthritis) also can occur ( 20). The fatality rate among persons with reported acute hepatitis B is 0.5%-1.5%, with highest rates in adults aged >60 years ( 21). Although the consequences of acute hepatitis B can be severe, the majority of serious sequelae associated with HBV disease occur in persons who are chronically infected. Persons with chronic infection also serve as the major reservoir for contin-ued HBV transmission. Chronic infection occurs in approxi- mately 90% of infected infants, 30% of infected children aged <5 years, and <5% of infected persons aged >5 years, with continuing viral replication in the liver and persistent viremia (19,22-24 ). Primary infections also become chronic more fre- HBsAg prevalence >8% = high 2-7% = intermediate<2% = low * For multiple countries, estimates of prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), a marker of chronic HBV infection, are based on limited data and might not reflect current prevalence in countries that have implemented routine childhood hepatitis B vaccination. In addition, HBsAg prevalence rates might vary within countries by subpopulation and locality.FIGURE 1. Geographic distribution of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, 2005*4 MMWR December 23, 2005 quently in immunosuppressed persons (e.g., hemodialysis patients and persons with human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection) ( 23,25,26 ). On the basis of data from fol- low-up studies of persons infected with HBV as infants or young children, approximately 25% of those with chronic infection die prematurely from cirrhosis or liver cancer; themajority remain asymptomatic until onset or end- stage liver disease ( 27-29 ). No specific treatment exists for acute hepatitis B. Persons who have chronic HBV infection require medical evaluation and regular monitoring ( 30,31 ). Therapeutic agents approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatmentof chronic hepatitis B can achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication and remission of liver disease in certain per- sons ( 31). Periodic screening with alfa fetoprotein or imaging studies has been demonstrated to enhance early detection of HCC ( 31). Chronically infected persons with HCC have been reported to have experienced long-term survival after resec-tion or ablation of small HCCs, and persons who were screened had a substantial survival advantage compared with historic controls ( 31). Reinfection or reactivation of latent HBV infection has been reported among certain groups of immunosuppressed persons, including renal transplant recipients, HIV-infected patients,bone marrow transplant recipients, and patients receiving che-motherapy ( 32-35 ). The frequency with which this phenom- enon occurs is unknown. Interpretation of Serologic Markers of HBV Infection The antigens and antibodies associated with HBV include HBsAg antibody to HBsAg core antigen (HBcAg) and antibody to HBcAg (anti-HBc), and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe). At least one serologic marker is presentduring the different phases of HBV infection (Table 1) ( 18,36 ). Serologic assays are commercially available for all markers except HBcAg because no free HBcAg circulates in blood. The presence of a confirmed HBsAg result is indicative of ongoing HBV infection. All HBsAg-positive persons should be considered infectious. In newly infected persons, HBsAg isthe only serologic marker detected during the first 3-5 weeks after infection, and it persists for variable periods at very low levels. The average time from exposure to detection of HBsAgis 30 days (range: 6-60 days) ( 17,18 ). Highly sensitive single- TABLE 1.

HBsAg prevalence of >8%.Vol. 54 / RR-16 Recommendations and Reports 5 sample nucleic acid tests can detect HBV DNA in the serum of an infected person 10-20 days before detection of HBsAg (37). T ransient HBsAg positivity has been reported for up to 18 days after vaccination and is clinically insignificant ( 38,39 ). Anti-HBc appears at the onset of symptoms or liver test abnormalities in acute HBV infection and persists for life. Acute or recently acquired infection can be distinguished bythe presence of the IgM class of anti-HBc, which is detected at the onset of acute hepatitis B and persists for up to 6 months if the disease resolves. In patients who develop chronic hepa-titis B, IgM anti-HBc can persist at low levels during viral replication and can result in positive tests for IgM anti-HBc (40). In addition, false-positive IgM anti-HBc test results can occur. Because the positive predictive value is low in asymp- tomatic persons, for diagnosis of acute hepatitis B, testing for IgM anti-HBc should be limited to persons with clinical evi-dence of acute hepatitis or an epidemiologic link to a case. In persons who recover from HBV infection, HBsAg is elimi- nated from the blood, usually within 3-4 months, and anti-HBs develops during convalescence. The presence of anti-HBs typically indicates immunity from HBV infection. Infection or immunization with one genotype of HBV confers immu-nity to all genotypes. In addition, anti-HBs can be detected for several months after hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) administration. The majority of persons who recover fromnatural infection will be positive for both anti-HBs and anti- HBc, whereas persons who respond to hepatitis B vaccine have only anti-HBs. In persons who become chronically infected,HBsAg and anti-HBc persist, typically for life. HBsAg will become undetectable in approximately 0.5%-2% of chroni- cally infected persons yearly, and anti-HBs will occur in themajority of these persons ( 41-44 ). In certain persons, the only HBV serologic marker detected in serum is anti-HBc. Isolated anti-HBc can occur after HBVinfection among persons who have recovered but whose anti- HBs levels have waned or among persons in whom anti-HBs failed to occur. Persons in the latter category include thosewith circulating HBsAg levels not detectable by commercial assays. These persons are unlikely to be infectious except under circumstances in which they are the source for directpercutaneous exposure of susceptible recipients to substantial quantities of virus (e.g., through blood transfusion or follow- ing liver transplantation) ( 45). HBV DNA has been detected in the blood of <5% of persons with isolated anti-HBc ( 46). Typically, the frequency of isolated anti-HBc relates directly to the prevalence of HBV infection in the population. In popu-lations with a high prevalence of HBV infection, isolated anti- HBc likely indicates previous infection, with loss of anti-HBs. For persons in populations with a low prevalence of HBVinfection, an isolated anti-HBc result often represents a false- positive reaction. The majority of these persons have a pri- mary anti-HBs response after a 3-dose series of hepatitis B vaccine ( 47,48 ). Infants who are born to HBsAg-positive mothers and who do not become infected might have detect- able anti-HBc for <24 months after birth from passively trans- ferred maternal antibody. HBeAg can be detected in the serum of persons with acute or chronic HBV infection. The presence of HBeAg correlates with viral replication and high levels of virus (i.e., high infec-tivity) ( 49,50 ). Anti-HBe correlates with the loss of replicat- ing virus and with lower levels of virus, although reversion to HBeAg positivity has been observed ( 44). Epidemiology of HBV Infection Transmission HBV is transmitted by percutaneous (i.e., puncture through the skin) or mucosal (i.e., direct contact with mucous mem-branes) exposure to infectious blood or to body fluids that contain blood. All HBsAg-positive persons are infectious, but those who are also HBeAg positive are more infectiousbecause their blood contains high titers of HBV (typically 10 7- 109 virions/mL) ( 49,50 ). Although HBsAg has been detected in multiple body fluids, only serum, semen, and saliva havebeen demonstrated to be infectious ( 51,52 ). HBV is com- paratively stable in the environment and remains viable for >7 days on environmental surfaces at room temperature ( 53). HBV at concentrations of 102-3 virions/mL can be present on environmental surfaces in the absence of any visible blood and still cause transmission ( 53,54 ). For infants and children, the two primary sources of HBV infection are perinatal transmission from infected mothers and horizontal transmission from infected household contacts.Adolescents are at risk for HBV infection primarily through high-risk sexual activity (i.e., sex with more than one partner and male sexual activity with other males) and injection-druguse (21). T ransmission of HBV via transfusion of blood and plasma-derived products is rare because of donor screening for HBsAg and viral inactivation procedures. For a newborn infant whose mother is positive for both HBsAg and HBeAg, the risk for chronic HBV infection is 70%-90% by age 6 months in the absence of postexposure immunoprophylaxis ( 55-57 ). For infants of women who are HBsAg positive but HBeAg negative, the risk for chronic infection is <10% in the absence of postexposure immuno-prophylaxis ( 58-60 ). Rare cases of fulminant hepatitis B among perinatally infected infants also have been reported (61,62 ). Studies suggest that breastfeeding by an HBsAg-6 MMWR December 23, 2005 positive mother does not increase the risk for acquisition of HBV infection in the infant ( 63). Children who are not infected at birth remain at risk from long-term interpersonal contact with their infected mothers.In one study, 38% of infants who were born to HBsAg- positive mothers and who were not infected perinatally became infected by age 4 years ( 64). In addition, children living with any chronically infected persons are at risk for becoming infected through percutaneous or mucosal expo- sures to blood or infectious body fluids (e.g., sharing a tooth-brush, contact with exudates from dermatologic lesions, contact with HBsAg-contaminated surfaces). HBV transmis- sion rates to susceptible household have varied (range: 14%-60%) ( 65,66 ). High rates of infection also have been reported among unvaccinated long-term residents of institutions for the mentally handi-capped ( 67,68 ), and, in rare instances, person-to-person trans- mission has been reported in child care settings ( 69,70 ). Incidence During 1990-2004, overall incidence of reported acute hepatitis B declined 75%, from 8.5 to 2.1 per 100,000 popu- lation. The most dramatic declines occurred in the cohort ofchildren to whom recommendations for routine infant and adolescent vaccination have applied. Incidence among chil- dren aged <12 years and adolescents aged 12-19 yearsdeclined 94%, from 1.1 to 0.36 and 6.1 to 2.8 per 100,000 population, respectively (Figure 2). Since implementation of routine childhood immunization, an estimated 6,800 perina-tal infections and an additional 18,700 infections during the first 10 years of life have been prevented annually in the United States ( 71).Although infections in infants and children aged <10 years represented <10% of all HBV infections before implementa- tion of childhood immunization programs, childhood infec- tions resulted in an estimated 30%-40% of the chronic HBVinfections among persons who acquired their infections in the United States ( 1). In two population-based studies conducted among Asian/Pacific Islander children who were born in theUnited States before perinatal hepatitis B prevention programs were widely implemented, 61%-66% of the chronic HBV infections occurred in children born to HBsAg-negative moth-ers (72,73 ). A substantial proportion of these chronic infec- tions would not have been prevented by a selective program of identification and immunization of only infants born toHBsAg-positive mothers. In addition to declines in incidence among all age groups, racial disparities in hepatitis B incidence among children havebeen substantially reduced (Figure 3). The reduction of the disparity between Asian/Pacific Islander and other children is consistent with recent observations noting a decline inseroprevalence of HBV infection after successful implemen- tation of routine hepatitis B vaccination among Asians who have recently immigrated to the United States ( 74,75 ). How- ever, as hepatitis B incidence has declined among U.S.-born children, unvaccinated foreign-born children account for a high proportion of infections. During 2001-2002, of 19 chil- dren born after 1991 in whom acute hepatitis B had been verified, eight (42%) were foreign born ( 76). Prevalence In the U.S. population, the overall age-adjusted prevalence of HBV infection (including persons with chronic infection and those with previous infection) was 4.9% in the third * Per 100,000 population.FIGURE 2.

Foreign-born persons (par- ticularly Asian/Pacific Islanders) who have emigrated from countries in which HBV is endemic (Figure 1 and Box 2)contribute disproportionately to the burden of chronic HBV infection in the United States. The prevalence of chronic HBV infection among foreign-born persons immigrating to theUnited States from Central and Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa varies (range: 5%-15%) and reflects the pat- terns of HBV infection in the countries and regions of originfor these persons. During 1994-2003, approximately 40,000 immigrants with chronic HBV infection were admitted annually to the United States for permanent residence ( 78; CDC, unpublished data, 2005). Prophylaxis Against HBV Infection Hepatitis B Vaccine HBsAg is the antigen used for hepatitis B vaccination (79,80 ). Vaccine antigen can be purified from the plasma of persons with chronic HBV infection or produced by recom- binant DNA technology. Vaccines available in the United Statesuse recombinant DNA technology to express HBsAg in yeast, which is then purified from the cells by biochemical and bio- physical separation techniques ( 81,82 ). Hepatitis B vaccines licensed in the United States are formulated to contain 10-40 \u00b5g of HBsAg protein/mL. Since March 2000, hepati- tis B vaccines produced for distribution in the United Statesdo not contain thimerosal as a preservative or contain only a trace amount (<1.0 mcg mercury/mL) from the manufactur- ing process ( 83,84 B vaccine is available as a single-antigen formula- tion and also in fixed combination with other vaccines. T wo single-antigen vaccines are available in the United States:Recombivax HB \u00ae (Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, New Jersey) and Engerix-B\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium). Of the winrix \u00ae [GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium]) for vaccination adults, and two (Comvax\u00ae [Merck & Co., Inc., [GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium]) are used for vaccination of infants and young children. T winrix contains recombinant HBsAg and inactivated hepatitis A virus.Comvax contains recombinant HBsAg and Haemophilus influenzae b (Hib) polyribosylribitol phosphate conju- to Neisseria meningitidis outer membrane protein com- plex. Pediarix contains recombinant diphtheria and acquired anti-HBs and temporary protection (i.e., 3-6 months) when administered in standard doses. HBIG is typically used as an adjunct to hepatitis B vaccine for postexposure immunoprophylaxis to prevent HBVinfection. HBIG administered alone is the primary means of protection after an HBV exposure for nonresponders to hepa- titis B vaccination. HBIG is prepared from the plasma of donors with high concentrations of anti-HBs. The plasma is screened to elimi- nate donors who are positive for HBsAg, antibodies to HIVand hepatitis C virus (HCV), and HCV RNA. In addition, proper manufacturing techniques for HBIG inactivate viruses (e.g., HBV, HCV, and HIV) from the final product ( 85,86 ). No evidence exists that HBV, HCV, or HIV ever has been transmitted by HBIG commercially available in the United States. HBIG that is commercially available in the UnitedStates does not contain thimerosal. Vaccination Schedules and Results of Vaccination Preexposure Vaccination Infants and Children Primary vaccination consists of >3 intramuscular doses of hepatitis B vaccine (Table 2). Vaccine schedules for infantsand children (Tables 3-5) are determined on the basis of immunogenicity data and the need to integrate hepatitis B vaccine into a harmonized childhood vaccination schedule.Although not all possible schedules for each product have been evaluated in clinical trials, available licensed formulations for both single-antigen vaccines produce high (>95%) levels ofseroprotection among infants and children when administered in multiple schedules ( 87-91 ). The immunogenicity of the combined hepatitis B-Hib jugate vaccine (Comvax) and the combined hepatitis B-DTaP- IPV vaccine (Pediarix) is equivalent to that of their individual antigens administered separately. However, these vaccines can-not be administered to infants aged <6 weeks; only single- antigen hepatitis B vaccine may be used for the birth dose. Use of 4-dose hepatitis B vaccine schedules, including sched-ules with a birth dose, has not increased vaccine reactogenicity (92,93 ). Anti-HBs responses after a 3-dose series of hepatitis B-containing combination vaccines among infants who werepreviously vaccinated at birth with single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine are comparable to those observed after a 3-dose series of combination vaccine without a birth dose ( 93).8 MMWR December 23, 2005 Birth Dose Hepatitis B vaccine can be administered soon after birth with only minimal decrease in immunogenicity, compared with administration at older ages, and no decrease in protective efficacy ( 87). Administration of a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine is required for effective postexposure immuno- prophylaxis to prevent perinatal HBV infection. Although infants who require postexposure immunoprophylaxis should be identified by maternal HBsAg testing, administering a birthdose to infants even without HBIG serves as a \"safety net\" to prevent perinatal infection among infants born to HBsAg- positive mothers who are not identified because of errors inmaternal HBsAg testing or failures in reporting of test results (13). The birth dose also provides early protection to infants at risk for infection after the perinatal period. Administration of a birth dose has been associated with higher rates of on-time completion of the hepatitis B vaccine series ( 15,94 ). In certain populations, the birth dose has been associated with improved completion rates for all other infant vaccines ( 95), although findings have not been consistent ( 15,94 ). Adolescents Recommended vaccination schedules for adolescents bal- ance available immunogenicity data with the need to achievecompliance with vaccination in this age group (Tables 2 and5). Both licensed single-antigen hepatitis B vaccines adminis- tered intramuscularly at 0, 1, and 6 months produce a >95%sero-protection rate in adolescents. Equivalent seroprotection rates are achieved among adolescents vaccinated at 0, 1-2, and 4 months and 0, 12, and 24 months. The adult (10 \u00b5g) dose of Recombivax-HB administered in a 2-dose schedule to children and adolescents aged 11-15 years at 0 and 4-6 monthsproduces antibody levels equivalent to those obtained with the 5- \u00b5g dose administered on a 3-dose schedule ( 96,97 ). However, no data on long-term antibody persistence or pro- tection are available for 2-dose schedules. No combination vaccines containing hepatitis B vaccine antigen are approved for use in adolescents aged 11-17 years. Nonstandard Vaccine Schedules No apparent effect on immunogenicity has been documented when minimum spacing of doses is not achieved precisely. Increasing the interval between the first 2 doses has little effect on immunogenicity or final antibody concentration ( 98-100 ). The third dose confers the maximum level of seroprotection but acts primarily as a booster and appears to provide optimal long-term protection ( 101). Longer intervals between the last 2 doses result in higher final antibody levels but might increase the risk for acquisition of HBV infection among persons who have a delayed response to vaccination. No differences in immunogenicity have been observed when 1 or 2 doses of hepa-titis B vaccine produced by one manufacturer are followed by doses from a different manufacturer ( 102).TABLE 2.

No data suggest that children who have no detectableantibody after 6 doses of vaccine would benefit fromadditional doses. Groups Requiring Different Vaccination Doses or Schedules Preterm infants. Preterm infants weighing <2,000 g at birth have a decreased response to hepatitis B vaccineadministered before age 1 month ( 104-106 ). By age 1 month, medically stable preterm infants, regardless of initial birth weight or gestational age, have a response to vaccination that is comparable to that of full-terminfants ( 107-110 ). Hemodialysis patients and other immunoco- mpromised persons. Although data concerning the response of pediatric hemodialysis patients to vaccina- tion with standard pediatric doses are lacking, protec- tive levels of antibody occur in 75%-97% of those whoreceive higher dosages (20- \u00b5g) on either 3- or 111-114 ). Humoral response to hepa- titis B vaccination is also reduced in other children andadolescents who are immunocompromised (e.g., hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, patients undergoing chemotherapy, and HIV-infected persons)(115-119 ). Modified dosing regimens, including a dou- bling of the standard antigen dose or administration ofadditional doses, might increase response rates ( 120). However, data on response to these alternative vaccina- tion schedules are limited ( 121). Immune Memory Anti-HBs is the only easily measurable correlate of vac- cine-induced protection. Immunocompetent persons who achieve anti-HBs after preexposure vaccination have virtually complete protec- tion against both acute disease and chronic infection even if anti H Bs concent rations subsequently decline to <10 mIU/mL ( 122-125 ). immunogenicity is lower among immunocompromised persons, those who achieveand maintain a protective antibody response beforeexposure to HBV have a high level of protection from infection. After primary immunization with hepatitis B vaccine, anti-HBs concentrations decline rapidly within the firstTABLE 3.

On a case-by-case basis and only in rare circumstances, the first dose may be delayed until after hospital discharge for an infant who weighs >2,000 g and whose mother is HBsAg negative, but only if a physician's order to withhold thebirth dose and a copy of the mother's original HBsAg-negative laboratory reportare documented in the infant's medical record.

Among children who respond to a primary vaccine series with antibody levels >10 mIU/mL, 15%-50% have low or undetectable concentrations 5-15 years ( 126-130 ). The persistence of detectable anti-HBs after vaccination, in the absence of exposure to HBV, depends on the level of post-vaccination antibody concentration. Despite declines in anti-HBs to <10 mIU/mL, nearly all vaccinated persons are still protected against HBV infection.The mechanism for continued vaccine-induced protection is thought to be the preservation of immune memory through selective expansion and differentiation of clones of antigen-specific B and T lymphocytes ( 131). Persistence of vaccine- induced immune memory among persons who responded to a primary childhood vaccine series 13-23 years earlier butthen had levels of anti-HBs below 10 mIU/mL has been dem- onstrated by an anamnestic increase in anti-HBs levels in 67%- 76% of these persons 2-4 weeks after administration of anadditional vaccine dose ( 132,133 ). Although direct measure- ment of immune memory is not yet possible, these data indi- cate that a high proportion of vaccine recipients retain immunememory and would develop an anti-HBs response upon ex- posure to HBV. Studies of cohorts of immunocompetent persons vaccinated as children or infants also indicate that, despite anti-HBs loss years after immunization, nearly all vaccinated persons whorespond to a primary series remain protected from HBV infection. No clinical cases of hepatitis B have been observed in follow-up studies conducted 15-20 years after vaccination among immunocompetent vaccinated persons with antibodylevels >10 mIU/mL. Certain studies have documented break- through infections (detected by the presence of anti-HBc or HBV DNA) in a limited percentage of vaccinated persons(130,131 ), but these infections are usually transient and asymptomatic; chronic infections have been documented only rarely ( 134). Breakthrough infections resulting in chronic infection have been observed only among vaccinated infants born to HBsAg-positive women. Limited data are available on the duration of immune memory after hepatitis B vaccination in immunocompromised persons (e.g., HIV-infected patients, dialysis patients, patients undergoing chemotherapy, or hematopoietic stem cell trans-plant patients). No clinically important HBV infections have been documented among immunocompromised persons who maintain protective levels of anti-HBs. In studies of long-termprotection among HIV-infected persons, breakthrough infec- tions occurring after a decline in anti-HBs concentrations to <10 mIU/mL have been transient and asymptomatic ( 135). However, among hemodialysis patients who respond to the vaccine, clinically significant HBV infection has been docu- mented in persons who have with HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine and active PEP with hepatitisB vaccine alone have been demonstrated to be highly effective in preventing transmission after exposure to HBV ( 137-140 ). HBIG alone has also effective inpreventing HBV transmission ( 141-144 ), but with the avail- ability of hepatitis B vaccine, HBIG typically is used as an adjunct to vaccination. The major determinant of the effectiveness of PEP is early administration of the initial dose of vaccine. The effectiveness of PEP diminishes the longer it is initiated after exposure(17,145,146 ). Studies are limited on the maximum interval after exposure during which PEP is effective, but the interval is unlikely to exceed 7 days for perinatal ( 147) and needlestick (140-142 ) exposures and 14 days for sexual exposures ( 122, 138,139,143,144 ). No data are available on the efficacy of HBsAg-containing combination vaccines when used to complete the vaccine series for PEP , but the efficacy of combination vaccines is expected to be similar to that of single-antigen vaccines because the HBsAgcomponent induces a comparable anti-HBs response.TABLE 5.

Twinrix may be administered to persons aged >18 years at 0, 1, and 6 months.Vol. 54 / RR-16 Recommendations and Reports 11 Perinatal HBV Exposure Passive-active PEP . PEP with hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG administered 12-24 hours after birth, followed by comple- tion of a 3-dose vaccine series, has been demonstrated to be85%-95% effective in preventing acute and chronic HBV infection in infants born to women who are positive for both HBsAg and HBeAg ( 137). Although clinical trials have evalu- ated the efficacy of passive-active PEP with hepatitis B vac- cine and HBIG administered only within 24 hours of birth, studies of passive immunoprophylaxis have demonstrated thatHBIG provided protection when administered as late as 72 hours after exposure. The majority of clinical trials have evalu- ated the efficacy of passive-active PEP when the second vac-cine dose was administered at age 1 month ( 137). Administration of HBIG plus vaccine at birth, 1 month, and 6 months and at birth, 2 months, and 6 months has demon-strated comparable efficacy in prevention of acute and chronic infection among infants born to women who were both HBsAg and HBeAg positive (Cladd E. Stevens, MD, New York BloodCenter, personal communication, 1994). Infants born to HBsAg-positive/HBeAg-negative mothers who receive passive-active PEP with HBIG and hepatitis Bvaccine should have the same high degree of protection as infants born to women who are HBsAg positive/HBeAg posi- tive. However, the efficacy of this regimen has not been exam-ined in controlled clinical trials because the low infection rate would require an unattainable sample size. Active PEP . Active PEP with hepatitis B vaccine alone (i.e., without HBIG) is frequently used in certain remote areas (e.g., Alaska and the Pacific Islands) where implementation of maternal HBsAg testing is difficult because no access exists toa laboratory. In randomized, placebo-controlled clinical tri- als, administration of hepatitis B vaccine in a 3- or 4-dose schedule without HBIG beginning <12 hours after birth has been demonstrated to prevent 70%-95% of perinatal HBV infections among infants born to women who are positive for both HBsAg and HBeAg ( 58,148-152 ). Population-based studies in areas with a high endemicity of HBV infection have demonstrated that active postexposure vaccination is highly effective in preventing infection when the first dose is admin-istered soon after birth, the second at age 1-2 months, and the third at age 6-8 months ( 153-155 ). Vaccine Safety Hepatitis B vaccines have been demonstrated to be safe when administered to infants, children, adolescents, and adults. Since 1982, an estimated >60 million adolescents and adults and>40 million infants and children have been vaccinated in the United States. Vaccine Reactogenicity The most frequently reported side effects among persons receiving hepatitis B vaccine are pain at the injection site(3%-29%) and fever >99.9\u00b0 F (>37.7\u00b0 C) (1%-6%) (156,157 ). However, in placebo-controlled studies, these side effects were reported no more frequently among personsreceiving hepatitis B vaccine than among persons receiving placebo ( 87). Administration of hepatitis B vaccine soon after birth has not been associated with an increased rate of elevatedtemperatures or microbiologic evaluations for possible sepsis in the first 21 days of life ( 158). Adverse Events A causal association has been established between receipt of hepatitis B vaccine and anaphylaxis ( 159). On the basis of data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) project, the estimated incidence of anaphylaxis among children and ado-lescents who received hepatitis B vaccine is one case per 1.1 million vaccine doses distributed (95% confidence interval = 0.1-3.9) ( 160). Early postlicensure surveillance of adverse events suggested a possible association between Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and receipt of the first dose of plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccineamong U.S. adults ( 161). However, in a subsequent analysis of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome cases reported to CDC, FDA, and vaccine manufacturers, among an estimated 2.5 million adultswho received >1 dose of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine dur- ing 1986-1990, the rate of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome occurring after hepatitis B vaccination did not exceed the back-ground rate among unvaccinated persons (CDC, unpublished data, 1992). A review by persons with clinical expertise con- cluded that evidence was insufficient to reject or accept a causalassociation between Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and hepatitis B vaccination ( 159,162 ). Multiple sclerosis (MS) has not been reported after hepati- tis B vaccination among children. However, one retrospective case-control study ( 163,164 ) reported an association between hepatitis B vaccine and MS among adults. Multiple other stud-ies (165-168 ) have demonstrated no association between hepa- titis B vaccine and MS. Reviews of these data by panels of persons with clinical expertise have favored rejection of a causalassociation between hepatitis B vaccination and MS ( 169,170 ). Chronic illnesses that have been reported in rare instances after hepatitis B vaccination include chronic fatigue syndrome(171), neurologic disorders (e.g., leukoencephalitis, optic diabetes ( 177), and autoimmune disease (178). No evidence of a causal association between these con- ditions or other chronic illnesses and hepatitis B vaccine hasbeen demonstrated ( 159,169,170,179-182 ). Reported episodes of alopecia (hair loss) after rechallenge with hepatitis B vaccine suggest that vaccination might, inrare cases, trigger episodes of alopecia ( 183). However, a popu- lation-based study determined no statistically significant association between alopecia and hepatitis B vaccine ( 184). No evidence exists of a causal association between hepatitis B vaccination, including administration of the birth dose, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or other causes of deathduring the first year of life ( 185-187 ). Infant death rates, including rates of SIDS, declined substantially in the United States during the 1990s, coincident with an increase in infanthepatitis B vaccination coverage from <1% to >90% and implementation of efforts to reduce SIDS through infant sleep positioning and separation from other persons in bed ( 188). The safety of hepatitis B vaccine and other vaccines is assessed continuously through ongoing monitoring of data from VSD, the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS),and other surveillance systems. Any adverse events after vaccina- tion should be reported to VAERS; report forms and assistance are available from CDC at telephone 1-800-822-7967 or athttp://www.vaers.hhs.gov. Contraindications and Precautions Hepatitis B vaccination is contraindicated for persons with a history of hypersensitivity to yeast or to any vaccine compo-nent ( 92,189-191 ). Despite a theoretic risk for allergic reac- tion to vaccination in persons with allergy to Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast), no evidence exists that documents adverse reactions after vaccination of persons with a history of yeast allergy. Persons with a history of serious adverse events (e.g., ana- phylaxis) after receipt of hepatitis B vaccine should not receive additional doses. As with other vaccines, vaccination of persons with moderate or severe acute illness, with or with-out fever, should be deferred until the illness resolves ( 192). Vaccination is not contraindicated in persons with a history of MS, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, autoimmune disease (e.g.,systemic lupus erythematosis or rheumatoid arthritis), or other chronic diseases. Pregnancy is not a contraindication to vaccination. Limited data indicate no apparent risk for adverse events to develop- ing fetuses when hepatitis B vaccine is administered to preg- nant women ( 193). Current vaccines contain noninfectious HBsAg and should cause no risk to the fetus.Future Considerations Implementation of the recommendations and strategies in this document should ultimately lead to the elimination of HBV transmission in the United States. New information willhave implications for this effort, and adjustments and changes are expected to occur. Long-Term Protection and Booster Doses Studies are needed to assess long-term protection after vacci- nation and the possible need for booster doses of vaccine. The longest follow-up studies of vaccine protection have been con- ducted in populations with an initially high endemicity of HBVinfection (i.e., >8% prevalence of chronic infection) ( 130). Implementation of hepatitis B vaccination programs in popu- lations with a high endemicity of HBV infection has resulted invirtual elimination of new HBV infections by providing vac- cine-induced immunity to susceptible persons. In these popu- lations, ongoing exposure of vaccinated persons to persons withchronic HBV infection might complicate future efforts to as- sess long-term hepatitis B vaccine efficacy. Assessment of effi- cacy provided by hepatitis B immunization after 15-20 yearswill require studies among populations that continue to have exposures to HBsAg-positive persons (e.g., communities of im- migrants from highly endemic countries, populations ofinjection-drug users, or health-care workers) and studies among populations with a low prevalence of infection. Immunization Escape Mutants Mutations in the S gene of HBV can lead to conforma- tional changes in the a determinant of the HBsAg protein, which is the major target for neutralizing anti-HBs. These variants have been detected in humans infected with HBV,and concern has been expressed that these variants might rep- licate in the presence in HBIG ( 194,195 ). Although no evidence suggests that S gene immunization escape mutants pose a threat to existing programs using hepatitis B vaccines ( 196), further studies and enhanced surveillance to detect the emergence ofthese variants are high priorities for monitoring the effective- ness of current vaccination strategies. Recommendations for Hepatitis B Vaccination of Infants, Children, and Adolescents This section outlines updated ACIP recommendations and associated implementation strategies for hepatitis B vaccina-Vol. 54 / RR-16 Recommendations and Reports 13 tion of infants, children, and adolescents. These recommen- dations have been summarized (Box 3). Prevention of Perinatal HBV Infection and Management of Pregnant Women Recommendations Prenatal HBsAg Testing \u007f All pregnant women should be tested routinely for HBsAg during an early prenatal visit (e.g., first trimester) in each preg- nancy, even if they have been previously vaccinated or tested. \u007f Women who were not screened prenatally, those who engage in behaviors that put them at high risk for infec-tion (e.g., injection-drug use, having had more than one sex partner in the previous 6 months or an HBsAg-posi- tive sex partner, evaluation or treatment for a sexually transmitted disease [STD], or recent or current injection-drug use) and those with clinical hepatitis should be tested at the time of admission to the hospital for delivery. \u007f All laboratories that provide HBsAg testing of pregnant women should use an FDA-licensed or -approved HBsAg test and should perform testing according to the manufacturer's labeling, including testing of initially reac-tive specimens with a licensed neutralizing confirmatory test. When pregnant women are tested for HBsAg at the time of admission for delivery, shortened testing protocolsmay be used and initially reactive results reported to expe- dite administration of immunoprophylaxis to infants. \u007f Women who are HBsAg positive should be referred to an appropriate case-management program to ensure that their infants receive timely postexposure prophylaxis and follow- up (see Case-Management Programs to Prevent PerinatalHBV Infection). In addition, a copy of the original labo- ratory report indicating the pregnant woman's HBsAg sta- tus should be provided to the hospital where delivery isplanned and to the health-care provider who will care for the newborn. \u007f Women who are HBsAg positive should be provided with or referred for appropriate counseling and medical man- agement (Appendix A). HBsAg-positive pregnant women should receive information concerning hepatitis B thatdiscusses \u2014 modes of transmission; \u2014 perinatal concerns (e.g., infants born to HBsAg- positive mothers may be breast fed); \u2014 prevention of HBV transmission to contacts, includ- ing the importance of postexposure prophylaxis forthe newborn infant and hepatitis B vaccination for household, sexual, and needle-sharing contacts; \u2014 substance abuse treatment, if appropriate; and\u2014 medical evaluation and possible treatment of chronic hepatitis B. \u007f When HBsAg testing of pregnant women is not feasible (i.e., in remote areas without access to a laboratory), all infants should receive hepatitis B vaccine <12 hours of birth and should complete the hepatitis B vaccineseries according to a recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers (Tables 2 and 3). Management of Infants Born to Women Who Are HBsAg Positive \u007f All infants born to HBsAg-positive women should receive single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine (Table 2) and HBIGBOX 3. Summary of hepatitis B vaccination recommendations for infants, children, and adolescents Maternal hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) testing \u007f All pregnant women should be tested routinely for HBsAg. Vaccination of infants At birth \u007f Infants born to mothers who are HBsAg positive should receive hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) <12 hours of birth. \u007f Infants born to mothers whose HBsAg status is unknown should receive hepatitis B vaccine <12 hours of birth. The mother should have blood drawn as soon as pos-sible to determine her HBsAg status; if she is HBsAgpositive, the infant should receive HBIG as soon as pos- sible (no later than age 1 week). \u007f Full-term infants who are medically stable and weigh >2,000 g born to HBsAg-negative mothers should re-ceive single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine before hospitaldischarge. \u007f Preterm infants weighing <2,000 g born to HBsAg- negative mothers should receive the first dose of vaccine 1 month after birth or at hospital discharge. After the birth dose\u007f All infants should complete the hepatitis B vaccine series with either single-antigen vaccine or combination vaccine, according to a recommended vaccination sched- ule (see Tables 3 and 4). \u007f Infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers should be tested for HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg after completion ofthe hepatitis B vaccine series at age 9-18 months. Vaccination of children and adolescents \u007f All unvaccinated children and adolescents aged <19 years should receive the hepatitis B vaccine series.14 MMWR December 23, 2005 (0.5 mL) <12 hours of birth, administered at different injection sites. The vaccine series should be completed according to a recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers (Table 3). The final dose in thevaccine series should not be administered before age 24 weeks (164 days). \u007f For preterm infants weighing <2,000 g, the initial vac- cine dose (birth dose) should not be counted as part of the vaccine series because of the potentially reduced immunogenicity of hepatitis B vaccine in these infants; 3additional doses of vaccine (for a total of 4 doses) should be administered beginning when the infant reaches age 1 month (Tables 3 and 4). \u007f Postvaccination testing for anti-HBs and HBsAg should be performed after completion of the vaccine series, at age 9-18 months (generally at the next well-child visit).Testing should not be performed before age 9 months to avoid detection of anti-HBs from HBIG administered during infancy and to maximize the likelihood of detect-ing late HBV infection. Anti-HBc testing of infants is not recommended because passively acquired maternal anti-HBc might be detected in infants born to HBV-infected mothers to age 24 months. \u2014 HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs levels >10 mIU/mL are protected and need no further medical manage-ment. \u2014 HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs levels <10 mIU/mL revaccinated with a second 3-dose series andretested 1-2 months after the final dose of vaccine. \u2014 Infants who are HBsAg positive should receive appro- priate follow-up (Appendix A). \u007f Infants of HBsAg-positive mothers may be breast fed beginning immediately after birth. \u007f Although not indicated in the manufacturer's package labeling, HBsAg-containing combination vaccines may be used for infants aged >6 weeks born to HBsAg- positive mothers to complete the vaccine series afterreceipt of a birth dose of single-antigen hepatitis B vac- cine and HBIG. Management of Infants Born to Women with Unknown HBsAg Status \u007f Women admitted for delivery without documentation of HBsAg test results should have blood drawn and tested assoon as possible after admission. \u007f While test results are pending, all infants born to women without documentation of HBsAg test results shouldreceive the first dose of single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine (without HBIG) <12 hours of birth (Tables 2 and 3).\u2014 If the mother is determined to be HBsAg positive, her infant should receive HBIG as soon as possible but no later than age 7 days, and the vaccine series should be completed according to a recommended schedule forinfants born to HBsAg-positive mothers (Table 3). \u2014 If the mother is determined to be HBsAg negative, the vaccine series should be completed according to arecommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg- negative mothers (Table 3). \u2014 If the mother has never been tested to determine her HBsAg status, the vaccine series should be completed according to a recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers (Table 3). Administrationof HBIG is not necessary for these infants. \u007f Because of the potentially decreased immunogenicity of vaccine in preterm infants weighing <2,000 g, theseinfants should receive both single-antigen hepatitis B vac- cine and HBIG (0.5 mL) if the mother's HBsAg status cannot be determined <12 hours of birth. The birth dose of vaccine should not be counted as part of the 3 doses required to complete the vaccine series; 3 additional doses of vaccine (for a total of 4 doses) should be administeredaccording to a recommended schedule on the basis of the mother's HBsAg test result (Table 3). Vaccination of Pregnant Women \u007f Pregnant women who are identified as being at risk for HBV infection during pregnancy (e.g., having more than one sex partner during the previous 6 months, been evalu-ated or treated for an STD, recent or current injection- drug use, or having had an HBsAg-positive sex partner) should be vaccinated. \u007f Pregnant women at risk for HBV infection during preg- nancy should be counseled concerning other methods to prevent HBV infection. Implementation Delivery Hospital Policies and Procedures \u007f All delivery hospitals should implement policies and pro- cedures (Box 4) to ensure 1) identification of infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers and infants born to mothers with unknown HBsAg status (see Prenatal HBsAg Test-ing), and 2) initiation of immunization for these infants). Such policies and procedures should include the follow- ing standing orders:\u2014 for all pregnant women, review of HBsAg test results at the time of admission for delivery; \u2014 for women who do not have a documented HBsAg test result, HBsAg testing as soon as possible after admission for delivery;Vol. 54 / RR-16 Recommendations and Reports 15 \u2014 identification and management of all infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers; \u2014 identification and management of all infants born to mothers with unknown HBsAg status; and \u2014 for all infants, documentation on the infant's medical record of maternal HBsAg test results, infant hepatitis B vaccine administration, and administration of HBIG(if appropriate). \u007f Delivery hospitals should enroll in the federally funded Vaccines for Children (VFC) program to obtain free hepa-titis B vaccine for administration of the birth dose to new- borns who are eligible (i.e., Medicaid eligible, American Indian or Alaska Native, underinsured, or uninsured). Case-Management Programs to Prevent Perinatal HBV Infection \u007f States and localities should establish case-management programs (Box 5), including appropriate policies, proce- dures, laws, and regulations, to ensure that \u2014 all pregnant women are tested for HBsAg during each pregnancy, and \u2014 infants born to HBsAg-positive women and infants born to women with unknown HBsAg status receiverecommended case management. \u007f The location of these programs and the methods by which they operate will depend on multiple factors (e.g., popu-lation density and annual caseload of HBsAg-positive women). Programs may be located in state or local health departments, private health-care systems (e.g., healthmaintenance organizations), or institutions (e.g., correc- tional facility systems). Program administrators will need to work with prenatal care providers, delivery hospital staff,pediatric care providers, private health-care systems, and health departments. Universal Vaccination of Infants Recommendations \u007f All infants should receive the hepatitis B vaccine series as part of the recommended childhood immunization sched- ule (Table 5 and Appendix B). (For recommendations onmanagement of infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers and infants born to mothers with unknown HBsAg sta- tus, see Prevention of Perinatal HBV Infection and Man-agement of Pregnant Women.) \u007f For all medically stable infants weighing >2,000 g at birth and born to HBsAg-negative mothers, the first dose ofvaccine should be administered before hospital discharge. Only single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine should be used for the birth dose.BOX 4. Delivery hospital policies and procedures to prevent perinatal HBV transmission At time of admission for delivery \u007f Review hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) status of all pregnant women. \u007f Record maternal HBsAg test results on both labor and delivery record and on infant's delivery summary sheet. \u007f Perform HBsAg testing as soon as possible on women who \u2014 do not have a documented HBsAg test result, \u2014 were at risk for HBV infection during pregnancy (e.g., more than one sex partner in the previous 6months, evaluation or treatment for a sexually trans-mitted disease, recent or current injection-drug use,or HBsAg-positive sex partner), or \u2014 had clinical hepatitis since previous testing. After delivery HBsAg-positive mothers and their infants \u007f Administer single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine and hepa- titis B immune globulin (HBIG) to all infants born toHBsAg-positive mothers <12 hours after birth and record date and time of administration of HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine in infant's medical record. \u007f Provide information regarding hepatitis B to HBsAg- positive mothers, including \u2014 advice that they may breast feed their infants upon delivery; \u2014 modes of HBV transmission;\u2014 need for vaccination of their susceptible household, sexual, and needle-sharing contacts; \u2014 need for substance abuse treatment, if appropriate; and\u2014 need for medical management and possible treat- ment for chronic hepatitis B. Mothers with unknown HBsAg status and their infants\u007f Administer single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine (without HBIG) to all infants born to mothers with unknown HBsAgstatus <12 hours after birth and record date and time of administration of hepatitis B vaccine on infant's medical record. \u007f Alert infant's pediatric health-care provider if an infant is discharged before the mother's HBsAg test result is available; if the mother is determined to be HBsAg posi- tive, HBIG should be administered to the infant as soonas possible, but no later than age 7 days. All mothers and their infants \u007f Administer a dose of single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine to all infants weighing >2,000 g. \u007f Ensure that all mothers have been tested for HBsAg prenatally or at the time of admission for delivery anddocument test results. At time infant is discharged \u007f Provide infant's immunization record to mother and remind her to take it to the infant's first visit to pediat-ric health-care provider.16 MMWR December 23, 2005 BOX 5. Components of case-management programs to prevent perinatal hepatitis B virus infection Identify and manage infants born to mothers without HBsAg test results \u007f Delivery hospitals should implement policies and pro- cedures to ensure identification and initiation ofpostexposure immunization of infants born to mothers with unknown HBsAg status at delivery (see Delivery Hospital Policies and Procedures). \u007f Delivery hospitals should document the date and time of birth, date and time of administration of hepatitis Bvaccine, and maternal HBsAg test results for all infantsborn to mothers with unknown HBsAg status at the time of delivery. Complete the hepatitis B vaccine series \u007f Practitioners should document the dates of administra- tion of all doses of the hepatitis B vaccine series for allinfants born to HBsAg-positive mothers. Complete postvaccination testing \u007f Health-care providers should document the results of test- ing for HBsAg and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen(anti-HBs) after completion of the hepatitis B vaccineseries for all infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers. Monitor and evaluate the case management program \u007f Annually, each program should track \u2014 the number of HBsAg-positive pregnant women; \u2014 the proportion of infants born to HBsAg-positive women receiving postexposure prophylaxis <12 hours of birth, third vaccine dose by age 6 months,and postvaccination serologic testing for HBsAg andanti-HBs; \u2014 the number of delivering women with unknown HBsAg status; and \u2014 the proportion of infants born to mothers with unknown HBsAg status receiving hepatitis B vac-cine within 12 hours of birth. \u007f Programs should determine reasons for \u2014 >10% difference between expected and identified number of HBsAg-positive pregnant women; \u2014 <90% completion rates for HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine <12 hours of birth, third dose by age 6 months, and postvaccination testing for infants bornto HBsAg-positive mothers; and \u2014 <90% completion rates for hepatitis B vaccine <12 hours of birth for infants born to mothers withunknown HBsAg status.Test all pregnant women for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) \u007f Health-care providers should test all pregnant women for HBsAg during each pregnancy. \u007f HBsAg testing should be incorporated into standard prenatal testing panels (e.g., blood type, human immuno- deficiency virus) infection, Rh factor, rubella antibodytiter, and syphilis infection) used by all health-careproviders caring for pregnant women. \u007f Delivery hospitals should ensure that all pregnant or delivering women have been tested for HBsAg before hospital discharge. \u007f Reporting of HBsAg test status should be included on hospital-based electronic birth certificates or neonatalmetabolic screening requests. Report and track HBsAg-positive women \u007f All HBsAg-positive pregnant women and all women of childbearing age with HBsAg-positive laboratory resultsshould be reported to state or local perinatal hepatitis Bprevention programs. \u007f All HBsAg-positive pregnant women should be entered into case-management tracking systems. Provide prenatal HBsAg testing records to delivery hospitals \u007f HBsAg test results should be included on all forms (hard copy, electronic) used by practitioners to record andtransmit information regarding care during pregnancy. \u007f For all pregnant women, a copy of the original labora- tory report of HBsAg test results should be transferredfrom the prenatal care provider to the delivery hospital. \u007f Practitioners should document that HBsAg-positive pregnant women have a copy of the original laboratoryreport, that a copy of the original laboartory report is transferred from the prenatal care provider to the deliv- ery hospital, and that patients are informed of theirHBsAg test status and advised to notify delivery staff. Identify and manage infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers \u007f Delivery hospitals should implement policies and pro- cedures to ensure identification and initiation ofpostexposure immunization of infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers (see Delivery Hospital Policies and Pro-cedures). \u007f Delivery hospitals should document the date and time of birth and the date and time of administration of hepa-titis B immune globulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vac-cine for all infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers.Vol. 54 / RR-16 Recommendations and Reports 17 \u007f On a case-by-case basis and only in rare circumstances, the first dose may be delayed until after hospital discharge for an infant who weighs >2,000 g and whose mother is HBsAg negative.\u2014 When such a decision is made, a physician's order to withhold the birth dose and a copy of the original labo- ratory report indicating that the mother was HBsAgnegative during this pregnancy should be placed in the infant's medical record. \u2014 For infants who do not receive a first dose before hos- pital discharge, the first dose should be administered no later than age 2 months. \u2014 Situations in which the birth dose should not be delayed include any high-risk sexual or drug-using practices of the infant's mother during pregnancy (e.g., having had more than one sex partner during the pre-vious 6 months or an HBsAg-positive sex partner, evaluation or treatment for an STD, or recent or cur- rent injection-drug use) and expected poor compli-ance with follow-up to initiate the vaccine series. \u007f Preterm infants weighing <2,000 g and born to HBsAg- negative mothers should have their first vaccine dosedelayed until 1 month after birth or hospital discharge (Table 4). For these infants, a copy of the original labora- tory report indicating that the mother was HBsAg nega-tive during this pregnancy should be placed in the infant's medical record. \u007f The vaccine series should be completed according to a recommended schedule with either single-antigen vaccine or a combination vaccine that contains the hepatitis B vaccine antigen (e.g., Hib-hepatitis B or DTaP-IPV-hepatitis B) (Table 2). The final dose in the vaccine series should not be administered before age 24 weeks (164 days). \u007f Administration of 4 doses of hepatitis B vaccine to infants is permissible in certain situations (e.g., when com- bination vaccines are administered after the birth dose). \u007f In populations with currently or previously high rates of childhood HBV infection (i.e., Alaska Natives; Pacific Islanders; and immigrant families from Asia, Africa, and other regions with intermediate or high endemic rates ofinfection [Figure 1 and Box 2]), the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine should be administered at birth and the final dose at age 6-12 months. Implementation \u007f All delivery hospitals should implement standing orders for administration of hepatitis B vaccination as part ofroutine medical care of all medically stable infants weigh- ing >2,000 g at birth (Box 4).\u007f All delivery hospitals should implement policies and pro- cedures for management of infants weighing <2,000 g at birth, including the following: \u2014 ensuring initiation of postexposure immunization of infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers and infants born to mothers not screened for HBsAg prenatally (see Prevention of Perinatal HBV Infection and Man-agement of Pregnant Women), and \u2014 documentation of maternal HBsAg test results on the infant's medical record. \u007f Prenatal care education should include information regarding the rationale for and importance of newborn hepatitis B vaccination. \u007f States are encouraged to adopt regulations or laws that require hepatitis B vaccination for entry into child care and also for entry into kindergarten and/or elementaryschool to ensure high vaccine coverage among infants and children. Vaccination of Children and Adolescents Who Were Not Previously Vaccinated Recommendations \u007f Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all children and adolescents aged <19 years. \u007f Children and adolescents who have not previously received hepatitis B vaccine should be vaccinated routinely at any age with an appropriate dose and schedule (Tables 2 and 5). Selection of a vaccine schedule should consider theneed to achieve completion of the vaccine series. In all settings, vaccination should be initiated even though completion of the vaccine series might not be ensured. Implementation \u007f To ensure high vaccination coverage among children and adolescents, the following measures are recommended:\u2014 All children aged 11-12 years should have a review of their immunization records and should complete the vaccine series if they were not previously vaccinated orwere incompletely vaccinated. \u2014 All children and adolescents aged <19 years (includ- ing internationally adopted children) who were bornin Asia, the Pacific Islands, Africa, or other intermedi- ate- or high-endemic countries (Figure 1 and Box 2) or who have at least one parent who was born in oneof these areas should have a review of their immuniza- tion records and should complete the vaccine series if they were not previously vaccinated or were incom-pletely vaccinated.18 MMWR December 23, 2005 \u2014 States are encouraged to adopt regulations or laws that require hepatitis B vaccination before entry into middle school or its equivalent. \u2014 Vaccination requirements should be considered for older high school students and for students before col- lege entry, when feasible. \u2014 States are encouraged to expand or implement immu- nization registries to include adolescents. \u2014 Hepatitis B vaccine should be offered to all unvacci- nated adolescents in settings that provide health-careservices to this age group (Box 6), particularly those who engage in behaviors that place them at high risk for HBV infection.

Retesting of persons who were tested for HBsAg in other coun-tries should be considered. \u007f Other persons who should be tested for HBsAg as part of vaccination services include\u2014 all pregnant women (See Prevention of Perinatal HBV Infection and Management of Pregnant Women), \u2014 persons who receive prevaccination testing for suscep- tibility and who test positive for anti-HBc (See Pre- vaccination Testing for Susceptibility), \u2014 hemodialysis patients, and\u2014 nonresponders to vaccination (See Appendix B, Post- vaccination Testing for Serologic Response). Management of Persons Identified as HBsAg Positive \u007f All persons with HBsAg-positive laboratory results should be reported to the state or local health department. \u007f To verify the presence of chronic HBV infection, HBsAg- positive persons should be retested. The absence of immu-Chronically infected persons are at high risk for chronic liver disease and are a major reservoir of hepatitis B virus (HBV)infection. Foreign-born persons, especially persons from Af- rica, Asia, and the Pacific Islands, have high* rates of chronic HBV infection. During delivery of recommended hepatitis Bvaccination services (e.g., HBsAg screening of pregnant women and serologic testing to assess susceptibility), vaccination pro- viders will identify persons who are HBsAg positive. Thesepersons require counseling and medical management for chronic HBV infection to reduce their risk for chronic liver disease. Their susceptible household, sexual, and needle-shar-ing contacts also need to be vaccinated against hepatitis B. Few programs have been implemented to identify HBsAg- positive persons, provide or refer these persons for appropri-ate medical management, and provide vaccination to their contacts ( 1). Extending these services to persons identified as HBsAg positive will help prevent serious sequelae in chroni-cally infected persons and enhance vaccination strategies for elimination of HBV transmission. This Appendix addresses case finding and management of persons with chronic HBVinfection in the context of vaccine delivery. The recommen- dations are not intended to represent a comprehensive pre- vention program for chronically infected persons. Case Finding in the Context of Vaccination Service Delivery \u007f All foreign-born persons (including immigrants, refugees, asylum seekers, and internationally adopted children) born in Asia, the Pacific Islands, Africa, and other regions withhigh endemicity of HBV infection (Box A-1) should be tested for HBsAg, regardless of vaccination status. \u2014 For all persons born in high-endemic countries who are applying for permanent U.S. residence, HBsAg screening and appropriate follow-up on the basis of HBsAg test results should be included as part of therequired overseas premigration and domestic adjust- ment-of-visa status medical examination process ( 2). HBsAg-positive persons should be considered eligiblefor migration and adjustment-of-visa status and coun- seled and recommended for follow-up medical evalu- ation and management in U.S. resettlementcommunities.BOX A-1.

Certain patients with chronic hepatitis B will benefit from early intervention with antiviral treatment or screening to detect hepatocel-lular carcinoma at an early stage. \u007f Household, sexual, and needle-sharing contacts of chroni- cally infected persons should be identified. Unvaccinatedsex partners and household and needle-sharing contacts should be tested for susceptibility to HBV infection (see Prevaccination Serologic Testing for Susceptibility) andshould receive the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine imme- diately after collection of the blood sample for serologic testing. Susceptible persons should complete the vaccineseries using an age-appropriate vaccine dose and schedule (see Tables 2 and 6) Persons who are not fully vaccinated should complete the vaccine series. \u007f Sex partners of HBsAg-positive persons should be coun- seled to use methods (e.g., condoms) to protect them- selves from sexual exposure to infectious body fluids (e.g.,semen or vaginal secretions) unless they have been dem- onstrated to be immune after vaccination (i.e., anti-HBs >10 mIU/mL) or previously infected (anti-HBc positive). \u007f To prevent or reduce the risk for transmission to others, HBsAg-positive persons should be advised concerning the risks for\u2014 perinatal transmission to infants born to HBsAg- positive women and the need for such infants to receive hepatitis B vaccine beginning at birth (see Pre-vention of Perinatal HBV Infection and Management of Pregnant Women) and \u2014 transmission to household, sexual, and needle-sharing contacts and the need for such contacts to receive hepa- titis B vaccine. \u007f HBsAg-positive persons should also be advised to \u2014 use methods (e.g., condoms) to protect nonimmune sex partners from acquiring HBV infection from sexual activity until the sex partners can be vaccinated andimmunity documented;\u2014 cover cuts and skin lesions to prevent the spread of infectious secretions or blood; \u2014 refrain from donating blood, plasma, tissue, or semen (organs may be donated to HBV-immune or chroni-cally infected persons needing a transplant); and \u2014 refrain from sharing household articles (e.g., tooth- brushes, razors, or personal injection equipment) thatcould become contaminated with blood. \u007f To protect the liver from further harm, HBsAg-positive persons should be advised to\u2014 avoid or limit alcohol consumption because of the effects of alcohol on the liver; \u2014 refrain from beginning to take any new medicines, including over-the-counter and herbal medicines, with- out consulting their health-care provider; and \u2014 obtain vaccination against hepatitis A if chronic liver disease is found to be present. \u007f When seeking medical or dental care, HBsAg-positive per- sons should be advised to inform those responsible fortheir care of their HBsAg status so they can be evaluated and their care managed appropriately. \u007f Other counseling messages: \u2014 HBV is not spread by breastfeeding, kissing, hugging, coughing, ingesting food or water, sharing eating uten- sils or drinking glasses, or casual contact. \u2014 Persons should not be excluded from school, play, child care, work, or other settings on the basis of their HBsAg status unless they are prone to biting ( 4). \u2014 Involvement with a support group might help patients cope with chronic HBV infection.

When more than one injection must beadministered in the same limb, the anterolateral thigh is usually the preferred site, with injections separated by 1\"-2\" to avoid overlap in local reactions. \u007f For persons at risk for hemorrhage (e.g., persons with hemophilia), the risk of bleeding after intramuscularinjection can be minimized by use of a 23-gauge (orsmaller) needle, application of direct pressure to the injection site for >2 minutes, and administration of vac- cine immediately after infusion of coagulation factor. Sub- cutaneous administration of vaccine can be considered for these persons but might result in lower response and an increased local reaction. \u007f Hepatitis B vaccine should be stored at 35\u00b0-46\u00b0 F (2\u00b0-8\u00b0 C) and should not be frozen. \u007f A vaccine information statement (VIS) must be provided to recipients of hepatitis B vaccine. The National Child- hood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-26) requires vaccine providers to give a copy of the most cur-rent vaccine-specific VIS to all recipients (children or their guardians) of vaccines that are included on the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program table maintained by the Health Resources and Services Administration (available at http://www. hrsa.gov). Hepatitis B vaccine is included on this table. The most current VIS forhepatitis B vaccine is available at http://www.cdc.gov/nip/ publications/vis. Statements in languages other than English are available from the Immunization ActionCoalition at http://www.immunize.org. Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (HBIG) Dose and Administration \u007f The standard dose of HBIG is 0.5 mL for postexposure prophylaxis of infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive women and 0.06 mL/kg for all other applications. \u007f HBIG may be administered simultaneously with hepati- tis B vaccine but in a different injection site. \u007f HBIG is administered by intramuscular injection. For infants, HBIG should be administered intramuscularlyHepatitis B Vaccine Dose and Administration \u007f Recommended vaccine doses vary by product, age of recipient, and needs of special populations (see Table 2). Administration of single-antigen or combination vaccine simultaneously with other childhood vaccines produces no clinically significant interference in antibody responses (1-13 ). Although the antigen contents of vaccines differ, vaccines made by different manufacturers are interchange-able, except for the 2-dose schedule used for adolescentsaged 11-15 years, for which only Recombivax HB is approved. Combination vaccines are not approved for use as a birth dose because of potential suppression of theimmune response to subsequent doses of the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) component in Comvax ( 14) and possible decreased immunogenicity of the diphtheria com- ponent of Pediarix when administered at birth. \u007f Hepatitis B vaccine should be administered by intramus- cular injection. Injection into the buttock is associated with decreased immunogenicity ( 15-18 ). Intradermal administration can result in a lower seroconversion rateand final concentration of antibody to hepatitis B surfaceantigen compared with intramuscular administration; lim- ited data are available to assess long-term protection from this route of administration ( 19,20 ). \u007f The anterolateral thigh muscle is the recommended site of administration for neonates (aged <1 month) and infants (aged 1-12 months). For toddlers (aged 1-2 years) and older children, either the anterolateral thigh or the deltoid muscle may be used if the muscle mass is adequate. The deltoid muscle is the preferred site of administrationfor adolescents. \u007f For intramuscular injection, the needle should be long enough to reach the muscle mass and prevent vaccine from seeping into subcutaneous tissue, but not so long as to involve underlying nerves and blood vessels or bone ( 21). The appropriate needle length is usually 5/8\" for neonates, 7/8\"-1\" for infants, and 7/8\"-11/4\" for toddlers, older chil- dren, and adolescents. A 22- to 25-gauge needle should be used. \u007f Hepatitis B vaccine administered by any route or site other than intramuscularly in the anterolateral thigh or deltoidmuscle should not be counted as valid and should be repeated unless serologic testing indicates that an adequate28 MMWR December 23, 2005 in the anterolateral thigh using a 22-25-gauge needle that is 7/8\"-1\" in length. For older children and adolescents, an appropriate muscle mass (i.e., deltoid or gluteal) should be chosen in which to deliver the larger volumes of HBIG required for these age groups by using a needle length appropriate for the person's age and size ( 21). \u007f Vaccination with certain live-virus vaccines (measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella) should be deferred for at least 3 months after administration of HBIG because HBIG can inhibit the response to these vaccines ( 21). \u007f HBIG should be stored at 35\u00b0-46\u00b0 F (2\u00b0-8\u00b0 C) and should not be frozen. Unknown or Uncertain Vaccination Status \u007f A reliable vaccination history is defined as a written, dated record (personal, school, physician, or immunization reg- istry) of each dose of a complete series. \u007f In the majority of clinical practice settings and in situa- tions when postexposure prophylaxis is indicated (see Appendix C), providers should accept only written and dated records (e.g., personal, school, physician, or im- munization registry) as evidence of vaccination. Although vaccinations should not be postponed if records cannot be located, providers should try to locate missing recordsby contacting previous health-care providers and search- ing for personally held records. \u007f Persons whose records cannot be located should be con- sidered susceptible and started or continued on the age-appropriate vaccine schedule. \u007f Persons who reside in the United States but were vacci- nated in other countries should be considered fully vacci-nated if they have written documentation of >3 doses of vaccine administered at recommended minimum inter- vals, including the third dose at age >24 weeks. If they were not vaccinated according to recommended minimumintervals, they should be revaccinated (see MinimumDosing Intervals and Management of Persons Who Were Incorrectly Vaccinated). Persons without written docu- mentation of full vaccination should complete the age-appropriate vaccine series. Interrupted Vaccine Schedules \u007f When the hepatitis B vaccine schedule is interrupted, the vaccine series does not need to be restarted. \u007f If the series is interrupted after the first dose, the second dose should be given as soon as possible, and the secondand third doses should be separated by an interval of atleast 8 weeks. \u007f If only the third dose is delayed, it should be adminis- tered as soon as possible, after age 24 weeks (164 days). \u007f It is not necessary to restart the vaccine series for infants switched from one vaccine brand to another, includingcombination vaccines. Minimum Dosing Intervals and Management of PersonsWho Were Incorrectly Vaccinated \u007f The third dose of vaccine must be administered at least 8 weeks after the second dose and should follow the first dose by at least 16 weeks; the minimum interval betweenthe first and second doses is 4 weeks. In infants, adminis- tration of the final dose is not recommended before age 24 weeks (164 days). \u007f Inadequate doses of hepatitis B vaccine (see Table 2) or doses received after a shorter-than-recommended dosinginterval should be readministered. Accelerated Vaccine Schedules \u007f The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not ap- proved accelerated schedules in which hepatitis B vaccineis administered more than once in a month. If clinicianschoose to use an accelerated schedule (i.e., doses at days 0, 7, and 14 days), the patient should also receive a booster dose at least 6 months after the start of the series to pro-mote long-term immunity. Hemodialysis Patients and Other Immunocompromised Persons \u007f Standard hepatitis B vaccine doses (see Table 2) are ap- proved by FDA for vaccination of all persons aged <20 years. For hemodialysis patients and other immuno- compromised persons, higher doses might be more immunogenic, but no specific recommendations havebeen made. \u007f Serologic testing of hemodialysis patients and other immunocompromised persons is recommended 1-2months after administration of the final dose of the pri- mary vaccine series to determine the need for revaccina- tion (see Postvaccination Testing for Serologic Response).In addition, booster doses of vaccine might be needed (see Booster Doses).Vol. 54 / RR-16 Recommendations and Reports 29 Prevaccination Serologic Testing for Susceptibility \u007f Because of the low prevalence of HBV infection among infants, children, and adolescents born in the United States, prevaccination testing for susceptibility usually is not indicated for these age groups. \u007f Prevaccination testing for susceptibility is recommended for unvaccinated household, sexual, and needle-sharingcontacts of HBsAg-positive persons. \u007f Anti-HBc is the test of choice for prevaccination testing. \u007f Persons tested for anti-HBc and found to be anti-HBc negative are susceptible and should complete the vaccine series. \u007f Persons found to be anti-HBc positive should be tested for HBsAg. HBsAg testing may be performed on the samespecimen collected for anti-HBc testing. If the HBsAg test result is positive, the person should receive appropri- ate management (see Appendix A). \u007f In most situations, the first vaccine dose should be administered immediately after collection of the bloodsample for serologic testing. Postvaccination Testing for Serologic Response Recommendations for postvaccination testing of infants born to HBsAg-positive women are provided in this report (see Management of Infants Born to Women Who Are HBsAgPositive). This section provides recommendations for post- vaccination testing of other persons. \u007f Serologic testing for immunity is not necessary after rou- tine vaccination of infants, children, or adolescents. \u007f Testing after vaccination is recommended only for the following persons whose subsequent clinical management depends on knowledge of their immune status: \u2014 health-care workers; \u2014 chronic hemodialysis patients, other immunocompromised persons (e.g., hemato- poietic stem-cell transplant recipients or persons receiving chemotherapy), to determine the need forrevaccination and the type of follow-up testing; and \u2014 sex partners of HBsAg-positive persons, to determine the need for revaccination and the need for other meth-ods of protection against HBV infection. \u007f Testing should be performed 1-2 months after adminis- tration of the last dose of the vaccine series by using amethod that allows determination of a protective level of anti-HBs ( >10 mIU/mL).\u007f Persons found to have anti-HBs levels of >10 mIU/mL after the primary vaccine series are considered to be im- mune. \u2014 Immunocompetent persons have long-term protection and do not need further periodic testing to assess anti- HBs levels. \u2014 Immunosuppressed persons might need annual test- ing to assess anti-HBs levels (see Booster Doses). \u007f Persons found to have anti-HBs levels of <10 mIU/mL after the primary vaccine series should be revaccinated. Administration of three doses on an appropriate schedule (Table 7), followed by anti-HBs testing 1-2 months after the third dose, is usually more practical than serologic testing after one or more doses of vaccine. \u007f Persons who do not respond to revaccination should be tested for HBsAg. \u2014If the HBsAg test result is positive, the persons should receive appropriate management (see Appendix B), and any household, sexual, or needle-sharing contacts should be identified and vaccinated (see Appendix A). \u2014 Persons who test negative for HBsAg should be con- sidered susceptible to HBV infection and should becounseled about precautions to prevent HBV infec- tion and the need to obtain HBIG postexposure pro- phylaxis for any known or likely parenteral exposure to HBsAg-positive blood (see Appendix C). Booster Doses \u007f Booster doses are not recommended for persons with normal immune status who were vaccinated as infants, children, or adolescents. Serologic testing is not recom- mended to assess antibody levels in any age group, except in specific circumstances (see Postvaccination Testing for Serologic Response). \u007f For hemodialysis patients, the need for booster doses should be assessed by annual antibody to hepatitis B survace anti-gen (anti-HBs) testing. A booster dose should be when anti-HBs levels decline to <10 mIU/mL. other immunocompromised persons (e.g., HIV- infected persons, hematopoietic stem cell transplantrecipients, and persons receiving chemotherapy), the need for booster doses has not been determined. Annual anti- HBs testing and booster doses when anti-HBs levels decline to <10 mIU/mL should be considered in persons with an ongoing high risk for exposure.30 MMWR December 23, 2005 References 1.

Recommendations for management of infants born to moth-ers who test positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)- positive mothers are provided in this report (see Prevention of Perinatal HBV T ransmission and Management of PregnantWomen). HBsAg-Positive Source \u007f Unvaccinated persons (Table C-1) or persons known not to have responded to a complete hepatitis B vaccine seriesshould receive both hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vaccine as soon as possible after exposure (preferably <24 hours). For sexual exposures, HBIG should not be administered more than 14 days after ex- posure. Hepatitis B vaccine may be administered simul- taneously with HBIG in a separate injection site. Thehepatitis B vaccine series should be completed using the age-appropriate vaccine dose and schedule (see Tables 2 and 3 ).\u007f Persons who are in the process of being vaccinated but who have not completed the vaccine series should receive the appropriate dose of HBIG and should complete the vaccine series. \u007f Children and adolescents who have written documenta- tion of a complete hepatitis B vaccine series and who were did not receive postvaccination testing should receive asingle vaccine booster dose. Source with Unknown HBsAg Status \u007f Unvaccinated persons (Table C-1) should receive the hepa- titis B vaccine series with the first dose initiated as soon aspossible after exposure, preferably <24 hours. The vac- cine series should be completed using the age-appropri- ate dose and schedule (see Tables 2, 3, and 5). \u007f Persons who are not fully vaccinated should complete the vaccine series. \u007f Children and adolescents with written documentation of a complete hepatitis B vaccine series require no further treatment. TABLE C-1. Guidelines for postexposure immunoprophylaxis of unvaccinated persons who are exposed to blodo or body fluids that contain blood Cause Action Discrete exposure to an HBsAg*-positive source Percutaneous (e.g., bite, needlestick) or mucosal exposure to HBsAg-positive blood or body fluids that contain blood Sexual or needle-sharing contact of an HBsAg-positive personVictim of sexual assault/abuse by a perpetrator who is HBsAg-positive Discrete exposure to a source with unknown HBsAg status Victim of sexual assault/abuse by a perpetrator with unknown HBsAg statusPercutaneous (e.g., bite or needclestick) or mucosal exposure to blood or body fluids that contain blood from a source with unknown HBsAg status * Hepatitis B surface antigen. Immunoprophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible, preferably <24 hours. Studies are limited on the maximum interval after exposure during which postexposure prophylaxis is effective, but the interval is unlikely to exceed 7 days for percutaneous exposures and 14 da ys for sexual exposures. The hepatitis B vaccine series should be completed.Administer hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) Administer hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG Administer hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG Administer hepatitis B vaccine Administer hepatitis B vaccine32 MMWR December 23, 2005 Glossary Terms and Abbreviations Used in This Report ACIP Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ALT alanine aminotransferase Anti-HBc antibody to hepatitis B core antigenAnti-HBe antibody to hepatitis B e antigen Anti-HBs antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen DTaP diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis adsorbedFDA Food and Drug Administration HBcAg hepatitis B core antigen HBeAg hepatitis B e antigenHBIG hepatitis B immune globulin HBsAg hepatitis B surface antigen HBV hepatitis B virusHCC hepatocellular carcinoma HCV hepatitis C virus Hib Haemophilus influenzae type b HIV human immunodeficiency virus IgM immunoglobulin M IPV inactivated poliovirusMS multiple sclerosis NHANES National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey VAERS Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting SystemVSD Vaccine Safety DatalinkRecommendations and Reports December 23, 2005 / Vol. 54 / No. RR-16Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report depardepardepardepardepar tment of health and human sertment of health and human sertment of health and human sertment of health and human sertment of health and human ser vicesvicesvicesvicesvices Centers for Disease Control and PreventionCenters for Disease Control and PreventionCenters for Disease Control and PreventionCenters for Disease Control and PreventionCenters for Disease Control and PreventionContinuing Education Activity Sponsored by CDC A Comprehensive Immunization Strategy to Eliminate Transmission of Hepatitis B Virus Infection in the United States Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Part 1: Immunization of Infants, Children, and Adolescents You must complete and return the response form electronically or by mail by December 23, 2008 , to receive continuing education credit.
