With autumn upon us and winter just around the corner, the cooler temperatures, damp conditions and reduced daylight hours can be quite testing for most of us. If your immune system is already a little weak, you can become more vulnerable to picking up a range of illnesses and infections at this colder time of the year. Poor health is also disruptive and costly. It can mean having to take time off work or take your children out from school or creche. Many people have very little choice but to continue working through a period of illness which means the body doesn't really get a chance to fully recuperate. This in turn can create a vicious cycle of poor health. Prevention is better than cure, so why not invest the time, think ahead and give your immune system a natural boost with Homeopathy now. Some common ailments during the autumn and winter months include: Not only can homeopathy help treat colds, coughs and flu when they are in full stream, but it can also be used as a preventative to help boost your immune system and improve your general health so that you become less susceptible to picking up \"all that is going around\". For some people this time of year can highlight feelings of sadness, depression, melancholy, loneliness and isolation. For others a condition known as [Seasonal Affective Disorder ](https://www.homeopathy-healing.com/homeopathy-for-seasonal-affective-disorder/)is common and can range from mild to debilitating, at times requiring medical treatment. Homeopathy can offer a range of help and support both short and long term with these emotional issues. Many people complain of [low energy, feeling tired or sluggish](https://www.homeopathy-healing.com/homeopathy-general-well-being/) as more time is spent in central heated buildings as we tend to want to hibernate. Being stuck indoors in stuffy environments can subject us to more pollutants and allergens. Getting outdoors can be enough to revitalise the mind and body but if you feel stuck then Homeopathy can be just the tonic you need. The cold damp weather can create debilitating aggravations for suffers of rheumatic diseases such as arthritis. There are many remedies that can be used to help reduce the severity of symptoms and help maintain joint mobility. Ireland has the 4th highest prevalence of asthma worldwide with approximately 470,000 people affected (1 in 8 of population). Those with asthma can often find their symptoms are triggered more so during the cold windy months and repeated chest infections can become the norm. Homeopathy offers a range of supports for the respiratory system. Homeopathy is an excellent choice of healthcare for boosting your child's immune system naturally too. Not only can it help when your child is ill. When their immune system is stronger it can help them avoid repeated illnesses, infections and picking up everything that is going around. Homeopathic remedies are safe and effective for children. They are gentle, non toxic, with no side effects and are easy to administer. Other supports that can be used to boost your immune response during the autumn months include 1. A healthy diet, 2. Vitamin C daily to help your body build white blood cells which help fight against invading germs. 3. Plenty of fresh air! So step out of the heated offices, homes and cars and get some fresh air into your lungs. 4. Make the most of the sunlight and take a brisk walk in the natural daylight. Not only can it help rejuvenate and re-energise your mind and body, but it can also significantly lift your spirits. Prevention is better than cure. So if you have a tendency to recurring health problems during the colder months, it is best to treat the underlying cause, rather than just symptoms that manifest. If the immune system can be strengthened then the body will no longer need to produce troublesome ailments. However if you do fall ill or have a flare up, \"acute\" remedies can be used to bring more immediate relief while the immune response is building and improving. The benefits of homeopathy are many. Professionally prescribed homeopathic remedies can safely be used in conjunction with conventional medication. Homeopathic remedies have no side effects, are non-addictive, are not tested on animals and are eco-friendly.
