Vaccination drives have begun all across the country, with healthcare workers lining up to get the first doses of the coronavirus vaccines, Covaxin and Covishield. Globally, too, there's a lot of zeal and enthusiasm amongst people registered to get the vaccine in the earliest of timeframe-which is also a way of achieving herd immunity. Right now, while there are no limitations as to what may prevent a person from getting vaccinated, there are some precautionary measures which people have been asked to follow before their turn comes up- being well-rested, educated and safeguard immunity being some basic ones.

When a person gets sick, it probably means that the body has been infested by an infectious germ or virus, meaning that the immune system is already in a compromised, stressed-out state, working hard to remove the germ. It's common knowledge that a vaccine works the best when a person's immunity is healthy, well-developed and stress-free. Existing sickness, or at a time of sickness, when the immune system is already busy fighting out the virus would mean that there would be risks for the vaccine to work well, making many wonder if getting a COVID vaccine would be safe or not.

It can be harder to distinguish your illness from that of the reactogenic vaccine reactions. In some cases, it can lead to serious side-effects, even if rare and complicate your recovery. The best course of action to take would be to talk to a doctor, or authorities at the vaccination centre beforehand to alert them about the problem at hand, and take the neccessary course of action.

Another common misconception is that people who have recovered from coronavirus will not require a vaccine shot right now. This is not true.
