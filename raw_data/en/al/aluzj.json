Prior to the midp oin t of the semester, studen ts ma y use T opNet to withdra w. After the midp oin t of the semester, the studen t should rep ort to the O ce of the Registrar to initiate withdra w al pro cedures. Studen ts lea ving the institution without an o cial withdra w al will receiv e failing grades in all courses in whic h enrolled and endanger their future status in the institution. Studen ts withdra wing after the midp oin t of the semester, a bi-term or comparable p erio d during the summer session m ust consult with their instructors as to the withdra w al grade. The o cial date of the withdra w al is the date the withdra w al is pro cessed on T opNet or the written notice is receiv ed in the O ce of the Registrar. Studen ts wishing to return to WKU at a later date m ust submit an application for readmission prior to the deadline for submitting applications. In sp ecial circumstances, as describ ed b elo w, a complete withdra w al from the univ ersit y after the mid-p oin t of a term will b e considered. A dministrativ e Withdra w al A request for an administrativ e withdra w al is initiated b y the Univ ersit y b ecause of a disciplinary situation or when, in the professional judgmen t of a health care pro vider, psyc hologist and/or univ ersit y administrator, there is reason to b eliev e a studen t is a substan tial threat to him/herself or in terferes with the w elfare of other mem b ers of the univ ersit y , the education pro cess, or the orderly op eration of the univ ersit y . The Vice A\u001bairs A\u001bairs, resp ectiv e designees, will notify studen t of the in v olun tary withdra w al, and the Registrar will b e directed to withdra w the studen t from all classes in whic h the studen t is curren tly enrolled and cancel registration that has o ccurred for an y future terms. The O ce of the Registrar will notify the studen t's instructors of the withdra w al, and \u0010 W\u0011 grades will b e recorded for the term in progress. A studen t who is administrativ ely withdra wn will ha v e a registration hold placed b y the Vice Presiden t for Studen t A\u001bairs or the Asso ciate Presiden t for A ca- demic A\u001bairs to prev en t the studen t from b eing readmitted or re-enrolled unless cleared b y the appropriate administrator or the resp ectiv e designee. A studen t ma y le a written app eal of an in v olun tary withdra w al through the o ce that administered the withdra w al. T uition refund app eals for administrativ e withdra w als are handled in a separate pro cedure, and instructions ma y b e obtained from the Bursar's O ce. Medical Withdra w al A studen t ma y request and b e considered for a medical withdra w al from all courses in a term when ex- traordinary circumstances, suc h as a serious ph ysical or men tal illness or injury , prev en t the studen t from con tin uing his or her classes after the mid-p oin t of a term, and incompletes or other arrangemen ts with the instructors are not feasible or p ossible. A medical withdra w al m ust b e substan tiated with appropriate do cumen tation from the attending health care pro vider. Once the rationale for a medical withdra w al has b een v alidated b y the O ce of the Registrar, the studen t's instructors will b e sen t noti cation of the with- dra w al, and \u0010 W\u0011 grades will b e recorded for eac h course. A studen t who requests a medical withdra w al, or an individual requesting a withdra w al on b ehalf of the studen t who is ph ysically or men tally unable to request the withdra w al, should con tact the O ce of the Registrar to obtain medical withdra w al pro cedures.

If an incomplete grade is not a viable option, the studen t will b e p ermitted to withdra w either from individual courses or from the en tire sc hedule of classes. A full refund of tuition and fees will b e issued for those courses from whic h the studen t has withdra wn.

The studen t m ust presen t supp orting do c- umen tation that demonstrates serious and comp elling reasons justifying the withdra w al and exten uating circumstances justifying its retroactiv e nature; p o or academic p erformance that is not attributed to non- academic exten uating circumstances is not a consideration for retroactiv e withdra w al. A studen t ma y app eal for a retroactiv e withdra w al within t w o calendar y ears follo wing the end of the term for whic h withdra w al is requested. A studen t need not b e enrolled at WKU at the time the application for retroactiv e withdra w al is submitted. An app ellate b oard will review the request for a retroactiv e withdra w al. The b oard will consider the follo wing factors, including, but not limited to: 1. Do cumen tation of exten uating circumstances. 2. W ritten letter of supp ort from an academic administrator, facult y mem b er, advisor or other univ ersit y professional who is familiar with the studen t's situation. If a retroactiv e withdra w al is appro v ed, the Registrar will notify the studen t's instructors and departmen t heads of the request for a retroactiv e withdra w al, and they will b e giv en 14 calendar da ys to raise ob jections if the studen t's classro om p erformance w as suc h that a withdra w al (W) w ould not b e appropriate.

Standardized Examination Scores The MBA program requires the GMA T test for admission. The GRE ma y b e required for admission to a graduate program. Please inquire with the sp eci c program or with Graduate Studies and Researc h. Graduate Record Examination (GRE) As of August 2011, the GRE revised General T est measures the v erbal and quan titativ e reasoning, critical thinking and analytical writing skills. If required b y the program the studen t is applying to, standardized test scores m ust b e receiv ed b y the O ce of Graduate Studies and Researc h prior to admission. In these cases, the admission decision will b e based up on the undergraduate transcript, the GRE score, and other materials required b y the program to whic h the studen t is applying. 22W estern Ken tuc ky Univ ersit y Graduate Catalog 2011-2012 Registration materials for the GRE and GMA T are a v ailable at the Counseling and T esting Cen ter, the O ce of Graduate Studies and Researc h, h ttp://www.gre.org, or h ttp://www.gmat.org, or b y calling 1 (800) 473-2255. If a studen t has a master's degree from an accredited institution in a eld of study related to the desired program, the studen t ma y request that the completed master's degree b e considered as a substitute for the GRE General T est. Eac h departmen t has the discretion to appro v e this exception to the GRE requiremen t. Depnding on the program, some admissions decisions are based up on b oth the undergraduate grade p oin t a v erage and the GRE General T est score, whic h is kno wn as the GAP score. The GAP score is the sum of the GRE V erbal & Quan titativ e scores times the o v erall undergraduate grade p oin t a v erage. F or example, a GRE score of 800 (V erbal + Quan titativ e) and a grade a v erage of 3.5/4.0 w ould pro duce a GAP score of 2800. Because GAP is a pro duct of b oth the GRE score and undergraduate grade p oin t a v erage, b oth the GRE and transcript record are essen tial for making an admission decision. The GRE General T est also includes a writing comp onen t; some programs ha v e established a minim um Analytical W riting score requiremen t. Most programs requiring a GAP score require a minim um of 2200, although individual degree programs ma y b e higher. Previous graduate course w ork do es not ha v e an y b earing on admission requiremen ts, i.e., GAP score calculation. F or studen ts who to ok the GRE General T est prior to Octob er 1, 2002, most programs requiring the GAP score require a minim um 3500 or b etter. This GRE General T est consisted of v erbal, quan titativ e, and analytical sections, and in this case the GAP score is generated b y the sum of the three parts of the GRE times the o v erall undergraduate grade p oin t a v erage. GMA T Score A dmission decisions to the Master of Business A dministration are based up on the scores of the Graduate Managemen t A dmission T est. The requiremen ts for general admission to the MBA program are a 500 total GMA T test score and a GAP score of 1050 (undergraduate grade p oin t a v erage times 200 plus GMA T score). A dmission Requiremen ts Individual pr o gr ams may have mor e stringent r e quir ements than the O c e of Gr aduate Studies, but al l students must me et the minimum Gr aduate Studies r e quir ements to b e c onsider e d for admission.
