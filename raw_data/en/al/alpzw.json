Mostly, there is no listing of them, assessment of risks, description of alternatives. For the first time this report looks at the toxicity and likely prevalence of the burgeoning number of materials and devices of concern, making recommendations concerning better legal constraints. It reveals many little known alternatives that are safer in manufacture, use, abuse and disposal.", "sitename": "IDTechEx", "date": "2018-02-27", "cleaned_text": "This report is no longer available.
