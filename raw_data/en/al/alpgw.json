Kerry Hennessy from Wexford has been struggling to get a booster for her daughter Hannah (23) who has autism. \"She doesn't understand the pandemic, she can't wear a mask, she can't social distance.\" Hannah originally got vaccinated though her day service. However, she was advised by the HSE to go to a mass vaccination centre in Enniscorthy to receive her booster. \"Hannah has behaviour problems. There will be queues to get vaccinated... it will take a long time for Hannah to feel comfortable.\" Hospital Report Ms Hennessy rang her doctor, who agreed to vaccinate her daughter. \"The doctor is going to have to vaccinate her in the car park in the car... if I was to bring her into the doctors ... she would get very distressed.\" Sharon McManus from Salthill in Galway has a son (10) with autism. Myles was tested for Covid in a large centre. \"We met one staff at registration and I told her that Myles had autism and was worried about the test. She didn't reply to this at all.\" Encouraging However, Ms McManus says the tester was encouraging and talked Myles through the process. Myles became distressed at one point during the test and shouted out. \"The tester appeared apprehensive during the process but did a great job.\" Ms McManus would like to get a vaccine for her son, but she would prefer to bring him to a GP clinic or pharmacy where she could explain his needs in advance. She also thinks there should be a way to include additional information before testing and vaccination. \"It is not appropriate to have to impart sensitive, personal information as you queue in an open area. There is no privacy, and these conversations can increase anxiety for the child.\" Jane Johnstone from Wexford has two sons with additional needs. Her son Evan is 21. He has autism and an intellectual disability. He was initially vaccinated through his day service. Daniel, her other son, is 17 and also has autism. He got his initial dose of the vaccine in a mass vaccination centre. While she says the vaccination staff couldn't have been nicer, Daniel became overwhelmed by the strange environment and engaged in self-harming behaviours. \"He became very distressed in the cubicle. People were looking in. I know it is only human nature, but where is his dignity and privacy?\" The nurse who was vaccinating Daniel reassured him and he got the vaccine, but the 15-minute wait after the jab was also very tough, she says . \"Once we got back into the car, I put on my sunglasses and a few tears rolled down my face. Why couldn't we do it in an environment that was more familiar? Such as in respite or school, or a clinic specifically for people with a disability?\" Both Daniel and Evan got their boosters in the car park of their GP which was best for their safety but lacked privacy, she says Bespoke In a statement, the HSE said the appointments offered to vulnerable adults were predominantly through vaccination centres, but there were some bespoke, onsite and GP clinics. There is also a standard operational procedure for the vaccination of children with additional needs, and the HSE said parents can request these accommodations by contacting HSE Live, who can alert the vaccination centre in advance of their child's appointment. The HSE added that there are also some specialist clinics available, such as t Citywest in Dublin and a centre in Limerick. \"In addition to this, any children (or adults) who are unable to leave their homes to receive a vaccination will receive their booster vaccine in their own homes.
