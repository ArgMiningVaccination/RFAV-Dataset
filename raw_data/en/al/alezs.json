What is a third dose? People with moderately to severely compromised immune systems are especially vulnerable to COVID-19, and may not build the same level of immunity to 1 or 2-dose vaccine series compared to people who are not immunocompromised. CDC recommends that people with moderately to severely compromised immune systems receive an additional dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine at least 28 days after the second dose of [Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html) or [Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Moderna.html). This additional dose is intended to improve immunocompromised people's response to their initial vaccine series What is a booster dose? COVID-19 booster vaccines are additional vaccines that \"boost\" or increase your immunity to protect you from contracting COVID-19. Recommendations for appropriate COVID-19 booster shots - View the latest CDC recommendations for COVID-19 Vaccine Boosters [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html). For Pfizer and Moderna - For the first booster, an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) is preferred in most situations. The second booster must be an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.

After Vaccination - With most COVID-19 vaccines, you will need two shots in order for them to work. Get the second shot even if you have side effects after the first one, unless a vaccination provider or your doctor tells you not to get a second shot. - Ask your healthcare provider about getting started with v-safe, a free, smartphone-based tool that uses text messaging and web surveys to provide personalized health check-ins after you receive a COVID-19 vaccination. V-safe also reminds you to get your second dose if you need one. Learn more at [www.cdc.gov/vsafe](http://www.cdc.gov/vsafe). - It takes time for your body to build protection after any vaccination. COVID-19 vaccines that require 2 shots may not protect you until a week or two after your second shot. [Frequently "}
