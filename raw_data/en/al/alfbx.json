This command to \"testifyto what they had seen, heard, and known of Him . . . is theprincipal task of every Christian.\" 1 To face the enormity of the task and the obstacles within the culture, Jesuspromised power through the Holy Spirit sufficient for thefulfillment of the mission. 2 As it was for the early church, so it is for the contemporary church. The Rise of Postmodernism Postmodernism represents one of the greatest obstacles to the mission of the contemporary church. HustonSmith describes postmodernism as a view of the world inwhich reality cannot be accessed. 3 The influence of the postmodern perspective is prevalent in the culture today. 2 4C.

He proposes thatmodernism promoted reason as \"unifying power of religion.\"One can find postmodern thought coursing through the media, academia, and ecclesia . Postmodernism is a shift from the Enlightenment ideal of modernism. 4 Modernism describes the pursuit to establish \"all-inclusive\" explanations for life.5 The autonomous individual is the highest reality and value.6 Knowledge is attainable and certain through the objectiveand precise tool of the scientific method. 7 Modernism promotes the progress of humanity and society throughtechnological advancements. 8 In short, Habermas suggests also,Cornel Now? , ed.

He writesthat the essential fabrication permeating culture is thatthere should be \"obedience . . . the spirit.\"He writes: \"This was realized in society as the space secured by civil law for the rational pursuit of one's owninterests; . . . in the private sphere, as ethical autonomyand self-realization; finally, in the public sphere relatedto this private realm, as the formative process that takesplace by means of the appropriation of a culture that hasbecome reflective.\" 10 Beginning with Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900),11 the incipient form of postmodernism found fertile soil inwhich to flourish by attacking the Enlightenment. 12 To understand postmodernism, therefore, it is important tounderstand the Nietzschean project that has led to itsgrowth. Nietzsche's critique of modernism promotes a denialof the \"myopic view\" of truth, morality, and language. 13 4 14Friedrich Nietzsche, Will to Power , trans.

For Nietzsche,moral value depends solely upon the individual's taste.Nietzsche dismissed the notion of a single meaning for the world. The world has \"countless meanings.\" 14 In his project, Nietzsche sought to dismantle the \"pervasive lie\"that Plato, Christianity, and the Enlightenment hadperpetrated for centuries. First, Nietzsche attacked the \"mendacious fabrication\" of truth and morality. He declared that truthis \"a sum of human relations, which have been enhanced,transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, andwhich after long use seem firm, canonical, andobligatory.\" 15 Wilcox suggests that for Nietzsche \"values are not objective\" but are relative. Moral values are\"created rather than discovered.\" 16 As a counterattack against the prevailing views of truth and morality, Nietzsche called for the rise of the \u00fcbermensch . The \u00fcbermensch is a \"free spirit\" who has broken free of the constraints of the external moral law. 5 17Leslie Paul Thiele, Friedrich Nietzsche and the Politics of the Soul: A Study of Heroic Individualism (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1990), 12. 18Walter Kaufmann, Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist , 4th ed.

Hollingdale (New York: Penguin Books, 1961), 136. Nietzsche condemned Plato forinverting reality through the creation of an imaginary, truerealm. Christianity continued this falsity of the imaginary realm (Beyond Good and Evil , 14-23). The metaphysicians of modernity embraced the similar notion of a metaphysical realm beyond this world ( Zarathustra , 136). The notion of an imaginary realm was the origination of the false ideal ofuniversal morality. This is the \"mendacious fabrication\"that Nietzsche sought to reverse. 19Friedrich Nietzsche, \"The Twilight of Idols or, How One Philosophizes with a Hammer,\" in The Portable Nietzsche , ed. and trans.

Rather, he \"bears his own standards of morality and reasonand attempts to vanquish the hitherto reigning traditions and values.\" 17 Nietzsche argued that Kant's belief in an a priori universal moral law must be corrected or \"revalued.\"18 Indeed, this \"revaluation\" was paramount to his philosophy.19 In his thought traditional morality was a \"dying tree\" that cannot be saved.20 Indeed, for Nietzsche, the of \"right and wrong\" was nonsensical.21 6 Evil, 135-36. 23Nietzsche, Zarathustra , 213, in which the prophet says, \"All my progress has been attempting and a questioning-- and truly one has to learn how to answer suchquestioning!

None of these moralities can be \"absolutized\" as solelyjustifiable. 22 Values are based upon preference rather than reason or rationality.23 Nietzsche also attacked \"mendacious fabrications\" in the concepts of language. Nietzsche proposed thatreality was a function of grammar -- a linguistic constructof the social context. 24 Language itself is the creator of truth.25 Language is a system of interpretation which opens a beautiful vista of \"eternal unfolding\" for meaning.26 It is the tool which creates the interpretation of reality.7 27Thiele, 103. 28Nietzsche, Will to Power , 267. He writes that individuals \"set up a word at the point at which ourignorance begins\" and the word is \"the horizon of not 'truths.'\" Extremity: Nietzsche, 96-97. 30Charles E. Winquist, Desiring Theology (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995), 31.\"Correctness\" of interpretation is not the most important goal of language,27 because language creates its own truth.28 Through the interpretive \"will to power,\" a new language isintroduced, and a new reality which corresponds to thelanguage comes into being. 29 Truth is fiction \"imaginatively produced\" by the \"arbitrariness of theelements of language.\" 30 Nietzsche's project rejects the idea that language is a fixed representation of a fixedreality. Nietzsche's \"yes-saying\" and \"no-saying\" produced a clear path for the exaltation of the postmodern mind. Rather than absolute truth, the postmodern mind reflects thearbitrariness of truth according to social context. Ratherthan universal morality, the postmodern mind embracesperspectival morality. Rather than language asrepresentative of reality, the postmodern mind findslanguage as the creator of reality.8 31Definitions are given throughout the dissertation. 32See, Stanley Grenz, \"The Gospel and the Postmodern Context,\" in A Primer Postmodernism , 161-74; Gene Jr., \"Conclusion: 'When Foundations Are Destroyed,'\" in Postmodern Times: A Christian Guide to Contemporary Thought and Culture (Wheaton: Crossway Books, 1994), 225-34. 33See, Jimmy Long, Generating Hope: A Strategy for Reaching the Postmodern Generation (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1997). 2, passim. 35See, Tom Beaudoin, Virtual Faith: The Irreverent Spiritual Quest of Generation X (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers, 1998).Need for Present Study31 Many books, essays, and articles seek to help the church to engage the adherents of postmodernism with thegospel of Christ. These works may be categorized into fourbasic groups: descriptive, responsive, corrective, andpostmodern. The descriptive group details the currentsituation of the postmodern condition, offering anappropriate Christian response in the concluding chapter ora few paragraphs at the close of each chapter. 32 The responsive category focuses upon a Christian response to thepostmodern condition, detailing the postmodern tenets in theintroduction. 33 The corrective category seeks to examine and negate the destructive tendencies of postmodernism.34 The postmodern category embraces much of the tenets ofpostmodern thought as an appropriate Christian response. 359 36Charles J. Conniry Jr., \"Apostolic Theological Seminary, Information Superhighway,\" (D.Min. diss., Fuller TheologicalSeminary, 1997). 38The suggestion here is that the works have something other than evangelism as their theses, or thatthey offer philosophical approaches to postmodernism.This proposed dissertation falls into the responsive category. More specifically, this dissertationproposes a very specific evangelistic response to thechallenges of the postmodern condition from an exegeticalanalysis of the first-century church as reported in the NewTestament. While some works attempt to demonstrate a biblical response to the postmodern world, they fail to addressspecifically the issue of evangelism in the ministry of thechurch to the postmodern person. 36 Other works provide a sound evangelistic approach to the postmodern condition, butthey fail to offer an in-depth exegetical analysis ofScripture. 37 These dissertations offer responses to the postmodern condition, but they lack either the depth ofconsideration in terms of evangelism or the depth ofexegetical analyses. 38 Gosnell's dissertation deals with postmodernism and evangelism. His approach, however, is mostly analytical. 10 39Ricky D. Gosnell, \"Abstract,\" in \"The Mission (Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books, 1993).He analyzes the rise of postmodernism, postmodernism in contemporary culture, and strategies for evangelisticministry to postmodern people. 39 He focuses upon the contemporary strategies of evangelism in relation to thepostmodern condition. Following David Bosch, 40 Gosnell provides insight for the church in evangelism. Whileproviding sound, biblical direction, Gosnell does not focushis attention primarily upon an exegetical analysis of theevangelistic approach of the apostolic church in the firstcentury. The dissertation seeks to offer an in-depth consideration of evangelism and exegetical analyses. WhereGosnell offers insight into the postmodern condition andproposes evangelistic response, this dissertation presentsmore exegetical analyses as the paradigm for such responses. Gosnell's approach focuses the first half of thedissertation on the historical development and contemporarycondition of postmodernism. This dissertation, however,focuses upon an exegetical analysis of the evangelisticapproach of the first-century church in the New Testament. 11 41Malcolm McDow and Alvin L. Reid, Firefall: How God Has Shaped History Through Revivals (Nashville: Broadman and Holman, 1997), 96. 42Everett Harrison, The Apostolic Church (Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans, 1985), ix-xii. Harrisondivides the \"Gospel History\" fourGospels) and \"Apostolic History\" (the remainder of the NewTestament). This dissertation follows a similar division,but focuses upon Acts and the Pauline epistles.The strength of this dissertation is its analyses of the evangelistic ministry of the apostolic church asfoundational for the evangelization of postmodern people. An Apostolic Approach The premise of this dissertation is that the New Testament approaches to evangelism are sufficient andeffective for evangelism in a postmodern context. Similarto the conditions in the contemporary society, the apostolicchurch evangelized cultures fundamentally opposed to theproposition of the gospel. In the midst of competingworldviews and rampant pluralism, the apostolic church\"saturated\" the contours of the ancient world with thegospel. 41 The term apostolic will reflect the period beginning with Pentecost and ending at the close of thefirst century. 42 An apostolic approach may be defined as the adoption of the examples, directions, and procedures ofthe apostolic church for the contemporary church setting. 12 43Robert A. Guelich, \"Translator's Preface,\" in Apostolic and Post-Apostolic Leonhard Goppelt (Grand Rapids: Baker Books, 1970), x.The record of the apostolic church found in the New Testament provides the basis for the work of thecontemporary church. Robert Guelich correctly states thatthe apostolic church serves as the \"norm for all Churchhistory.\" 43 This writer has chosen this topic due to the need for a coherent and biblical approach for the evangelizationof postmodern people. Within the plethora of materialdealing with evangelism in general, a specific approach forthe evangelization of postmodern people rarely is found. Furthermore, within the several books and articles dealingwith the evangelization of the postmodern person inparticular, a coherent, biblical paradigm often is missing. As a response to this condition, this writer seeks to offeran approach for the evangelization of postmodern peoplefollowing a coherent, biblical model. This model is foundin the evangelistic strategy of the apostolic churchdetailed in the Book of Acts and the Pauline epistles. Postmodernism makes basic presuppositions that present difficulties for the evangelistic ministry of thechurch. In order for the contemporary church to evangelizethe postmodern person, she must answer these difficulties. 13 44Millard J. Erickson, Postmodernizing the Faith: Evangelical Responses to the Challenge of Postmodernism (Grand Rapids: Baker Books, 1998), 18-19. 45David Wells, No Place for Truth: Or Whatever Happened to Evangelical Theology? (Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans, 1993), 104. 46These terms will be defined in the following chapter. The definitions will be presented primarily fromthe viewpoint of postmodern adherents. Although thereremains a varying degree of specificity among the theoristsof postmodernism concerning the definitions of these terms,the general descriptions present sufficient groundwork foranalysis.Erickson suggests that postmodernism presupposes that knowledge is not objective, that authoritative systems ofexplanation are invalid, and that knowledge is a creation ofcommunity. 44 The apostolic church faced similar challenges for evangelism in \"a cauldron of conflicting religiousclaims within which the Christian faith would have remainedtiny but for one fact: the first Christians knew that theirfaith was absolutely true.\" 45 Through the pattern of the apostolic church, the contemporary church finds an approachto address the four basic challenges of postmodernism: 1)anti-foundationalism, 2) communal truth, 3) deconstruction,and 4) pluralism. 46 These four challenges will be examined in the following chapter. viTABLE OF CONTENTS PREFACE ........................i v INTRODUCTION ...................... 1 The Rise of Postmodernism ............. 1 Need for Present Study ............... 8 An Apostolic Approac h................1 1 Chapter 1.

Geoff Rachel Bowlby (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1991), 14CHAPTER ONE PERSON AND EVANGELISM Prevailing Postmodern Themes Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard, professor of philosophy at the University of Paris in Vincennes and a leading voice in postmodern thought, defines postmodernism \"as incredulity toward metanarratives.\"1 A metanarrative is one \"grand theory\" which explains the meaning of life. For Lyotard, to be postmodern is to reject all things modern; that is, all pursuits to establish one, over-arching, prevalent theme for life.2 This rejection of metanarratives provides a fountainhead for the prevailing postmodern themes: anti- foundationalism, communal truth, deconstruction, and pluralism. Each of these themes presents a particular challenge for evangelizing the postmodern person. Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D. Senior Pastor First Baptist Church Norfolk, Virginia15 3Philip D. Kenneson, \"There's No Such Thing as Objective Truth and It's a Good Thing Too,\" in Christian Apologetics in the Postmodern World , ed. Timothy R.

(Oxford: Blackwell Publishers, 1997), 66.Dismissal of the Foundations The postmodern project dismisses the foundations of knowledge.3 Postmodernism rejects \"realism\" which states that \"there exists a mind-independent world\" which \"can be accessed.\"4 Postmodernism also rejects foundationalism, which states that knowledge is justified through \"certainindubitable\" beliefs. 5 Postmodernism states \"that there are no objective, transhistorical truths, or bottom lines whichmight serve to stabilize the interpretation of the particular historical purposes of groups and individuals.\" 6 Even the pursuit of such foundations is not beneficial. Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D. Senior Pastor First Baptist Church Norfolk, Virginia16 7Richard Rorty, Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1979), 178. 8Stanley Fish, There Is No Such Thing as Free Speech and It's a Good Thing, Too (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994), 218. 9Grube, 118. 10R. Rorty, Objectivity, Relativism, Truth , 128-29. As will be shown, Rorty contends that the pursuit of truth is an illusion and should not be the endeavor. He opts for conversation with others as the model for meaning.\"The question is not whether human knowledge in fact has 'foundations,' but whether it makes sense to suggest that itdoes -- whether the idea of epistemic or moral authorityhaving a 'ground' in nature is a coherent one.\" 7 Since metanarratives are no longer viable, evangelism faces the problem of anti-foundationalism. Stanley Fish proposes this description of anti- foundationalism: In a heterogeneous world, a world in which persons are situated -- occupying particular places with particularpurposes pursued in relation to particular goals,visions, and hopes as they follow from holding (or beingheld by) particular beliefs -- no one will be in asituation that is universal or general (that is, nosituation at all), and therefore no one's perspective (aword that gives the game away) can lay claim toprivilege. 8 In this way postmodernism abandons the correspondence theory of truth which suggests that \"a true statement is one whichcorresponds to reality.\" 9 Indeed, Rorty contends that this kind of pursuit of truth should be dismissed altogether.10 Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D. Senior Pastor First Baptist Church Norfolk, Virginia17 11Stephen Louthan, \"On Religion -- A Discussion with Richard Rorty, Alvin Plantinga and Nicholas Wolterstorff,\" Christian Scholar's Review 26 (1996): 183. 12David Tracy, Plurality and Ambiguity: Hermeneutics, Religion, Hope (San Francisco: Harper and E. Webber, Rethinking Evangelicalism 14R. Rorty, Objectivity, Relativism, Truth , 38. Alvin Plantinga proposes that Rorty's postmodernism suggests that \"there really isn't any such thing as truth.\"11 Communal Truth David Tracy clearly sets forth the postmodern ideal when he suggests that \"human knowledge is finite, communal, and perspectival.\"12 The postmodern comes to truth through the definition of personal experience in the community context. Each community creates its own narrative that defines its beliefs, history, and precepts. Truth is found within the social construct of each community narrative, and\"all these narratives are of equal value\" according to thepostmodern ideal. \"No one narrative can claimuniversality.\" 13 According to Rorty, the community informs and controls the definition of truth.14 Truth and self are ultimately the constructions of the social context. Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D. Senior Pastor First Baptist Church Norfolk, Virginia18 15Ibid., 165. 16Jimmy Long, Generating Hope: A Strategy for Reaching the Postmodern Generation (Downers Grove: InterVarsity, 1997), 70. Communal truth is a predominant theme in postmodernism. The notion of truth as the productof community will be a theme throughout this examination. 17Ibid., 69-70. 18R. Rorty, Objectivity, Relativism, Truth , 38.Community is the starting point for truth and self, and a community built for conversation maintains the socialcontext as the only source for guidance. 15 Jimmy Long states that truth comes through the lens of the community.16 That which is true is that which everyone in the social context of community believes to be true. The universality of truth is found only within the context of community. If one ventures to another social context, then the universality of truth changes.17 In postmodernism multiple truths exist, and the individual is left with only preferences. Absolute truth is the by-product of a communal, totalitarian, oppressive force seeking control and power.18 Michel Foucault, a leading postmodern philosopher who was trained at the Sorbonne and lectured at College de France , states that \"objective knowledge\" is the product of a social construct establishing its own truth. This construction is made to affirm thecommunity's way of life and to oppress others who differ. Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D.

As Millard Erickson reports this development,\"Truth is defined by and for the community, and allknowledge occurs within some community.\" 21 Truth is established through \"the ground rules that facilitate the well-being of the community in which one participates.\"22 Postmodernism declares that the individual is \"centerless and ever-changing.\"23 As the social context changes, beliefs and values of the individual also change. Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D. Senior Pastor First Baptist Church Norfolk, Virginia20 24Tracy, Plurality and Ambiguity , 19-20, 110-14; Stanley Grenz, A Primer on Postmodernism (Grand Rapids: William B.

Long states, \"The autonomous self of the Enlightenment has been replaced by tribalism or community.\" 25Lyotard, 165. 27Henry Knight III, A Future for Truth: Evangelical Theology in a Postmodern World (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1997), 53. Knight's evaluation indicates as well the commonview of postmodernism that the autonomous individual of theEnlightenment should be rejected. The community providesthe appropriate context and clues to self-identity. Withoutthe community, one cannot come to this self-identity.Self-identity comes through the individual's contact within the social construct of community. 24 In postmodernism, the community defines truth and dispenses personhood. The individual who does not match the norms of the community becomes \"rehumanized\" to match the prevailing norms of the community.25 Community, therefore, is vital for the postmodern perspective. It is the \"only source of guidance\" in determining the beliefs and values for life.26 As Henry Knight, assistant professor of evangelism at Saint PaulSchool of Theology in Kansas City, Missouri, states, \"Instead of the individual being prior to the community, the community is prior to the individual; participation in thecommunity with its network of practices and relationships iswhat constitutes the personhood of the individual.\" 27 Eric J.

The gospel from an evangelical perspective provides the fixed meaning for life.Postmodernism reacts against community to some degree, in that it views the community as oppressive to the minority group of dissidents within the social construct. On the other hand, postmodernism embraces community as thefundamental agent for the belonging of the individual. Theindividual is dependent upon the community as the placewhere self and truth begin, but no single communitypossesses a system of belief which is perfectly consistentor coherent. 28 Although community may be oppressive, paradoxically it is only context for solace in a fragmented world. Deconstruction of Meaning Deconstruction is the postmodern project which identifies \"ideological inconsistencies or ambiguities in a text that prevent interpreters from claiming that it has a fixed meaning.\"29 Deconstruction seeks to dismantle the metanarrative of modernity, including the gospel.30 Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D. Senior Pastor First Baptist Church Norfolk, Virginia22 31Charlene Spretnak, States of Grace: The Recovery of Meaning in a Postmodern Age (San Francisco: HarperCollins, 1991), 4. 32Jacques Phenomena , Allison 33Gene Edward Veith, Jr., Postmodern Times: A Christian Guide to Contemporary Thought and Culture (Wheaton: Crossway Books, 1994), 51. 34Ferdinand de Saussure, \"Course in Linguistics,\" in Deconstruction in Literature and Philosophy , ed. Mark C. Taylor (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1986), 148-54.Charlene Spretnak suggests that deconstruction is the appropriate and necessary action for the responsible individual. The responsible individual must \"deconstruct\"objectified meaning in order to overcome the totalitarianismof the cultural constructs. 31 Without such dismantling, the oppressive force of the metanarrative continues to marginalize and subject humanity to violence through its singular control of reality.32 Literary criticism has provided the framework for postmodernism to flourish.33 From the postmodern outlook, language is a cultural construction, and meaning is a social construct. Signifiers may point to a particular object (the signified), but that object is also a signifier of something else.34 The result of these layers of signifiers is a mass of meaning that must be taken apart, layer by layer.

Baudrillard describes this project of postmodernism as a \"metamorphosis of the macro-structures into innumerable particles which bear within them all the stigmata of thenetworks and circuits -- each one forming its own micro-network and micro-circuit.\" 36 Deconstruction dismisses the intent of the author as irrelevant to interpretation. All interpretations, therefore, \"are equally valid or equally meaningless (depending upon your point of view).\"37 Deconstruction does not provide comfortable solutions, but rather it embraces fragmentation. Postmodernism seeks deconstruction without reconstruction. 38 Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D. Senior Pastor First Baptist Church Norfolk, Virginia24 39Edgar V.

The only absolute creed is the creed of pluralism. No religion has the right to pronounce itself right or true, and the others false, or even (in themajority view) relatively inferior.\" 41 In the words of Richard Rorty, pluralism consists of \"lots of cultural options but no privileged central discipline or practice,\" leaving the individuals \"unable to worship anything.\" Eric J.

Rorty'spragmatic postmodernism encourages the individual to\"rejoice in a lot of different things.\" 42 Lesslie Newbigin indicates that this brand of pluralism celebrates plurality \"as things to be approved and cherished.\"43 For the postmodern this celebration and exaltation of plurality leads to the acceptability of all truth-claims as equally valid. Fredric Jameson notes that the historical uniqueness of postmodernism is the \"sheer heteronomy andemergence of random and unrelated subsystems of all kinds\"which are unified in a theory of differentiation. 44 Within this unified theory, \"no functional conception of a ruling group, let alone, class, can be conceived.\"45 Postmodernism replaces \"master narratives\" with \"heteronomous, random petit narratives.\" None of these local stories gain privilege over other local stories.

(Nashville: Broadman Press, 1961), 2.Rorty proposes that \"there are many ways to talk about what is going on, and that none of them gets closer to the waythings are in themselves than any other.\" 46 Preeminent Challenges for Evangelism The prevailing themes of postmodernism present specific challenges for the evangelization of postmodern people.47 Yet, as McGrath notes, the future of Christianity depends upon evangelism.48 C. E. Autrey defines evangelism as \"urging the lost to accept Christ as Saviour [sic].\"49 Evangelism is the communication of the gospel to theunconverted so that they might repent of their sin, trust Jesus as their Savior, and surrender to Him as Lord in service through the local community of faith. Theevangelization of postmodern people encounters threepreeminent challenges: the gospel as metanarrative,epistemology, and hermeneutics. Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D. Senior Pastor First Baptist Church Norfolk, Virginia27 50J. Richard Middleton and Brian J. Walsh, Truth Is Stranger Than It Used to Be: Biblical Faith in a Postmodern Age (Downers Broadman, 1960), 82. 54Middleton and Walsh, Truth Is Stranger Than It Used to Be , 83.The Gospel as Metanarrative Evangelism bases its truth-claims on metanarrative of Scripture.50 Robert Webber describes the Christian metanarrative as \"a rehearsal of the saving deeds of God in history\" which culminate in Jesus Christ.51 The Christian metanarrative \"is the story of the meaning ofhistory.\" 52 Such a totalizing statement about the gospel, however, is unacceptable in the postmodern milieu. The Pentecost sermon is metanarrative (Acts 2). Here are the humanity of Jesus, God's approval, Jesus' power, man's wickedness, God's redemptive purpose,Jesus' death and resurrection, and God's judgment upon sin and death. Add to these God's promise of Jesus'ultimate victory at [H]is second advent (Acts and [H]is saviourhood (Acts2:36). . . . This body of truth became the gospel of theearly Christians and God honored it. 53 God's saving activity fulfilled in Jesus is the metanarrative that tells the \"true story of the world.\"54 The gospel is the Christian metanarrative. Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D. Senior Pastor First Baptist Church Norfolk, Virginia28 55Erickson, Postmodernizing the Faith , 151-52, 154. 56William J. Larkin, Culture and Biblical Hermeneutics: Interpreting and Applying the Authoritative Word in a Relativistic Age (Grand Rapids: Baker Books, 1988), 233-37. 57Stanley Grenz, Primer on Postmodernism , 163.The challenge for evangelism centers on presenting the gospel as metanarrative without altering the expression and content of the Christian faith to make the gospelpalatable to the postmodern deconstructionist. 55 Evangelism is the proclamation that Jesus Christ is the ontological and epistemological basis for salvation and life. In postmodern thought, the very essence of the gospel demands deconstruction.56 The Challenge of Epistemology With the dismantling of all metanarratives, including the gospel, postmodernism presents the challenge of epistemology in the evangelistic effort. Evangelization of postmodern people depends upon the communication of thegospel which propositionally corresponds to reality. AsStanley Grenz suggests, the postmodern rejection of the\"reigning epistemological principle -- the correspondence theory of truth . . . undermines Christian claims that ourdoctrinal formulations state objective truth.\" 57 Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D. Senior Pastor First Baptist Church Norfolk, Virginia29 58Francis Schaeffer, \"He Is There and He Is -- Part Man's Epistemological the Mirror of Nature , 140. 60Merold Westphal, \"Levinas and the Immediacy of Face,\" Faith and Philosophy 10 (October 1993): 491-92. McGuiness (London: Routlege, 1961), \u00a76.52-\u00a76.522. 63Rorty, Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature , 159.Epistemology is the study of the \"process of knowing.\"58 Rorty states that epistemology is a discipline seeking to discover \"the nature, origin, and limits of human knowledge.\"59 The rejection of foundations and project of deconstruction in postmodernism, however, create a problemin epistemology. When no ultimate origin for the foundation of meaning exists, the question arises, \"How can I know?\" 60 For Rorty, the answer to this question is to \"get beyond\" epistemology.61 Rorty suggests that the epistemological quest results in the ineffable, by which the \"recontextualization of signs\" unceasingly alters meaning.62 A systematic theory of meaning in postmodernism, therefore,does not exist. The \"supposed\" foundations of knowledge are merely the \"product of the choice of perceptual metaphors\" rather than a presentation of corresponding reality. 63 Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D. Senior Pastor First Baptist Church Norfolk, Virginia30 64Martin Heidegger, Introduction to Metaphysics , trans. Ralph Manheim (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1959), 185. 65Rorty, Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature , 209- 212. Rorty takes this challenge up in chapter 5, entitled,\"From Epistemology to Hermeneutics.\" 66Millard J. Erickson, Evangelical Interpretation: Perspectives on Hermeneutical Issues (Grand Rapids: Baker Books, 1993), 51-52. The gospel witness seeks to open the avenue for the acquisition of truth by the postmodern.Rorty approvingly cites Heidegger's idea that objectivity in epistemology emerges from the description of things \"beforeus\" which is personal perception rather than therepresentation of reality. 64 Rorty, therefore, proposes to replace epistemology with the justification of meaning through the social context.65 The abandonment of epistemology presents a problem for the evangelization of postmodern people. Evangelismconsists of a \"biblical doctrine of epistemology.\" 66 The Holy Spirit leads the individual to the acquisition of truthand meaning (John 16:8-13). With the removal of epistemology, the work of the Holy Spirit and the gospel becomes simply another metaphor of perception rather than atrue description of reality in postmodernism. The Challenge of Hermeneutics Although originally a theological discipline, hermeneutics has broadened to include a variety of study. Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D. Senior Pastor First Baptist Church Norfolk, Virginia31 67Klein, et al., Biblical Interpretation , in Hermeneutics by Rapids: Baker Books, 8-11. 69Mark C.

(New York: Crossroad, 1982), 3. 72Stephen Moore, Poststructuralism and the New Testament: Derrida and Foucault at the Foot of the Cross (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1994), 7-8.Hermeneutics is a set of principles which is utilized \"to understand what something means, to comprehend what amessage -- written, oral, or visual -- is endeavoring tocommunicate.\" 67 Currently, hermeneutics exists as a philosophical as well as theological discipline.68 Deconstruction presents a philosophical and theological movement in Taylor's \"death of God\"69 and Roland Barthes' \"countertheological refusal of God\"70 represent theological and philosophical proposals. While Carl Rashke suggests that \"deconstruction is the death of God put in writing,\"71 Stephen Moore contends that Derrida and his brand of deconstruction exists in a \"muteddialogue with theology,\" and he suggests that deconstruction is not \"utterly inimical to theological concerns.\" 72 Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D. Senior Pastor First Baptist Church Norfolk, Virginia32 73Jacques Derrida, Limited Inc (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1988), 61-62. 74Kevin J. Vanhoozer, Is There a Meaning in This Text? The Bible, The Reader, and the Morality of Literary Knowledge (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1998), 38.Whether viewed from a negative or neutral view, postmodern hermeneutics speaks to the theological endeavor ofevangelism. Through deconstruction postmodernism dismisses the author in the hermeneutical process. Derrida suggests thatthe intent of the author does not lead to the ultimatemeaning, because \"the possibility of its being repeated another time -- breaches, divides, expropriates the 'ideal' plenitude or self-presence of intention.\" This \"iterability\" produces alternate meanings even while theauthor speaks or writes with a particular meaning in mind. The author's intention is \"contaminated\" by the possibilitythat what he says is \"(already, always, also) other than\"the author's intent. 73 The dismissal of the foundations and the disappearance of the author in postmodernism moves \"interpretation\" from a truth claim emerging from a text to a reference \"to what the reader makes of the text.\"74 Therefore, Rorty confidently suggests that hermeneutics is the appropriate remedy for the absence of epistemology. Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D. Senior Pastor First Baptist Church Norfolk, Virginia33 75Rorty, Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature , 315. 76Vanhoozer, Is There a Meaning in This Text analysis is instructive. Moore seeks to \"capsize the hierarchical opposition that established the parameters of the dialogue between Jesus and the Samaritan woman.\" He wants to demonstrate that the woman of Sychar is the \"moreenlightened partner in the dialogue.\" He traces the imageryof water in John's Gospel, ultimately demonstrating that\"Jesus' physical thirst [19:28], therefore, is the necessary precondition for the proleptic yielding up of that which isintended to satiate the spiritual thirst of the believer,namely, the Holy Spirit.\" Moore contends that \"thehierarchical opposition established at the well is invertedat the cross, the ostensibly superior, pleromatic term(living water, Spirit) being shown to depend for itseffective existence on the inferior, insufficient term (literal well water), contrary to everything that the Gospel has led us to expect.\"Rorty posits that hermeneutics is \"hope that the cultural space left by the demise of epistemology will not befilled.\" 75 Postmodern hermeneutics does not begin with meaning prior to interpretation. Even authorial intent does not provide a prior meaning. Rather, postmodernism suggests that \"what one finds in a text depends on what aims, categories, and perspectives one brings to it.\"76 According to Derrida, the \"signified always already is in the position of the signifier.\"77 No \"transcendental signified\" exists.78 Meaning, therefore, becomes the creation of the reader.79 Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D. Senior Pastor First Baptist Church Norfolk, Virginia34 80Hahn and Verhaagen, Reckless Hope Theme: History's Nth Great Hermeneutical Crisis,\" Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society 39 (Sept 1996): 447. 82Rorty, Philosophy and Mirror of Nature , 392-94. 83Ibid., 226-29.Todd Hahn and David Verhaagen have studied the influence of postmodernism in the Christian culture. They have found that the influence of postmodern hermeneutics hashampered the evangelistic effort of the church. The impact of relativism has wormed its way into the church. Take a look at our Bible studies. Manyinterpretations of the same passage are allowed andaccepted as equally valid. Everyone's opinion isconsidered equally viable. Respecting the ideas ofothers has been given precedence over a search for theactual intention of the author. In fact the unrealizedassumption is that one's sincere ideas are synonymouswith truth. 80 Postmodern hermeneutics leads to a indefinite number of equally valid interpretations of a particular text. AsRobert Yarborough correctly concludes, \"A contemporary commitment to hermeneutical pluralism, if not anarchy, is demanded by postmodern experience, with a primary casualtybeing God's Scriptural witness to unified, world.\" 81 Rorty trades epistemology for \"conversation.\"82 Conversation unfolds sentences, bringing about a relative, conceptual truth in the context of a particular community.83 Eric J.

Evangelism proclaims that the gospel isabsolute truth for all of humanity. 85 Possible Opportunities for Evangelism The postmodern condition also presents possible opportunities for the evangelistic task. Albert Mohler Jr. indicates that \"postmodernism may well represent a new evangelistic moment.\"86 The following postmodern confession elucidates the situation for evangelism: \"I have no beliefs. I belong to no community, tradition, or anything like that. I'm lost in this vast, vast world. I belong nowhere.\"87 Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D. Senior Pastor First Baptist Church Norfolk, Virginia36 88Ibid., 181-83. 89Jacques , ed. Mark C.

(Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1984), 211-216.This interview demonstrates that the yearning of the individual caught in the morass of a deconstructed life mayprovide opportunities for evangelism. Search for a Better Story Postmodern people are in search of better stories for personal existence. 88 They desire connections with stories that will bring fulfillment to their lives. Derrida concedes this postmodern yearning when he pronounces the possibility of \"nostalgia\" over what is lost in his project of diff\u00e9rance . Derrida calls for \"laughter and dance\" instead of nostalgia, because the \"quest for the proper word and the unique name\" continues.89 It is this quest that provides opportunity for the gospel in the evangelization of postmodern people. The only legitimate story in postmodern thought is the localized narrative.90 The local story, according to Alasdair MacIntyre, provides one interpretation of life.91 Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D. Senior Pastor First Baptist Church Norfolk, Virginia37 92This has been shown by Stephen Best and Douglas Kellner, Postmodern Theory: Critical Interrogations (New York: Guilford, 1991), 171-79. 93Grenz, A Primer on Postmodernism , 170.Postmodern people see their local stories as only one of innumerable, equally true stories. The buffet of localized narratives rests upon the table of the postmodern metanarrative.92 The postmodern individual faces the choices of a smorgasbord of narratives to provide significance and meaning to life. This represents the Derridean \"laughter and dance.\" The quest for the ultimate signifier and the most beneficial storyremains ever before the postmodern individual. Postmodernpeople are searching for the story that will satisfy theappetite of their souls. Although postmodernism rejects the gospel as metanarrative, it must respect it as a local narrative. It has no place of privilege at the postmodern table, but itcontinues to be served. What then is the advantage? Grenzoffers this description of opportunity: \"At the heart ofbeing a Christian is a personal encounter with God inChrist. . . . It is in this context of making sense out of life by means of recounting the story of a transformative religious experience that doctrinal propositions find theirimportance.\" 93 Postmodern people search for such a story. Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D.

Through the telling of thegospel, the power of God takes hold of people, leading themtoward salvation (Rom 1:16). The evangelistic witnesspresents postmodern people with a choice of a better storyfor their lives. When they encounter the gospel of JesusChrist, they determine whether the story of Christ providesa better story for their personal experience. As LeightonFord indicates, they choose \"either to reject the Story ofGod or to merge [their] story with His Story.\" 94 Search for Connection The outcome of postmodernism is a \"decentered self.\" The postmodern individual is \"free-falling\" amidst the chaotic waters of plurality.95 The concept of truth that is non-representational and communal has created a society of individuals who are disconnected and fragmented. The postmodern person searches for connections which will offer stability in life.96 Berger's description of the postmodern people in the flux of disorientation represents the search for a community that provides meaning in life. Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D. Senior Pastor First Baptist Church Norfolk, Virginia39 97Berger, The Sacred Canopy , 22. \"Anomy\" is the loss of any secure sense of meaningful order to the world. 98Grenz, Primer on Postmodernism , 169. 99R. Daniel Shaw, \"In Search of Post-modern Salvation,\" Evangelical Review of Theology 22 (1998): 57-59.In the postmodern world, \"reality and identity are malignantly transformed into meaningless figures of horror. To be in a society is to be 'sane' precisely in the sense ofbeing shielded from the ultimate 'insanity' of anomicterror. Anomy is unbearable to the point where theindividual may seek death in preference to it.\" 97 Grenz insightfully indicates that postmodern people are suspicious of verbal presentations of the gospel, but they are attracted to a community of believers in which the gospel is incarnated among the relationships. Thiscommunity is characterized by \"wholesome, authentic, andhealing relationships.\" 98 R. Daniel Shaw also connects the postmodern desire for community with the evangelistic mission of the church. The community of believers may offer a place of connection between the postmodern reality of this world and God's reality found in the gospel of Jesus Christ. The community of faith connects with postmodern people atthe point of need. 99 The postmodern search for connection provides a possible opportunity for the evangelization of postmodern people.

Beaudoin takes suffering as a possible avenue for connection with the gospel message, butalso warns against trivialization of suffering.Search for a Better Life The postmodern project is a search for a better life. Zygmunt Bauman suggests that postmodern people seek life freed from the oppressive forces of modernity. 100 The entire project of postmodernism seeks to divest individuals from the nightmare of the world in which they live and which the Enlightenment principles created. This nightmare includes the horrors of victimization, totalization,oppression, and injustice. 101 These descriptions indicate that postmodern people want a better life. The postmodern generation notes the inadequacies of the world.102 Tom Beaudoin suggests that the postmodern generation is \"suffering\" under the threat of nuclear holocaust, AIDS, and the national debt. Their \"suffering\" leads them to a \"spiritual crisis of meaning.\"103 Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D. Senior Pastor First Baptist Church Norfolk, Virginia41 104Ibid., 120. 120. S.

Davaney (Philadelphia: Trinity Press, 1991), 135.Ultimately, they seek liberty from the multitude of diversities which overwhelm them.104 The postmodern inability to access the absolute is the \"pleasure of pain,\" according to Lyotard.105 The painful pleasure of fragmented life, however, is not enough to satisfy the quest of the postmodern person. This fragmented life that they experience in their \"hermeneutics of suspicion\" creates a need to discover \"becomings of self\" inthe midst of deconstruction. Winquist suggests that thisreconstruction is found ultimately through a \"meaningfulcommunity\" of love. 106 The possible opportunity for evangelism is found in this quest for a better life in a community of love. Suffering is the common language of all generations.107 According to Fiorenza, \"Suffering brings us to the bedrock of human existence.\"108 The reality of suffering presents common ground for the witness and the postmodern person.

An Apostolic Approach to the Postmodern Challenge J\u00fcrgen Moltmann wrote: \"The apostolic church is the missionary church.\"110 As noted in the introduction, an \"apostolic approach\" refers to the examples, directions, and procedures of the New Testament (NT) church recorded especially in Acts and the Pauline epistles. An apostolic approach utilizes the work and ministry of the apostolicchurch as the paradigm for the evangelization of postmodernpeople today. The evangelical community offers various biblical paradigms related to the postmodern challenge. 111 Millard Erickson evaluates the primary approaches to postmodernism within evangelical circles. He identifies four approaches. The first approach endeavors to \"alter the expression and even the content of the Christian faith.\"112 Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D. Senior Pastor First Baptist Church Norfolk, Virginia43 113Long, Generating Hope , 19-22. Long modifies the five models of H. Richard Niebuhr's Christ and Culture (New York: Harper and Row, 1956). 114Leonard Sweet, Post-Modern Pilgrims: First Century Passion for the 21st Century World (Nashville: Broadman and Holman, 2000), 143-47. 123-25, 152. See also, Middleton and Walsh, Truth Is Stranger Than It Used to Be , 172-85. 116Erickson, Postmodernizing the Faith , 152.The church must in some way adjust the gospel to the postmodern objections to truth as objective, referential,and corresponding to reality. The gospel as metanarrativemust also be adjusted in expression according to thisapproach. Jimmy Long describes this approach as the\"assimilating church,\" which adopts \"some of culture'scharacteristics\" in order to become relevant to thatculture. 113 Leonard Sweet espouses this approach to some extent when he suggests that the church embrace postmodern hermeneutics.114 Erickson charges Middleton and Walsh with this approach \"by the way in which they recast the method ofutilizing Scripture.\" 115 The second approach seeks to alter the \"method and means\" of gospel witness. Erickson suggests that movementto a narrative presentation of the gospel serves as one example of this approach. 116 Todd Hahn and David Verhaagen indicate that this type of alteration is good and necessary. Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D. Senior Pastor First Baptist Church Norfolk, Virginia44 117Hahn and Verhaagen, , 26-27. Long highlights correctly the need to remain radically biblical but not necessarily traditional. This means that the paradigm of Scripture informs the evangelistic witness, but the tradition of the church is not necessarily synonymous withthe Scriptural paradigm. 121David Wells, No Place for Truth: Or Whatever Happened to Evangelical Theology (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1993), 102-104.The narrative method speaks \"to the specific and unique needs of this generation.\"117 The proponents of an alteration of method or means seek to communicate and relate intimately to postmodern people.118 The third approach consists of no adjustment, either in expression or method.119 Long identifies this approach with the \"unchanging church\" which ignores culture. These proponents seek to maintain their traditions by \"rising above culture.\" For Long, this approach is indicative of churches which elevate traditionalism abovebiblicism. 120 The \"kerygmatic\" proponents of this approach, however, contend that adjustment in expression or method is not necessary. They suggest that the power of the gospel, illumined by the Holy Spirit, is capable of reaching postmodern people.121 Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D. Senior Pastor First Baptist Church Norfolk, Virginia45 122Long, Generating Hope , Postmodernity (Cambridge: Basil Blackwell, 1989), 113-14, 117.The fourth approach involves dismantling the premises of postmodernism.122 Proponents of this approach contend that postmodern people can be reached through a demonstration of the \"impossibility of living\" in the postmodern way.123 Veith represents this approach when he evaluates postmodernism as \"passive, cynical, and insecure.\"124 The church which engages the deficiencies of postmodernism demonstrates to postmodern people the \"end-result\" of a postmodern life. It stresses the contradictions of postmodernism so that the postmodern will see eventually the impossibility of living a meaningfulpostmodern life. 125 An apostolic approach offers several advantages to the current proposals. The first advantage of an apostolic approach is fidelity to Scripture as the principal guide in faith and practice. An apostolic approach offers a paradigm for evangelism in light of an exegetical analysis of the NTchurch. Evangelization flows out of the commendation ofScripture rather than out of an accommodation to culture. Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D. Senior Pastor First Baptist Church Norfolk, Virginia46 126Alister McGrath, \"The Christian Church's Response to Pluralism,\" Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society 35 (December 1992): 500. 127Michael Green, Evangelism in the Early Church (London: the Gospels: Methodology and Contextualization,\" Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society 27 (March 1984): 33.In other words, the methodology begins with Scripture rather than with postmodernism.126 Scripture is the guiding principle of faith and practice. The second advantage of an apostolic approach is effectiveness.127 An apostolic approach seeks to implement the principles of the apostolic church, which effectively evangelized a relativistic, pluralistic culture. The apostolic church \"sought 'redemptive analogies' in its presentation of the gospel. . . . Yet at the same time theChurch refused to compromise the content of her message.\" 128 In the same manner, the contemporary church must apply the principles of the apostolic church to communicate the gospel without compromising the content of the message. The third advantage is the community-emphasis in an apostolic approach. From its inception, the apostolic church maintained and emphasized community (Acts 2:41-47). The postmodern culture desires community, and the church can provide the specific answer to this yearning for connection. Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D. Senior Pastor First Baptist Church Norfolk, Virginia47 129Stanley Grenz, Created for Community: Connecting Christian Belief with Christian Living (Grand Rapids: Baker Books, 1996; reprint, 1998), 207.As Grenz points out, the church is the \"pioneer community\" of individuals who \"live out in the present the gloriouscommunity for which God created us.\" 129 An apostolic approach presents the evangelistic ministry of the NT church as the starting-point for the evangelization of postmodern people. The following chapter deals with the role of the Holy Spirit in the evangelistic approach of the apostolic church. The coming of the Spirit at Pentecost (Acts 2)finds deeper significance through an examination of the promise of Joel's prophecy (Joel 2:28-32) and the promise ofChrist concerning the Spirit of truth in John's Gospel. This writer will seek to show the implications of Pentecostand the Spirit's work in the evangelization of the ancientworld and in the evangelization of the postmodern world. Eric J. Thomas, Ph. D. Senior Pastor First Baptist Church Norfolk, Virginia1\"But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you and you will be My witnesses in Jerusalemand all Judea and Samaria and to the end of the earth\" (Acts 1:8).

Jesus declared, record of the apostolic church reveals the worldview by which it evangelized the ancient world. This worldview stands in contrast to the postmodern mind-setin several ways. First, with its premise of anti-foundationalism, postmodernism rejects any \"interpretationof the particular historical purposes of groups andindividuals\" through \"objective, transhistorical truths.\" 2 The apostolic church in Acts believed that God purposed49 3J. C. O'Neill, The Theology of Acts in Its Historical Setting , 2d ed. (London: SPCK, 1970), 177-78. 4Adolf Schlatter, The Theology of the Apostles: The Development of New Testament Theology , trans. A. J. K\u00f6stenberger (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1998), 28-31, 361.everything in history to culminate in the Christ-event. This divine purpose continues through the work of the Spiritin the church. According to J. C. O'Neill, \"the success ofChristianity, despite all the set-backs it encountered, wasused to support its claim to be the only true religion.\" 3 Schlatter further suggests that the apostolic churchpossessed the conviction that Christ directed the community\"from within and from without,\" so that He is the supremeinterpretation of history and the future. 4 In other words, an apostolic approach promotes the conviction that theChristian way is true because it corresponds to the externalreality of God's redemptive activity in history. Second, postmodernism's exaltation of \"communal truth\" dismisses any proposal of absolute, universal truth. Accordingly, any claim to truth is the creation of thesocial group and context. The apostolic church, however,construed truth as the external product of God's mindcommunicated to humanity by God's Spirit. Insightfully,John Frame proposes that \"communal truth\" demands omniscientjustification in the social context, so that all potential50 5John Frame, \"Christianity and Contemporary Epistemology,\" Westminster Journal of Theology 52 (Spring 1990): 136. 6Everett F. Harrison, The Apostolic Church (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1985), 113.objections to any particular truth-claim may be refuted. If, however, God were a member of this social group, thenHis omniscience would provide the necessary justificationfor \"objective knowledge.\" 5 With the coming of the Spirit at Pentecost, the Spirit of truth provides the necessaryjustification of \"objective knowledge\" and universal truthin an apostolic approach (John 16:13). Third, postmodernism's \"precommitment\" to deconstruction dismisses the possibility of certainty inmeaning. The apostolic church, however, found meaning inthe Spirit's illumination of Christ's doctrine through theapostles and Scripture. 6 The apostolic church believed that the Spirit indwells and instructs believers within thecommunity, so that they discover the intention of the God ofrevelation. Finally, with its preeminence of pluralism, postmodernism disdains any proposal of an ultimate \"masternarrative.\" The apostolic church, however, believed thatthe gospel is the \"master narrative\" which presents the onlytrue pathway to life. Peter's statement to the Sanhedrin in51 7\"And there is no salvation in another, for there is no other name under heaven which has been given in humanityby which we must be saved.\" 8C. E. Autrey, Evangelism 1964), 78. 9Gordon Kaufmann, \"Religious Diversity, Historical Consciousness, and Christian Theology,\" Journal of Religion 68 (October 1988): 9. 10Ibid. 11Schubert M. Ogden, \"Problems in the Case for a Pluralistic Theology of Religions,\" Journal of Religion 68Acts 4:12 depicts this conviction in the apostolic church. In answer to the Sanhedrin, indicates, this statement declares that Christianity cannot \"peacefully coexist\" with a plurality of religious options,for \"Christ and not man was the Messiah.\" 8 This conviction stands in contrast to the postmodern proposal. Unlike Gordon Kaufmann, an apostolicapproach does not suggest that the Christian faith is onlyone among many worldviews imaginatively constructed in the\"search for orientation in life.\" 9 Neither does the community construe the communication of the gospel as thearticulation of \"one particular perspective on life amongothers.\" 10 An apostolic approach presents the gospel as the only \"universal salvific truth.\"1152 (October 1988): 498. 12James D.

Thefollowing discussion will seek to indicate how Godalleviates the barrier of competing worldviews and opens thedoor for evangelization of postmodern people. Pentecost and the Spirit of Truth, Acts 2:1-13 Pentecost is the starting-point for a discussion of an apostolic approach to evangelize postmodern people. Pentecost is an historical and theological hinge for therole of the Spirit and evangelism. 12 The fulfillment of Joel's prophecy (Joel 2:28-32) demonstratethe significance implications ofthe Spirit in the evangelization of postmodern people. 13 Fulfillment of the Visionary Gift, Joel 2:28-32 The coming of the Spirit at Pentecost presents the53 14Merrill Unger, \"The 175. 15See the discussion on the relationship between duvnami~ and ejxousiva below on Bibelgesellschaft, 1966-1977).

This \"visionary gift\" is the abiding presence of God withHis people through His Spirit. Calvin surmises that theprophecy of Joel 2:28-32 16 promises \"something greater than what the fathers under the Law experienced,\" for God \"didnot pour out His Spirit so abundantly and so largely underthe Law, as after the manifestation of Christ.\" 17 Through Joel, God said, rc;B;AlK;Al[' yjiWrAta, JwPov]a, keAyrej}a' hy:h;w .18 This prophecy depicts a future when God will establish His54 19Duane A.

When God pours out His Spirit ( jWr), He pours Himself upon whom He chooses to accomplish the work He desires, 20 so that the intention of God is \"the personal experience of everymember of the religious community.\" 21 Joel indicates the essence of the \"visionary gift\" through three terms: abn (to prophesy), .lj (to dream), and har (to see). Keil suggests that abn is the general designation of the prophetic gift, and that visions and dreams are two forms of prophetic revelation.22 When God pours out His Spirit, He will reveal Himself and His word toHis people, and they will proclaim it to the world.

Schniedewind suggests that God clothes the prophet with HisSpirit, so that the person receives and delivers His wordwith the people to whom he is sent. 26 Having received this \"visionary gift\" of God through revelation, the prophetdiscloses to humanity \"what otherwise would remainconcealed.\" 27 Von Rad suggests that the prophet \"completely submerges his own ego\" and speaks \"as if he were his master56 28Gerhard von Rad, Old Testament Theology , vol. 2, The Theology of Israel's Prophetic Tradition , trans.

Fretheim suggests that Christ is the \"culmination\" of the \"visionary gift.\" 29 Jesus fully reveals divine truth, proclaims the way of forgiveness, and calls fordecision as prophet. 30 His ministry as prophet extends to His followers. Thus, Pentecost marks the continuation ofthe \"visionary gift\" by which God's people fulfill thefunction of prophet with Christ. Pentecost signifies a new relationship between God and humanity. 31 Although Joel most likely envisions rc;B;AlK; solely as Israel,32 Pentecost (Acts 2) and the outpouring of57 33I. H. Marshall, The Acts of the Apostles , Tyndale New Testament Commentary (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1980;reprint, 1999), 193.

Revell, 1987), 124.the Spirit 10:43).33 Everyone who believes in Jesus will receive forgiveness of sin and \"will stand in a relationship of immediacy to God\"through the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. 34 Pentecost's events in Acts 2 provide a framework for the fulfillment of Joel's prophecy. Indeed, \"the wholehistorical context in which it [Pentecost] takes place showsthat it was the outgrowth and development of God's pastdealings with Israel.\" 35 Pentecost was the culminating act in an agelong process of redemptive activity, the final step in the descent ofthe divine into human. Jesus as an external Presencenow became enthroned Sovereign in the hearts of Hispeople. A new era of the Kingdom had begun in Spirit-endued witnesses. The Gospel had become life and powerwithin them. At last they were ready to go forth aslaborers in the harvest of the Lord. 36 The followers of Christ continue His ministry in the58 37C. E. Autrey, The the Theology of John,\" Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society 35 (December 1992): 462.world.37 They reveal God's truth, proclaim His redemptive work, and call the world to accept His salvation. Likewise, Pentecost elucidates contemporary application for apostolic evangelism with postmodern people. An apostolic approach depends upon the duvnami~ promised by Christ (Acts 1:8), inaugurated at Pentecost (Acts 2), and continued today through the presence of the Spirit. Christ's followers continue in the postmodern milieu as a\"nation of prophets\" possessed by God's Spirit to accomplishHis redemptive mission in the postmodern world. Selected Paraclete Passages in John's Gospel An examination of the Paraclete passages in John's Gospel provides a theological foundation for engagingindividuals in the postmodern milieu. 38 These passages demonstrate that Christ's redemptive mission \"is continuedthrough the Paraclete and the disciples.\" 39 Much of the literature on these passages focuses59 40\"Eschatological comforter,\" [J. G. Davies, \"The Primary Meaning of paravklhto\" ,\" Journal of Theological Studies 4 (1953): 35-38]; the spirit of messianic proclamation [C. K. Barrett, The Gospel According to St. John, 2nd ed. (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1978), 461-63]; \"sponsor\" or \"supporter\" [K. Grayston, \"The Meaning of PARAKLETOS,\" Journal for the Study of the New Testament 13 (1981): 67-82]. Brown suggests that transliteration is bestsince the term is so packed with significance [Raymond E. Brown, \"The Paraclete in the Fourth Gospel,\" New Testament Studies 13 (1967): 118-19]. 41C. K. Barrett, Gospel According to St. John , 463. 42G. Quell, s.v. \" ajlhvqeia,\" in Theological Dictionary of the New Testament , 10 vols., ed. G. Kittel, trans. and ed. G. W. Bromiley (Grand Rapids: reprint, 1978), 1:232-33. Hereafter cited, 43Ibid., 1:234-35.upon the various interpretations of the term, paravklhto~ Jesus identifies the \"the Spirit who communicates truth.\"41 The concept of truth, hJ ajlhvqeia, needs further examination. John's use of ajlhvqeia is closely akin to the Hebrew term tm,a. In a general sense, tm,a denotes that which is solid, valid, or trustworthy.42 When used in connection with God's revelation, however, tm,a denotes that which corresponds to fact or that which is not false.43 When the OT prophets spoke, they communicated God's truth to others. In this communication, they spoke the word of God as tm,a (Jer 23:29). Quell, therefore, suggests that v. \" ajlhvqeia,\" TDNT, 1:235. 45C. H. Dodd, The Interpretation of the Fourth Gospel (Cambridge: University Press, 1953), 177. Dodd makes this contention in light of John's specific use of the termin his Gospel. 46Dennis R. Lindsay, \"What Is Truth? jAlhvqeia in the Gospel John,\" Restoration Quarterly 35 (1993): 129-45. 47Ibid., 142. 48C. K.

The HolySpirit reveals truth, which corresponds to fact and eternalreality. Barrett indicates that John employs ajlhvqeia as \"the Christian revelation brought by and revealed in Jesus.\" 48 Indeed, in the context of chapter 14, ajlhvqeia in verse 17 calls to mind the self-appellation of Jesus in verse 6: (John 14:6).49 The Spirit of truth unveils, not merely a concept of truth, but the person61 50D.

This isthe very core of the biblical message. Truth is somethingthat happens, that God does. Jesus Christ not only reveals,[but also] He at once fulfills and realizes the will ofGod.\" 52 The Spirit makes divine reality accessible -- ultimately in the person of Jesus Christ.53 Furthermore, the Spirit of truth unveils the significance of Christ's teachings to His followers. In verse 26 Jesus didavxei pavnta62 things and call to your mind all things which I have said to you\" (John 14:26). 55Dunn, Jesus and the Spirit , 351-52. 56D. A. Carson, Gospel According to John , 505. 57Ibid., 541-42.presents a difficulty in interpretation. Some commentators, such as Dunn, conclude that the didavxei pavnta of 14:26 includes \"new revelation,\" albeit controlled by the original revelation of Christ.55 The Holy Spirit directs the minds of the followers of Christ to the doctrine taught by Jesus. D. A. Carson, however, indicates that the Spirit of truthspeaks directly to the disciples. Accordingly, theParaclete's work is to help the disciples grasp thesignificance of Christ's teaching following theresurrection. 56 Carson, however, does allow for the implication of illumination by the Spirit at work inbelievers today. 57 Stuhlmacher indicates, on the other Gospel of John emphaticallydeclares that the testimony of Jesus of the post-Eastercommunity was empowered and born by the Spirit-Paraclete (John 16:7ff.). With the biblical martyria it is generally a question of a word-testimony which equips humanity for theknowledge and proclamation of God in the power of the HolySpirit.\" 59Ibid., 222.

The Spirit, also,illumines the deposit of divine revelation to believers. Through this ministry, the Spirit equips believers toproclaim the gospel to others. Through the Spirit thebelievers of Christ \"bis heute die Stimme Gottes und seinesChristus vernimmt\" through Scripture. 59 Erickson also indicates that the ministry of the Spirit of truth helps\"believers today to understand Scripture.\" 60 The role of the Paraclete as the Spirit of truth is to teach and toremind disciples of the revelation of God through the lifeand ministry of Jesus Christ so that they might share thegospel of Christ with the conviction that it is absolutetruth. The Paraclete aids followers of Christ for the64 61Todd Hahn and David Verhaagen, Reckless Hope: Understanding and Reaching Baby Busters (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1996), 39. 62\"Whenever the Paraclete whom I send to you from the Father may come, the Spirit of truth who comes from theFather, that one will testify concerning Me; and youtestify, because you are with Me postmodern world. The Spirit illumines the followers of Christ today so that they mightbear witness to the gospel in their world with conviction. 61 Rather than promoting personal opinion, the Spirit investsbelievers with the conviction that the gospel is truth. The theme of the Spirit of truth in John 15:26-27 elucidates the Paraclete's role in the conviction of truth. The Spirit of truth works in the world as witness to Jesus (marturhvsei peri; ejmou` ). In of \"witness to ascertainable facts\" and \"the making known and confessing convictions.\"63 The role of the Spirit is to make known the facts concerning Jesus Christ. Allison A.Trites indicates that the witness-motif presents anhistorical apologetic concerning the miracles and65 64Allison A.

This could be thesecond person indicative, but the context appears to suggestthe imperative. resurrection of Jesus for a lost world. 64 Indeed, the apostolic approach for the evangelization of the ancientworld centers upon the concept of witness. 65 Jesus sends the Spirit of truth to empower His followers as witnessesthrough His own activity of witness. The Spirit empowerswitnesses sufficiently in the postmodern world. Jesus states that the witness of the Spirit conjoins with the witness of His followers in John 15:27. Bultmann suggests that \"the Spirit is the power of theproclamation in the community.\" 66 John uses different tenses of marturevw in verses 26 and 27. When he describes the testimony of the Spirit of truth, John uses the futuretense, marturhvsei . This represents the future work of the Spirit of truth, which is to bear witness concerning Jesus. In verse 27, John uses the imperative, marturei`te , which denotes a command and mandate. 67 The followers of Christ have the mandate to join with the mission of the Spirit of66 68Leon Morris, The Gospel According to John (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1971), 684. 69Herman A.

Connor, Work of the Holy Spirit , 89-90.truth and bear witness concerning Jesus Christ.68 The Spirit clothes the followers of Christ and their testimonyfor effective evangelization. Hoyt further suggests that the Spirit provides the duvnami~ for \"credible witness.\" 69 John further describes the Spirit's work in 16:13. He highlights the work of the Spirit in the illumination ofChrist's followers. The role of the Spirit, according toJohn Frame, is to meet the need in believers \"for inwardchange, a need to reconcile ourselves to what God hasalready revealed.\" 70 The Spirit bears witness of Christ to the world, which is hostile toward Jesus and the gospel. The HolySpirit is on mission \"to bear witness to Christ and to makeChrist real to men.\" 71 This is the work of the Spirit in 16:7-11. The key term in these verses is ejlevgcw. B\u00fcchsel suggests that ejlevgcw usually means 564-65; George R. Beasley-Murray, John, Word Biblical Commentary (Dallas: 1987), 280-81. 74I. De la three o{ti-sentences concern, in what way the Spirit condemns regarding the named entity the worldto its humiliation.\"and to summon him to repentance.\" 72 Bultmann posits a legal setting in which the Spirit stands as the prosecuting attorney.73 De la Potterie indicates that ejlevgcw in this passage is \"d\u00e9montrer l'erreur ou les torts de quelqu'un.\"74 Kovsmo~ is the object of the Spirit's work of ejlevgcw. In distinctively Johannine language, the kovsmo~ consists of those who are apart from Christ and opposed to Him. Thekovsmo~ is the aim of the redemptive mission of God through the Spirit. 75 John indicates that the Paraclete works in the world to lead lost humanity to repentance. The o}ti clauses provide further indication of the Spirit's work (John 16:9-11). Bauer indicates clauses as68 77Carson, 78Beasley-Murray, John, 281. 79Thomas C. Oden, Life in the Spirit , 91.explicative, by which the Spirit demonstrates how the world is wrong about sin, righteousness, and judgment. Carson seeks to maintain the parallelism of the three o{ti clauses and concludes that the Spirit speaks to the world's sin, pseudo-righteousness, and wrong estimation of Jesus and their spiritual reality.77 Through witness, the Spirit reveals the truth of sin, demonstrates thepathway to righteousness, and warns of impending judgment. The proclamation of the followers of Jesus is the instrumentwhich the Spirit of truth uses to accomplish His work in theworld. 78 Through the witness of Christ's followers, the Paraclete penetrates the evangelistic obstacles to bringindividuals to the awareness of their need for repentanceand salvation through Christ. 79 The promise of the \"visionary gift\" and the promise of the Paraclete become a reality at Pentecost. God poursout His Spirit upon believers in fulfillment of the OTprophecy and Christ's promise. Believers, then and now,live in personal intimacy with the Father and continue the69 80Walt Russell, \"The Holy Spirit's Ministry in the Fourth Gospel,\" Grace Theological Journal 8 (Fall 1987): 237. 81David Wells, God the Evangelist: How the Spirit Works to Bring Men and Women to Faith (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1987; Johns HopkinsUniversity Press, 1997), 295-302.ministry of His Son. 80 The Holy Spirit: The Bridge for the Objective Truth of the Gospel The evangelization of postmodern people occurs in a chaotic kovsmo~ in which postmodernism is hostile to the gospel as objective truth. Bearing witness to Jesus in the postmodern world presents the challenge of epistemology. The ministry of the Spirit, however, provides a bridgebetween the gospel metanarrative and postmodern incredulity. David Wells correctly argues that the evangelistic witnessis effective \"because of the mighty power of the HolySpirit, who alone is able to turn rebellious sinners intoobedient followers of Christ.\" 81 Epistemology: A Postmodern Dilemma The postmodern premise suggests that one may not know truth because language is not a clear nor reliablerepresentation of truth. 82 By implication, postmodernism70 83Julian N. Hartt, \"Theological Investments in Story: Some Comments on Recent Developments and Some Proposals,\" Journal of the American Academy of Religion 52 (1984): 121. 84Kelsey's approach extends Frei's proposal. See Hans Frei, The Eclipse of Biblical Narrative (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974).proposes that the gospel is an illusionary foundation, since no foundations for knowledge or certainty exist. Thispresents a dilemma in the evangelistic work of the church. Julian Hartt rightly assesses this postmodern dilemma: \"Ifthe ontological truth-claims of the New Testament are false,then the Christian religious life, understood and pursued asthe knowledge and service of God in Jesus Christ, is foundedon an illusion.\" 83 With epistemology jettisoned in postmodernism, the evangelistic ministry of the church submerges into aquagmire of postmodern skepticism and doubt in relation tothe gospel. The postliberal and revisionist approaches topostmodernism increase this skepticism. For example, the postliberal approach begins with the \"self\" and moves to Scripture. David Kelsey'sdiscussion of Scripture presents a postliberal approach. 84 Kelsey sees the authority of a text in its pragmatic andproductive uses within the context of a particular71 85David H. Kelsey, The Uses of Scripture in Recent Theology (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1975), 150. 86Ibid., 89. 87David Tracy, Blessed Rage for Order: The New Pluralism in Theology (New York: Seabury Press, 1975; reprint, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996), 43-45. 88Ibid., 175.community.85 For Kelsey, texts are authoritative on the basis of \"how they are used in the Christian community.\"86 Along these lines, however, Kelsey's postliberal approachdevolves into an extreme pragmatic theory of truth, wherebysomething is true because it works. Evangelization ofpostmodern people, then, depends primarily upon thedemonstration of the gospel's pragmatic effects as a sign ofits veracity rather than upon the work of the Spirit oftruth. David Tracy proposes a revisionist model which begins with self and moves to questions about God andScripture. The revisionist approach couples \"Christiantexts\" with \"common human experience and language\" as thetwo principle sources of theology. 87 Tracy offers a theology which provides a \"proper understanding of ourcommon experience and its fundamental continuity with theGod proclaimed in the Christian scriptures.\" 88 For Tracy the gospel may be true if it is \"existentially meaningful,\"72 89Ibid., 71. 90W.

Lofthouse, \"The Holy Spirit Acts and the Fourth Gospel,\" Expository Times 52 (1940-41): 336. 91Millard Erickson, Christian Theology , 890. 92\"All authority has been given to Me in heaven and upon the earth.\" 93W. Foerster, s.v. experiential analysis.89 Truth is determined by the self-enlightenment which a text provides. In this light, evangelization ofpostmodern people depends upon the gospel's ability to leadthe individual to self-understanding. An apostolic approach, however, presents a different solution to the dilemma of epistemology. The\"conception of the Spirit\" in the evangelistic ministry ofan apostolic approach answers the postmodern skepticism. 90 The Spirit illumines the hearts and minds of believers through the Scripture to the truth of God found inJesus Christ, 91 so that each believer receives the \"Spirit of Christian proclamation.\" This outpouring inheres evangelization of postmodern people. Although postmodernism rejects thistype of authority, Jesus declares Geoffrey W. Bromiley (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1998), 16. 95\"Therefore as you go nations.\" s.v. \" duvnami~,\" TDNT, 2:284-85.Pannenberg notes that \"as the Spirit bears witness in believers to Jesus as the truth of God, they themselves areecstatically raptured and are outside themselves in Jesus,while conversely Jesus is in them to bind them in fellowshipwith one another, and along with Jesus the Father also takesup [H]is dwelling in believers.\" 94 Just as Jesus possesses ejxousiva, He invests His ejxousiva through the Spirit to His followers. This continual presence of Christ in believers produces the authority for evangelism in a postmodern world. It is this ejxousiva of Christ which produces the right and responsibility of His followers to poreuqevnte~ ou\\n maqhteuvsate pavnta ta; e[qnh (Matt 28:19a).95 Bearing witness in the epistemological dilemma of postmodernism highlights the significance of duvnami~. Indeed, the basic meaning of duvnami~ centers on one's ability to perform a task.96 In the context of evangelism, duvnami~ is the enabling power of God in the witness of Christ's followers. According to Christ's promise (Acts 1:8), thispower comes upon Christ's followers through the Holy Spirit. 74 97Ibid., 311. 98This language represents Paul's experience on the Damascus road (Acts 9). The layers of rabbinicinterpretation were deconstructed or unraveled in a decisiveencounter with Jesus Christ, the truth. Upon thisencounter, Paul's epistemological skepticism of Jesus Christas Messiah and Lord was diffused. The power of the gospelled him to repentance and salvation.The Spirit \"dispenses and mediates\" the power which enabled Christ to fulfill His mission and which equips His followersto \"stand in the place of Jesus and continue His work.\" 97 The Spirit of truth joins Christ's followers in thewitnessing encounter to bear witness together that JesusChrist is the way, truth, and life. The Spirit further infuses the witnessing encounter with duvnami~ to lead postmodern people to truth. The conversion of Saul provides exemplifies the evangelization in the midst of epistemological uncertainty (Acts 9). Although Saul rejected the \"truth-claims\" of the gospel(Acts 6-7), the power of the Spirit of truth deconstructshis epistemological skepticism (Rom 1:16-17). 98 In the same manner, the Spirit of truth deconstructs the epistemologicaldilemma of postmodern people. Borrowing cautiously from Tracy's revisionist approach, the Spirit of truth establishes the gospel ofChrist as \"meaningful\" to the postmodern person through the conviction ( ejlevgcw) of sin, righteousness, and judgment. 75 99David Harvey, The Condition of Postmodernity (Cambridge: Basil Blackwell, 1989), 44-45.The Spirit of truth establishes the \"meaning\" of the gospel through the empowered, internally coherent proclamation ofChrist's witnesses. The Spirit of truth establishes the\"truth\" of the gospel experientially and existentially inpostmodern people. The Spirit of truth answers thepostmodern dilemma of epistemology through His witness to truth and the conviction of truth for the postmodern kovsmo~ of the truth. In this light, the evangelization of postmodern people depends primarily upon the proclamation ofthe gospel in the power of the Holy Spirit to leadpostmodern people to truth who is Jesus Christ. Beyond Babel: Epistemology and eJtevrai~ glwvssai~ The evangelization of postmodern people presents the problem of language in a world of pluralities. Theglobal scope of evangelization for the apostolic andcontemporary church creates the difficulties of language andculture. David Harvey describes postmodernism as arejection of any \"meta-language\" which can overcome theplurality of \"power-discourses\" or \"language-games.\" 99 The events of Pentecost point to the \"meta-language\" of Godthrough the Spirit which overcomes the problem of languages. Dunn suggests that \"the glossolalia of Pentecost76 100Dunn, Jesus and the Spirit , 174. 101\"They began to speak with other tongues\" (Acts 2:4), and \"Each one was hearing them speaking in his ownlanguage\" (Acts 2:6). 102See, Malcolm McDow and Alvin L.

Derrida presents the story of Babel as a foundation for deconstruction. 103 He states that God \"deconstructs\" the universal language so that translation is impossible.104 The result is the \"multiplicity of idioms\" found in a confusionof tongues. 105 Derrida posits that God deconstructs meaning.

Yet, eJtevrai~ glwvssai~ at Pentecost shows that \"the Spirit of God speaks all languages.\" 109 The reality of eJtevrai~ glwvssai~ establishes confidence in communicating the gospel cross- culturally, for God speaks through His followers to hearersof all races, languages, and cultures (Acts 2:6-8). 110 Thus, the Spirit reverses the consequences of Babel in Genesis11:4-9. 111 Pentecost marks the call of grace to \"all humanity by making all human languages congruent with God's78 112Thomas C. Oden, Life in the Spirit , 64. 113William Neil, The Acts of the Apostles , 72. 114For a discussion of the veracity of the speeches in Acts and the arguments against it, see, Hans Conzelmann, A Commentary on the Acts of the Apostles , trans.

This writer contends that Luke'srecord of the speeches in Acts reflect the content of thesermons delivered, yet the sermons are not verbatim reports. 115H. N.

Regardlessthe cultural, ethnic, or socially informed situation ofpostmodern people, the Spirit of truth fills the witness ofChrist's followers so that the hearers experience convictionand comprehension. Evangelistic Approach at Pentecost, Acts 2:14-41 Peter's sermon at Pentecost represents an apostolic approach for evangelism.114 An examination of Peter's sermon provides a framework for the proclamation of the gospel in apostmodern world. Ridderbos insightfully suggests that thissermon preaching.\" 115 79 116On the paradigmatic nature of the speech, see Marion L. Soards, The Speeches in Acts: Their Content, Context, and Concerns (Louisville: Westminster, 1994), 9-11. 117C. H. Dodd, The Apostolic Preaching and Its Development (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1936), 7-8. Dodd distinguishes khvrugma from didavskein. The latter is moral instruction for believers. 118Ibid., 17-24. 119These five elements are: 1) the dawn of the messianic age (Acts 2:16-21); 2) the life, death, andresurrection of Christ (Acts 2:22-32); 3) Jesus is theexalted Lord sitting at the right hand of God as the head ofthe \"new Israel\" (Acts 2:33-36); 4) the Spirit is Christ's exaltation (Acts 2:33); 5) a call forrepentance, the offer of forgiveness, and the gift of theSpirit (Acts 2:38-39). The sixth element speaks to theconsummation of the messianic age (Acts 3:21). 120John B. 107.Accordingly, Peter's sermon is paradigmatic of other speeches in Acts as well as for evangelism in postmoderntimes. 116 C. H. Dodd indicates that the apostolic khvrugma is the public proclamation of the gospel to unbelievers.117 Dodd proposes that the apostolic khvrugma includes six basic elements present in Luke's presentation of the speeches.118 Of these six elements, Peter's sermon at Pentecost includesfive. 119 Within this examination, one notes the OT foundations of the messianic age, the life, death, andexaltation of Jesus, and a call to repentance. 120 An apostolic approach for the evangelization of80 121C. H. Dodd, Apostolic Preaching , 8. 122E. Earle Ellis, Prophecy and Hermeneutic in (Grand Eerdmans, and Yellammendu Form,\" Testament Studies 14 (1967-1968): 96-109; Richard Longenecker, Biblical Exegesis in the Apostolic Period requires the proclamation of the gospel. Peter's sermon provides a pattern for this public proclamation. The apostolic khvrugma is not optional in evangelism, for it is the essence of gospel proclamation.121 Most commentators agree that Peter utilizes either a midrash or pesher model. Generally, the midrash is \"interpretive renderings of the Hebrew text.\"122 The pesher adds an \"eschatological exegesis\" by which the OT prophecies find fulfillment in the current time of the commentary.123 Bowker and Longenecker point to Peter's sermon as a midrash of Joel's prophecy.124 Ellis suggests that the eschatological focus drawn from Joel 2 reveals Peter's use of pesher.125 Following Ellis' suggestion, an apostolic method begins with the contemporary event, brings togetheran OT text and \"christological kerygma,\" and applies the interpretation to the evangelization of the hearers. 126 81 127M. Soards, The Speeches in Acts , 32. 128C. H. Dodd, According to the Scriptures: The Substructure of New Testament Theology (London: Nisbet, 1952), 127. Dodd writes that OT scripture \"is thesubstructure of all Christian theology and contains alreadyits chief regulative ideas.\" This pertains to a Jewishaudience. For evangelization of Gentiles, see chapterfive, \"Apostolic Postmodern Time, Acts 1:8.\" 129F. F. Bruce, \"The Significance of the Speeches for Interpreting Acts,\" Southwestern Journal of Theology 33Peter's explication of the phenomena of Pentecost to the crowd presents the message of salvation.127 Four elements within Peter's sermon provide insight for anapostolic approach: the allure of the Spirit's activity, the OT foundation, the \"christological kerygma,\" and the witness of Christ's followers. The following section will focus upon these elements as instructive for the evangelization ofpostmodern people. The propositions from OT Scripturepresents a central feature in the definition of the Spirit'sactivity, the interpretation of the \"christological kerygma,\" and in the validation of the followers of Jesus. Propositions from Old Testament Scripture Peter's evangelistic approach interprets the experience of his hearers with the OT Scripture. 128 Joel 2:28-32 provide the interpretive framework for themiraculous events of Pentecost and serve as a spring-boardfor the systematic presentation of the gospel. 12982 (Fall 1990): 21. 130John 1-50 The Anchor Bible (Garden City, NJ: Doubleday, 1966), 1:91, suggests that this phraseindicates eternal life. 132Joseph A. Fitzmyer, \"David, Being Therefore a Prophet (Acts 2:30),\" Catholic Biblical Quarterly 34 (1972): 332-339; see also, Walter C. Kaiser Jr., \"The Promise toDavid in Psalm 16 and Its Application in Acts 2:25-33 and 13:32-37,\" Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society 23 (1980): 228. 133W. Kaiser Jr., \"Promise to David,\" 229.Psalm 16:8-11 provides the foundation for the resurrection. A key element in Peter's interpretation isthe identification of dysij; or \"favored one\" (Ps 16:10). Kaiser suggests that David is the representative and recipient of \"God's ancient but ever-renewed promise.\" 130 The term dysij; points to the object of God's favor and covenant commitment. God's promise of a future for His dysij; is the \"path of life.\"131 Fitzmeyer indicates that David's prophetic ability led him to see the future of God's dysij;.132 Peter utilizes David's prophecy that God's \"ultimate hasid would triumph over death. For David, this was all one word: God's ancient but ever-new promise.\"133 Through the OT foundation, Peter declares that Christ's resurrection fulfills the promise ofthe eternal kingdom to David. An analysis of this83 134See, W. R. G. Loader, \"Christ at the Right Hand: Psalm CX.i in the Testament Studies 24 (1977-78): 199-217. 135See Mark 12:35-37 in which Jesus attributes the psalm to David.\"christological kerygma\" will follow in the next section. Psalm 110:1 provides the foundation for the exaltation of Jesus. Peter declares that the unusualphenomenon at Pentecost is the outpouring of the Spirit fromthe exalted Jesus Christ. Psalm 110:1 serves as Peter's OTsupport for the exaltation of Jesus as well as the blessingsof the exalted Christ upon His followers. 134 The oracle from Yahweh to ynIdoa, however, is certain in its portrayal of ynIdoa as distinct from both David and Yahweh.135 In this way, OT Scripture serves as the foundation of knowledge to interpret the experience of the hearers. To this foundation, Peter joins the \"christological kerygma\" and the personal testimony of the disciples. OT Scripture provides the foundation of knowledge for the \"truth-claims\"of the cross and the resurrection. The Cross and the Resurrection: An Objective, Historical Reality Alvin Reid suggests, \"The objective message of the cross and Jesus' resurrection permeated the witness of the84 136Alvin Reid, Introduction to Evangelism (Nashville: Broadman and Holman, 1998), 48. 137Dunn, Unity and Diversity in the New Testament: An Inquiry into the Character of Earliest Christianity , 2d ed.

Dunn, following Conzelmann and Cadbury, however, contends that the kerygma of Acts does not contain a \"theology of the death of Jesus.\" He argues that the sermons in Acts do not interpret the historical fact ofJesus' death but focus on His resurrection and exaltation. 137 I. H. Marshall also acknowledges that Luke provides \"scanty\"material on the death of Jesus and its significance. 138 Marshall, however, finds vicarious atonement in Philip'sevangelistic encounter with the Ethiopian (Acts 8:26-39) the formula, \"hanging on a tree\" (Acts 5:30; 10:39;13:29). 139 Conner argues that Peter applies the Servant motif to Jesus (Acts 3:13, 26; 4:27, 30), \"who redeems [H]is85 140Leon Morris, The Cross the New Testament (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1965), 111. 141It is possible that the participle modifies both boulh`/ and prognwvsei , since both are in the s.v. \" oJrivzw,\" TDNT, 452-56. 143Fritz Rienecker, Key to the Greek , trans.

Polhill suggests that\"Peter carefully balanced the elements of God's divinepurposes and the human responsibility for the crucifixion ofJesus.\" 145 Peter also declares that the Jewish crowd of hearers and the Gentiles share the guilt of killing Jesus.146 The cross, however, \"was not a disaster but an act of God's grace for man's salvation.\"147 Peter proclaims the triumph of God over death through Christ (Acts 2:24).148 Morris insightfully states that the message of the cross inthe Pentecost sermon \"is not put forward from any idea thatit was good teaching, or good strategy, or that it couldmeet a damaging criticism. It is put forward because it isheld to be true.\" 149 For Peter and the apostolic church, the cross is an objective, historical reality which God purposedfor the salvation of humanity (Acts 2:39). 15087 151W. T. Conner, The Cross in the New Testament (Nashville: Broadman, 1954), 48. 152Leon Morris, Cross in the Commentary (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1974), 27.Peter also presents the resurrection of Jesus as an objective, historical reality. The apostolic churchconnects the significance of the cross with theresurrection. 151 This significance is that the cross is \"the means to the end, and that end is victory.\"152 God provides victory over death through Christ's resurrection. Thegospel promises victory through the inauguration of the newage at Christ's exaltation and His bestowal of the Spirit toHis followers (Acts 2:33). 153 An apostolic approach follows Peter's example. The OT Scripture provides the hearers foundations for belief. The eyewitness testimonies of the disciples about theresurrection also provide a foundation for belief. Finally,Peter presents the proof of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:33). This represents the \"crowning proof that Christ had beenraised from the dead and enthroned in heaven as exaltedMessiah.\" 154 David Wells connects this proclamation also to the witness of the Spirit of truth. The witness of the Spirit88 155David Wells, God the Evangelist , 45. Peter's statement in Acts 2:36 is a climactic statement, by whichPeter and the apostolic church give to Jesus the highesttitle, signifying Yahweh Himself.joins Peter's evangelistic proclamation to draw the hearers toward salvation. The sermon Peter preached at Pentecost was one in which Jesus was the focus and the Holy Spirit's ministry ofconviction was apparent. He convicted listeners of [H]im from the dead';[H]e 'exalted the right hand of God'; 2:24, 33),and judgment ('The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at [M]yright hand until I make your enemies a footstool foryour feet'; 2:34-35). Those who heard were 'cut to theheart' (2:37); on that day, three thousand believed. 155 Thus, Peter joins the testimony of the Spirit to evangelize the Jerusalem crowd at Pentecost. Following these proofs, Peter concludes his evangelistic sermon with a call for the audience to repent. He declares that the foundations for faith have been laid at the feet of his hearers so that they should know ( ginwskevtw ) that God has made Jesus both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36). The truth of God's salvation is the impetus for the creationof the community of faith (Acts 2:41-47). An apostolic approach for the evangelization of postmodern people proclaims the cross and the resurrectionas the \"truth-claims\" of the gospel to postmodern people. The contemporary church follows the example of the apostolicchurch, proclaiming the death and resurrection as Rapids: Baker Books, 1999), 150. 157Ibid.historical facts which are essential in evangelism. Robert Webber suggests that evangelism in a postmodern world \"must recover the emphasis that Christ'sdeath is a victory over the powers of evil.\" 156 This is the message which Peter proclaims in his sermon at Pentecost,and it is the content of the proclamation of the gospel in the postmodern world. The proclamation of Christus Victor \"makes connection with churched and unchurched people.\" 157 In the evangelization of postmodern people, the gospel ofthe cross and the empty tomb declares that God has gained avictory that is unattainable without Him. The contemporary church must proclaim the \"christological kerygma.\" Scripture, personal witness, and the Spirit of truth provide the foundations for belief. Proclaiming the cross and resurrection as objective,historical realities, the Spirit of truth verifies the truthof the gospel and convicts postmodern people. Objective or Communal? The Postmodern Question of Truth The \"truth-claims\" of the cross and the resurrection are essential for the evangelization of90 158Richard Rorty, Objectivity, Relativism, and Truth: Philosophical Papers, 1 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991), 23-25, 165. 159On the production of meaning and truth by the community, see Stanley Fish, Is There a Text in This Class? (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1980), 14. 160Hans H\u00fcbner, \"The Holy Spirit in Holy Scripture,\" Ecumenical Review 41 (July 1989): 328-29; Stanley Grenz, Theology for the Community of God (Nashville: Broadman and Holman, 1994), 482-85.postmodern people; yet for the postmodern mind, the question of truth and the acquisition of truth must be considered. According Richard Rorty and other postmodern theorists,truth is a function of community. 158 The community creates truth that is most beneficial for the continuance of thatcommunity. 159 This truth remains in tact until an individual or a group of individuals within the community developenough skill in the \"language games\" to change or alter thetruth. Truth then changes according to the context of thecommunity and the language games within the community. The outpouring of the Spirit of truth at Pentecost teaches, however, that community is a function of truth. The Christian community in apostolic times and in thepostmodern world is built upon the truth of the gospel andthe power of the Spirit of truth applying the truth to thehearts of the hearers. The Holy Spirit creates communitythrough the truth of the gospel. 160 The Holy Spirit, who91 161William Neil, Acts of the Apostles , 79; Dunn, Jesus and the Spirit , 260-62; G. W. H. Lampe, The Seal of the Spirit (London: Longmans, 1951), 3-7. 162Arthur Darby Nock, Conversion: The Old and New in Religion from Alexander the Great to Augustine of Hippo (London: Oxford University Press, 1933), 7. 163Rienecker, Luke's description, indicates penetrates the heart as if stinging.\"comes to indwell individuals upon their conversion, validates the common bond of salvation for every member ofthe Christian community. 161 The Holy Spirit creates an epistemological bridge to conversion and an experientialunity within the community. The Spirit of Truth, Conversion, and Community Arthur Darby Nock provides a helpful definition of conversion as a \"reorientation of the soul\" which involves a\"turning which implies a consciousness that a great changeis involved, that the old was wrong and the new is right.\" 162 In Peter's Pentecost sermon, the people respond to thegospel with a cry of dismay over their condition (Acts2:37). 163 Peter calls for repentance and baptism (Acts 2:38). In the context of this call for decision, repentanceconnects the hearer to conversion. Stagg confirms this connection when he declares that metanoevw represents the NT92 164Frank Wells, God the Evangelist of conversion. He writes, \"The call to 'repentance,' was a call . . . to conversion.\"164 Repentance and conversion mean to change one's mind and turn towardsomething or someone else. Indeed, Behm indicates thatconversion is \"the basic requirement\" in the apostolic kerygma, and metanoevw is \"the heart of the apostolic mission.\" 165 Peter clearly presents the connection between metanoevw and ejpistrevfw in Acts 3:19.166 Repentance is to change one's mind concerning the old way of life, and conversion is to change one's direction toward God.167 The work of repentance and conversion comes to the postmodern person through the work of the Spirit of truth inthe evangelistic engagement. The Spirit of truth leads thepostmodern person to the acquisition of the truth of thegospel. Wells suggests that evangelism involves\"explanation and persuasion relative to Christ\" and thetruth of the cross. \"Biblical conversion is conversion thatis brought about by truth.\" 168 93 169William Barclay, The Promise of the Spirit (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1960), 58. 170George R.

As Bruce (Book of Acts , 70) writes: \"It would indeed be a mistake to link the words 'for the forgiveness of sins' with thecommand 'be baptized' to the exclusion of the prior commandto repent.

Barclay writes that baptism joins the \"confession of faith\" with\"entry into the fellowship of the church.\" 169 Beasley-Murray shows that the confession of faith identifies the believerto the Lord for the purpose or with the result ofsalvation. 170 The corollary identification in baptism is incorporation as a member of the community of believers. The believer in baptism numbers \"himself with the people whoinvoke the Name of Jesus\" and is incorporated \"into thecommunity of those who inherit the Kingdom.\" 171 The concept of incorporation indicates the nature of involvement and participation in Christ's body. relationship between \"Spirit-94 173G.

His arguments include: 1) the work of Christ by His Spirit in baptism for consecration of thebeliever in 1 Cor 6:11; 2) evidence from Acts in which theprimitive church saw the fulfillment of messianic baptism inthe outpouring of the Spirit and in the \"administration ofbaptism to those responsive to the gospel\" and 3) theconnection between Gal 3:27 and this verse which link\"baptism to Christ with baptism to the Church.\" 175Ibid., 170.baptism\" and incorporation into the the phrase, ejn eJni; pneuvmati , to depict agency, so that the Spirit is the \"agent of baptism to membership in the Body.\"173 Beasley-Murray contends that this verse points directly to \"Christian baptism inwater.\" 174 This conclusion presents dangerous implications. The apparent danger of this view, in this writer's opinion,is the unlikely identification that water-baptism is Spirit-baptism. Beasley-Murray sees this danger and writes that\"there is nothing automatic about this association ofbaptism and the Spirit\" but \"the relation of the believerwith the Spirit is to be construed in strict analogy withhis relation to the Risen Christ.\" 175 Beasley-Murray, therefore, contends that the reference in this verse is to95 176Gordon Fee, The First Epistle to the Corinthians , New International Commentary on the New Testament (GrandRapids: Eerdmans, 1987), 604-606. 177Ibid., 605. 178See Douglas Moo, The Epistle to the Romans , New International Commentary on the New Testament (Grand Rapids:Eerdmans, 1996), 359-79. 179Ibid., 604 n. 24. 180Ibid., 604.water-baptism, but it does not refer to water-baptism as a salvific act of the Spirit through water-baptism. Fee provides a lengthy discussion on this verse. He suggests that Paul is not referring to water-baptism in any way in this text.176 His argument, which looks upon ejn eJni; pneuvmati as locative, places the emphasis upon conversion when the believer is \"immersed in the Spirit.\"177 Although Fee's emphasis on conversion is admirable, one must ask if his diligent denial is justified. Paulunderstands the symbolism of water-baptism (Rom 6:3-11). 178 As Fee concedes, however, \"the point of reference for themetaphor would be their own baptism (immersion) in water.\" 179 Fee himself indicates the association between baptism andthe reception of the Spirit, which is the \"crucialingredient\" of conversion. 180 It is therefore reasonable that Paul refers to conversion, calling to his readers' minds their water-baptism, when he writes ejn eJni; 181F.

The significance of this discussion is that Spirit- baptism incorporates believers into the \"body of Christ.\" Water-baptism is the visible demonstration of thisincorporation. Bruce suggests that \"faith-union with Christbrought [H]is people into membership of the Spirit-baptizedcommunity, procuring for them the benefits of the once-for-all outpouring of the Spirit at the dawn of the new age,while baptism in water was retained as the outward andvisible sign of their incorporation into Christ.\" 181 The call to conversion and community through repentance and baptism provides a transition from Peter'sPentecost sermon to apostolic community life (Acts 2:41-47). Gaventa points out that Acts 2:38 \"provides a transition tothe ensuing narrative of the expansion of the Jerusalem[Christian] community.\" 182 Those who submit to baptism as an expression of repentance receive the seal of the Spirit. Conversion which is wrought by the Spirit leads to communityof the Spirit in the fellowship of the saints. Thus, theapostle Paul elucidates the preeminent community ethic in97 183\"One body and one Spirit, just as also you have been called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, onefaith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who [is]above all and through all and in all\" Through this extensive examination of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit, and evangelism, the following foundationshopefully are established. First, Pentecost is thehistorical and theological hinge for the evangelization ofpostmodern people. God inaugurates a new age in which thechurch joins the Spirit to evangelize the postmodern world. Second, the Spirit is the epistemological bridge for theobjective truth of the gospel in a postmodern context. The Spirit unites ejlevgcw with the evangelism of the church. Third, Peter's sermon at Pentecost reveals an example ofapostolic khvrugma for postmodern people by which the Spirit speaks through the believer to the hearer. The objective reality of the cross and resurrection is the center ofevangelistic preaching to postmodern people. The Spiritestablishes the conviction of postmodern people that the \"truth-claims\" of the apostolic khvrugma are in fact true. The Spirit leads postmodern people to conversion through repentance and community through baptism.1Paul Minear, Images of the Church in the New Testament (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1960), 268-69. He proposes ninety-six \"analogies\" of the church in the NT. This examination is not as exhaustive as Minear's and 98CHAPTER THREE THE FUNCTION OF COMMUNITY IN AN APOSTOLIC APPROACH An apostolic approach for the evangelization of postmodern people has a community focus. Postmodernism hasinaugurated the demise of the \"autonomous individual\" andgiven way for the exaltation of community. This creates aspecific advantage for the contemporary church following anapostolic approach for evangelism in the postmodern milieu. The influence of community in the postmodern world, however,engenders the notion of truth as a social construct. Anapostolic approach depends upon the Spirit as theepistemological bridge toward the access of truth. What,then, is the role of community? Images of an Apostolic Community An examination of the biblical images of an apostolic community serves as a starting point for ananalysis of the role of community in an apostolic approach. 1 99 organizes specifically around a trinitarian motif. 2Boyd Hunt, Redeemed! Eschatological Redemption and the Kingdom God Die Entstehung The translation is: \"yet even more it [ ejkklhsiva] presents itself in the gathering of the Christian church as the holy people of God.\" Lohsefurther writes that the local church can representcompletely (vollst\u00e4ndig) the Church of Jesus Christ. 5Stanley Grenz and John Franke, Beyond Foundationalism: Shaping Theology in a Postmodern ContextThese images, drawn from Acts and Paul's epistles, reveal an apostolic view of the Christian community. Although this isnot an exhaustive examination, the premise of this author isthat the images of an apostolic community present anevangelistic focus for the apostolic church. The most common term for the Christian community in the NT is ejkklhsiva. 2 This is the primary term in Acts.3 Lohse understands ejkklhsiva to mean the Gottes heileges Volk,\"4 and the following images reinforce this concept. Stanley Grenz and John Franke propose that the Trinity provides a fundamental framework for the Christiananswer to God's identity in a postmodern context. 5 100 (Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 2001), 187. 6Ibid. 7P.

Carson (Exeter: Paternoster Press, 1984), 76. Murphy-O'Connor, St. Paul: A Critical Life (Oxford: Oxford University Press,Therefore, as these authors seek to \"shape theology in a postmodern context,\" they suggest that the Christiancommunity \"finds its basis in being and action\" within theframework of the Trinity. 6 Paul Minear also indicates that the biblical images of the church point \"to a realm in whichGod and Jesus Christ and the Spirit are at work.\" 7 Clowney furthermore proposes that these images \"continually relatethe church to the triune God.\" 8 With this concept in mind, the trinitarian metaphors for the Christian communityprovide the basis for \"being and action\" in apostolicapproach. Christ's Body The \"body of Christ\" represents one of the major metaphors for the apostolic community. Paul describes theunity of the body amidst the diversity of the membership. 9 101 1997), 288. Each member of the community relates to other members as an organic whole called the \"body of Christ.\" 10Gordon D. Fee, The First Epistle to the Corinthians , New International Commentary on the New Testament (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1987), 606. Thetranslation is \"whether Jews or Greeks or slaves or freepersons, and we all have been made to drink one Spirit\" (1Cor 12:13). 11Jean Baudrillard, The Transparency of Evil: Essays on Extreme Phenomena , trans. James Benedict (New York: Verso, 1993), 4-6. 12:13).10 The elimination of these symbols of alienation presents an answer to the postmodern quest. Baudrillard suggests that the postmodern desire for \"relationality\" emerges from the \"fractal stage\" ofvalues, 11 which is the \"haphazard proliferation and dispersal of value\" so that there is \"no law of value.\"12 Good is no longer the opposite of evil, nothing can now be plotted on a graph or analysed in terms of abscissasand ordinates. Just as each particle follows its owntrajectory, each value or fragment of value shines for amoment in the heavens of simulation, then disappearsinto the void along a crooked path that only rarelyhappens to intersect with other such paths. This is thepattern of the fractal -- and hence the current patternof our culture. 13 This postmodern pattern produces a desire for \"otherness,\"102 14Ibid., Strecker, Theology of the New Testament , trans.

Franke, Beyond Foundationalism , 201.which for Baudrillard is \"getting beyond alienation.\"14 Here, Baudrillard's solution is to pursue \"radicalotherness\" in which alienation becomes \"definitively other.\" In this way, the individual loses \"any trace of my own.\" Baudrillard's solution heralds back to Nietzsche'sexaltation of the \"free spirit.\" 15 This \"relationality\" within an apostolic community theologically reflects the \"relationality\" within theTrinity. 16 Jenson suggests that trinitarian doctrine begins with the premise that \"God's relations to us are internal to[H]im.\" 17 Therefore, as Grenz and Franke suggest, the apostolic community provides \"the foretaste of the newhumanity\" who \"represent God in the midst of the fallennessof the present through relationships that reflect God's ownloving character.\" 18 As Baudrillard concludes, the \"Object\" is the answer to alienation, even though he equates \"radical103 19Baudrillard, Transparency of Evil , 173-74. 20Ben Witherington III, Conflict and Community in Corinth: Socio-Rhetorical Commentary on 1 and 2Corinthians (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1995), 259. 21James D.

Bruce, 1 and 2 Corinthians , New Century Bible Commentary (London: Marshall, Morgan, and Scott,1971), 122-23.otherness\" of the individual, which is beyond \"the Other.\" 19 From an apostolic approach, this \"Object\" is community withGod through Christ. The image of the \"body of Christ,\"therefore, presents an apostolic answer to the postmodernquest for an escape from alienation. The \"relationality\" of the \"body of Christ\" proceeds to a specific application of purpose; namely, to beused by God (1 Cor 12:18). 20 Dunn suggests that \"there is no such thing as passive membership.\"21 Active membership involves the fulfillment of specific functions within Christ's body (1 Cor 12:27-28). Each member of the sw`ma Cristou` has a function to fulfill for the edification of the whole.22 The contention of this writer is that each member's function corresponds to the leadership andpriorities of Christ Jesus who is the head of His body.

The community of faith \"draws its life from [H]im towhom it is united.\" 26 The apostolic community exists as Christ's body 28F. F.

Gundry, S\u00f4ma in Biblical Theology with Emphasis on Pauline Anthropology , Society for New Testament Studies Monograph Series 29(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1976), 228. Gundryproposes that this metaphor points to \"an ecclesiasticalcreation becomes reconciliation through Christ. 28 The connection between the reconciling work of Christ and the evangelistic emphasis of Christ's body isfurther amplified through Paul's description in verses 21through 29. Paul Minear writes: The forgiveness that had become effective within the Christian community was seen as the beginning of aprocess that would continue until it had achieved itsgoal not only within the church but also throughoutcreation. (Vs. 20-23) Those who to this end shared theredemptive sufferings of the Messiah were carrying out aministry for the body, thus making God's word more fullyknown. (Vs. 24-28) 29 Paul's concern is for God's reconciling work through Christ to permeate the world through the apostolic mission.30 Thus, Eduard Schweizer states that \"the church is understoodas the body of Christ because of its obedience to its Head. The church manifests itself in the mission to thenations.\" 31 106 Body consisting of believers, in which [H]e Christ] Neuen Testaments , 192. The image of Christ's body reveals that the apostolic community is the presence of Christ on mission. In an apostolic approach for the evangelization ofpostmodern people, the image of Christ's body presents thepriority of evangelism, for Christ's body naturally followsthe leadership of the Head, who is Christ Jesus. Christ'spurpose of reconciliation answers the postmodern quest forescape from alienation. As an extension of Christ'sministry, the church today recognizes its mission ofevangelism in the postmodern setting. The function of anapostolic community is to evangelize the world as anextension of Christ's ministry. God's People A second image for the apostolic community is the \"people of God.\" The apostolic community represents thegathering of the followers of Christ as God's holy people,set apart by the Spirit to accomplish the purposes of God inJesus Christ. 32 As such, \"Christians were heirs to the Jewish conception of the people of God as 'brothers and107 33David A. deSilva, Honor, Patronage, Aliens: Between Good and Evil,\" in Evil After Postmodernism: Histories, Narratives, and Ethics , ed.

Once again, as with the \"body of Christ,\" the postmodern quest for \"relationality\" finds fulfillment inthis trinitarian image of the apostolic community. Derrida's concept of hospitality helps elucidate thispostmodern quest. Derrida calls for absolute hospitality. 34 He proposes hospitality which gives place ( donne lieu ) \"without demanding that he give his name or enter into some reciprocal pact.\"35 Through this process of \"absolute hospitality,\" Kearney suggests that the host must \"allowsome way for the absolute other to enter our home, family,nation, state.\" 36 The role of \"absolute hospitality\"108 37Ibid., 112. 38Douglas Moo, The Epistle to the Romans , New International Commentary on the New Testament (Grand Rapids:Eerdmans, 1996), 504 n. 41. 39\"Then you are of the seed of Abraham, heirs according to promise.\" 40\"If then children [of God], also heirs; heirs God, and joint-heirs Christ.\" 41D.

The church,which relates to the postmodern world, must not \"becomespiritually linked\" with the philosophies of postmodernitywhich defile the distinctiveness of the community. Thepostmodern quest for pluralism calls for \"agreement\" betweenthe \"temple of the Spirit\" and other religious narratives. Lakeland, who writes for a postmodern theology, declaresthat such a theology will \"reflect the open-ended,pluralistic, pragmatic, and tentative nature of thepostmodern world.\" 61 Lakeland suggests that the church in the postmodern setting must \"embrace the spirit of theage.\" 62 To accomplish this task, Lakeland relegates the114 63Ibid., 102. 64Ibid., 108. 65Ronald Y.

Fung, \"Some Pauline Pictures of the Church,\" Evangelical Quarterly 53 (1981): 107.mission of the church to \"pluralistic discourse\" which seeks \"consensus.\"63 The necessity of consensus leads Lakeland to conclude that \"Christ will not be in the foreground ofChristian mission in the postmodern world,\" but He \"will bethe distinctive element 'behind'\" the mission. 64 Is this not the fulfillment of Paul's warning in 2 Corinthians 6? According to Fung, the trinitarian images of the apostolic community point to the \"relationality\" between thechurch and God in Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit. 65 This writer suggests a modification of Fung's conclusion. The self-conception of the apostolic community includes therelation to the world as well; therefore, the conclusionwould be that the images reflect the \"relationality\" betweenthe church and God in Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit to the world . The application of this self-conception to the contemporary scene compels the Christian community toconceive this single reality in a postmodern world. Thechurch lives in connection with God's redemptive actions inChrist as the mission of the church among postmodern people. 115 66Moltmann, Church in the Power of the Spirit , 75. 67Ibid. 68Markus Barth, The Broken Wall: A Study of the Epistle to the Ephesians (Valley Judson Narratives: of Postmodernity and the Recovery of a Churchly Theology,\" in A Confessing Theology for Postmodern Times, ed.

An examination of th`/ didach`/ tw`n ajpostovlwn demonstrates its connection with the Christ. William Neilproposes that th`/ didach`/ tw`n ajpostovlwn refers to the \"words and works of Jesus as later incorporated in the Gospels.\" 82 Rengstorf concludes that th`/ didach`/ tw`n ajpostovlwn refers to the proclamation of Christ's didachv by those whom He has sent into the world.83 The premise of this section is that the doctrine of Christ is the apostles' doctrine.

A. Carson, The Gagging Christianity Confronts Pluralism (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1996), 57.An apostolic approach for the evangelization of postmodern people requires the transformation of worldviews. The connection between the community and the transformationof worldviews is found in devotion to the apostles'doctrine. Postmodernism, however, exalts the process ofhermeneutics. The following excursus examines therelationship between hermeneutics and the postmodernresistance to the transformation of worldview throughScripture. Excursus: Hermeneutics and the Postmodern Challenge Hermeneutics plays an important role in the premise of postmodernism. Postmodern theorists propose that truthis a product of the community. D. A. Carson suggests thatpostmodernism \"depends not a little on what are perceived tobe the fundamental limitations on the power ofinterpretation.\" 102 Stanley Fish, Richard Rorty, and Jacques Derrida represent three leading voices in postmodernhermeneutics. Stanley Fish's \"reader-response\" approach to hermeneutics presents a leading voice in postmodern theory125 103Stanley Fish, Is There a Text in This Class?: The Authority of Interpretive Communities (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1980), 1-17. 13. 106Ibid., 16. 107Ibid., 86. 108Ibid., 326-27. He proposes that in his model \"the reader was freed from the tyranny of the text and given thecentral role in the production of meaning\" (Ibid., 7). 109William Ray, Literary Meaning: From (New York: Basil Blackwell, 1984), 162.of interpretation.103 According to Fish, the meaning of a text is the reader's response to the text.104 The text is an \"entity independent of interpretation\" and \"is replaced bythe texts that emerge\" from interpretation within the socialsetting. 105 Fish further indicates that all \"interpretation is the source of texts, facts, authors, and intentions.\"106 By this endeavor, Fish dismisses foundationalism because itprohibits the reader from \"the most remarkable of hisabilities, the ability to give the world meaning rather thanto extract a meaning that is already there.\" 107 According to Fish's hermeneutical program, one comes to the text to create rather than discover meaning.108 Fish views a text as \"an empty, separate domain, awaitingthe collective intention that will fill it.\" 109 For Fish,126 110S. Fish, Is There a Text in This NY: Cornell University Press, 1981), 125. 112D. A. Carson, The Gagging of God , 126. 113Richard Rorty, Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1979), 390-94. 114Crispin Wright, Truth and Objectivity (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1992), 91-93. Wright indicatesthat the \"representation of facts\" incorporates on the truth predicate\" (Ibid., 83). Wright's contention is that truth is the \"output\" of thecognitive function of an individual correctly handling the\"input\" of information. Differences of opinion between twoor more individuals concerning the same information is the result of a priori \"differences of opinion.\"the only parameter in interpretation is the \"point of view\" in the interpretive community. 110 As Culler sees Fish's proposal, the \"notion of 'what the text says' itself dependsupon common procedures of reading.\" 111 Thus, the different interpretive strategies of exegetical communities make thetext speak differently. The readers in their interpretivecommunity is determinative in the creation of meaning. 112 Richard Rorty proposes another leading approach in postmodern interpretation which focuses on conversation ashermeneutics. 113 The assumption of Rorty's position consists in his concept of the acquisition of truth. He rejectsCrispin Wright's \"representationalist\" portrayal of thecognitive discourse 114 Rorty, views127 115Richard Rorty, Truth and Progress: Philosophical Papers, Volume University Press, 1998), 32. 116Ibid., 3-4. Rorty writes: \"Truth is not a goal of inquiry. If 'truth' is the name of such a goal then,indeed, there is no truth. For the absoluteness of truthmakes it unserviceable as such a goal.\" 117Ibid., 5. 118Rorty, Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature , 389.\"human beings as machines constructed (by God or Evolution) to, among other things, get things right.\" Rorty's approachis \"to get rid of that self-image and to replace it with apicture of machines that continually adjust to each other'sbehavior, and to their environment, by developing novelkinds of behavior.\" 115 Rorty's assumption is that the acquisition of truth is not the goal of discourse.116 Rather, the continual adjustment toward others and thesocial context is the goal of discourse. 117 This \"continual adjustment\" provides the framework for conversation as \"the ultimate context within whichknowledge is to be understood.\" 118 For Rorty, hermeneutics is the conversation between people who come to the end oftheir \"edifying discourse\" with understanding, but who donot seek truth as the goal of the dialogue. Because novocabulary or text \"is closer to reality than another\" nor128 119Richard Rorty, Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), 73. 120Richard Rorty, Consequences of Pragmatism (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1982), xlii. 121Douglas Groothuis, Truth Decay: Defending Christianity Against the (Downers Grove: InterVarsity, 2000), 198. 122Richard Rorty, Objectivity, Relativism, and Truth: Philosophical Papers, Volume 1 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991), 102-103. 123Rorty, Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity , 97. Rorty suggests that individuals are not judged by anyexternal reality or final vocabularies, but only bythemselves. 124Ibid.\"in touch with a power not herself,\"119 hermeneutics involves merely \"obedience to our own conventions.\"120 Rorty seeks to \"abandon the courtroom of truth for the carnival of redescription.\"121 \"Redescription\" is the process by which one makes something \"to look good or bad,\"depending upon the goal and context of \"language game.\" 122 The ultimate arbiter in hermeneutics is the individual.123 Texts and vocabularies are interpreted through conversationand \"re-description.\" The end-game of hermeneutics forRorty is to \"make something that never had been dreamed ofbefore.\" 124 This hermeneutical process results in a pragmatic, \"whatever works best\" interpretation. In this way, according to Rorty, \"hermeneutics is129 125Rorty, Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature , 365- 66. 126Rorty, Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity , 43. 127Roger Lundin, Clarence Walhout, and Anthony Thiselton, and Philosophy , ed.

Roger Lundin suggests that Rorty'shermeneutics presents the reader as the \"parasite\" who seeks\"to bring the dead text to life by internalizing it.\" 127 Jacques Derrida's concept of diff\u00e9rance provides another view of the hermeneutical process in postmodernthought. 128 Derrida's concept of diff\u00e9rance is the fulcrum of his deconstruction project. Vanhoozer suggests that \"Derrida is an unbeliever in the reliability, decidability, and neutrality of the sign.\"129 Diff\u00e9rance is and Phenomenon: And Other Essays on Husserl's Theory of Signs , trans.

The absence of thetranscendental signified extends the domain and the play ofsignification infinitely.\" 139 This absence produces \"differences and traces of traces.\"140 The result of Derrida's hermeneutic is a text 25. 142Jacques Derrida, Dissemination , trans.

According to Derrida, the movement of diff\u00e9rance overturns \"all theologies.\" 144 Because no transcendental signified exists, he rejects \"la religion du vivant\" as which all133 the living\" which creates \"absolute command, holy law, law of salvation: to save the living as the whole, the protected against harm, the set apart ( holy).\" 146See chapter 2, \"Beyond more Babel. 147Geoffrey Bennington and Jacques Derrida, Jacques Derrida (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993), 105. 148Craig Bartholomew, \"Babel and Derrida: Postmodernism, Language and Biblical Bulletin 49 (November Biblical Shadow (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 223.theologies in his study of Babel.146 Derrida views the use of the proper name as the promotion of \"logocentrism\" --that there is a stable connection between the world andlanguage. 147 The result of Derrida's interpretation of Babel, where Babel (confusion) is the proper name for God,is that logocentrism itself is confusion and that\"determinate textual interpretation impossible.\" 148 Ingraffia theologicalfashion when he writes: \"Instead of the Logos callinghumanity into being, humanity calls God into being.\" 149 Derrida, therefore, promotes a hermeneutic which dismissesmeaning as indeterminable. Instead, meaning moves through the arbitration of diff\u00e9rance in the reading and writing of the individual. Unlike the postmodern hermeneutics of Fish, Rorty,134 150N. T. Wright, \"How Bible Be Authoritative?,\" Vox Evangelica 21 (1991): 16; quoted in B.

Scripture interprets the postmodern person'slife so that he or she may be free \"to be fully human.\" 150 Derrida, Rorty, and Fish pursue a hermeneutic which rejects the pretension that exegesis can lead to a \"correctview of things.\" 151 Yet, encounters with Scripture impinge certain expectations and demands upon the interpreter.152 Clarence Walhout, following Alvin Plantinga, proposes that\"our hermeneutics needs to be grounded in our warrantedbeliefs.\" 153 In an apostolic approach, these \"warranted beliefs\" emerge from the text of Scripture (the design plan)as it is interpreted in the \"cognitive environment\" of the135 154Alvin Plantinga, Warrant and Proper Oxford University Press, 1993), 82.

Following Wolterstorff's suggestion of \"double136 158Nicholas Wolterstorff, Divine Discourse: Philosophical Reflections on the Claim That God Speaks (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 38-54. however, of authorial intention, which they claimis a \"modern tendency to elevate some other reality [theauthor] above the Bible as text.\" 160K.

The first verb, devcomai, suggests to Fuller that the \"natural man does not welcome the things of the Spirit of God.\" The second verb, ginwvskw, indicates that that the yuciko;~ a[nqrwpo~ cannot evaluate spiritual things. 165M.

As Clowney writes, \"The Spirit who communicated through theapostles and prophets the deposit of sound doctrine (1 Tim6:20, 21; 2 Tim 1:13) also works to illumine ourunderstanding of the truth.\" 167 Following Vanhoozer, this writer proposes that the text of Scripture has the \"mission of meaning.\"168 by the Spirit.169 The Spirit of truth persuades and convinces the reader of the truth-claims of the Scripture. As Vanhoozer writes, \"The Spirit's leading readers into alltruth is a matter of nurturing a Pentecostal conversationabout the correct interpretation of the Word's past meaningand present significance.\" 170 Illumination does not present the Spirit as a rival author who leads individuals to deconstruct th`/ didach`/ tw`n ajpostovlwn , as didach`/ ajpostovlwn as with139 171Bernard Ramm, The Witness of the Spirit: An Essay on the Contemporary Relevance of the Internal Witness of theHoly Spirit (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1959), 125. 172K.

Inan apostolic community, the table fellowship allowsbelievers to remember the foundation of their community asthe \"body of Christ.\" 179 The celebration of the common meal actualizes the \"fellowship of the individual church membersin the unity of the body of Christ\" for the church. 180 Neyrey indicates that the ceremonial meal serves as a process to \"bolster the boundaries defining a group orinstitution, even as they confirm established roles and statuses within the group.\" 181 The klavsi~ tou` a[rtou is an idiom for Jewish ceremony opening a meal in which the host offers142 182Brad Blue, \"The Influence of Jewish Worship on Luke's Presentation of the Early Church,\" in Witness to the Gospel: The Theology of Acts , eds.

This aspect of koinwniva establishes the nature of Christ's death as God's provision of life, promotes the nature of the future with Christ's imminent return, providesthe nature of the blessings received as part of thecommunity, commends the nature of ethics within thecommunity, and commissions individuals for the continuity143 186Ibid., 376-77. This conclusion is drawn from Christ's farewell meal with His followers as the starting-point of the ceremonial meal of Acts 2:42. 187Michael Green, Evangelism Through the Local Church (Nashville: Thomas Greeven, TDNT, 2:807-808. 189Daniel K.

Furthermore, apostolic fellowship includes proseuchv, which denotes the regular petitioning to God for aid.188 Falk suggests that Luke records the adoption of Jewishprayer practices including the appointed prayer times. 189 The connection, however, between koinwniva and klavsi~ tou` a[rtou suggests that the devotion to prayer moves beyond the practices of Temple worship.190 Indeed, the tight connection of the fellowship suggests that the apostolic communityshares prayer together around the celebration of the common144 191J.

His model is\"God as benefactor.\" For the apostolic community, DeSilvasuggests that God goes \"far beyond the high-water mark ofgenerosity\" through the bestowal of reconciliation to Hisenemies. 193 Furthermore, as the \"personal patron to Christians,\" God hears and acts upon the specific petitionsfrom \"local communities of faith\" who enjoy the \"privilegeof access to God for such timely and specific help.\" 194 Prayer, therefore, is \"the means by which believers canpersonally seek God's favor, and request specificbenefactions, for themselves or on behalf of one another.\" 195 The role of th`/ klavsei tou` a[rtou and tai`\" proseucai`\" in valuable picture for the145 196Sally Morgenthaler, Worship Evangelism: Inviting Unbelievers into the Presence of God (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1995), 123. 197Ibid., 123. 198Bruce Thede, \"How One Reached Out 1994): 14.

For instance, Elmer Towns examines the role of \"small-group prayer\" during worship. In this approach, theworship leader calls for the congregation to gather in smallgroups during the worship in order to pray for the needs ofone another. Towns writes that this place of prayer146 200Elmer Towns, An Inside Look at Ten of Today's Most Innovative Churches (Ventura, CA: Regal Books, 1990), 66-67. 201Wayne A.

It is the connection within thecommunity that provides impetus for transformation. Furthermore, the distinctive nature of the apostolic community promotes evangelism. Elliott suggeststhat the community represents \"the basic social organizationthrough which the gospel advances from Palestine to Rome.\" 202 Through the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, the apostoliccommunity establishes solidarity for the church's missionaryenterprise. 203147 204Zygmunt Bauman, \"What Prospects of Morality in Times of Uncertainty?\" Theory, Culture, and Society 15 (February 1998): 11-12. 205Thom S.

This writer seeks todemonstrate the necessity of a commendable community for theevangelization of postmodern people. 206 The apostles' doctrine and koinwniva transform worldviews so that the community becomes \"the contemporary embodiment of the paradigmatic biblical narrative.\"207 Witness occurs through the \"way of life\" of the community. Nicholas Lash proposes that martyrdom is the \"performance orenactment of the biblical text: in its 'activereinterpretation.'\" 208 In order to overcome the postmodern scepticism of truth, an apostolic approach seeks to148 209Ibid. 210Wayne A. Meeks, The Origins of Christian Morality: The First Two Centuries (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1993), 5. The contention of this writer is that the Spiritforms community, and the morals or ethics that proceed fromthe community proceed from the demands of the Spirit uponthe community as revealed through Scripture. 211Brian J. Capper, \"The Palestinian Cultural Context of Earliest Christian Community of Goods,\" in The Book of Acts in Its Palestinian Setting , ed. Richard Bauckham, vol. 4, The Book of Acts in Its First Century Setting (Granddemonstrate the truth of the gospel through the performative interpretation of Scripture in the way-of-life of theapostolic community. In other words, the Christianworldview is \"lived-out\" through the community of faith, andthis presents the \"transformative power of Christian'martyrdom.'\" 209 Meeks suggests that \"making morals means making community.\"210 The premise of this section, however, is that ethics proceed from the demands of the Spirit andthe One to whom He bears witness. The Spirit establishescommunity, and the community adheres to His demands. The Ethics of Community: Acts 2:44-47 and the Importance of ajllhvlwn in Pauline Paraenesis The description of the apostolic community in Acts presents the ideal paradigm for the ethic of community. Capper and Schmithals indicate that Luke records thesummaries to present the Christian community as an idealcommunity (Acts 2:44-47; 4:32-35). 211 These summary149 Rapids: Eerdmans, , 334-35. 212Alan Brehm, \"The Significance of the Summaries for Interpreting Acts,\" Southwestern Journal of Theology 33 (Fall 1990): 33. 213Ibid., 35.

Unity of the apostolic community leads them to help a[n ti~ creivan ei\\cen (Acts 4:35). 213 T. B. Maston indicates that there are three aspects to the apostolic ethic in Acts: ethic of the Spirit, ethicof fellowship, and ethic of inclusion. 214 The ethic of the Spirit centers on the decision-making within the communityof faith recorded specifically in Acts 5:1-11 and 15:1-29. The fellowship ethic focuses upon the \"the concept ofsharing.\" The ethic of inclusion involves the inclusion ofGentiles in the community (Acts 11:1-18). This apostolicethic presents a paradigm for the contemporary church. Although the community of goods in Acts 2 and 4 appear as an150 215Gordon Fee, Paul, the Spirit, and the People of God (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 1996), 115, 106. 216See also the ethic of humility in Rom another with brotherly love, outstretching one another with honor.\" Here, prohgouvmenoi indicates the desire to be the best at giving honor to one another.

Paul describes the apostolic ethic in his exhortation or paraenetic sections of his letters. His use of ajllhvlwn (and ajllhvlou~) demonstrates this ethic. Following the pattern of Christ, an apostolic ethic focuses on love. 215 Phil 2:1-4 specifically reveal the principle of love in the apostolic ethic of the community.216 In verse 3, Paul presents the \"modest self-assessment\" calls for each member of the community to seek the \"advantage ofhis fellow believers\" above personal benefit. 218 This is the151 291-92. 219\"Who existing in the form of God.\" This translation follows Gordon Fee, Paul's Letter to the Philippians , 202-204.

Dunn, Christology in the Making: A New Testament Inquiry into the Origins of the Doctrine of the Incarnation (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1980), 114-20. He views thispassage merely a depiction of Christ's humanity. 220\"He emptied himself receiving the form of a slave\" and \"being found in outward appearance as a man.\" 221G.

Martin argues against such an ethical interpretation ofthis hymn, proposing instead that the purpose of the hymn inthe midst of Paul's ethical instruction is to call the community to live worthy of Christ's kenosis, death, and exaltation. His conclusion, however, does not militateagainst the ethic of community toward one another. Indeed,his conclusion only strengthens the portrait of this ethic. 225L. W. Hurtado, \"Jesus as Lordly Example in Philippians 2:5-11,\" in From Jesus to Paul: Studies in Honour of Francis Wright Beare , ed. P. Richardson and J. C.

As Schnackenberg concisely indicates, \"'zueinander,'unterstreicht die Verpflichtung zur Gemeinschaft.\" 226 Relationally, this commitment to the community involves153 227BAGD, s. v. \" crhstovth~ ,\" 886.

Once again, the key to apostolic ethic is found in (Col 3:14),237 the apostolic ethic finds tangible expression. Paul's use of ajgaphv with ajllhvlwn indicates the reciprocity of love.238 This love produces spiritual strengthening of one another. This edification involves the pursuit of ta; th`~ oijkodomh`~ th`~155 239\"The for another.\" 240\"To admonish one 32b exhortation, \"comfort one another,\" focusesupon the eternal association of all who are in Christ, eventhose who have already died.

Other tangible expressions of the principle of love in apostolic ethics include proslambavnesqe ajllhvlou~, kaqw;~ informs the relationship between the dunatoi; and the ajduvnatoi in Rome.

Sweet, Post-Modern Pilgrims , 115.postmodern people depends upon a community which follows the principle of Christ's love for one another as exemplified byChrist Himself. Thus, the principle of apostolic ethics islove and the pattern is Christ. The Postmodern Need for Intimacy The postmodern need for intimacy presents a connecting link between the gospel and postmodernism. Inthe postmodern world, individuals possess a hunger forcommunity and connection. An apostolic approach seeks tobring ideal community to the hearts of postmodern people. Indeed, as Leonard Sweet suggests, \"relationship issuesstand at the heart of postmodern culture.\" 249 Kenneth Gergen notes that postmodernism leads individuals into \"a state ofcontinuous reconstruction.\" 250 In the flux of interminable meaning, postmodern people seek \"a self-identity within aconnectional framework of neighborliness, civic virtue, Middleton and Walsh indicate that postmodern people158 252Middleton and Walsh, Truth Is Stranger Than It Used to Be , 145-46. 253Peter Berger, The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1967), 22. 254Stanley Grenz, A Primer on Postmodernism (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 255Rorty, Objectivity, Relativism, and Truth , idem., Essays on Heidegger and Others , 163. 256Rorty, Consequences of Pragmatism , 166.exist in a state of \"radical\" homelessness.252 The deconstruction of metanarrative is also the deconstructionof reality. As such, postmodern people are \"submerged in aworld of disorder, senselessness, and madness.\" 253 They exist in a state of exile, searching for intimacy in a worldof violence and isolation. Postmodern people, in turn, yearn for community that embodies \"wholesome, authentic, and healingrelationships.\" 254 Rorty's espousal of a communal view of understanding promotes the community as the creator ofidentity, meaning, and value for the individual. 255 Rorty suggests that in a world with contingencies rather thantruth \"loyalty to other human beings clinging togetheragainst the dark\" is a more appropriate pursuit than thepursuit of truth or the goal of \"getting things right.\" 256 Being informed by 257Charles E. Winquist, Desiring Theology 259Ibid., 146-47. 260Ibid., 148-50.postmodernism, Winquist suggests that \"we can no longer develop an ethic in itself.\"257 By this, Winquist embraces a postmodern skepticism toward any claim to a universal,absolute ethic. In response to this \"epistemicundecidability,\" Winquist proposes \"paraethics.\" Hedescribes \"paraethics\" as a \"belief that life is lessbeautiful when people are oppressed and disenfranchised.\" 258 \"Paraethics\" seeks to \"deterritorialize\" texts, so that notext has a privileged place. 259 With \"perspectives that are never absolute,\" Winquist proposes that the \"becoming ofparaethics\" is love. This love, however, is \"contingent onplace and time\" and subject to the \"finite experience\" ofrelative context. 260 The context of the individual, therefore, informs and directs the becoming of \"paraethics.\" In the view of this writer, an apostolic approach presents a more constructive avenue of ethics. Beinginformed by the apostolic community of the NT, an apostolicapproach seeks to embody the principle of love in Christ. Rather than allowing the world of contingencies to 'invisible,' unseeable, no structured institution and nospecific form of organization.\" 264Ibid., 129. \"The postmodern creates us \"hoboes\" in a land of values, ethically unsatisfied, morallyhomeless and always on the search for the other, the new.\"and direct the ethics in which one engages, 261 apostolic ethics allows the paradigm of Christ unveiled by the Spiritof truth to dictate and direct moral principles andobligations. An apostolic approach, therefore, speaks with\"decidability\" to the postmodern need for intimacy. Helmut Anselm describes the necessity of an ethical response to the postmodern generation. 262 Anselm indicates that the postmodern generation is an ethical community whichneeds a stable, concrete way of life. Postmodern Neuen.\" 264 This evaluation necessitates that the church is to provide a161 265Ibid., 135. \"One cannot however mediate to the youth through speeches, but only through specific action,not through theories, but through practice.\" 266Stanley Hauerwas, A Community of Character: Toward a Constructive Christian Social Ethic (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1981), 92.stable, concrete \"way-of-life.\" This concrete ethic is built upon the principle of love and the pattern of Christ. Anselm calls for a movement in the church from \"virtuelleEthik-Community\" dominated by speeches and theories. Hesuggests that 265 The practice of an apostolic approach follows the principle of love and the pattern of Jesus Christ modeled by the apostolic church in Acts and in Paul's use of ajllhvlwn. The ethic of community focuses upon the ethic of Christ, which is not a theory, but an active engagement of others. The Commendable Community and Evangelism, Acts 2:47, 5:13 A community following an apostolic approach to ethics provides a commendable community for people in apostmodern setting. Stanley Hauerwas posits that all humanrelationships are \"splintered and tribal existence\" incomparison to a church which reflects an apostolic ethic. 266 An apostolic community of love in Christ satisfies the162 267The apostolic community had \"favor with all the people.\" Ernst Haenchen, The Acts of the Apostles: A Commentary , trans.

C. Torrey, however, considers loipw`n to refer to the Jewish religious leaders and kalla`sqai to the arrest of the Christians.275 This writer follows Marshall who proposes the intent of the verse is: \"unbelieving Jews kept away from the Christians.\"276164 277Polhill, Acts, 164. 278I.

Daniel Shaw, \"In Search of Post-modern Salvation,\" Evangelical Review of Theology 22 (1998): 57.The fear of \"half-hearted\" allegiance to the apostolic community provides a corrective to the social ministry in which it engaged. The provision for a[n ti~ kreivan ei\\cen most likely attracted a large following in Jerusalem. The incident with Ananias and Sapphira, however, caused those who were looking for physical needs to evaluate theirtrue commitment to Christ. Unless they were willing tosubmit to the Spirit's power, they kept their distance. 277 Nevertheless, even those who feared participation in the apostolic community \"could not help praising them asthey were impressed by what they did.\" 278 In fact, the ethic of the commendable community, especially when joined withthe powerful demonstrations of God's presence and power, ledto the growth of the community (Acts 5:14). Vaughanproposes that the purity of the community and the obviouspresence of the Lord promotes the growth of the church. 279 R. Daniel Shaw suggests that the church in the postmodern world must utilize specific ministry to those whoare in need as she evangelizes of postmodern individuals. 280 165 281Allison A.

Timothy R. Phillips and Dennis L. Okholm (Downers Grove: InterVarsity,1995), 182-93. He proposes that the gospel is a \"holy, loving, just,forgiving, life-giving community\" which reflects theprinciple of love and the pattern of Christ (Ibid., 190). \"Plausibility structure\" is a \"social structure whichmanifests the worldview of a people\" (Ibid., 186).An apostolic approach seeks such an holistic approach. An apostolic community responds to the practical as well asspiritual needs of its members (Acts 4:32, 34-35; 6:1-6). Evangelism and social action join together to the postmodern world. Trites writes: \"Such anunselfish, caring fellowship was undeniably attractive tothe pagan world, and it still is.\" 281 This is not to say that a commendable community \"makes true\" the gospel. Hauerwas appears to present such aconclusion when he suggests that \"the truthfulness\" of astory \"is known by the kind of community [it] shouldform.\" 282 Dennis Hollinger rightly proposes that the church, as \"a visible, corporate expression\" of the gospel, servesas a witness in the postmodern world. 283 Unlike Hauerwas, this writer proposes that the truthfulness of the gospel isinherent in its nature as divine revelation and witness. 166 284Ibid., 187. 285William C.

Okholm (Downers Grove: InterVarsity, 1995), 101-27.The Spirit of truth bridges the truth of the gospel to postmodern people. Yet, in evangelism, the community'sactions join with the Spirit's witness to Christ. Bergerproposes that the \"reality of the gospel is mediated\"through the faith-community modeling the apostolic ethic. 284 As such, an apostolic approach presents a model for lifewithin community which postmodern people seek. 285 An apostolic approach for the evangelization of postmodern people exalts the principle of love for oneanother and follows the pattern of Christ in the community. In this way, the community of faith \"incarnates\" intimacy,and the postmodern desire for intimacy finds fulfillment inthe commendable community, which shows love and practical concern for a[n ti~ creivan ei\\cen . Kevin Graham Ford calls for a commendable community in the evangelization of postmodern people. He suggeststhat the \"intellectual dimension\" 287Kevin Graham Ford, Jesus for a New Generation: Putting the Gospel in the Language of Xers (Downers Grove: InterVarsity, 1995), 136-37. E. Autrey, Evangelism in New Studies 19 (1972-1973): 271-87.Although this writer does not concur completely with Ford's conclusions about apologetics in the evangelization ofpostmodern people, his emphasis on community is insightful. The commendable community in which the church is a \"safe andnurturing haven of relational stability\" presents the mosteffective tool for the evangelization of postmodernpeople. 287 Obstacles to Community: Deception and Division When deceit and division mark the community of faith, these obstacles encumber the \"truthful telling\" ofthe gospel. 288 The apostolic ethic, which exegetes the love of God through Christ to others, becomes the target ofSatan's attack against the faith-community. 289 The deception of Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5:1-11)290 and the division between the Hellenists and the Hebrews (Acts 6:1-6)demonstrate an approach to overcome these obstacles. 291 168 292Trites, \"Church Growth in the Book of Acts,\" 172. 293Brian Capper, \"The Interpretation of Acts 5.4,\" Journal for the Study of the New Testament 19 (1983): 117- 31. Capper shows that the candidates for membership in theEssene community went through a probation period in whichall personal property was given, but ownership was nottransferred. To deceive the community demonstrated a lackof trust in the community. 294B. Capper, \"Palestinian Cultural Context of Earliest Christian Community of Goods,\" 337-38. 295F. F. Bruce, Acts of the Apostles , 105 n. 15. 296B. Capper, \"Palestinian Cultural Context of Earliest Christian Community of Goods,\" 338-39.Accordingly, this writer will seek to demonstrate how the apostolic church responded to these threats.292 The setting of the deception and judgment of Ananias and Sapphira informs the approach involved in theresolution of the problem in the community. Capper providesan extensive analysis of the community of goods in itsPalestinian context. He concludes that the violation of thecouple finds a parallel in the Essene community. 293 In drawing this comparison, Capper connects membership in thecommunity with the transfer of personal property. 294 Bruce, however, rightly indicates that such a conclusion outweighsthe evidence. 295 Furthermore, the demand of the surrender of personal property to join the community finds no parallel inthe NT. Indeed, Peter's questions in verse 4 demonstratethe voluntary nature of the community of goods. 296 169 297F. F. Bruce, Acts of the Apostles , 102. 298M.

The methodology of oJ satana`~ is the temptation to sin. 298 In an attempt to garner a reputation for generosity, Ananias and Sapphira seek yeuvsasqai (Acts 5:3). Yet, the object of this deception pneu`ma and tw`/ qew`/, not merely ajnqrwvpoi~ . The judgment is swift and final (Acts 5:5, 10). As the community of the Spirit, the church must maintain purity in order to maintain effective witness. TheSpirit is the agent of confirmation, power, leadership, andjudgment \"by which God launches the good news.\" 299 The \"execution of Ananias is a prolepsis that the proclaimedword carries the prospect of divine retribution for any whodeny its truth.\" 300 Thankfully, the finality and extent of this judgment does not represent the normative standard. 170 301David P.

The diversity, however, is \"socialized\" bythe unity of the Spirit and the ethics of an apostolic community, specifically in connection with ajllhvlwn. John Milbank writes that \"peace no longer depends upon the reduction to the self-identical, but is the sociality ofharmonic difference.\" 307 An apostolic approach, following the example of Acts 6:1-6, provides this \"harmonic peace.\" Along with the growth tw`n JEllhnistw`n pro;~ tou;~ JEbraivou~ (Acts 6:1).308 This conflict demonstrates the social, cultural, and linguistic differences within the growing faith-community.309 172 310I.

Walter proposes the two-community structure.This diversity, although present, should not be overemphasized since Greek culture had already influencedmuch of the Palestinian world. 310 Although the subject-matter for the goggusmo;~ focuses on the distribution of food to the needy, this probably represents one of many factors contributing to theconflict. 311 This writer, however, does not concur with the reconstruction of many commentators on this passage. Haenchen, for example, seeks to demonstrate the emergence oftwo distinct congregations within the apostolic community. He builds his case from the conclusion that only Hellenistsexperience persecution (Acts 8:1; 9:31; 11:19; 12:1). Haenchen's suggestion is that these two groups are sodistinct that the Jewish leaders persecuted one and not theother. Luke, therefore, creates the conflict within theapostolic community between the Hellenists and Hebrews tomake room for this persecution. 312 173 313\"The Twelve\" and \"seven.\" Conzelman, Acts of the Apostles , 44. 314B.

The apostolic community nominates and elects eJptav to lead the \"separately developing community of hellenistic believers\" rather than to unify the Hellenists and Hebrews.314 The apostolic ethic of community, however, requires a more synchronic analysis of this text. Unlike thereconstructive efforts represented here, this writer seeksto discern the natural appeal of the text. As Bruce notes, the eJptav certainly are leaders among the Hellenists in the apostolic community, 315 but their selection by the community does not necessarily point to the further fracture of thecommunity. In fact, Haenchen initially proposes that \"thisstory seems entirely plausible.\" 316 He then builds a case to \"unravel the tangle\" which he perceives beyond the text. 174 Hengel, \"Early Christianity as a Jewish- Messianic, Universalistic Movement,\" in Conflicts and Challenges in Early Christianity , ed.

H. Marshall, Acts of the Apostles , 127. The Greek names of the seven men leads to the assumption that they were Hellenists.The plausibility of this narrative rests upon a view of Luke's historical reliability. Hengel summarizes theviewpoint of this writer when he suggests that thehistorical details within Luke's writing \"do not fit in withthe popular picture of Luke as a kind of pious, ahistoricalnovelist.\" 317 Accordingly, as Luke reports it, \"there is no reason to picture a breach or separation in the totalChristian community -- only the sort of 'distancing' createdby natural linguistic and cultural differences.\" 318 The problem for the apostolic community focuses upon the \"distance\" between two groups within the community. The Twelve offer \"total participation\" , the community elects seven Hellenists to bridge the distance between those who were voicing their concern and the wholeof the community within the Jerusalem church (Acts 6:5). 320 175 321W.

Postmodern people seek to distance themselves from the \"distance of others.\" They despise the relegation of\"others\" to the place of inferiority. Postmodernism rejectsoutright this \"totalization.\" As Lyotard pronounces, \"Letus wage a war on totality.\" 324 Albert Borgman suggests that the postmodern person desires to hear and to respond to the\"voice of alterity,\" which is the cry of the \"other.\" 325 The apostolic community responds to the voice of alterity.176 326Thomas D.

As such, the apostolic ethic of communityprovides a powerful tool for the evangelization ofpostmodern people. Finally, the obstacles to an apostoliccommunity, which includes deception and division, findresolution through the leadership of the Spirit in apostmodern world. The role of the community in the evangelization of postmodern people does not present the absolutism of thecommunity, which is the postmodern plea. Instead, the roleof community exalts the absolutism of Christ. As Moltmanncogently states: \"The visible church is, as Christ's church,the ministry of reconciliation exercised upon the world. Thus the church is to be seen, not as absolute, but in itsrelationship to the divine reconciler.\" 3291David Tracy, \"Christianity in the Wider Context: Demands and Transformations,\" in Worldviews and Warrants: Plurality and Authority in Theology , eds.

This dissertation distinguishes betweenplurality and pluralism. David Tracy suggests that\"plurality is a fact. Pluralism is one of the manyevaluations of that fact.\" 1 Plurality is \"the sheer diversity of race, value systems, heritage, language,culture, and religion in many Western and some othernations.\" 2 Pluralism, however, is the response to plurality which approves, cherishes, and embraces the multiple, andsometimes contradictory, differences. 3 As such, pluralism178 4Lieven Boeve, \"Christus An Attempt at Apophatic Christology,\" in The Myriad Christ: Plurality and the Quest for Unity in Contemporary Christology , eds.

Therefore, \"Jesus Christ must then be regarded as areligious genius like Buddha or Mohammed -- human beings atthe origin of a world religion, praiseworthy but nothingmore.\" 4 Pluralism seeks the \"deferral of all strong claims to unity or even truth\"5 so that \"there is no officially approved pattern of belief or conduct.\"6 This writer proposes that evangelism in the midst of postmodern pluralities follows the pattern of evangelismin apostolic times. Paul Lakeland, however, suggests thatthe postmodern identification of the \"community ofredemption\" as revisable, pragmatic,provisional seeing what-is'\" demands an approachdifferent from the first-century church. 7 Lakeland's approach does not seek persuasion toward the gospel, but distinctive about Christianity remains within Christianityand in no way challenges or represents itself as superior toother religious traditions, namely, the belief that inChrist God has spoken in a way that human beings can receivethe word.\" 13Ibid., 113.conversation with pluralities which leads to a consensus.8 Lakeland further indicates that the Christian community\"cannot realistically understand itself as the only avenueof the divine into human history.\" 9 Lakeland, therefore, rejects the necessity of Christ for salvation.10 For Lakeland, Nietzsche's Zarathustra defines salvation as\"being faithful to the earth.\" 11 Thus, he concludes that other religious traditions are equally valuable for thesalvation of the postmodern world. 12 Such an approach for evangelization, however, deconstructs the gospel so that it is no longer biblical,apostolic, or Christian. Although Lakeland's approach callsfor postmodern people to \"choose one\" among the alternativeversions of reality, no one version is better thananother. 13 The evangelization of the apostolic church in180 14Harry Eberts Jr., \"Plurality and Ethnicity in Early Christian Mission,\" Sociology of Religion 58 (1997): 317. According to Eberts, the apostolic church faced thecultural, social, and religious differences within thetarget-groups for evangelism: Galilean, Hebrew, Hellenist,and pagan Greek culture. 15Robert M. Grant, Gods and the One God (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1986), 19-28. 16Anthony Blasi, \"Sociology of Early Christianity -- By Way of Introduction,\" Sociology of Religion 58 (1997): 299-303.pluralities presents a better approach for the contemporary church. Pluralities in Apostolic and Postmodern Times The nature of plurality in pre-modern and postmodern times presents similarities as well asdifferences, but the fact of plurality in apostolic age iscertain. An examination of New Testament (NT) literatureprovides a mosaic of the religious and cultural pluralitiesin the pre-modern world of the apostolic church. 14 Robert Grant's summary of the gods in the book of Acts certainlypoints to this fact. 15 Anthony Blasi of Tennessee State University describes the sociology of early Christianitywithin the framework of the Roman Empire. He suggests thatthe context of the apostolic church's evangelization was a\"culturally pluralist environment.\" 16 Several examples from Acts and the Pauline epistles181 17\"For there is no difference of both Jew and Greek, for the same Lord [is] rich toward all who are calling uponHim.\" 18These terms are translated: dou`lo~ (slave), \"The Location of Cultures in Second Temple Palestine,\" in The Book of Acts in Its Palestinian Setting, ed.

The apostle and qh`lu in Gal peritomh; and ajkrobustiva and Skuvqh~ to the list of pluralities.18 Rajak indicates that these listings represent ethnic, linguistic, religious, or socialdifferences. 19 More specifically, however, the apostolic church faces the challenges of religious plurality. Paul'sevangelism in Athens illustrates this plurality (Acts 17). Athens possessed \"a blend of superstitious idolatry andenlightened philosophy\" in its cultural and religious182 20I. H.

Barrett, drawing from kateivdwlon (Acts 17:16), states that Athens \"was overrun with idols.\"21 Furthermore, Bertil G\u00e4rtner's complex analysis of the Areopagus speech seeks todemonstrate Paul's use of Stoic and Jewish concepts as anapostolic approach to evangelize those gathered at Athens. 22 Conzelmann indicates that Paul's speech brings \"therepresentatives of the universal Greek culture into play\"and engages the audience as \"typical Athenians.\" 23 This apostolic approach will be discussed below. As Marshall suggests, \"[t]he world of the New Testament was a world in which different cultures or ways oflife were in contact with one another, leading to183 24I.

The pluralities in postmoderntimes is comparable to the \"encounter of the early churchwith the religious variety of the Greco-Roman world,including Greek philosophy.\" 25 Alasdair MacIntyre argues that the \"contemporary vision of the world\" is a \"multiplicity of visions derivingfrom that irreducible plurality of values.\" 26 When considering the \"global village\" that has emerged during thepostmodern era, one can recognize the veracity ofMacIntyre's statement. Charles Jencks proposes that the\"meteroic\" rise of the information age has increased theaccessibility to various cultural beliefs. 27 Following Jencks, Grenz declares that the information age has \"brought184 28Stanley Grenz, A Primer on Postmodernism (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1996), 18. 29Richard Rorty, Essays on Heidegger and Others: Philosophical Papers, Volume 2 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991), 132. 30Todd Hahn and David Verhaagen, Reckless Hope: Understanding and Reaching Baby Busters (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1996), 38.the world together in a manner never before possible,\" so that \"the global village imbues its citizens with a vividawareness of the cultural diversity of our planet.\" 28 The postmodern religious pursuits reflect the heterogeneity and plurality of the generation. RichardRorty indicates that today's postmodern ethos is filled with\"lots of picture galleries, book displays, movies, concerts,ethnographic museums, museums of science and technology\"which represent the plurality of cultural options availablefor worship. 29 With the demise of the Enlightenment ideal, \"empiricism was rejected as the only way of knowing andreplaced with myriad options. There became multiple pathsto knowledge and understanding, none more important or realthan another. As a result, spiritual ideas were acceptable,but no system of belief was allowed to be more 'true' thananother.\" 30 As with Athens of the first-century, today's185 31Rorty, Essays on Heidegger and Others , 132-33. 32See especially, Bertil G\u00e4rtner, The 46-50. 33George P.

The philosophers of Athens were primarilythe elite thinkers with specialized training and knowledge. The plurality of Athens, while specialized, represented theplurality of the Greco-Roman culture. 32 The age of the postmodern is the age of the computer and the \"informationsuper-highway.\" The postmodern philosopher consists ofanyone who has the temerity to \"run a search\" on the \"net\"and consider the information gleaned as both legitimate andvaluable. 33 The plurality of the postmodern is neither specialized nor representative. The \"truth statements\" orreligious beliefs of the person in the \"chat are aslegitimate and valuable as the \"truth statements\" orreligious beliefs of leading academic theorists in the fieldof philosophy. 34 This status of plurality presents186 35Michael Green, Evangelism in the 1970), xvii. 36Martin Hengel, , trans. John Bowden (London: SCM Press, 1983), 4-11.opportunity and challenge for the evangelization of postmodern people. This subject will be discussed in thelater section dealing with Paul's speech in Athens, forPaul's address provides a paradigm for the faithful andeffective evangelization of pre-modern or postmodernpluralities. Michael Green presents the challenge of an apostolic approach in the face of pluralities: \"We sometimesthink that relativism and pluralism are peculiar to ourtime. We feel it politically correct to adopt them. Not sothe early Christians. They lived in a world more relativistand far more pluralist than our own. And yet they would notmake any compromise on this issue. What was needed was notmore religion, but a new life -- and Jesus could provideit.\" 35 The apostolic church provides insight for the project of evangelization. Judaic, Hellenistic, or Christian? A Question of Pluralities As has already been noted in chapter 3, the apostolic church struggled with pluralities from within aswell as without. 36 The issue in this section, however,187 37Peter G.

Bruce, The Book of the Acts , rev. ed., The New International Commentary on the New Testament (GrandRapids: Eerdmans, 1988), 201.focuses upon the Christian identity for the apostolic community when facing the plurality of Judaic andHellenistic cultures. The increasing differences betweenthe Hebrews and Hellenists find resolution in Acts 6, butthe diversity among Judaic and Hellenistic influencescontinues for the apostolic community. For example, Cornelius' conversion marks a distinctive collision of pluralities for the apostoliccommunity in the evangelization of the world. Bolt suggeststhat the three-fold repetition of the event marks thesignificance of the content. 37 Through the drama of a vision (Acts 10:9-16), Peter recognizes that the culturallyspecific dietary laws \"no longer applied for Gentile or Jewin Christ.\" 38 As Bruce suggests, the gospel's reach \"has been steadily broadened,\" but this story illustrates thatthe time had come for the barrier between Jews and Gentiles\"to be crossed authoritatively by an apostle.\" 39 188 40Blomberg, \"The Christian and the Law of Moses,\" 404. 41\"Pious and one who fears God.\" This description indicates that Cornelius was an \"adherent to the synagogue but not a proselyte to the Jewish faith.\" William Neil, The Acts of the Apostles , New Century Bible Commentary (London: Marshall, Morgan, and Scott, 1973; reprint, Grand Rapids:Eerdmans, 1987), 137. 42Jacob Jervell, \"The Church of Jews and Godfearers,\" in Luke-Acts and the Jewish People: Eight Critical Perspectives , ed. J. B. Tyson (Minneapolis: Augsburg, 1988), 11-20.God's threefold command to eat the unclean animals of the heavenly vision (10:9-16) leads to stunningconclusions: Peter deduces that no person is unclean (v.28), that God accepts people of every nation who fear[H]im and do right (vv. 34-35), and that therefore thegospel should be preached to Cornelius (vv. 36-43). Goddramatically confirms Peter's deductions by sending[H]is Spirit on the centurion and his companions beforehe finishes preaching (v. 44). 40 The collision of plurality exists between the Jewish cultural expressions of the Mosaic law, theHellenistic cultural expressions in conflict with the Mosaiclaw, and the Christian response of the apostolic community. This statement does not contradict the case of Cornelius as eujsebh;~ kai; fobouvmeno~ tou` qeou` (Acts 10:2). 41 Although Cornelius sympathizes with the Jewish cultural expressions and worship, other Gentile converts do not. Jervell incorrectly suggests that the qualifications of eujsebh;~ kai; fobouvmeno~ qeou` represent in Luke-Acts , Journal for the Study of the New Testament, SupplementSeries 72 (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1992), 126. 44J.

The narrative does not indicate that eujsebh;~ kai; fobouvmeno~ tou` qeou` are qualities that one must have prior to salvation. The emphasis of Luke's narrative in chapter 10 points to the movement of thegospel outside the realm of Jewish traditions.

Just as Christ conquered the grave, so too will His followers experiencethe blessings of eternal life. 57 In consideration of pluralities, therefore, the Antioch mission institutes a new chapter in theevangelization of the ancient world. The leadership in Jerusalem sends Barnabas, plhvrh~ pneuvmato~ aJgivou kai; pivstew~ (Acts 11:24), who verifies the ministry and encourages further evangelism. This marks the growth of theevangelistic efforts and the intensification of pluralitieswithin the apostolic community. Interestingly, the statement in apostolic193 58Lawrence W.

In this way the necessity ofproclamation of the gospel to the Jews and to the Gentiles creates a new identification as o{soi h\\san tetagmevnoi eij~ zwh;n aijwvnion (Acts 13:48). 62 This is not an identity of a new religion but as the \"true Israel.\"63194 64E.

But secondly, an exegetical argument which creates a link between closelyrelated prophecies and Leviticus 17-18 establishes thatthe Law of Moses itself contains just four commandmentswhich do explicitly apply to precisely those Gentiles. 75 The four prohibitions included in the apostolic decree indicate the ceremonial requirements from Leviticus 17-18upon Gentiles who chose to live in the Jewish community. 76 As such, the prohibitions present the requirements which hadalways been applied to Jew and Gentile alike. 77 Thus, the apostolic community confirms that conformity to to;n novmon Mwu>sevw~, especially in terms of circumcision, is not a requirement for salvation. The Jerusalem council's conclusion establishes the \"universality and progress of theword . . . on the basis of the unity of the people ofGod.\" 78 One final note needs attention in the consideration197 79D.

An examination of his epistlesprovides an aid for evangelization in postmodern plurality. Paul's letters highlight an apostolic approach whichrecognizes the diversity within culture, yet through whichthe Spirit transforms the pluralities into a unifiedcommunity for the purpose of mission. 86 Paul presents this approach in his epistle to the no longer strangers and foreigners but you are fellow-citizens of thesaints and [you are] members of the household of God, havingbeen built upon the foundation of the apostles and theprophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone, inwhom all the building which is fitted together grows into aholy temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being builttogether into a dwelling of God in the Spirit\" (Eph 2:19-22). 88Interestingly, George S.

See also, of new life upon a believer and the baptism of the Spirit upon the believer, the believer becomes the temple ofthe Spirit of God (1 Cor 3:16; 2 Cor 6:16). This individualreality is also the communal experience in Ephesians. 88 Paul describes the apostolic community as the corporatedwelling place of God in the Holy Spirit. The corporate nature of the apostolic community emerges from the pluralities of Gentiles and Jews. Paulportrays the nature of the heterogeneity within the apostolic community in verse 19 through the phrase, xevnoi kai; pavroikoi. St\u00e4hlin suggests that these two descriptive terms are synonymous in this verse. He further suggests that, inthe time of Paul's writing, Judaism considered the xevnoi with distant courtesy at best and hostility at worst.

To say that Gentile Christians are no longer xevnoi is to say that they \"are not just guests of God, but members of His household.\" 90 Paul also describes the believers as oujk pavroikoi , which is \"one who lives in a place that is not his home.\"91 This idea of an alien or foreigner in Judaism is different from the \"God-fearer\" of synagogue worship. The pavroiko~ is a \"resident alien\" who lives in Israel without becoming a Jew.92 Foulkes suggests that these two terms point to \"people who might live alongside them [the people of God] inthe same country, but owning no land and with only the mostsuperficial rights of citizenship.\" 93 Gentile believers are201 94F.

Much debate surrounds aJgivwn. Bruce indicates that aJgivwn is \"the people of God of all ages.\" 95 Procksch draws upon the analogy of Rom 11:17, which describes the Gentile believers being grafted into the \"holystump of the OT people of God\" as new branches. He then identifies this \"holy stump\" as politeiva tou` jIsrahvl (Eph 2:12), with an jIsrahvl kata; pneu`ma .\" Procksch, therefore, concludes that the aJgivwn are Jewish Christians. 96 Andrew Lincoln, however, proposes that Procksch's202 97Andrew Lincoln, \"The Church and Israel in Ephesians 2,\" Catholic Biblical Quarterly 49 (October 1987): 605-24.

Specifically, according to Lincoln, the Gentiles, who were once far off (Eph 2:13), now are in the \"bosom\" of God'sfamily. 99 In this way, \"each member of the household is functioning optimally in behalf of the whole, not self-assertively in behalf of individual interest.\" 100 Beginning with verse 20, the apostle Paul introduces the imagery of the building and temple for theapostolic community. He describes the foundation of the203 101K. kai; profhtw`n refer to the NT and OT witnesses for God. D. Hill, New Testament Prophecy (London: Marshall, Morgan, and Scott, 1979), 139, suggests that theuse of the single definite article presents apostles andprophets as the same group of people. 102Markus Barth, A Broken Wall: A Study of the Epistle to the Ephesians (Valley Forge: Judson the Apostle in the Early Church (Nashville: Abingdon, 1969), 43 n. 91.oijkei`oi tou` qeou` . Paul explicitly refers to those who proclaim the revelation of God through Christ.101 Both the prophets and the apostles lay the foundation upon which the \"walls ofthe Church bear witness to the community.\" 102 The apostles and prophets \"constitute the foundation ministries in thechurch\" and perhaps \"the first stones to be laid in the newbuilding.\" 103 Markus Barth suggests that ejpi; tw`/ qemelivw/ may refer to gifted individuals \"witnessing explicitly to Jesus Christ.\"104 Schmithals indicates that the phrase represents the \"deposit of doctrine.\"105 The foundation of the \"temple of the Spirit,\" however, does not represent the individualsthemselves.

It seems, therefore,204 106\"For all are sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.\" 107G. W. H. Lampe, A Patristic Greek Lexicon (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1961), 66. 108S.

Indeed, this interpretation meets aujtou` Cristou` jIhsou`. swirls around the location and meaning of ajkrogwniaivou , whether it is part of the foundation or at the top of the building. G. W. H. Lampe indicates thatajkrogwniaivou is the \"top-most angle or point of a pyramid.\" 107 Hanson concludes that Jesus \"is the top stone of the pinnacle of the building.\"108 R. J. McKelvey, on the other hand, rejects this proposal and contends that ajkrogwniaivou refers to the foundation stone of the building.109 Jeremias, however, moves beyond the location of the stone to denotethe significance of the image when he writes that verse 20describes the church as the spiritual temple, the apostles205 110J. , 306 n. 154. 113\"Through Him both have access by one Spirit to the Father\" (Eph 2:18).and prophets as the foundation, and Jesus Christ as the \"final stone\" who completes the temple.110 Foulkes also suggests that this phrase \"denotes primarily the honour[sic] of [H]is position in the building, but then also theway in which each stone is fitted into [H]im, and finds itstrue place and usefulness only in relation to [H]im.\" 111 Thus, Bruce indicates that \"keystone\" is the \"better rendering of ajkrogwniai`o~ .\"112 Paul expands ajkrogwniai`o~ (2:21-22) when he describes the relationship between Christ, believers, and the church. Through the use of ejn w|/, Paul reveals once again the centrality of Jesus Christ in the redemptive plan of God. Through Jesus Christ, the wall of separation between God andhumanity falls down (Eph 2:1-13). Furthermore, in Christthe wall of separation which divides individuals from one another falls down (Eph 2:14-18), so that is Christ's project of reconciliation. In verse 16 Paul writes, kai; ajpokatallavxh/ tou;~206 114\"And that He might reconcile both completely to God in one body through the cross, killing the enmity by it\"(Eph 2:16). 115John B. Polhill, Paul and His Letters (Nashville: Broadman and Holman, 1999), 366. 116The better Basil,Pseudo-Justin, Chrysostom, and Theodoret) calls for thecurrent reading. Other manuscripts, such as the uncialsSinaiticus ( a a), Alexandrius (A), Ephraemi fathers (Origen, Chrysostom, Euthalius, and Theophylact) provide the article, so that the text reads, pa`sa hJ oijkodomhv . Understanding that the shorter and more difficult reading is many times more favorable, the formerreading carries the most terminology of reconciliation is the language of human relationships.115 The result of His death on the cross is the death of the th;n e[cqran caused by sin. In the same manner, the enmity between Jew and Gentile has also been killed through the cross of Christ. Because Jesus hasoffered peace both to Jew and Gentile, they share the sameaccess to the Father through Jesus Christ. Having abolished the wall of separation between Jew and Gentile, Jesus Christ joins the whole building together. The use of pa`sa oijkodomh; without the article calls for the interpretation, \"every building.\" 116 T. K. Abbott concludes that this construction argues for the description of every207 117T. K.

D. church. 117 Moule suggests that the phrase points to a Hebraism depicting the entire, rather than localized,community of believers. 118 Fee opts for the idea that the anarthrous construction describes \"all that has gone intothe building\" while Christ joins the building together. 119 The participle, sunarmologoumevnh , depicts the union of membership into a unified whole. Christ, as theajkrogwniai`o~ , is the bond to join each individual together. 120 As Christ joins the community together, He also provides for its growth, which is the continual growth of the individualsinto a unified whole (Eph 4:16). Schnackenburg concludes that the Spirit is the key to this text. 121 Through a succession of images, the apostle moves his readers through a series of metaphors until theycome to the final image of the community of believers, whichis the \"temple of the Spirit.\" These that Paul's ecclesiology \"finds expression atthe local level, even in this circular letter.\"remote relationships to intimate relationships. Those who were far off are now brought near. Those who were strangersand foreigners are now fellow citizens and fellow members ofGod's household. God's household is a community ofbelievers, who, through the metaphor of a building, exist asthe \"present place of God's habitation.\" 122 Although Lincoln posits that this passage refers to the universal church,123 Fee suggests that the imagery describes more than \"a nebulous entity.\"124 The apostolic community involves personal commitments in relationship. Unity is not a nebulous concoction of contemporaryecumenicism for the universal church. Rather, unity comesthrough the intimate bond which the Spirit establishesbetween individuals within the community. As the sameSpirit dwells within each individual, Paul calls thoseindividuals to express the unity of the Spirit in a personaland intimate manner. This intimate expression comes througha \"gathered community 'filled with the Spirit' and thus'teaching and another' God's 1-3 , 321. Barth further writes: \"No one, not even the church and her most piousmembers, can possess God for [H]imself alone.\" 128Gordon Fee, First Epistle to the Corinthians , 263. Fee interprets this phrase to mean that the body of theindividual is the \"present habitation of God's Spirit.\" 129\"But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, this one is not of Him\" (Rom 8:9b). Peter Stuhlmacher, Paul's Letter to the Romans: A Commentary , trans. Scott J. Hafemann (Louisville: Westminster / John Knox Press, 1994),118. He suggests that Paul's description is similar to theEssene text (1QS 11:9-18), in which the God of righteousness\"on the basis of free grace, forgives the sinner histransgressions, fills him with the Holy Spirit, and enableshim to praise as well as to walk in perfection.\"of songs, including those of the Spirit.\" 125 Hanson correctly adduces that the building terminology in Paul's epistles \"is not an individualisticconcept, but one of fellowship.\" 126 Barth oversteps the evidence, however, when he proposes that this image\"excludes the notion that God's presence might be primarilylocated in the souls of individual believers.\" 127 The related passage in 1 Cor 6:19 certainly speaks to the individual believers as the nao;~ tou` ejn uJmi`n aJgiou` pneuvmato~ .128 Rom 8:9-12 also reveals that the Spirit resides inindividual believers, for suggests a theological contention that one may not possess the Spirit210 130Barth, Ephesians 1-3 , 323, suggests that although individual growth is concomitant to the growth of thecommunity, Paul decisively has in mind here the growth ofthe entire community. 131Walter Society (Downers Grove: chapter 1, \"Prevailing Postmodern Themes: Pluralism\"apart from the church.

The apostolic community, facing themultiplicity of plurality, finds unity through the power ofthe Spirit, uniting their hearts and lives with the commonmission of evangelism. Evangelization in the Midst of Pluralism 133 Pluralism also presents a problem for the211 134Alister McGrath, \"The Challenge of Pluralism for the Contemporary Christian Church\" Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society 35 (September 1992): 361-73. 135Alister McGrath, Evangelicalism and 1995), After Virtue , 2d ed. (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1984), 30-31.evangelization of the postmodern person.134 Alister McGrath suggests that pluralism is a common issue for thecontemporary and the New Testament church. The NewTestament church was not content with \"conversation\" or\"dialogue\" with the pluralities, but they preached thegospel. McGrath concludes that the future of Christianitydepends upon evangelism. 135 The Imperial Ethic of Pluralism Cherished pluralism is the only acceptable absolute in postmodernism and is the ethic which dominates.136 Insightfully, Alasdair MacIntyre indicates that thepostmodern culture has embraced \"psychologicaleffectiveness\" as the replacement to truth. 137 He further writes that the pursuit of meaning \"cannot be simply orunconditionally identified with any particular moralattitude or point of view . . . just because of the fact212 138Ibid., Lane Craig, \"Politically Incorrect Salvation,\" in Christian Apologetics in the Postmodern World, eds.

Craig, \"Politically Incorrect Salvation,\" 77.that its judgments are in the end criterionless.\"138 The result of \"criterionless\" judgment is the exaltation ofplurality. 139 The postmodern setting, therefore, gives rise to the \"profound human meaning and importance\" of theplurality of religious traditions. 140 As such, Allan Bloom suggests that \"relativism is necessary to openness; and thisis the virtue, the only virtue. . . . Openness -- and therelativism that makes it the only plausible stance in theface of various claims to truth . . . is the great insightof our times.\" 141 Craig proposes that the \"postmodernist is not merely saying that we cannot know with certainty whichreligious worldview is true and we therefore must be open-minded; rather he maintains that none of the religiousworldviews is objectively true, and therefore none can beexcluded in deference to the allegedly one true religion.\" 142 213 143F.

The Areopagitica , Acts 17:16-34 In light of this imperial ethic of pluralism, Paul's Areopagitica (Acts 17:16-34) serves as an example for an apostolic approach for evangelism.

Conzelmann suggests that Luke takes the common inscription on Athenian altars, \"to unknown gods,\"gospel engaged the pluralism of the ancient world. Following the example of Paul, the Areopagitica speech presents a paradigm for the evangelization of postmodern people. First, Paul begins with a statement of recognition. The deisidaimonestevrou~ , according to Conzelmann, means \"devout\" rather than \"superstitious.\"146 Rather than attacking the various idols in place before him, Paul beginswith an acknowledgment of religious pursuit among hishearers. Although this is not necessarily complimentary, itclearly is not condemnatory. 147 The nature of postmodern pluralism certainly presupposes the same deisidaimonestevrou~ of postmodern people. Paul's example for the contemporary church is to recognize and acknowledge the spiritual hunger and search of thepostmodern people. Second, Paul finds a place for common ground in his evangelistic presentation. The altar ajgnwvstw/ qew`/ offers Paul a starting-point for the gospel. 148 Although they did not215 and then \"changes it into the singular and then uses this as a point of departure for Christian ideas.\" 149\"This one I proclaim to you.\" Hope , 120-21. 151Joseph A.

Fitzmeyer, Acts of the Apostles , 612.In an apostolic approach to postmodern people, the contemporary church must lead the postmodern listeners to aproper understanding of the living God. This demands theuse of specific phrases and terms which will not fit neatlywith the pluralism of postmodernism. Yet, this approachbegins with a common ground and moves toward the specificstatements of God's reality and ultimate sovereignty. Finally, the apostle presents the necessary response to God through Jesus Christ (17:30-31). Theresurrection of Jesus Christ is the proof and verificationof the power and victory of God. 153 The judgment of the world is also included in this approach. The clarity of thegospel demands a faithful presentation of the judgment thatawaits all humanity. The pluralism of postmodern peoplewill cringe at this presentation of an absolute truth-claim. The results, however, depend upon the Spirit of truthleading the hearer toward the conviction that yieldsrepentance (John 16:8-11). Following the pattern of the apostolic community, the contemporary church may deal effectively with thepluralities and the pluralism of the postmodern world. Thefinal analysis of an apostolic approach for the217 evangelization of postmodern people seeks to remain faithful to the absolute truth of the gospel, and yet also seeks tofind avenues through which the Spirit of truth may move morereadily to the hearts of the postmodern people. 1H. 4:492-514. A. Trites, The New Testament Concept of Witness (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1977), 132. 217CHAPTER FIVE PERSONAL EVANGELISM AND POSTMODERN PEOPLE An Apostolic Witness in Postmodern Times, Acts 1:8 As a conclusion, this writer seeks to bring specific application for personal evangelism in a postmodernworld following an apostolic approach. The first issue to consider is the form and function of mavrtu~ with postmodern people (Acts 1:8). According to Strathman, mavrtu~ is one who proclaims the facts and the truths of the gospel. 1 Trites indicates that mavrtu~ in Acts \"presents the claims of Christ against a background of hostility, contention, and persecution,\"2 which finds similarity to postmodernism. An apostolic approach, therefore, calls for personal testimony concerning the facts of Christ and thetruth of the gospel. As already noted, the Spirit of truthconjoins the witness of the follower of Christ to presentepistemological foundations of faith to postmodern people. 218 3\"You will be My witnesses.\" The future tense carries the force of a command in this context. 4Jacob Jervell, The Theology of the Acts of the Apostles (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), 9. 5Michael Green, Evangelism in the Early Church (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1970), 137-38. 6Jervell, Theology of the Acts of the Apostles , 9. 7See chapter 2, \"Evangelistic Approach at Pentecost, Acts 2:14-41.The mandate of Christ is e[sesqe mou mavrture~ (Acts 1:8).3 The believer in a postmodern milieu has the duty to share the gospel with individuals through personal witness. Themanner of this evangelistic witness, however, finds variousformulations. This writer proposes that the power ofpersonal witness moves along the lines of narrative. The speeches in Acts present one aspect of this witness. 4 These speeches serve as guidelines for a contemporary approach in personal evangelism. As noted inchapter one, the postmodern people search for a better storyto provide meaning for their existence. These speeches inActs present a variety of style and form. 5 This writer proposes that this variety reflects the different audiencesto whom the apostolic church evangelized with the gospel. 6 For instance, when dealing with Jewish sympathizers, theapostolic witnesses interpret Scripture as the basis forIsrael's historical place in God's plan of redemption. 7 219 8F.

Bruce, \"The Significance of the Speeches for Interpreting Acts,\" Southwestern Journal of Theology 33 (Fall 1990): 21. 9Ibid. 10Ibid., 22. 11Jervell, Theology of the Acts of the Apostles , 67- 68. 12Ibid., 88-89.Jesus is the culmination and fulfillment God's saving purpose.8 In Acts 5:29-32, \"the apostles affirm more briefly that God has exalted the rejected and crucifiedJesus, and through [H]im is now offering Israel anopportunity to repent and receive [H]is forgiveness.\" 9 Peter's evangelistic speech to Cornelius represents approach to eujsebh;~ kai; fobouvmeno~ tou` qeou` . Bruce suggests that the apostolic witness proclaims the fulfillment of prophecy, the facts of Christ's crucifixionand resurrection, the eyewitness reports, and the \"assuranceof forgiveness to all who believe in Jesus.\" 10 Paul's sermon at Antioch Pisidia eujsebh;~ kai; fobouvmeno~ tou` qeou` . Paul presents a survey of God's mighty acts of redemption in Israel's history (Acts 13:17- 25).11 Jesus, according to Paul's witness, is the summit of God's saving deeds (Acts 13:26-37). Salvation, therefore,comes through Jesus Christ (Acts 13:38-39). 12220 13Ibid., 67. 14I. H. Marshall, The Acts of the Apostles , Tyndale New Testament Commentary (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1980;reprint, F. Bruce, \"The Significance of the Speeches,\" 24.Paul's speeches to a Gentile audience, however, do not include an extensive look at Old Testament Scripture.13 In Lystra, as well as in the court of the Areopagus, Paul forms his witness around the qeo;n zw`nta . Rather than a description of God's activity in the history of Israel, Paul presents the world of nature to point to the \"existence,power, and goodness of the Creator.\" According to Marshall,this presentation leads Paul to the gospel witness, althoughLuke does not record this testimony. 14 Michael Green proposes that the varieties in the evangelism of the apostolic church reflect the needs of theaudience. Following an apostolic approach, evangelism isthe proclamation of the gospel \"in terms that makes sense\"to the audience. 15 As Bruce cogently writes, Luke's record of speeches to Jews demonstrates \"how to present the gospelto Jews and God-fearing Gentiles; and when he reproduces thepreaching at Lystra and Athens, this, he implies, is how itshould be presented to pagans.\" 16221 17Eduard Schweizer, in Acts,\" in Studies in Luke-Acts , eds. L. E. Keck and J. L. Martyn 1966), Speeches 214. This is in contrast to a \"christological\" kerygma.Schweizer offers the following elements essential in the apostolic approach to witness: 1) an appeal to Scripture, 2) the \"christological kerygma,\" 3) proclamation of salvation, and 4) the call to repentance.17 In an application of the apostolic approach for the evangelizationof postmodern people, this writer proposes similar elements. Alvin Reid offers a similar proposal in his evangelisticapproach. Reid draws a comparison between the Jews andnominal Christians who have \"some knowledge and backgroundin the faith.\" 18 Reference to Scripture makes sense to postmodern people who have connections to the church. Gentiles, however, represent the \"radically unchurched\" inReid's model. Reid suggests that \"we need 'sensoryapologetics' to reach a postmodern culture.\" 19 In this approach, the witness tells the \"story of how God relates toman.\" 20 Similarly, Schweizer contends that the apostolic witness to Gentiles promotes the \"theological\" kerygma.21 222 22Dieter Zander, 36-42. 23James W. Sire, \"On Being a Fool for Christ and an Idiot for Nobody,\" in Christian Apologetics in the Postmodern World , ed. (London: Routledge, 1982), 142- 43, 171-72.The personal witness shares the story of Christ's work in the individual's life. Indeed, Dieter Zander suggests thatthis is the most authoritative connection to the postmoderngeneration. Evangelism that is effective to postmodernpeople communicates the personal story of salvation andforgiveness. 22 The metanarrative of the gospel finds connection with the postmodern person through the personal testimony ofthe believer. 23 The postmodern culture communicates knowledge through the fluidity of the spoken word. Thereception of this knowledge depends upon the oral devices,such as rhythmic balance, formulaic patterns, proverbs,mnemonic aids, and other tools to provide associativeremembrance in the minds of the hearers. The narrator movesto the point of action in the story rather than following alinear plot. In the telling of the story, the hearersbecome active participants in the creation of the narrative. The culture communicates truth by story. 24223 25E. Y. Mullins, Christian Religion in Its Doctrinal Expression (Valley Forge: Judson Press, 1917; reprint, 1964), 62. 26Richard A.

Y. Mullins describes personal evangelism: \"Christ is presented to thesoul. A new sense of sin is awakened through the power ofthe Holy Spirit within. At length the will is surrenderedto God in Christ.\" 25 The communication of the gospel of Christ to the soul of the postmodern person comes mostreadily through the personal story of the witness. As Jensen states, \"Stories work by indirection. Working indirectly they have a chance to break through thecultural filters that work in the heads of those wholisten.\" 26 Through the use of story, the witness creates an \"affective experience for the audience of a sermon.\"27 Listeners are provided room to overhear this kind of \"message,\" to bridge the distance and choose toparticipate because they identify with the experiencecreated and the impetus to act evoked by the speaker'sown encounter with \"meaning.\" The goal of this kind ofpreaching is to create an experience of the word of Godin listeners within a range of possible responses ratherthan trying to control the specific response. 28224 29Millard J. Erickson, Postmodernizing the Faith: Evangelical Responses to the Challenge of Postmodernism (Grand Rapids: Baker Books, 1998), 155. 30James I. Packer, Evangelism and the Sovereignty of God (Downers Grove: InterVarsity, 1961), 41.Erickson suggests that \"we may need to modify the way in which we do the leading or present the message. Thismay mean that a more narrative presentation, not in thehermeneutical or heuristic but in the communicational senseof narrative, will have to be the beginning of theconversation.\" 29 This provides the foundation for witness. The role of the Spirit, the ethic of a commendablecommunity, and the personal witness join to provide aneffective evangelistic presentation to postmodern people. J. I. Packer summarizes the role of personal evangelism. Evangelism is just preaching the gospel, the evangel. It is a work of communication in which Christians makethemselves mouthpieces for God's message of mercy tosinners. Anyone who faithfully delivers that message,under whatever circumstances . . . is evangelizing.Since the divine message finds its climax in a plea fromthe Creator to a rebel world to turn and put faith inChrist, the delivering of it involves the summoning ofone's hearers to conversion. If you are not, in thissense, seeking to bring about conversions, you are notevangelizing; this we have seen already. But the way totell whether in fact you are evangelizing . . . is toask whether you are faithfully making known the gospelmessage. 30 Personal evangelism in an apostolic approach presents the story of the gospel through the lens of personal experience.225 31Douglas Moo, The Epistle to the Romans , The New International Commentary on the New Testament (Grand Rapids:William B. Eerdmans, 1996), 891-98. 32\"To have made of Christ.\" 33Mark Saucy, \"Miracles and Jesus' Proclamation Sacra 153 (July 1996): 286. 34Merrill Unger, The Baptism and Gifts of the Holy Spirit (Chicago: Moody Press, 1974), 138-40.The Power for Personal Evangelism, Rom 15:17-21 The various obstacles for personal evangelism in a postmodern world necessitate the empowerment of the witness. Without the power of the Spirit in an apostolic approach,personal evangelism may be just another story among stories. The apostle Paul provides insight into the power in anapostolic approach to personal evangelism (Rom 15:17-21). 31 In this passage, the apostle demonstrates the role of the Spirit which empowers him peplhrwkevnai to; eujaggevlion Saucy suggests that \"the church is empowered to preach by the Spirit (Acts 1:8), and it works miracles through the Spirit.\"33 Unger indicates that such miraculous signs of God's presence in the apostolic community haveceased. 34 Yet, the presence of the miraculous demonstration of God's presence in the apostolic community regularlyaccompanies the evangelistic ministry of the church in Acts. 226 35See John Wimber, Power Evangelism (San Francisco: in in Perspectives in Luke-Acts , ed. C. H. Talbert (Macon, GA: Mercer University Press, 1977), 168-86. 37H. Wayne House, \"The Christian Life Usage of Pneumati as a Reference to the Spirit of God,\" Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society 27 (September 1984): 307- 308.This writer proposes that the manifestation of the Spirit's work in the church continues to play an important role. This is not to embrace wholeheartedly the \"power evangelism\"of John Wimber, 35 but it is to acknowledge in a postmodern setting the necessity of the Spirit's therapeutic work ofpower through an apostolic approach for evangelism. In connection with the source of power, the place of prayer highlights a significant avenue for empowerment inpersonal evangelism (Col 4:2-6). 36 Prayer plays a major role in Paul's evangelistic ministry. In the contemporarychurch, prayer should accompany the evangelistic enterprisewith postmodern people, \"so that the mystery of theindwelling Christ may be proclaimed (4:2-4).\" 37 In Eph 6:18, Paul calls the apostolic community to pray ejn pneuvmati . Through prayer, individual witnesses experience the overflow of God's power for evangelism.38 227 39F. F. Bruce, \"The Holy Spirit in the Acts of the Apostles\" Interpretation 27 (1973): 166-83; C.

A \"stubbornlyentrenched paganism\" is one obstacle to apostolic witness. 44 Simon in Samaria (Acts 8:9), Elymas in Paphos (Acts 13:6-8),and the the first-century. This paganism presented anobstacle to the evangelistic efforts of the apostolicchurch. 45 The contemporary church faces this same obstacle. Postmodern people have a \"healthy spiritual appetite\" thatdrives them \"to seek our mystical experiences, developingtheir own unique religious faith.\" 46 The dismissal of foundations, the relativism of truth, and the pluralism thatdefine postmodernism create fertile ground for thedevelopment of unique religious, syncretistic beliefs. 229 47These religious circles may even be contradictory. 48\"[They] believed Philip as he preached the good news concerning the kingdom of God and of the name of JesusChrist.\" In Acts 13:6-8, Elymas the sorcerer was struckblind by God which led to the conversion of Sergius Paulus. 49F.

I. H. Marshall and David Peterson (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1998), 444.Based upon various mystical experiences and philosophies from a multitude of religious circles, postmodern peopleembrace a contemporary form of paganism. 47 Luke exorcisms (Acts 8:7) serve as \"visible 'signs' confirming the message that heproclaimed.\" 49 Luke presents Simon of Samaria as a pagan counterpart to Philip and the apostolic ministry (Acts 8:9-11). 50 Simon receives baptism along with other converts, but then he considers the acquisition of miraculous power \"amatter of greed rather than grace (8:14-23),\" offering moneyto Peter for the power of the Spirit. 51 230 52Simone Weil, Waiting for God , trans. Emma Craufurd (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1951), 185. Weil offersthis conclusion based upon spiritual pursuits of individualssince she includes those who have embraced a native religionas well as those who have not embraced any formal religion. 53J. Richard Middleton and Brian J. Walsh, Truth Is Stranger Than It Used to Be: Biblical Faith in a PostmodernAge (Downers Grove: InterVarsity, 1995), 191. 54M. Early Church , 132. \"The dunamis shown by the Christians appealed to a magician like Simon Magus or Elymas.\"This encounter of Phillip and Peter with Simon reveals the nature of personal evangelization before theobstacle of paganism in a postmodern milieu. First, thepersonal witness must proclaim the gospel. Unlike SimoneWeil, the apostolic approach seeks to evangelize individualswho adhere to any spiritual pursuit other than Christ Jesus. Weil considers that such evangelization discounts thespiritual pursuits of individuals and the possibility thatthe cross affects the same benefit of salvation to thesepursuits which are \"not too unsuitable for pronouncing thename of the Lord.\" 52 For an apostolic approach, however, the proclamation of the gospel confronts the postmodern\"carnivalesque world of multiple constructions of reality\"and demonstrates the \"ongoing drama of God's redemption ofthe world\" through Jesus Christ. 53 The presentation of the gospel in the power of the Spirit produces the foundationsfor faith in Jesus in the face of postmodern paganism. 54231 55William Neil, The Acts of the Apostles , New Century Bible Commentary (London: Marshall, Morgan, andScott, 1973; reprint, Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1987), 163. 56\"To turn from these vain things toward the living God.\"Secondly, an apostolic approach corrects any syncretistic tendency in the evangelization of postmodernpeople. Peter corrects Simon's misconception of the HolySpirit (Acts 8:20-24). In Lystra Paul and Barnabas eujaggelizovmenoi h\\san (Acts 14:7). After healing a lame man, the people seek to worship the missionaries as oiJ qeoi; oJmoiwqevnte~ ajnqrwvpoi~ (Acts 14:11). As Neil suggests, \"This fascinating glimpse of the superstitious pagan background of the Empire suggests the magnitude of the problem facingearly Christian missionaries.\" 55 The apostolic approach confers no affiliation with the paganism of the people, but calls apostolic approach diligently presents the good news of Jesus Christ as the unique and supremeavenue for salvation. In an apostolic approach, personalevangelism refuses to accommodate the gospel to thespiritual \"postmodern theater pieces,\" which mesh to form acomplex of spiritual claims embraced by individuals. Rather, the apostolic approach presents the gospel as theonly true story of God's salvation to humanity.232 57\"We have the divine necessity to obey God rather than men.\" See, C. H. Cosgrove, \"The Divine DEI in Luke- of God and Persecution,\" in Witness to the Gospel: The Theology of Acts, eds. I. H. Marshall and David Peterson (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1998), 236. 59Ernst Bammel, \"Jewish Activity Against Christians in Palestine According to Acts,\" in The Book of Acts in Its Palestinian Setting , ed. Richard Bauckham, vol. 4, The Book of Acts in Its First Century Setting (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1995), 358-59.Persecution also presents an obstacle to personal evangelism in an apostolic approach. An examination of thepersecutions in Acts reveals that the gospel encountersspecific opposition from the Jewish community. Theapostolic approach in the face of persecution may be summarized by Peter's words . 57 In face of persecution, the apostolic church continues to evangelize. Yet, the \"Christian witness does not prevail . . . because of human tenacity but bydivine empowerment.\" 58 Jewish persecution in Jerusalem occurs in response to the growth of the Christian witness in Jerusalem. Theanimosity of the Jewish leaders focuses upon the apostolicwitness that they were responsible for Christ's passion. 59 Opposition to Stephen, which leads to his death, begins with a debate with the sunagwgh`~ th`~ legomevnh~ Libertivnwn (Acts 6:9). 233 60F.

Bruce, Men and Movements in the Primitive Church: Studies in Early Non-Pauline Christianity (London: Paternoster Press, 1979), 54-55. 61\"[They] went everywhere preaching the good news of the word.\" M. Green, Evangelism in the Early Church , 131- 32. Green suggests that \"Stephen did more for his Master inhis death than he did in his life\" because of the appeal hiscourage and faith presented to the ancient world. 62B. Rapske, \"Opposition to the Plan of God and Persecution,\" 249. 63Ibid., 250.Stephen's defense speech considers the history of God's people apart from any temple.60 The evangelistic importance of Stephen's speech culminates in his martyrdom(Acts 7:54-60). Upon Stephen's death, the persecutionscatters the apostolic community (Acts 8:1-3). Encouragedby the boldness and faith of Stephen in martyrdom, the apostolic community dih`lqon eujaggelizovmenoi to;n lovgon (Acts 8:4). 61 Later, when Paul and Barnabas proclaim the gospel in Iconium, the Jews stir up opposition (Acts 14:1-7). AsRapske notes: \"Relying upon the Lord, they speak fearlessly(Acts 14:3) concerning God's grace and their message isconfirmed by miraculous signs and wonders.\" 62 This boldness exemplifies an apostolic approach throughout Luke's account. This boldness depends upon the empowerment of the Spirit to\"fulfil [sic] the divine plan\" and to \"to carry on throughthe negative effects of opposition and persecution.\" 63234 64D. A. Carson, The Gagging of and and Pagan Society,\" in Christian Beginnings: Word and Community from Jesus to Post-Apostolic Times , ed. J\u00fcrgen Becker, Knox,1993), 261. 66B.

Furthermore, \"Through such tokens asearthquakes, miraculous releases from prison and visions,the Lord gives both [H]is people, and [H]is plan which theypursue, an unqualified, 'Yes'.\" 67Norman Geisler, \"Some Philosophical Perspectives on Missionary Dialogue,\" in Theology and Mission , ed. David J. Hesselgrave (Grand Rapids: Baker Books, 1978), 228-45.In a postmodern world, persecution finds its main expression in the intellectual realm. The pluralism ofpostmodernism disdains the absolutism of the gospel. Persecution comes in the arena of public discourse. 64 The \"claim to absoluteness and exclusivity of Christianity\"presents one reason for animosity toward an apostolicwitness to Jesus Christ. 65 This \"totalizing metanarrative\" remains untenable in a postmodern setting for personalevangelism. An apostolic approach, however, depends uponthe \"unstoppable character of Christian witness\" through thedirect influence and empowerment of the Spirit of truth. 66 Finding Common Ground, 1 Cor 9:19-23 Personal evangelism to postmodern people demands a biblical principle of accommodation (1 Cor 9:19-23).67 235 68Leith Anderson, \"Practice of Ministry in Bibliotheca Sacra 151 (October 1994): 388. 69James D. G. Dunn, Unity and Diversity in the New Testament: An Inquiry into the Character of EarliestChristianity , 2d ed. (London: SCM Press, 1990), 25. III, Conflict and Community in Corinth: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary on 1 and 2Corinthians (Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans, 1995), 213.Leith Anderson suggests that \"Paul should be seen as a skilled ethnologist who understood cultures whilecommunicating truth.\" 68 Paul's example of combining ethnology and exegesis serves as an apostolic approach inevangelizing postmodern people. Dunn suggests that \"Paulallowed circumstances and situations to determine the statement of his kerygma to a considerable degree.\" 69 This accommodation, however, has limits. As Ben Witherington states, \"[Paul's] accommodating behavior hasclear limits. He does not say that he became an idolator[sic] to idolators [sic] or an adulterer to adulterers. Butin matters that he did not see as ethically or theologicallyessential or implied by the gospel, Paul believed inflexibility.\" 70 This concept of accommodation promotes the discovery of \"common ground\" between the postmodern cultureand the gospel. Finding common ground, within limits,provides a bridge for personal evangelism. Suchaccommodation promotes a flexibility, but not compromise. 236 71John Frame, \"In Defense of Something Close to Biblicism: Reflections on Sola Scriptura and History in Theological Method,\" Westminster Theological Journal 59 (Fall 1997): 286. 72George Hunter III, How to Reach Secular People (Nashville: Abingdon, 1992), 95. 73See Rapids: Baker Books, 1999), 150.John Frame contends that there are \"some areas in which Christians may and should be like those to whom they preach,so their witness may be more effective.\" 71 Simply stated, a personal witness who is \"open to beginning where people are,will thus discover that the unchaining of his or her ownimagination is indispensable to reaching secular people.\" 72 As noted earlier, such common ground may be found in the postmodern search for a better story, for connection,and for a better life. 73 One aspect of a better story is the postmodern desire to discover a story that overcomes thepowers of evil in the world. Webber suggests thatevangelism in a postmodern world proclaims that \"Christ'sdeath is a victory over the powers of evil.\" 74 The common ground of connection promotes the commendable community ofthe church following the ethics of the apostolic community. The church is the place of connection in a postmodern world. 237 75George Hunsberger and Craig Van Gelder, Church: Between Gospel and Culture, The Emerging Mission in NorthAmerica (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1996), 32. 76Harry Lee Poe, Christian Witness in a Postmodern World (Nashville: Abingdon, 2001), 74. 77Jervell, Theology of the Acts of the Apostles , 46.Craig Van Gelder suggests that effective evangelization of postmodern people demands \"building communities of faith andaddressing fragmentation and brokenness.\" 75 Finally, evangelism to postmodern people finds common ground withthem as they seek a better life. As Harry Lee Poe writes,\"We have nothing to offer the postmodern world in terms oforganizations, programs, institutions, and structures. Whatwe have to offer is a concrete basis for peace in afragmented world. We have a Savior to offer . . . a Saviorwho will put their house in order.\" 76 Application of an Apostolic Approach An apostolic approach proceeds from the power of witness through the outpouring of the Spirit of truth. TheSpirit of truth provides the epistemological bridge for thepostmodern skepticism. The Spirit establishes community,which, in turn, creates a place of nurture, growth, andwarmth in the evangelistic endeavor. The Spirit of truthfurther produces connection and continuity with Christthrough the inspiration and illumination of Scripture. 77 238 78R. Daniel Shaw, \"In Search of Post-Modern Salvation,\" Evangelical Review of Theology 22 (1998): 59.The ethic of community extends intimacy to postmodern people and provides a living testament to the veracity of thegospel proclaimed. The apostolic approach provides specificapproaches to pluralities and pluralism in the postmodernworld, especially in Paul's speech at the Areopagus. Finally, the personal evangelism in a postmodern milieurequires the witness of personal story, the spirit-filledlife which overcomes the obstacles of persecution andpaganism, and the pursuit of common ground with postmodernpeople. The contemporary church seeks to build bridges to apostmodern world through the evangelistic proclamation ofthe gospel. The search for salvation and forgiveness continues in a postmodern world. Shaw summarizes the situation whenhe writes: \"The shift to a new culture type [postmodern]does not change the human condition, merely the way it ismanifest in daily living. It is in relationship . . . withChrist that we realize salvation.\" 78 The presentation of this approach possesses both weaknesses and strengths in the mind of this writer. Onepossible weakness of this presentation is the danger of theoversimplification of the postmodern thought and situation. 239 79M. Erickson, Postmodernizing the Faith , 100. 80Ibid., 153.The reality of postmodernism is complex, with a multitude of various versions and concerns. This writer has chosen topaint broad strokes in his description of postmodernism. Insuch a description, the danger by which specific patterns ofpostmodernism are chosen to fit the argument of the thesis. Although this writer has attempted to minimize this danger,it presents one weakness of the approach. Secondly, the presentation of this approach may present the weakness of insufficient engagement with thecomplexities of postmodernism. As Erickson suggests,ministry to postmodern people requires that the contemporarychurch adopt some of the characteristics of postmodernism. 79 This writer, however, has sought to present the \"self-authenticating character of the biblical message . . .combined with a strong belief in the convicting,illuminating power of the Holy Spirit.\" 80 As such, there may exist at points a failure to address specific postmodernissues in an effort to maintain an overall connection withthe approach for evangelization depicted in Acts and thePauline epistles. Thirdly, this analysis does not consider completely the current status of technology in the postmodern world. 240 81Leonard Sweet, Post-Modern Pilgrims: First Century Passion for the 21st Century World (Nashville: Broadman and Holman, 2000), 53-83. 82George W. Peters, A Theology of Church Growth (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1981), 17-18.As Leonard Sweet points out, the contemporary church must minister to the \"virtual world\" of postmodern people,utilizing the technological opportunities in a postmodernworld. 81 The relationship between technology and an apostolic approach may be fertile field for further study. Certainly, other weaknesses of this approach occur. Thesethree, however, present the major limitations that thisdissertation presents in the mind of this writer. The strengths of this presentation of an apostolic approach center upon the strict correlation betweencontemporary ministry and the biblical pattern. GeorgePeters indicates that the record of the apostolic communityis the primary source for world evangelism and churchgrowth. This record includes: 1) the Spirit as the divineAgent; 2) the apostles as the divine representatives; 3)witness as the major means; 4) Jesus Christ as the content;and 5) the world as the object. 82 The approach of this dissertation follows a similar analysis and promotes astrong connection with the biblical paradigm for evangelism. As such, the Bible represents the authority for praxis. 241 83Douglas K. Blount, \"Apologetics and the Ordinances of the Church,\" Southwestern Journal of Theology 43 (Spring 2001): 72. 84M. Erickson, Postmodernizing the Faith \"The Gospel for Generation X,\" Leadership: A Practical Journal for Church Leaders 16 (Spring 1995): 39-40.Furthermore, as Douglas Blount states, \"If contemporary Christians are to find a paradigm suitable to thecommitments of that ancient faith which they have come toembrace . . . it will be by resituating the spiritual tradition initiated by their ancientChristian forebears.\" 83 Secondly, this presentation finds strength in the community ethic. This provides a connection betweenpostmodernism and the gospel. The community is the visible,vital expression of the gospel at work in the world. Inthis way, the message of the gospel remains unchanged, butthe community itself provides a flexible, relevant appeal topostmodern people. 84 Dieter Zander notes that the authenticity of the gospel manifested in the lives ofChrist's followers attracts postmodern people to thegospel. 85 It is the contention of this writer that there is no greater community in the world to which postmodern peoplemay connect than the apostolic community in the twenty-firstcentury. 242 86Jervell, Theology of the Acts of the Apostles , 42.Conclusion In the final analysis, this presentation of an apostolic approach for the evangelization of postmodernpeople concludes as does the record of Acts in chapter 28. An apostolic approach results in \"a people divided over theChristian message, some believing, others unbelieving.\" 86 The mission, however, remains the same: \"[They] wenteverywhere preaching the good news of the word\" (Acts 8:4).243BIBLIOGRAPHY General Reference Aland, K., M.
