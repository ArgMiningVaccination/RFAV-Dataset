Reported job titles include: Naturopathic Physician, Naturopathic Doctor, Physician, Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine. ] [Naturopathic oncology is the application of the art and science of naturopathic medicine to the field of cancer care and treatment. Naturopathic oncologists work both in hospital oncology settings and in private practices, bringing their wisdom, perspective and experience to aid oncology treatment teams that seek the best positive outcomes for their patients.] [The Oncology Association of Naturopathic Physicians (OncANP) is a society of physicians who either specialize in naturopathic oncology or who desire to further their knowledge and understanding of the field. OncANP is an affiliate of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP). OncANP's founding vision is, \" to enhance survival and quality of life for people living with cancer through the integration of naturopathic oncology into cancer care.\" One of the goals of the OncANP is to bring naturopathic doctors into standard medical oncology practices. To achieve this, the organization has worked to create a credentialing process to assure a level of competence in naturopathic oncology.] [Naturopathic Oncologists: The OncANP initiated a credentialing process for naturopathic doctors in 2006. A separate and independent board, the American Board of Naturopathic Oncology (ABNO) was established to oversee the process. ABNO established a Board of Medical Examiners (BoMEx). ABNOBoMEx developed standards including training requirements, an application process and mechanisms for an independent agency to administer board certification tests.] [FABNO](http://www.fabno.org/) (Fellow of the American Board of Naturopathic Oncology): Naturopathic physicians who meet standards representative of advanced experience and knowledge in cancer care are eligible for board certification in Naturopathic Oncology. Qualifying doctors whose applications are accepted must completed a 2-year residency focused in naturopathic oncology or have been in practice for at least 5 years with 5000 pt contact hours and submit cases for review by designated examiners. All applicants must then pass a board certification exam in order to be awarded the status of Fellow by the American Board of Naturopathic Oncology. Fellows of the American Board of Naturopathic Oncology (FABNO's) meet the highest standard of the profession as specialists in naturopathic oncology. [The Need for Naturopathic Oncology?] Many people with cancer choose complementary and alternative medicine in their fight against cancer and in seeking to improve quality of life while undergoing treatment for cancer. They utilize therapies including meditation, prayer, acupuncture, herbal, botanical, nutritional diets, homeopathic, and other holistic practices seeking benefit. Naturopathic doctors specializing in oncology serve as capable guides for patients interested in exploring alternative medicine. Naturopathic doctors (ND) support people with cancer to use natural therapies safely and seek to maximally support overall health, fight disease processes, and prevent or reduce side effects of standard cancer treatment regimens for patients who utilize them. ND's promote and teach health related behaviors and may recommend specific supplements or nutritional programs in an individualized treatment approach. ND's are trained at accredited naturopathic medical schools in modern scientific nature cure. Please refer to the AANP at naturopathic.org for more information on the education and training of naturopathic doctors. Naturopathic doctors who specialize in naturopathic oncology understand both the standard treatments employed by medical oncologists and how best to work in a collaborative model of cancer co-treatment. They often help patients maintain their oncology treatment regimens and provide vital support for reducing side effects of those treatments. Naturopathic doctors are well aware of the multitude of 'alternative therapies' promoted to cure cancer and work to educate patients on evidence based treatment modalities. Naturopathic physicians may offer advanced alternative therapies to their patients including things such as intravenous treatments and hyperthermia therapies. You're applying for a research grant!

Prior to initiating a research project, consider the cost of the study to ensure it's feasible with or without funding. Beyond the direct costs of conducting research (e.g. statistical software, purchasing full-text papers, filing cabinets for storage), consider the time spent developing a protocol, analyzing and interpreting results, and writing and editing manuscripts for submission. Potential costs include: - Personal time spent creating a protocol, executing the project, analyzing results, manuscript writing - Storage fees, filing cabinets - Consulting fees for statistician, librarian - REB/IRB review (if not affiliated with the institution) - Statistical software (most common: IBM SPSS) - Publication costs - will vary but can range from $1000-3000 for open access, higher-impact journals To help off-set costs, many researchers will seek funding opportunities. While funding opportunities exist, many are highly competitive with large institutions competing for limited funds. Here is a useful paper: [How to plan and write a budget for a research grant proposal?](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0975947617301328) (Patil S, 2019) Below are some grants that NDs and ND students might consider if their project necessitates funding. Please let the research committee know of other opportunities you are aware of so we can add them! |Name||Additional information||Link if applicable| |OncANP Research members. $2,000 USD grant awarded bi-annually.|| | Will consider foreign organizations proposal, see website for requirements. There are aspects of research that NDs might need help with, including protocol development, IRB/REB submissions, data management, and statistical analysis. You can hire research consultants to help with the aspects you are not able to complete on your own. NUNM offers research consulting: [Contract Research](https://nunm.edu/research/contract/) Many universities and hospitals offer research methods consulting services, however, in many cases, you or someone on the team must be affiliated with the institution. You can contact local universities/research methods centres to find out. Regulatory and ethical approval is most often granted from Research Ethics Boards (REB)/Institutional Review Boards (IRB), or from federal agencies such as Health Canada or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Regulatory approval from Health Canada or the FDA are only required for regulated interventional trials (e.g. phase 1-4 clinical trials). These types of studies are generally too complex to be run by NDs in practice; they require a larger study team and usually affiliation with a university or hospital. Therefore, they will not be discussed. When to submit for REB/IRB approval? Generally, all studies other than case reports must obtain ethical approval from an REB/IRB. On the other hand, Quality Improvement (QI) activities generally do not. There can be some overlap and confusion between what constitutes research versus quality improvement. There are many resources online with tools for determining if your project is research or QI, here is an example: [Quality Improvement vs Research - Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute](https://irb.research.chop.edu/quality-improvement-vs-research) Who to submit to? If you work for or are affiliated with an institution (e.g. university, college, hospital), or the research will be conducted at an institution, or the research subjects will be recruited from an institution, you will generally be required to submit to the REB/IRB from that institution. Many REBs/IRBs will not review studies for independent researchers (meaning you have no affiliation with the institution). Both CCNM REB and NUNM REB will accept applications from independent researchers for a fee. REB/IRBs you might consider: Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine (CCNM) [Ethical Conduct of Research Involving Humans](https://www.ccnm.edu/research/research-policies/ethical-conduct-research-involving-humans) - Will review external research National University of Natural Medicine (NUNM) [Contract Research](https://nunm.edu/research/contract/) [Institutional Review Board - National University of Natural Medicine](https://nunm.edu/research/resources/irb/) - Will review external research Bastyr University [Bastyr University Research](https://bastyr.edu/research) - Does not review external research. Principal investigator must be affiliated with Bastyr. Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine (SCNM) [IRB/RAB Forms | IRB](https://my.scnm.edu/ICS/Research/IRB/) - Does not review external research. Principal investigator must be a SCNM faculty member or staff National University of Health Sciences (NUHS) [Institutional Review Board](https://www.nuhs.edu/research/starting-your-research/institutional-review-board/) - Does not review external research. Principal or co-investigator must be a member of NUHS faculty Private or external IRB/REBs Advarra and WCG IRB are two examples of external IRB/REBs offering services in Canada and the US - [https://www.advarra.com/irb-services/](https://www.advarra.com/irb-services/) and [https://www.wcgirb.com](https://www.wcgirb.com) Most types of research require that you complete specific training to ensure safe and ethical treatment of participants. The only type of research that does not typically require research training are reviews (narrative, systematic, meta-analyses) and case reports. Please be aware that there is additional training beyond what is listed below for regulated interventional trials, however this is beyond the scope of this research toolkit. Note: Always check requirements for your specific location, Institutional review board/Research Ethics Board, and if relevant, your academic institution.

A protocol includes information on the background, rationale, objectives, design, methodology, and project organization. Protocols should be developed for all study types with the exception of case reports. There are many different formats; if you work with an institution you should ask if they have specific requirements and templates. Reporting guidelines: Reporting guidelines are available for most study types. Reviewing these as you are developing your protocol is helpful to ensure you are setting yourself up to conduct your study properly and write a great manuscript. The guidelines have checklists available for a quick review of elements you should be including and planning for. See the manuscript wiring section for more details. - Standard Protocol Items - Recommendations for Interventional Trials - [SPIRIT Statement](https://www.spirit-statement.org/) - Provides recommendations for the minimum content of a clinical trial protocol - The 33 item check-list takes you through items that should be included - Even if you are not doing an interventional trial, this is still a useful checklist to consult as many of the sections will still be relevant. - Observational studies - [The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement: guidelines for reporting observational studies](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/) - Case reports: [The CARE Guidelines: Consensus-based Clinical Case Reporting Guideline Development](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/care/) - Systematic reviews / meta-analyses: - Other reporting guidelines: [The EQUATOR Network | Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of Health Research](https://www.equator-network.org/) Templates and other resources: - Paper: [Protocol Writing in Clinical Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5198475/)(Al-Jundi & Sakka, 2016) - Sample protocol templates: - University of Alberta - Observational and interventional trial protocol templates [Tools & Templates | Research & Innovation](https://www.ualberta.ca/research/research-support/quality-management-in-clinical-research/tools-templates.html) - University of California San Francisco - [Clinical Trial Protocol Development](https://hub.ucsf.edu/protocol-development) - University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine - [Retrospective review protocol template](https://irb.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/ProtocolTemplate_Retrospective_Final_201502.doc) - University of South Florida - [Retrospective chart review protocol template](https://health.usf.edu/-/media/Files/Medicine/Research/OCR/protocoltemplateChartReviews081108sa.ashx?la=en&hash=38E70A2C0B6A5088B1DEF2D41D7C207697CC3248) - National Institutes of Health - [NIH Systematic Review Protocols and Protocol Registries](https://www.nihlibrary.nih.gov/services/systematic-review-service/systematic-review-protocols-and-protocol-registries) - University of Alberta - Observational and interventional trial protocol templates - How to do high-quality clinical research: first steps (Sandercock & Whiteley, 2018) [Click here for paper](https://storage.oncanp.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/13015242/Sandercock-How-to-do-high-quality-clinical-research-part-1.pdf) - Research questions, hypotheses, and objectives (Farrugia, 2009) [Click here for paper](https://storage.oncanp.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/13015242/Farrugia-Research-questions-hypotheses-and-objectives.pdf) - Developing research questions - [Research Questions - Research Guides at Queen's University](https://guides.library.queensu.ca/clinical-trials/research-questions) Clinical Trial: Any investigation involving participants that evaluate the effects of one or more health-related interventions on health outcomes. In a clinical trial, participants are prospectively assigned interventions according to a pre-defined protocol. This includes pilot studies and single-arm trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and randomized controlled trials. - e.g., you have developed a new drug for Parkinson's Disease and want to see how effective it is. You enroll people and give them your intervention. Observational Trial: The study of human acts or behaviours in which people involved in their normal activities are observed by researchers who participate in some way with the activity. Participants in the study may receive therapeutic, diagnostic, or other interventions, but the investigator does not assign interventions to the study participants. - e.g., you wish to know if more frequent medical imaging results in lower recurrence rates for breast cancer, so you collect data from breast cancer patients at your local institution. Qualitative Research: An approach that aims to understand how people think about the world and how they act and behave in it. Data collection may include interviews, direct observation, and focus groups, and the data is usually non-numerical. - e.g., you wish to know why people seek naturopathic care at your clinic so you conduct structured interviews with them at various time points and record your findings. Quality Improvement: A process of systematic, data-guided activities that involves implementing knowledge or evaluating/improving a process or program through established/accepted standards. Quality improvement is designed to bring about immediate, positive changes in the delivery of healthcare in a particular setting. - e.g., you identify that 50% of your patients miss appointments on average, so you develop a new policy to conduct reminder phone calls for each patient the day prior to their appointment. You then evaluate the rate of missed appointments before and after your policy was implemented and report your findings. Medical chart reviews - Uses patient data from charts to answer a research question. They can be retrospective (uses pre-recorded patient data), or prospective (plans to evaluate patient data that does not yet exist). - e.g., you want to see if there is a difference in outcomes among patients you have seen with metastatic pancreatic cancer who utilized subcutaneous mistletoe versus those who did not. You are using data that is already recorded to conduct this retrospective chart review. Systematic Review: a review of the evidence on a clearly formulated question that uses explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant primary research, and to extract and analyze data from the studies that are included in the review. - e.g., you hire a medical librarian to conduct a search of all RCTs studying melatonin and the reduction of mortality for people with lung cancer and conduct an analysis on all the available data. Traditional Literature (Narrative) Review: A comprehensive, critical, and objective analysis of the current knowledge on a topic. Narrative reviews describe and appraise previous work but do not describe the specific methods by which the reviewed studies were identified, selected, and evaluated. - e.g., you wish to describe the procedures of administering hyperthermia for people with breast cancer, so you conduct a search for any related studies and summarize their work.
