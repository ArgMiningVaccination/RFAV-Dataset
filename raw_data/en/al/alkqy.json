Practitioners will be quick to tell you the truth about holistic and integrative healthcare is far from that. Holistic medicine simply means merging the best of Western medicine with whole-body care. Holistic doctors provide integrative solutions which blend modern diagnostics and interventions, with diet, lifestyle, and behavioral changes. And like many experts, we believe it's truly the future of health care. What is Holistic Medicine? Holistic medicine is everything you wanted healthcare to be-and more. Holistic medicine is whole-body healthcare and diverse treatment methods based on your unique case. You'll often hear this referred to as integrative medicine-as it integrates methods from conventional and traditional systems of healing. Holistic medicine often includes diet changes, Ayurvedic remedies, traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture, energy healing, behavioral therapy, supplements, and more. This is in addition to modern diagnostics and testing. Holistic practitioners work to get to the root cause of your issues, instead of merely treating the symptoms. They'll spend more time with you\u2014on average our typical appointments last 45 minutes versus just 18 minutes with conventional doctors (1). And we'll work with you as a partner in your healthcare, to listen, identify, and address your concerns. During a consultation, expect to talk about your diet, lifestyle, sleep, stress levels, supplements, and overall health history. This comprehensive picture of your health helps your doctor apply functional medicine solutions to your individual chemistry. Many experts agree that holistic and integrated medicine is the future of healthcare (2). [Learn more about our full services>>>](https://centrespringmd.com/our-centre/services/) The Future of Healthcare Functional and Integrative Medicine Modern, conventional medicine is amazingly beneficial. In our lifetimes we have seen cures for diseases that were the cause of major suffering only decades ago. We have new technology and diagnostics that show us exactly what's going on inside the body. In many ways this innovation is nothing short of spectacular. But alongside this innovation, comes a heavy focus upon treatment rather than prevention or root cause medicine. Especially in many chronic conditions that plague modern society, medication isn't necessarily the most effective treatment option, but conventional medicine is quick to jump to a \"pill for every ill\" mentality. Integrative medicine pairs the best of conventional treatment options with the ability to expand options to supplements, lifestyle adjustments, and healing methods like Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine. The key is using a blend of the most effective treatment options for each patient's individual situation. What makes holistic medicine so effective and attractive for those looking to take their healthcare to the next level? Related: [IV Therapy - Just a Fad or Here to Stay?](https://centrespringmd.com/iv-therapy-trend/) Functional medicine Practitioners examine lifestyle, genetic, and environmental factors to find the best way to treat the root cause of your issues-instead of just managing the symptoms. Nutritional deficiency testing, hormonal evaluations, and metabolic workups all play a role in how your holistic doctor will address your needs. Personalized care Holistic doctors will want to know the basics for how you're taking care of yourself, including lifestyle, diet, and life goals to develop an individualized and in-depth treatment plan for you. We know that no two people are exactly the same-and this is what sets holistic medicine apart. Modern medicine Cutting-edge diagnostic testing, physiological analysis, and risk assessment will all help integrative medicine doctors get to know you better. In some cases, medication is necessary alongside other treatment options. It is a common misconception that integrative doctors don't believe in or follow science. On the contrary, integrative and functional doctors who follow a holistic approach are open to expanding treatment options to give patients the benefits from all systems of medicine.
