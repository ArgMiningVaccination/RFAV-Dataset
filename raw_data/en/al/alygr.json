INTERDISCIPLINARY GRADUATE PROGRAMS Challenges facing society require an interdisciplinary approach in graduate education. To prepare the next generation of scholars, s cientists and professionals, New Mexico State University offers a number of interdisciplinary degree programs. Through collaborations among departments, our faculty members have created degree programs and concentrations that will equip graduate students w ith research tools and professional skills to resolve complex societal problems. Interdisciplinary programs include the integration of courses from two or more fields of study in an approved degree program, concentration or minor area of study. We offer th ree types of interdisciplinary degree programs as listed below. We also offer several approved concentrations and minors within traditional degree programs.

The program of preparation should be substantially equivalent in the distribution of academic subject matter to the requirements for a comparable degree at NMSU. The required grade- point averages to be considered for admission to a master's program is explained under \"Categories of Graduate Students.\" To be considered for admission to a doctoral program, an applicant must have a minimum grade- point average of 3.0. Some doctoral degree programs also require a master's degree or its equivalent. No student is officially admitted into a graduate program until a \"Certificate for Admission\" has been issued by University Admissions. Although University Admissions considers this certificate valid for a one year period, academic departments may require re- application if the admitted applicant does not enroll in the semester noted in the certificate. Formal application is required of all prospective students, including graduates of NMSU, who seek admission to a graduate program. Students must submit the \"Application for Admission\" as well as other supplemental documents required by the academic department. Supplemental documents may include, but are not limited to, u nofficial college transcripts, test scores (TOEFL, IELTS, GRE, and GMAT), statement of purpose, writing samples, and letters of recommendation. If a student is admitted by the academic department, the student will be required to submit official transcripts , test scores, and the appropriate application fee directly to University Admissions. Other official documents may be required. Official transcripts must be sent directly from the prior colleges or university directly to University Admissions. INTERNATIONAL STUDENT APPLICATIO N FOR ADMISSION An international student that wishes to engage in graduate studies at New Mexico State University must be proficient in the English language. To be considered for r egular admission to NMSU, an international student must submit a Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) with an official score of 550 or above on the paper -based, or 79 on the internet -based exam. The TOEFL is administered by Educational Testing Ser vice (ETS). To learn more about TOEFL, please visit their web site at: http://www.ets.org. As an alternative to the TOEFL, NMSU also accepts test scores from the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). A test score of 6.5 or above on IELTS i s needed for admission consideration by University Admissions. To learn more about IELTS, please visit their web site: http://www.ielts.org/. Only scores from exams taken within the previous two years and reported directly from the testing service programs to NMSU will be accepted. NMSU's code for TOEFL score reporting is 4531. The English language exam requirement may be waived for an international student who holds a degree from an accredited university in the United States, or a country or accredited uni versity where English is the official language of instruction. (Find the list of waiver countries on the NMSU website.) An exchange student that has studied at NMSU for one academic year and has maintained a satisfactory grade -point average is exempt from the English language exam requirement when applying to an NMSU graduate program. NMSU will accept an international student on a conditional basis who has a TOEFL or IELTS score that falls below regular admission requirements. A student who has an official TOEFL score below 550 on the paper -based or below a 79 on the internet -based or an IELTS official test score below 6.5 may be admitted conditionally by University Admissions. A conditionally admitted international student will need to take the Academic English Proficiency Placement Test offered by the Department of Communication Studies. Based on the placement results, University Admissions and ISSS may require the student to successfully complete one or more English as a foreign language course(s). If comp letion of one or more courses is required, the student should enroll in the first such course during his or her first semester at NMSU, or prior to taking an assignment as a teaching assistant. Faculty members can appeal decisions concerning the language training needs of a student. A conditional admission to NMSU may require that an international student enroll in English classes through the Center for English Language Programs (CELP). Depending on a student's TOEFL or IELTS score and the Placement Test administered upon arrival, the student will be placed in the appropriate level of English instruction. The student will register for 3, 6, 9, or 12 credits for each level based on his or her English language needs. The number of credits is determined by the Director of CELP. A student conditionally admitted should be aware that the duration of his or her studies may be one, two, or three semesters longer in order to satisfy the English requirement. For more information about the Center for English Language Pr ograms, go to the Office of International and Border Programs website at http://www.nmsu.edu/~ip/. A conditional student cannot work as teaching assistant; however, he or she can work as a research assistant. A conditional student can later be classified a s a regular student once he or she has successfully completed the required English courses and successfully meet regular admissions requirements. ADMISSION TO A GRADU ATE CERTIFICATE PROG RAM The graduate certificate program of study is designed to develop or enhance a focused area of expertise. The primary purpose of a graduate certificate program is to provide specific skill training to meet employment needs locally, regionally, nationally, and globally. A graduate certificate is a focused collection of courses, consisting of 12 -18 credits, successfully completed by a student in a given discipline or a set of related disciplines. A graduate certificate is not an official graduate degree of NMSU. A student t hat successfully completes a certificate program at the graduate level will receive a certificate of completion statement on his or her official transcript and a formal certificate from NMSU University Admissions. A student has three years to complete a gr aduate certificate program. The graduate certificate program is offered to currently enrolled degree seeking students and students that meet the admissions criteria but enroll solely to obtain a certificate. Completing courses as part of a certificate prog ram does not guarantee admissions into a graduate degree program. Certificate only seeking graduate students who are not enrolled in a master's, educational specialist or doctoral programs will be admitted with a separate classification called \"Graduate Certificate Student.\" Enrolled degree seeking students must apply separately for the certificate program prior to completing half of their required degree credits. A student enrolled in a graduate certificate program cannot transfer credits from another inst itution towards the completion of the certificate program. However, he or she can transfer credits taken in a graduate certificate program into a graduate degree program provided that the courses lead toward a graduate degree in the focused area of the certificate program. The number of transfer GENERAL INFORMATION | 7 credits will be determined by the program of study. The time limit on course transfer is 5 years after the completion of the certificate. APPLICATION DATES AN D DEADLINES Contact the graduate degree program for published application deadlines. If the graduate program does not publish a deadline, University Admissions encourages the applicant to apply by March 15th for fall enrollment and by October 15th for spring enrollment to be considered for financial support. University Admissions will continue to accept applications 30 days prior to the first day of classes. TRANSCRIPTS An applicant is required to arrange to have one official transcript from each institu tion previously attended sent directly to University Admissions. If undergraduate work has not been completed at time of application, the student must obtain a transcript complete with degree statement as soon as the degree has been granted. No application materials will be returned to the applicant. STANDARDIZED TESTS Certain graduate programs may require standardized test scores for admission. An applicant may be required to take one or more of the following examinations as dete rmined by the academic department: Graduate Record Examination, the Miller Analogies Test, the Graduate Management Admission Test. (See academic department description for required testing.) READMISSION An NMSU student who has been out of school for more than two consecutive terms is required to make formal application for readmission to the institution. The application will be reviewed by the academic department and University Admissions. The application should be submitted at least 3 0 days prior to the start of the semester. A student who has attended other institutions during the absence is required to submit official transcripts to University Admissions prior to the date of registration and be eligible to return to the college or un iversity last attended. Admission status will be determined by previous NMSU academic standing. Academic performance at other institutions attended during the applicant's absence from NMSU may be taken into consideration in determining the student's admission status. RENEWAL OF APPLICATI ON FOR ADMISSION The admission credentials for an applicant who does not register for the semester admitted are retained at University Admissions for a period of one calendar year from the date of application. At the end of this period, credentials are discarded. A student wishing to renew his or her application after the one -year lapse must submit a new application. DENIED ADMISSION University Admissions o r the department may deny admission if the scholastic record or program of study is judged inadequate. If denied admission by a specific academic department, the applicant may be eligible to seek \"undeclared\" status as described in \"Categories of Graduate Students.\" If denied by the department, the student may wish to contact the department for additional information. Admission may be denied to an otherwise qualified applicant when the desired program lacks resources to accommodate additional enrollment. A student who is denied admission to one program and wishes to be considered for another program must complete a new application for the second program. Application documents are retained by University Admissions for one calendar year. CATEGORIES OF GRADUA TE STUDENTS A student seeking admission to a graduate program is assigned one of the following categories based upon previous academic performance. Regular Student An applicant whose scholastic record is satisfactory will be admitted as a regular student. This classification includes: 1. an applicant whose grade- point average is greater than or equal to 3.0, or a grade- point average greater than or equal to 3.0 in the last half of undergraduate work, 2. an international applicant whose grade -point average (or its equivalent) is greater than or equal to 3.0, 3. a continuing graduate student whose grade -point average is greater than or equal to 3.0, or 4. a student with prior graduate work at anot her institution whose minimum grade- point average is 3.0. Provisional Student An applicant whose scholastic record is not satisfactory is admitted as a provisional student. This classification includes: 1. a graduate student tra nsferring whose cumulative grade -point average is less than 3.0; or 2. an applicant whose cumulative grade- point average or grade -point average the last half of undergraduate work is less than a 3.0, but who does have a minimum grade -point average of 2.5; or 3. a beginning graduate student who has qualified for admission by taking nine graded graduate credits as a undeclared student (defined below). A student admitted provisionally must complete the first three courses totaling 9 credits of graduate work, with a minimum grade- point average of 3.0. A provisional student who does not meet the 3.0 grade -point average after at least 9 credits of graduate work is subject to dismissal. A provisional student is prohibited from working as a teaching assistant, howe ver can work as research assistant for one semester. A provisional student can be employed for one semester as a grader. Academic departments wishing to hire a provisional student as a grader must submit an official letter requesting permission from the Gr aduate School. Undeclared Graduate Student An applicant who has not decided on a specific graduate degree program and who has an undergraduate minimum grade -point average of 2.5 may be considered for admission as an unde clared master student. An undeclared master student is restricted to transferring 9 hours graduate credit to a degree program. An applicant admitted as an undeclared master is not eligible to receive a graduate teaching assistantship. Undeclared students a re not eligible to receive federal or state financial aid. Transferring from undeclared master to a degree program requires a new Application for Admission. If the student has nine or more graded graduate credit hours, the cumulative minimum grade -point average must be 3.0 for the request to be considered. If the student transferring to a degree program has fewer than nine graded graduate credits and the undergraduate grade- point average is between 2.5 to 2.9 the recommendation for admission will be provisi onal student status. If the undergraduate grade -point average is 3.0 or greater, the admission recommendation will be regular student status. International students with an F- 1 visa are not eligible for undeclared master status. A student who has been deni ed admission to a graduate program by the department may enroll as an undeclared master in the college of interest and can complete up to nine hours graduate credit (exclusive of directed readings and independent study) with a grade -point average of 3.0 or above. Course restrictions placed by the graduate department may constrain enrollment by an undeclared student. An undeclared master student is restricted to transferring 9 hours graduate credit with a grade B or better into a degree program. Academic adv ising for an undeclared master student is obtained from the Graduate School or the academic department. Graduate Study by University Seniors (Senior Petitioner) An undergraduate student who i s in the last 15 graded credit hours of a bachelor's degree program and who is completing all requirements for graduation, may take up to 6 credits of graduate level courses numbered from 450 through 598 for credit toward an advanced degree, with the appro val of the appropriate academic department, college dean and the graduate dean. The student must (1) have a cumulative grade -point average of 3.0 or higher or have a grade -point average of 3.0 or higher in the last 45 credits completed; (2) complete the Se nior Petitioner Form at University Admissions 30 days prior to registration; (3) if accepted as a senior petitioner, the student must file a Senior Petitioner Course Form for each course by the deadline to add courses for the semester in which the course i s to be taken and obtain approval from the graduate instructor, and the undergraduate advisor; and (4) register for the course at University Admissions. The combined total of graduate and undergraduate courses for the semester may not exceed 17 credits. Se nior petitioners must consult with an admission's representative at University Admissions.

FFIINNAANNCCIIAALL AAIIDD The mission of New Mexico State Financial Aid and Scholarship Services is a commitment to providing a high level of service to support students in achieving their academic goals by helping to remove the financial barrier s to college attendance. The office's mission is to offer coordinated delivery of comprehensive student aid programs that are supportive of the recruitment and retention of academically talented and diverse students. Although primary responsibility for educational cost rests with the student and his or her family, NMSU, the federal government, and the state of New Mexico all contribute to assist students pursuing higher education. University Financial Aid and Scholarship Services administers a broad spectru m of loan, grant, scholarship and work -study funding in an attempt to meet the financial needs of the university's students. Students and spouses, if applicable, are expected to contribute from their own assets and earnings, including appropriate borrowing against future income. All information provided to University Financial Aid is regarded as confidential. Students applying for financial aid complete a \"Free Application for Federal Student Aid\" (FAFSA) designed to determine, in accordance with state and federal guidelines, the difference between what the student or family is expected to contribute and the cost of attending NMSU. Among the factors that determine the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) are (1) annual adjusted gross income as reported to the Internal Revenue Service; (2) savings, stocks, or bonds; (3) other assets in the form of a business, farm, or real estate; (4) nontaxable income and benefits; and (5) student's prior year income and assets. Students applying for financial aid should complete a FAFSA by visiting http://fa.nmsu.edu or http://fafsa.ed.gov/. Please refer to http://fa.nmsu.edu/ for more information on financial aid.

SOURCES OF FINANCIAL AID Grants and scholarships are often called \"gift aid\" because they are free money, that is, financial aid that doesn't have to be repaid. Both grants and scholarships can be need, non- need or merit based. Grants and scholarships can come from the Federal government, the state government, a college or career school, or a private or nonprofit organization. Students may do research to apply for any grants or scholarships they might be eligible for, and should be sure to meet application deadlines! Occasionally, a student might have to pay back part or all of a grant if, for example, they withdrew from school before finishing an enrollment period such as a semester. The U.S. Department of Education offers Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants to graduate students attending four- year colleges or universities. Federal Direct Loans are long -term loans available to graduate students. Students receiving an unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan must complete an entrance counseling session by visiting http://studentloans.gov before NMSU will disburse funds. In addition, students must complete an exit counseling session upon graduati on or withdrawal from the University. Repayment of a Direct Loan begins six months after graduation or six months after enrollment drops below half time. The interest rate on new Direct Loans vary according to the year the loan is disbursed. More information will be available at the time the loan is made. Federal Perkins Loans are available to graduate students with financial need and are long -term, low -interest loans with a 5% fixed interest rate. In order to receive a Perkins Loan, the student must comple te an entrance counseling session by visiting http://studentloans.gov before NMSU will disburse funds. Additionally, a Perkins Loan must be repaid according to Federal guidelines. Repayment of Federal Perkins Loans begins nine months after graduation or ni ne months after enrollment drops below half time.

The New Mexico Work -Study Program also provides employment oppo rtunities for students; however, only New Mexico residents are eligible to participate in the program. FINANCIAL AID AWARDS All financial aid awards are based on information provided by the student and spouse, if applicable, av ailability of funds, and eligibility requirements. Any award may be revised based on changes in enrollment, cost of attendance, outside resources, family contribution, or failure to meet satisfactory academic progress. Withdrawals or reductions in enrollme nt may affect an award or any future awards. Financial aid will not pay for audited courses or for classes in which credit will not be received. FINANCIAL AID SATISF ACTORY ACADEMIC PROG RESS Federal regul ations require that financial aid recipients meet certain academic standards to be eligible for federal financial aid. To ensure that financial aid recipients are making satisfactory academic progress, academic transcripts are reviewed at the end of each t erm to determine eligibility for the next term. All terms of attendance are reviewed, including periods in which the student did not receive financial aid. All transfer work is taken into account when satisfactory progress is reviewed. In addition, repeate d courses are included in the academic progress calculation. Grade Point Average: Graduate students must maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.0 (a B average). Grade point values are: A = 4.0, B = 3.0, C = 2.0, D = 1.0, F = 0. Grades of I, CR, PR, NC, W, U and AU are not calculated in the GPA. Completion Rate: Students must complete a minimum of 70 percent of all course work (registered credit hours) attempted at NMSU. Any course with a 12| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2014 -2015 GRADUATE CATALO G grade of Withdraw (W), Incomplete (I), Failure (F), Audit (AU), or No Credit (NC) is considered attempted but not completed. Repeats are considered attempted credits. Maximum Time Frame: Graduate students must complete their program within 150 percent of the credit hours required by the program. Students who have reached the maximum allowable time will be suspended from receiving financial aid. Total attempted hours including repeated courses and transfer course work are included in the student's maximum time frame calculation. FINANCIAL AID SUSPENSION Students are suspended from receiving financial aid if they do not meet satisfactory academic progress standards. Students on financial aid suspension will not receive any form of federal or state financial aid (grants, loans, work study). When all standards of satisfactory progress are met, the student may contact their Financial Aid Advisor to have their financial eligibility reinstated. Please visit http://fa.nmsu.edu/contact -us for a list of personnel. THE APPEALS PROCESS Students suspended from financial aid may appeal the suspension if there are mitigating circumstances affecting their progress. Students who would like to appeal the suspension must submit an appeal form and all required document ation to the University Financial Aid.

INTERNATIONAL STUDEN TS English Proficiency International students that wish to become teaching assistants must prove that they are proficient in the English language. During summer session II preferably or before the start of the first semester of enrollment, each international student who is required to submit a TOEFL (Test of English as a Second Language) or an IELTS (International English Language Testing System) score that wishes to be considered for a teaching assistantship must also take the Academic English Proficiency Test administered by the Department of Communication Studies. Also, students who successfully complete and pas s approved English as a Second Language (ELS) course, and who wish to become a teaching assistant must also take the Academic English Proficiency Test administered by the Department of Communication Studies. Based on the recommendation of the Department of Communication Studies, the Graduate School may require the student to successfully complete one or more English as a foreign language course(s) prior to beginning an assignment as a teaching assistant. If completion of one or more courses is required, the student should enroll in the first such course during his or her first semester at NMSU or prior to taking an assignment as a teaching assistant. Enrollment All international graduate students on F -1 or J -1 visas are required to comply with Department of Homeland Security regulations governing maintenance of status related to full -time enrollment and making normal progress toward completing a degree. Therefore, all international graduate students are required to enroll in nine or more credits (exclusive of audited work) during fall and spring semesters. SHORT COURSES AND IN STITUTES Short courses and institutes are conducted on the campus each summer and during the academic year. Courses numbered 450 and above have been approved to carry graduate credit for students regularly enrolled in the Graduate School. Registration is required to receive graduate credit for these courses. Concurrent enrollment of graduate students in regular and short courses is allowed provided that the combined credits do not exceed 15 in a fall or spring semester. All short courses carrying one semester credit will be graded on an S/U basis, and these S/U credits will be counted toward the student's limit of S/U credits. SUMMER SCHOOL SESSIO N During the summer session, the maximum number of graduate credits a graduate student may take is 9. Students who wish to enroll in more than 9 credits in the summer, must write an appeal letter addressed to the Graduate Dean.

Credit for Military Service New Mexico Stat e University will award academic credit to United States military personnel for courses and Military Occupational Specialties (MOS), based on the American Council of Education Guide (ACE) as well as through national standardized tests, such as CLEP, AP, PEP, and DANTES. Credit for military - training is in accordance with NMSU Faculty Senate Legislation Proposition 24 - 07/08, which was passed in May 2008. Military Training and Military Occupational Specialties (MOS) must have a recommendation evaluation by ACE (in the ACE Guide) for credit to be awarded. Courses accepted for transfer credit are given an NMSU equivalent and become part of the student's official NMSU transcript and academic record. If a student wishes to appeal a decision regarding the acceptance of military training/education and/or MOS for academic credit, the student must submit a written statement of appeal to the Dean of the College to which the student has applied. The Dean will review the merits of the appeal and render a decision. The deci sion of the Dean is final. Only Primary MOS (s) are eligible for academic credit in the initial review and evaluation. Credit for Duty and /or Secondary MOS may be eligible for academic credit if the student petitions the college's Associate Dean. Primary MOS is the primary specialty of a soldier and reflects the broadest and most in - depth scope of military experience. Veterans, active -duty personnel, National Guard and Reservists who are current students or students applying for admission to New Mexico State University may be granted academic credit on a case -by- case basis upon evaluation of military transcripts - the Joint Service Transcript and the United States Coast Guard transcripts. Course equivalencies and credit hours awarded for a particular NMSU d egree are determined by colleges and/or academic departments. Credit hours may be awarded for specific courses toward 14| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2014 -2015 GRADUATE CATALO G degree requirement, or as elective credit. The number of credit hours awarded will be determined by the college and/or academic department. NOTE: Students submitting military transcripts for credit evaluation must keep in mind the Maximum Time Frame policy. See FINANCIAL AID section (p. 11). Veterans' Attendance and Satisfactory Progress The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs requires all veterans receiving VA education benefits to make satisfactory progress and systematic advancement toward an educational objective or be liable for over -payments. Satisfactory progress and regular class attendance are expected of such students. If a veteran receiving benefits is suspended for academic reasons, benefits are terminated and will be restored only after readmission to NMSU. If the university ha s liability claims filed against it as a result of a veteran failing to meet compliance requirements of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the university will not release any academic records on the veteran until such time as the veteran has reimburs ed the federal government for funds drawn in violation of those requirements. A student receiving VA education benefits who is pursuing a degree program offered by New Mexico State University should adhere to the curriculum of that program. Failure to do s o will result in the student being certified for less than full -time status or becoming liable for an overpayment. Military Withdrawal The following steps must be taken by all New Mexico State University students called up for a ctive duty who wish to withdraw from all their classes: 1. Military and Veterans Programs. VA students ordered to Active Duty must provide a copy of orders to the MVP office, Garcia Annex, room 141. To assist in reporting accurate information to the VA Regional Office, student should also provide, in writing, last day of class attendance. 2. NMSU Registrar. All students presenting their orders to the NMSU Registrar's Office, (575) 646 -3411, will receive a military withdrawal from classes and a full tuition and fees refund for that semester. 3. Bookstore. Students who still have their receipts for textbooks purchased the semester in which they are called to active duty will be given a full refund for these textbook purchases when they present their orders. (575) 646- 4431. Military/Veteran Graduate Student Status Veteran benefits are determined by the number of graded graduate credits of enrollement for a given semester or summer session. Listed below are the cre dit hours that determine student status for military veterans. Fall and Spring semester: full -time enrollment includes 9 or more graded credit hours. Students are considered three -fourths time if they are enrolled in 7 to 8 credit hours. Half time enrollment is 5 hours. Veterans enrolled in less than 5 credit hours are reimbursed for tuition and allowable fees only. There are several sessions within the summer term. For the 10 week summer session, full -time enrollment is 6 credit hours and half time enrollm ent is 3 credit hours. During the five week sessions, full -time enrollment is 4 graded credit hours. SPECIAL PROGRAMS Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) The Reserve Officer Training Corps is a commissioning program designed to attract, motivate, and train qualified students for military service as officers. The ROTC program is represented on the NMSU campus by the Department of Military Science (U.S. Army) and the Department of Aerosp ace Studies (U.S. Air Force). Curricula in the Departments of Military Science and Aerospace Studies are divided into basic and advanced courses of two years each. Enrollment in the basic course is voluntary and involves no obligation. Participation in the advanced courses is on a contractual basis and leads to military service as a commissioned officer. Elective academic credit is granted by the university for ROTC classes. Students with prior military service or Junior ROTC experience may receive credit, although not academic credit, for all or portions of the basic courses. All qualified cadets enrolled in ROTC receive a stipend that varies dependent upon the year the cadet is in the program. Scholarships, which pay full college tuition as well as various laboratory, textbook, and incidental fees, are available on a competitive basis. For more detailed information about the ROTC programs, see the College of Arts and Sciences departments of Aerospace Studies and Military Science in this catalog. Additional information may be obtained by contacting the departments directly at (575) 646 -4030 (Army) and FFOORR SSTTUUDDEENNTTSS GRADING SYSTEM Graduate students are expected to apply themselves intensively to the study of the material covered by the courses in which they are enrolled. Accordingly, a high level of performance is required. The student must maintain a grade- point average of at least 3.0 i n all graduate courses taken as a graduate student at NMSU. Courses transferred from the undeclared program at NMSU or from other institutions will be included in determining grade -point averages. Grades The grades awarded in all courses are indicative of the quality of work done. Their significance is as follows: Letter Grade Point per Credit A \u2014 For excellent work 4 B \u2014 For better than average work 3 C \u2014 For average work 2 D \u2014 For below average work 1 F \u2014 For failing work 0 W \u2014 Withdrawal 0 N \u2014 Grade not submitted 0 CR \u2014 Credit authorized, but not letter grade 0 IP \u2014 In progress 0 PR \u2014 Progress on graduate thesis 0 S \u2014 Satisfactory work 0 U \u2014 Unsatisfactory work 0 I \u2014 Incomplete 0 AU \u2014 Audit 0 Distinctions within a letter grade may be indicated by the use of plus or minus, and these will become part of the official record. S Grade An S grade indicates satisfactory performance. C, D, and F Grades Although C grades earned a t New Mexico State University may be counted toward the requirements for an advanced degree, this is not considered acceptable graduate- level performance. Courses in which a student earns only a D or F may never be counted toward a graduate degree, althoug h such grades are calculated in determining the grade- point average. Therefore, any grades of D or F must be compensated for by the necessary hours of A if the student is to have the 3.0 grade- point average required before awarding of the degree. Incomplet e Grade The grade of Incomplete is given for passable work that could not be completed due to circumstances beyond the student's control. The following regulations apply to removing or changing an Incomplete grade: 1. Instructors m ay assign an Incomplete grade only if the student is unable to complete the course due to circumstances beyond the student's control that develop after the last day to withdraw from the course. Examples of appropriate circumstances include documented illne ss, documented death or crisis in the student's immediate family, and similar circumstances. Job related circumstances are generally not appropriate grounds for being assigned an Incomplete. In no case is an Incomplete to be used to avoid the assigning of D, F, or Unsatisfactory grades for marginal or failing work. GENERAL INFORMATION | 15 2. To assign an I grade, the instructor must complete the \"I Grade Information Form\" and have the form delivered to the course dean. The instructor will state in writing the steps necessary to co mplete the remaining course work or the instructor may indicate that the student will be required to re -enroll in the course to receive credit (in which case the I grade will not be removed). The student will sign this document or the course dean will send a copy of the document to the student's official permanent address. 3. The student is entitled to have the Incomplete grade removed from the transcript only if the student completes the remaining course work as specified on the \"I Grade Information Form,\" in a manner satisfactory to the instructor. The work must be completed within 12 months after the Incomplete is assigned and prior to the student's graduation, or within a shorter period of time if specified by the instructor on the \"I Grade Information F orm.\" If the student fails to complete the course work, the instructor may change the Incomplete grade to any appropriate grade (including D, F, or Unsatisfactory) provided that the instructor stated that this would occur on the \"I Grade Information Form.\" 4. Incomplete grades can be removed from the transcript by the instructor only during the 12 -month period following assignment of the Incomplete or prior to the student's graduation, whichever comes first. To remove an Incomplete, the instructor must complete a \"Change of Grade Form\" and file the form with the Office of the Registrar. The instructor may assign whatever grade is appropriate for the entire course. This may include grades of D, F, or Unsatisfactory. An Incomplete not changed by the assigning instructor within 12 months and prior to graduation shall remain an Incomplete grade thereafter. 5. A student may re- enroll and receive credit for any course for which an Incomplete grade was previously received, but retaking the course will not result in removal of the Incomplete grade from the student's transcript. The effect of removing an Incomplete grade on a student's academic standing (scholastic warning, probation, or suspension) depends on the date the transaction is officially recorded on the stu dent's academic record. If the transaction is recorded before the student begins another semester, the grade replacing the Incomplete is included in the grade -point average calculation that establishes the student's academic standing. If the transaction is recorded after the student begins another semester, the new grade's effect on academic standing is based upon its inclusion with grades for the semester in which the student is enrolled. Students may appeal an unsatisfactory grade through the procedure de scribed in the \"Disciplinary Issues for Graduate Students\" section of this catalog. Independent Studies Independent study courses (including directed reading and special topics courses which do not carry a subtitle) are for stud ents capable of self -direction who meet the requirements for the S/U option, i.e., if the students are not eligible for the S/U option, they are not eligible for independent study. Each college determines the maximum number of credits that may be earne d in independent study courses. Grading of Research In grading master's and doctoral research and thesis work in progress, the instructor reports for each enrollment period the symbol PR (Progress) or U (Unsatisfactory) in place of a grade. \"Progress\" indicates that the student has devoted an adequate amount of time to the work scheduled but gives no indication of its quality. \"Unsatisfactory\" indicates that the student has stopped work or is doing work of unacceptable quality. T hese symbols remain on the student's transcript permanently. Only those credits graded PR (Progress) accumulate toward the minimum number of credits of research required. After having submitted a series of PR (Progress) or U (Unsatisfactory) symbols, the i nstructor shall report a grade at the conclusion of the final oral examination, or no later than the date the thesis is submitted for the signature of the graduate dean. If the thesis or dissertation and the performance in the final oral examination are fo und to be acceptable, the instructor shall report S (Satisfactory), which grade applies to the preceding series of registrations graded Progress and Unsatisfactory and denotes the overall quality of the entire series. If the thesis or dissertation or the p erformance in the final oral examination is found to be unacceptable, the instructor shall report U (Unsatisfactory), which grade applies only to the credits of research for the enrollment period in which the examination is administered. Students who accum ulate a total of two Unsatisfactory grades in courses numbered 598 (approved courses), 599, 600, 699, or 700 will be placed in provisional status. Three Unsatisfactory grades in these courses will result in dismissal from the Graduate School. Satisfactory and Unsatisfactory Course Option Grades of Satisfactory and Unsatisfactory (S/U) may be used for courses taken by a regular status graduate student outside the major department, provided that the studen t's advisor and the head of the department approve. Departments may designate three credits of departmental courses numbered 500 and above for S/ U option grading with the approval of the college dean and the graduate dean. The S/U grade request form must be submitted to the graduate dean at the time of registration for an academic session. The limitations of the S/U option are as follows: No more than six total credits of S/U courses are permitted on the master's degree. Doctoral candidates may take six additional credits under the S/U option after application to candidacy. Registration is limited to one course per semester, and courses with Unsatisfactory grades cannot be used in a student's program. POLICIES ON GRADUATE COURSES Numbering of Courses Courses numbered 100 through 299 are for undergraduate credit only. In no event may courses numbered below 300 be applied toward a graduate degree; 300 through 449 courses are intended primarily f or undergraduate level. In some cases, graduate credit may be obtained in courses numbered 300 through 449 with the approval of the student's advisor, the instructor of the course, the program dean, the student's department head, and the dean of the Gradua te School. To secure such credit, a written request must be filed with the dean of the Graduate School at the time of registration. However, these courses cannot be deficiencies, and not more than four credits toward a degree can be granted for courses numbered below 400. The total of courses numbered 300 through 449 cannot exceed eight credits. Courses numbered 450 through 499 are designed for seniors and graduates; 500 through 599 are primarily for graduate students working on the master's degree; 600 thr ough 700 are principally for students working on a doctoral degree. Adding and/or Dropping Courses It is the student's responsibility to initiate official withdrawal from a course. Courses may not be added after the l ast day to add as indicated in the academic calendar (printed on the inside back cover of the Graduate Catalog or on -line at http://gradschool.nmsu.edu/. The last day to drop a course is listed in the Schedule of Classes and the academic calendar. The refu nd policy and schedule is also noted in the Schedule of Classes. Auditing Courses A student officially admitted to the Graduate School may enroll in any class as an auditor with the verbal consent of the instructor, provided the fa cilities are not required for regular students. Record of enrollment is preserved but no credit is given. Courses being taken as audit will count toward total course load but cannot be used to meet the minimum course load requirements. Because graduate stu dents can enroll in any undergraduate course under the S/U option, they are discouraged from auditing classes. Repeating Courses Any graduate course numbered 450 and above may be repeated. Any computable grade (excluding I, W, AU, CR, S or U) earned for the course will be included in the cumulative grade -point average, but the credit hours may be earned only once. Substitutions and Waivers All substitutions or waivers of required courses for degree candidates must be approved before the last day of registration during the semester in which the student expects to obtain the degree. Challenging Graduate Courses A graduate student may challenge a graduate course by examination. Changes in Registration Registration changes may be processed only in accordance with university regulations and with appropriate signatures. It is the responsibility of the student to initiate official withdraw al from a course. Forms are available from the academic advisor or in the deans' offices. Courses may not be added or dropped after the deadline date indicated in the university calendar. For refund policy, see the \"Costs\" section of the catalog. When a st udent officially drops a course, the W grade is assigned as follows: 1. No grade is assigned during the registration period. 2. A W grade is assigned to any student who officially drops a course during the first half of its duration. A student may not officially withdraw from a course after this time. All drop forms must be signed and dated by the instructor of the course and the advisor. 16| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2014 -2015 GRADUATE CATALO G 3. A grade of W is assigned in all courses to any student officially withdrawing from the university prior to the last three weeks of classes. Any person attending under Veterans Educational Assistance should notify the Office of Veterans' Programs if dropping or adding courses changes enrollment status for benefits. TRANSFER OF GRADUATE CREDITS INTO A DEGRE E PROGRAM A student may transfer graduate credits taken at NMSU as well as graduate credits from another university to New Mexico State University, provided the credits were earned on the campus of an accred ited institution. Transferred course work (grades and hours) is maintained separately from NMSU course work. Immediately after initial enrollment in the Graduate School, students must submit forms to obtain formal permission from the department head, the d ean of the college, and the dean of the Graduate School to transfer graduate -level course work. The department has the responsibility to accept or reject any number of transferred credits based on such elements as whether the work fits into a logical progr am for a degree, if grades of A or B have been earned in the courses proposed for transfer, and any other elements it deems relevant. Credit granted for work done at another institution is tentative until proved by satisfactory work in residence, and the d epartment may also require work to be validated by examination. At the master's level, students must take at least 50 percent of the course work required for the degree from faculty of New Mexico State University to meet the residency requirements for thei r degree. Transfer credits must meet the same time -limit requirements (seven years) as graduate classes at accredited universities. Course work taken elsewhere after initiation of Graduate School at NMSU must have prior approval of the department head and the dean of the Graduate School if such work is to be transferred. All requirements as to accreditation, level, grades, and other elements described for initial transfer work will apply. \"Request for Transfer of Credit\" forms are available at University Admissions. TRANSFER OF CREDITS FOR CERTIFICATE PROG RAMS Students enrolled in certificate programs cannot transfer credits from another institution towards the completion of the certificate program offered by New Mexico State University. However, they can transfer credits taken in a graduate certificate program of NMSU into a graduate degree program of New Mexico State University provided that the courses will lead towards a graduate degree in the focused a rea of the certificate program. The number of transfer credits will be determined by the program of study. The time limit on course transfer is 5 years after the completion of the certificate. TRANSFER OF UNDERGRA DUATE CREDITS TO A N MSU GRADUATE PROGRAM A student who is enrolled in a specially designated, pre -approved (by the graduate dean and the applicable academic college dean(s) joint degree program that leads to the student being awar ded both undergraduate and graduate degrees may petition to have two graduate level courses (up to six credits) previously taken for undergraduate credit considered as transfer credits into the student's graduate degree program. To be considered for transf er credit, a course must have been taken by the student as a senior, and prior written permission must have been received from the director of the applicable graduate program, the course instructor, and the department head. In addition, only courses in whi ch the student received a grade of B or better will be considered for transfer credit. Credit can be transferred once the student has been accepted into the graduate degree program. Approved joint undergraduate/graduate degree programs are listed in the section called \"Graduate Degree Programs.\" \"Request for Transfer of Credit\" forms are available at University Admissions and on the web page http://prospective.nmsu.edu/graduate/current/index.html. LEAVING GRADUATE SCH OOL Leave of Absence/Continuous Enrollment Students working on advanced degrees who plan an interruption in studies for a calendar year should address a request for leave of absence through their department head, aler ting the dean of the Graduate School. The student must submit a formal letter through their department head to the Dean of the Graduate School. Email will not be accepted. The request should include the beginning date and the anticipated ending date for th e period of absence. A graduate student on leave of absence will be expected not to use university facilities and place no demands upon the university faculty and staff, and, therefore will pay no fees. Time spent in leave- of-absence status will not be cou nted toward time limits. A graduate student who fails to register for one calendar year without obtaining a leave of absence from the Graduate School will be considered withdrawn from the university. For information on resuming studies after such absence, see \"Readmission.\" (p. 7) Withdrawal from NMSU Withdrawal from any NMSU campus is an official procedure that must be approved as indicated on the withdrawal form. All such withdr awals will be registered on the student's transcript. It is the student's responsibility to initiate withdrawal from the university and to obtain necessary signatures. Students who leave without following the official procedure are graded appropriately by the instructor. The withdrawal process is initiated at the Registrar's Office. Applicable dates are published in the university calendar for all regular sessions. Medical Withdrawal A medical withdrawal applies to a student who b ecomes seriously ill, injured, or hospitalized and is therefore unable to complete an academic term for which they are enrolled. Based on the physician's information, a determination will be made if the student is eligible for consideration of tuition or o ther refunds. At the Las Cruces campus, medical withdrawal begins at the Registrar's Office. At all other campuses, medical withdrawal begins at the Student Services Office. Military Withdrawal See the section on Military/Vetera ns and Family Members for special provisions for servicemembers. DISCIPLINARY ISSUES FOR GRADUATE STUDENT S Graduate Student Appeals Board Each academic year a standing committee, consisting of three members of the graduate faculty and two graduate students, is appointed by the dean of Graduate School to handle grievance complaints including grade appeals. Any graduate who believes that he or she has been unjustly treate d within the academic process may proceed as far as necessary in the following steps to resolve his or her grievance. In general, there are three levels at which a grievance can be addressed: a course instructor or advisor, a department head, or the dean of the Graduate School. If the initial grievance is with an instructor or advisor, the process begins at Step 1. If the initial grievance is with a departmental committee, the process begins at Step 3. In all instances, the process must begin at the lowest possible level. 1. Under normal circumstances, the student should discuss the issue with the instructor/advisor. 2. If the student is unable to resolve the issue through consultation with the faculty member, the student must submit a written memorandum det ailing the grievance to the course instructor or advisor within 10 calendar days of the beginning of the following full (i.e., fall or spring) semester. The person to whom the memorandum is addressed must respond in writing within 10 calendar days to the s tudent. 3. If the student is not satisfied with the response from Steps 1- 2, he or she must submit a written appeal to the department head within ten working days of the initial decision. If the student is initiating the appeal at the departmental level, he or she must do so, in writing, within 10 calendar days of the beginning of the following full (i.e., fall or spring) semester. The department head must respond in writing within ten working days to the student, the instructor or advisor (if one is involv ed), and the dean of Graduate School. 4. If the student is not satisfied with the response from Steps 1- 3, they must submit a written grade appeal letter to the academic dean's office of the college where the course is taught. If it is a grievance against a faculty member, then the academic dean's office where the course is taught would be that of the faculty member's college. The student has 10 calendar days after receiving the decision of the department head. The associate dean of the given college has 10 days to collect the necessary documents to make a decision on the student's appeal or grievance. Please note that additional days may be required to collect information from the faculty and/or student involved in the case. The academic dean's office where the course is taught may convene an ad hoc committee to investigate the case. 5. If after the fourth step the student or any of the other parties involved is still not satisfied with the response, he or she must present to the dean of the Graduate School within ten working days a formal letter that provides specific details regarding the nature of the grievance. Copies of all documents including course materials and grades must accompany the letter. In the letter, the student can request that their case be presented to the Graduate Student Appeals Board. After receiving a letter complaint (not an email), the dean or associate dean of the Graduate School will determine GENERAL INFORMATION | 17 whether the complaint has merit. He or she will do so after reviewing the letters from the faculty member, the department head and the office of the academic dean as well as the materials from the student and all those involved in the case. If the graduate dean determines that the appeal does not have merit, he or she will inform the appellant and other parties, in writing, within ten working days of receiving the appeal. Please note that additional days may be required to collect information from the faculty and/or student involved in the case. If the graduate dean decides that the appeal does have merit, he or she will convene the Graduate Student Appeals Board, normally within three weeks. The Graduate Student Appeals Board will conduct, within 60 days of their convening, whatever investigations and deliberations are necessary, and will forward to the dean of the Graduate School a recommendation to resolve the grievance. 6. After reviewing the recommendation of the Graduate Student Appeals Board, the dean of Graduate School will, within ten working days, inform all parties involved of his or her decision in writing. 7. The dean of the Graduate School may waive the normal time frame for grievances when either party presents compelling evidence justifying such a delay, but grievances must be launched within one year. Grade appeals involving charge s of plagiarism must follow the process established on academic misconduct in the Student Code of Conduct. The web site is http://www.nmsu.edu/~vpsa/SCOC/index.html Graduate School strongly encourages students to study and use the Plagiarism web site of th e Library to learn of ways to avoid plagiarism: http://lib.nmsu.edu/plagiarism. Academic Probation and Suspension Academic Standing is based on both the student's semester GPA and cumulative GPA. Graduate Academic Probation I: A graduate student is placed on Graduate Academic Probation I when a graduate student's semester GPA is above a 3.000 and the cumulative GPA drops below 3.000; or when the semester and cumulative GPA's drop below 3.000 and the previous acad emic standing is Graduate Regular Good Standing. Graduate Academic Probation II: Is issued when a graduate student semester GPA is above a 3.000 and the cumulative GPA drops below as 3.000 and the previous academic standing is one of Graduate Academic Pro bation I or Graduate Re -admit on Probation I. The student must maintain a semester GPA of 3.000 or higher until the cumulative GPA reaches a 3.0 or higher at which time the graduate student is placed on Good Academic Standing. If the graduate student is un able to maintain a semester GPA of 3.000 or higher and the cumulative remains below 3.000 GPA while under Graduate Academic Probation II, the student will then be placed on Graduate Academic Suspension. Graduate Academic Suspension: When a graduate stude nt does not achieve a semester GPA of 3.000 or higher, and the graduate cumulative GPA remains below a 3.000 while under Graduate Academic Probation II or Graduate Re-Admit on Probation II, the graduate student is placed on Graduate Academic Suspension. Graduate students under Graduate Academic Suspension are barred from enrolling in graduate level courses at NMSU while under Graduate Academic Suspension. Graduate students on Graduate Academic Suspension must sit out a minimum of one semester. Graduate stud ents on suspension who wish to continue Graduate School after suspension must re -apply to the Graduate School and petition the Graduate Dean or College Academic Dean to be removed from Graduate Academic Suspension. At this time the graduate academic suspen sion status will be evaluated for possible removal. Should the suspension be lifted, the graduate student is placed on Graduate Academic Probation II or Graduate Re - admit on Probation II until such time that the graduate cumulative GPA equals or exceeds 3. 000. If you have questions about your academic standing, please contact the advising center or Graduate Dean's office. Disciplinary Probation and Suspension Graduate students are subject to the rules and regula tions with respect to disciplinary probation and suspension as listed in the \"Student Code of Conduct\" section of the Student Handbook http://www.nmsu.edu/~vpsa/SCOC/index.html and in the \"Regulations\" section (p. 14) of the Undergraduate Catalog http://www.nmsu.edu/Academic_Progs/Undergraduate_Catalog/. Graduate students who engage in academic misconduct at any of the other campuses of New Mexico State University, including Alamogordo, Carlsbad, Dona Ana and Grants, are also subject to the Student Code of Conduct of NMSU. Attendance and Student Behavior The instructor may report any absences to the graduate dean when the number of absences from class (including audited courses) is impairing the work of a student in a course. The graduate dean may drop a student from a class for persistent absence when such action is recommended by the instructor. Similarly, a student may also be dropped from a class for engaging in behav ior that interferes with the educational environment of the class. Students making satisfactory progress in their classes will be excused from classes when they are representing New Mexico State University on a university - sponsored event (e.g., ASNMSU pres ident representing NMSU at legislative session, student -athletes competing in NMSU -scheduled athletic events, or students attending educational field trips and conferences). Authorized absences do not relieve the students of their class responsibilities. P rior written notice of the authorized absence will be provided to the instructor by the sponsoring department. Only students who have enrolled in a class for credit or audit are allowed to attend classes. A student who has officially withdrawn from a cours e may continue to attend the course with the permission of the instructor for the remainder of the semester. Students not enrolled may visit classes only with the permission of the instructor. Academic Conduct of Graduate Students Graduate students at New Mexico State University are expected to observe and maintain the highest academic, ethical, and professional standards of conduct. Students should consult Section III of the \"Student Code of Conduct\" in the Student Handbook (http://www.nmsu.edu/~vpsa/SCOC/index.html) for more specific information regarding the rules of conduct and definitions of misconduct. In the event these standards of conduct appear to have been breached by violations such as plagiarism (consult the Library's Web page at http://lib.nmsu.edu/plagiarism), cheating, nondisclosure or misrepresentation of academic credentials, fabrication of data, or other forms of academic misconduct, the procedures set forth below shall be employed to resolve th e issues. As mentioned before, graduate students who engage in academic misconduct at any of the other campuses of New Mexico State University, including Alamogordo, Carlsbad, Dona Ana and Grants, are also subject to the Student Code of Conduct of NMSU. Procedures to Deal with Cases of Alleged Academic Misconduct in Graduate School Policies and procedures for dealing with such cases are detailed in the in the Student Cod e of Conduct http://www.nmsu.edu/~vpsa/SCOC/. Questions concerning these policies and procedures should be addressed to the dean of the Graduate School. Procedures include all course levels and all of the campuses of New Mexico State University, including Alamogordo, Carlsbad, Dona Ana, Grants and Las Cruces. PRIVACY ISSUES Privacy Rights The following information has been designated as directory information and is subject to release to the public under the Buck ley Amendment (PL 98 -380), \"The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974\": Student's name, address, e - mail address, telephone listing, date and place of birth, major field of study, classification, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, and the most recent, previous educational agency or institution attended by the student. Other information regarding disclosure of student data i s posted at the Office of the Registrar in compliance with the act. Requests for withholding directory information must be filed in writing with the Office of the Registrar. PURGING OF STUDENT F ILES All files of students who have attended NMSU Graduate School are kept for five years following final enrollment and then destroyed. Only archival documentation is retained. The files of students who do not enroll are destroyed after one year. TRANSCRIPT OF CREDIT S An official transcript is the University's certified statement of a student's complete NMSU academic record in chronological order by semester and year. It includes coursework, grades, and degrees earned. Credit hours earned through transfer work are not listed in detail, but do appear as cumulative totals. Transcripts are available as digitally -signed PDFs or printed copies. Transcripts can be ordered online at http://mytranscript.nmsu.edu. A fee is 18| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2014 -2015 GRADUATE CATALO G charged for each copy. No transcript will be released if the student is in debt to the university. The student name appearing on the transcript will be the same as it appears on the student's official NMSU records. Name changes are processed for current students only. Contact the Office of the Registrar, registra@nmsu.edu, for additional information. CHANGE OF ADDRESS In order to assure accurate student records, students are responsible for keeping University Admissions and the Office of the Registrar informed of the following: Changes in residence and mailing addresses; current telephone numbers, and primary e -mail addresses. Failure to do so may result in transcripts, diplomas, or other important communications from the university not being received in a timely manner. EVALUATING YOUR ACADE MIC EXPERIENCE As part of its continuing effort to maintain quality academic programs and to provide strong support services, New Mexico State University routinely conducts surveys. Students m ay be required to participate in one or more of these activities. The resulting data will be published only in aggregate form. RREEQQUUIIRREEMMEENNTTSS FFOORR EENNRROOLLLLEEDD SSTTUUDDEENNTTSS The following are general requirements applying to all graduate students. Requirements applicable to specific graduate degrees follow this section. FULL- TIME GRADUATE STUDEN T A full -time graduate student is one enrolled for nine or more credits per semester, other than fo r tuition purposes. Students doing graduate work while engaged in full -time, off -campus employment should limit themselves to one or two courses per semester. Graduate students should take into consideration any outside workload and commitments in planning their course load. Full -time graduate students without other commitments normally enroll for nine to 12 graded credits each regular semester; the maximum number of graded credits a graduate student may take in any regular semester is 15. During the summer session, the maximum number of graded credits a graduate student may take is 9. Graduate students may enroll for one additional credit that is not graded (i.e., Audit) for summer, fall, and spring semesters. COURSE DEFICIENCIES Students who have been admitted with departmental deficiencies may be required to take diagnostic tests and additional qualifying examinations. They must complete satisfactorily, in a manner specified by the major department, all undergraduate course defi ciencies as prescribed by the department responsible for the graduate program. Course deficiencies will be listed on the transcript; however, these deficiencies will not be calculated in the student's graduate GPA or graduate hours. With the permission of the student's advisor and the head of the department, courses to meet undergraduate deficiencies may be taken under an S/U option (with S being a grade satisfactory to the professor). These courses will not affect the maximum number of S/U graduate credits permitted. SPECIALIZATIONS/CONC ENTRATIONS A specialization is a collection of coursework in a specific area that is part of a degree program of study at NMSU. Only approved specializations/concentrations within a stu dents' department or program may be noted on a transcript. Students must file a request for inclusion of an approved specializations/concentration at the time they file their program of study and must identify the specializations/concentration in their app lication for the degree. Specializations/concentrations will not be added to a transcript after the degree is awarded. Departments must certify that a student has met the requirements for a specializations/concentration at the time the student successfully completes the final examination. DECLARATION OF MINOR Any doctoral applicant for candidacy may declare up to two approved minors in addition to the major area of study. All minors must be approved by the minor department head and the dean of the Graduate School and normally consist of nine credits. Demonstration of competency in the minor area will be required at both comprehensive and final examinations. COMPLETING A THESIS OR DISSERTATION The student must ensure that each member of the examining committee receives a copy of the thesis no later than seven working days before the date of the final examination. The form and style of the thesis or dissertation must comply with the regula tions given in the Guidelines for Preparing a Thesis or Dissertation. These guidelines also contain detailed information on the thesis -approval process and binding. See http://gradschool.nmsu.edu/Guidelines. Candidates are encouraged to consult with the gr aduate reviewer on format, deadlines, and procedures before final typing. The thesis must be submitted to the graduate reviewer on or before the deadlines posted in the current academic calendar printed inside the back cover of the current Graduate Catalog and at http://gradschool.nmsu.edu/deadlines/deadlines.htm. The thesis or dissertation is not complete until copies have been accepted for binding by the binding section staff in Branson Library. OUTCOMES ASSESSMENT - EVALUATING YOUR ACAD EMIC EXPERIENCE New Mexico State University is committed to providing its students with a quality education and a supportive learning environment. Assessment is a process of rigorous review followed by implem entation of changes to enhance and improve the quality of education students receive at NMSU. For assessment to be effective, students must be actively aware of, and engaged in, assessment activities. Faculty and staff at NMSU will communicate to students the value and implications of assessment. For their part, students will provide feedback on personal, professional and academic development. Students are expected to participate in all types of assessment when asked to do so. Types of assessment activities include class assignments, course projects, exams, exit interviews, standardized tests, surveys, focus groups, etc. Data gathered through these assessments will be published only in aggregate form. Efforts will be made to inform students of assessment res ults and the program improvements implemented as a result of assessment. REGISTRATION FOR SUM MER GRADUATION If the final examination is to be scheduled or the thesis is to be completed during the summer, the stude nt must register for one credit hour during the summer session in which the oral examination will be held or the thesis will be completed. In order to graduate during a summer session the student must also have filed the \"Application for Degree (Diploma)\" by the deadline posted in the current Schedule of Classes, or the academic calendar printed on the inside back cover of the current Graduate Catalog, and at http://gradschool.nmsu.edu/deadlines/deadlines.htm. APPLICATION FOR DEGR EE (DIPLOMA) The student must file an \"Application for Degree (Diploma)\" by the deadline set forth in the Schedule of Classes. The student must submit the \"Application for Degree (Diploma)\" to the Office of the Registrar prior to the last day for registration for the final semester or summer session in which the student will be completing degree requirements. Students filing an \"Application for Degree (Diploma)\" after the deadline will be charged an additional $25 fee. No \"Application for Degr ee (Diploma)\" forms are processed after midterm. The Graduate School will not approve Applications for Degrees after the late fee deadline has been reached. If a student does not complete requirements for the semester for which the \"Application for Degree (Diploma)\" has been made, then the student must reapply for the degree and pay all applicable fees for the semester in which the degree requirements will be completed. ATTENDANCE AT COMMEN CEMENT To participate in commence ment, all eligible candidates must have applied for their degree by the deadline established by the Registrar's Office (http://nmsu.edu/~registra/degdate.html) and met all final degree requirements set by their department, the Graduate School and University Admissions. In addition, doctoral degree students who wish to participate in commencement must have applied for their degree by the deadline established by the Registrar's Office, submitted their dissertation title by the deadline set by the Graduate Sch ool and met all final degree requirements. The title of the dissertation will be published in the Commencement book provided that all requirements and deadlines were met by the student. Degree recipients from the previous summer session who wish to partici pate in commencement must attend the fall ceremony. Students who complete all degree requirements in the spring semester attend the spring ceremony. GENERAL INFORMATION | 19 Participation in commencement does not, in itself, mean that a student is considered an NMSU graduate. In o rder to receive a graduate degree, a student must fulfill all university requirements. The degree will reflect the graduation date when all requirements were met. TTHHEE MMAASSTTEERR''SS DDEEGGRREEEE New Mexico State University offers both acade mic and professional master's degrees. If the student's undergraduate program fails to provide a proper foundation for advanced work in the chosen field or department, the student may be required to take classes to correct those deficiencies, consequently resulting in a longer period of residence than would otherwise be required. AMOUNT AND DISTRIBUTION OF WORK A minimum of 30 semester credits is required for the master's degree. Most master's degrees require at least 15 credits in courses numbered 500 or above, including thesis credit for master's programs involving a thesis. Master's programs involving a thesis include no more than six and no fewer than four credits of thesis. (See the section on \"Thesis\" (p. 19) for further guidelines.) At least 15 credits for the master's degree must be for work in courses in the department in which the student was admitted. Additional credits may be selected from other fields to fit into a logical, justifiable program. Courses used to remove deficiencies or satisfy prerequisites cannot be counted as part of the requirements for the master's degree. Students must take coursework from a variety of faculty. Students may not take more tha n half of the minimum credits required for a master's degree (excluding thesis credits) with the same professor. Short courses of less than one summer session or one semester duration cannot constitute more than one -fourth of the total course requirements for a master's degree. PROGRAM OF STUDY It is recommended that, during the first semester of enrollment, each graduate student beginning studies toward a degree prepare a complete tentative program of study in consultation with the student's advisor. This tentative program should be kept in the student's file within the department and is not to be considered as the \"Application for Admission to Candidacy,\" which contains the permanent program. APPLICATION TO CANDI DACY The admission of a student to the Graduate School does not imply admission to candidacy for an advanced degree. The major department in which the student intends to become a candidate for a master's degree must be satisfied as to the stu dent's sound basic training and the ability to pursue studies at the graduate level. Departments may require a comprehensive qualifying examination before officially approving any candidate for the master's degree. An \"Application for Admission to Candidac y,\" which formally lists curriculum requirements for the student's program of studies, must be filed with University Admissions no later than after the completion of 12 credits of graduate work. At the time the \"Application for Admission to Candidacy\" is s ubmitted, the student must have a cumulative graduate grade -point average of 3.0. The application may specify the Graduate Catalog in effect at the time of matriculation, provided that the catalog is not more than seven years old. Otherwise, the current Graduate Catalog will be used. The student's program listed in the \"Application for Admission to Candidacy\" must (1) meet the requirements of the chosen catalog, including the regulations of the Graduate School and of the major department, (2) include underg raduate deficiencies and required courses specified on the student's \"Certificate of Admission,\" (3) be certified by the student, the student's advisor, heads of departments offering major and minor fields, and the cognizant deans, and (4) list each course number and abbreviated title with the hours and grades. If the program is not satisfactory in the judgment of the graduate dean, it may be returned to the department for revision. When the \"Application for Admission to Candidacy\" has been approved by the graduate dean, the student will be formally admitted to candidacy for the master's degree. THESIS OR NON -THESIS OPTION A thesis in the major field is recommended and may be required, at the discretion of the department c oncerned. Not more than six nor fewer than four thesis credits may be counted toward the requirements for a master's degree. Many departments have a non -thesis option. Please check with the department on the non- thesis option. CONTINUOUS ENROLLMEN T Having once registered for thesis, a student must continue to register for a minimum of one credit in thesis or graduate course work each regular semester until the thesis is approved by the Graduate School and the copies have been accepted by the binding section in Branson Library. A student who fails to abide by this regulation will be considered withdrawn from the university and, in order to resume studies, must formally apply for readmission and satisfy the requirements in effect at the time of reapplication. GRADUATE COMMITTEE The master's degree committee will consist of a minimum of three faculty members holding at least master's degrees. The committee chair and one other member must be in the student' s department; however, the home department of one of these two committee members may be outside the student's department (see Graduate Faculty Guidelines section \"Appointments Outside of Home Department\"). The third person on the committee must serve as th e dean's representative and cannot be a faculty member of the students' home department. The committee chair and the dean's representative must be members of the graduate faculty (please refer to \"Guidelines for Graduate Faculty Appointments\"). If the stud ent has an approved minor area of study then either the dean's representative or a fourth committee member must come from the minor department. If no minor is declared, the dean's representative may come from a related area (recommended by the committee ch air) or be appointed independently by the dean of the Graduate School. All students completing a written exam are required to have a dean's representative that reviews the process of administering the exam. The dean's representative can sign off on all of the exams of students taking a written exam for the given semester. The dean's representative must be from outside the students' home department. The faculty committee of the student is responsible for identifying a dean's representative and completing the examination forms. A list of graduate faculty is available at the web site of the Graduate School. Faculty can use the list to identify graduate faculty to serve as the dean's representative. Departments can nominate individuals with a master's degree and /or doctoral degree and related experience for a temporary appointment to graduate faculty (please see Appointment to Graduate Faculty of Non -NMSU Employees in the Guidelines on Graduate Faculty Appointments in this Graduate Catalog). Nomination letters mu st identify specific roles of the individual and the year(s) of service (up to three years per request per individual). The nomination letter must receive the endorsement of the academic dean. If granted a temporary appointment to graduate faculty, the ind ividual will be limited to the specific role(s) identified by the department. Departments can request that the individual be allowed to serve as a dean's representative. As indicated in the \"Guidelines for Graduate Faculty Appointments,\" any qualified memb er of the graduate faculty may join any graduate program within a department. Applicants will be approved by the graduate program to which they are applying, through a process to be determined by that program, before their application is forwarded to the d ean of the Graduate School. Departments may structure committees that include more than the minimum number of members as long as the stated conditions of membership are satisfied. Additional voting and nonvoting members may be any person approved or appoin ted by the dean of the Graduate School. FINAL EXAMINATION Each candidate will be given a final examination conducted by the graduate committee in accordance to the schedule provided by University Admissions. It is the student's re sponsibility to be sure that the form to schedule this examination is submitted to the Graduate School at least ten working days prior to the proposed date for the examination. At the time of the final examination, a graduate student must have an NMSU cumulative graduate grade -point average of at least 3.0 and must be enrolled in the final semester; or, if the student is writing a thesis, he or she must have completed all course work for the master's degree. Students with the no thesis option may be require d to pay a special exam fee in lieu of registering for one credit hour of graduate course work. (See \"Tuition, Fees, and Other Expenses.\" (p. 8 )) The final examination format shall be determined by the depar tment, with the approval of the graduate dean. If a department does not specify an examination format, the final examination shall consist of an oral defense of the student's thesis (if one was written) as well as a general examination of the candidate's f ield of study. Any candidate who fails in the final examination may (1) upon recommendation of the advisor and approval of the graduate dean, be granted a second examination after a lapse of at least one semester, or (2) be excluded from further candidacy for the degree. Failure in the second examination disqualifies a candidate from obtaining the degree. Certification that the thesis has been 20| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2014 -2015 GRADUATE CATALO G accepted and that the final examination has been passed must be filed with University Admissions not later than one week before the degree is conferred. TIME LIMIT The graduate program leading to the master's degree must be completed within seven years (or eight successive summers) including completion of the master's thesis or final project. Any cou rse work more than seven years old at time of the final examination will not be included in the program. MINORS A candidate for a master's degree may select up to two approved minors in addition to the major. A minimum of nine credits of gra duate work is necessary for a minor at the master's level. (See \"Graduate Degree Programs, Specializations/ Concentrations, and Approved Minors\" for a list of approved minors.) To record a minor on a student's permanent record, the minor must be listed on the \"Application for Admission to Candidacy,\" and this form must be signed by the head of the department offering the minor program. At the oral examination, a committee member may move to remove the designation of a minor with the concurrence of the commi ttee. A minor will not be awarded after the degree has been posted to the transcript. INTERDISCIPLINARY MASTER'S DEGREE Interdisciplinary studies at New Mexico State University are intended for individuals speciali zing in programs that require the integration of more than one discipline to fully engage in the field of study. Interdisciplinary studies provide a mechanism to address emerging scholarship, innovation, and research and allows graduate students to engage in emerging technologies, optimizing their education outside the traditional disciplinary boundaries. Interdisciplinary study takes advantage of traditional academic training within specific departments yet allows students to customize their own career pre paration. In these programs, a coherent common core is expected and is intended to combine existing courses across disciplines to meet unique objectives. The Master of Science or Master of Arts degrees are awarded for interdisciplinary programs and are car ried out under the direction of the student's graduate committee. The interdisciplinary studies option should not be used in cases where the applicants' objectives can be realized by admission to a specific department and inclusion of up to two minor areas in the program of study. Admission Students follow the regular admission procedures set forth by the Graduate School. In completing the application, the applicant indicates IMAS in the section requesting Department or Program and designa tes the area of interdisciplinary study in the section requesting \"Field or area of advanced study.\" A proposal for interdisciplinary studies (see 1 below) must be submitted with the application. A departmental referral form will be generated and sent to the primary department specified in the proposal (see 3 below). Once the student's graduate committee is designated, the committee can require additional materials such as a statement of interest, letters of recommendation, GRE or GMAT scores, and a persona l interview. Thesis/Non- thesis option As with any graduate student, the student in interdisciplinary studies can select to follow a thesis or non- thesis option. Students enrolled in the thesis option register for six thesis credits. Students not wishing to follow the thesis option will be required to complete a project report. The project must reflect the interdisciplinary nature of the program in which the student is engaged. Comprehensive exam Students in interdisciplinary studies take a comprehensive exam composed of questions designed by the student's committee. Two individuals in the areas of study plus the dean's representative outside of the department/program/interdisciplinary study option w ill be involved. A chair is also identified. Degree awarded Students receive a Master of Arts (MA) or Master of Science (MS) and a concentration in the interdisciplinary study area. Other conditions that apply 1. The student must pre sent a written description of the program concept consisting of (a) objective of the program of study including proposed areas of skill development, proposed courses in more than one graduate degree granting department of NMSU, and (b) a justification for not using an existing departmental degree program. In addition the student needs to designate the degree being sought (Master of Science or Master of Arts) and a name for the interdisciplinary area. 2. The student's program of study must include a minimum of 30 graduate level credits and a maximum of 36 credits. The student may take six credits in departments that do not grant a graduate degree but the courses must be numbered 450 and above, and be pertinent to the program of study. 3. The majority of the d epartments involved in the student's program will be master's degree and doctoral degree granting departments. The student is expected to take at least 15 credits in the primary area of study within one department. The department selected by the student wi ll receive a copy of the student's application for admissions from University Admissions. In addition, the student is required to select an approved minor area of study in another department that consists of at least 9 credit hours (see the Approved Gradua te Minors and Programs section for the approved list of minors). 4. The student will form a committee composed of members of the graduate faculty and select an advisor who will chair the committee. The chair must be from the primary department where the st udent has taken at least 15 credit hours listed in the proposal submitted and the other committee member must be from another department in which the student has selected a minor area of study from the approved list of minors listed in the Graduate Catalog . The third faculty member must be the dean's representative. 5. The student will be required to submit the Candidacy Form to University Admissions after 12 credits are satisfactorily completed. 6. The program will meet all requirements of a master's degre e, as listed in the Graduate Catalog; with the interpretation that \"major field\" includes courses from two or more departments and in the designated interdisciplinary study area. 7. The program of study will include completion of a research thesis or project. The work may be submitted in the form of a publishable manuscript, technical report, thesis or creative option. 8. The student may enroll on a part -time basis keeping in mind that coursework cannot be more than seven years old at the time of the final examination. 9. The student will be administered a final comprehensive exam that is consistent with the department selected for the primary area of study. For example, if a department requires a written exam, the student in the interdisciplinary masters wi ll also be required to take a written exam. 10. The final oral comprehensive exam will consist of questions pertinent to the area of study and the defense of the research thesis or project. In both cases an integrated approach to the areas of study chosen should be followed. 11. All other rules for graduate study at NMSU must be followed. SECOND MASTER'S DEGR EE A student who has earned one master's degree at NMSU may be allowed to count a maximum of six semester credits earne d on the first degree toward a second master's degree, if those credits fit into a logical graduate program. The number of shared credits may be increased for dual and joint degree programs. DUAL AND JOINT DEGRE E PROGRAMS A dual degree program is a program of study whereby courses of study are combined so that students can complete two degree programs of study in less time than it would take if the programs were independently pursued. Upon graduation, they receive two separate diplomas from each degree program of participating departments and/or institutions. To enroll in a dual, students must complete two separate applications, receive two independent offers of admissions, and meet program and course requirements of b oth programs of study. A joint degree program is one where two or more departments interweave their courses and course requirements to create a single degree program. Students are admitted into one program, take courses in each participating department, college or university, but only received one degree and diploma. These degree programs allow departments and/or campuses to take advantage of faculty talents. Both dual and joint degree programs must have prior approval by the Graduate School. Students must apply and be accepted into graduate programs of each department participating in a specific dual or joint degree program. The list of approved dual and joint degrees can be found in the section \"Graduate Degree Programs.\" GENERAL INFORMATION | 21 TEACHER LICENSURE Students wishing to take graduate courses for licensure or renewal of licensure or for personal enrichment must be fully admitted to a department to do so. Undeclared students may not register for teacher licensure classes. Endorsement is availa ble at both the elementary and secondary levels in bilingual education, TESOL (Teaching of English as a Second Language), reading, and special education. Endorsement is also available in early childhood education at the elementary level. Contact curric- instr@nmsu.edu for more information. SPECIALIST IN EDUCAT ION DEGREE The degree of specialist in education is provided for experienced members of the education profession who have completed the master's degree (except the school psychology program, which requires the bachelor's degree) and have maintained a 3.3 grade -point average during pursuit of this degree or its equivalent. Primary emphasis is placed on the development of competencies needed for a professional special ization in a given field. Programs are available in curriculum and instruction and school psychology. Students must complete the general application for the Graduate School. They should also check with the admitting department for specific departmental requirements. Residency and Credit Requirements The specialist in education degree requires a minimum of 30 semester credits beyond the master's degree, including research, intern experiences, and graduate courses. Th e student meets the campus residency requirement by completing a minimum of 24 credits from faculty of New Mexico State University. The student must maintain a 3.0 average. No more than six semester credits of C level work are allowed in this program. Prog ram of Study It is recommended that, during the first semester of enrollment, each graduate student beginning studies toward a degree prepare a complete tentative program of study in consultation with the student's advisor. This te ntative program should be kept in the student's file within the department and is not to be considered as the \"Application for Admission to Candidacy,\" which contains the permanent program. Transfer of Credits A maximum of six g raduate credits earned at another approved institution may apply to this degree. Transfer credits must have been earned during the five - year period prior to completion of the specialist in education degree. Major Field All course work t aken for the degree should apply directly, through a logical program of study, to the specialty which the candidate has selected. Two to six credits will be earned through research that is acceptable to the College of Education and the cooperating educatio nal agency. Each department is responsible for defining the required sequence of courses. Candidacy Following the successful completion of 12 semester credits beyond the master's degree, the student is eligible for admission to candidacy. With the achievement of candidacy, a committee is appointed to work with the candidate on the remainder of the program. The committee consists of three members of the graduate faculty in the College of Education. Internship Each candida te will earn from three to six semester credits in an internship. This experience will consist of supervised performance of duties related to the candidate's specialty. The structure of the internship will be determined by the student's department. A resea rch project will be conducted in conjunction with the internship. Oral Examination The oral examination committee will consist of the student's committee plus a dean's representative appointed from the graduate faculty by the dean of the Graduate School. This committee will conduct an oral examination at the conclusion of the research project and no earlier than the candidate's last semester of enrollment. The examination will consist of a defense of the project along with general questions on subject matter related to the candidate's field of study. Any candidate who fails the oral examination may, upon recommendation of the advisor and approval of the graduate dean, be granted a second examination after a lapse of at least one seme ster. Failure in the second examination disqualifies the candidate from obtaining the degree. Time Limit The specialist in education degree must be completed within seven years following admission to the program. Students cannot include any course work on their program of study that is more than seven years old at the time of the final oral examination. TTHHEE DDOOCCTTOORRAALL DDEEGGRREEEESS PREPARATION FOR DOCT ORAL DEGREE PROGRAMS Prospective candidates are expected to hold bachelor's or master's degrees from accredited institutions, based on curricula that include the prerequisites for graduate study in the department of their subject. To be considered for admission to a doctora l program, the applicant must have a grade - point average of at least 3.0. Prospective candidates are urged to consult the department in which they wish to study for information concerning specific requirements. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY (PH.D.) The degree of doctor of philosophy requires distinguished attainment in both scholarship and original research. The degree is granted chiefly in recognition of the candidate's high attainments and ability in the special field, as shown by work on the required examinations covering both the general and the special fields, and by the preparation of a dissertation. A candidate for the Ph.D. degree is expected to maintain a higher level of work than the grade -point average of 3.0 that has b een established for the candidate for the master's degree. DOCTOR OF EDUCATION (ED.D.) The degree of doctor of education attests proficiency in a program of graduate study in which the emphasis is upon preparation for co mpetent performance in professional education. This program is intended primarily for students pursuing careers in which teaching, administration, or school services predominate, rather than those in which research predominates. The Ed.D. degree in curricu lum and instruction is offered in the Department of Curriculum and Instruction; the degree in educational administration is offered in the Department of Educational Management and Development. The requirements for doctoral degrees in the two departments of the College of Education have the following distinguishing elements: 1. The qualifying examination consists of a written and an oral section, both of which are administered prior to admission to the program. Successful completion of the qualifying examina tion is tantamount to acceptance of the student for doctoral admission. Residency of at least two consecutive semesters cannot commence until the semester after the qualifying examination is successfully completed. 2. Comprehensive examinations are usually administered three times annually. The written examination tests the major and related areas of concentration. Within two weeks after successful completion of the major and related area examinations, the student takes a comprehensive oral examination. Can didacy follows the successful completion of the orals. A student who fails any part of the comprehensive examination may present him - or herself for re- examination of the failed part of the exam before moving on to the next part. 3. The major area of study must be within the College of Education. A minimum of nine planned and integrated credits constitutes the related area and can be taken in any department of the university with the approval of the student's committee. The related area must be specifically planned with the major and minor departments in order for the doctoral fields to be mutually supportive. Any transfer credit or predoctoral course work to be included in the related field must have the approval of both the major and minor department at th e outset. Specified course work in both research and statistics is required for this degree. Other requirements are described in the departmental sections of this catalog. DOCTOR OF ECONOMIC D EVELOPMENT Students enrol led in the Doctor of Economic Development are required to complete and pass their comprehensive examination. Since a dissertation is not required, they are expected to complete an internship experience and a Project paper as defined by their program. They can embark on the Project paper once they have completed and passed their comprehensive examination. They are not required to take 700 level dissertation hours. However, they are expected to 22| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2014 -2015 GRADUATE CATALO G complete at least 12 credits at the 600 level including ECDV 694 Internship and ECDV 699 Doctoral Project. A Project paper must be finalized using a similar submission process as the dissertation (see section Finalizing the Doctoral Dissertation of the Graduate Catalog). On the front page, after the title of the paper, the student should indicate that it is a Project paper. Students completing Projects papers do not need to complete the Earned Doctoral Survey. The paper must be submitted to the Graduate School for format review on or before the deadline. The form and sty le of the paper must comply with regulations given in the Guidelines for Preparing a Thesis or Dissertation. These guidelines also contain detailed information on the dissertation/project paper -approval process as well as information on binding. Candidates are encouraged to consult with the Graduate School on format, deadlines, and procedures before final typing. The project paper is not complete until copies have been accepted for binding by the staff of Branson Library and until the microfilm agreement fo rm has been completed and received in Branson Library. DOCTOR OF NURSING PR ACTICE Students that hold a baccalaureate degree in Nursing are required to complete and pass all required course work for the Doctor of Nursing P ractice degree program.

The project paper is not complete until copies have be en accepted for binding by the staff of Branson Library and until the microfilm agreement form has been completed and received in Branson Library. INTERDISCIPLINARY DO CTORATE Students wishing to study in the interdiscipl inary doctoral degree program must apply and be accepted into a doctorate -granting department. The following requirements for admission to the interdisciplinary doctorate degree program have been established: 1. A master's degree or equivalent program of s tudy that includes at least 30 credit hours of graduate course work with a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0. 2. Twelve credit hours of graduate course work must be completed at New Mexico State University in order to apply for admission into the interdisciplinary doctorate degree program. Additional course work is required for degree completion. 3. Evidence of outstanding academic achievement in graduate school. 4. A written description of the program concept prepared by the student consisting of (a) areas in which competency is required; (b) proposed readings and course work and how these relate to required competencies; (c) objectives and an outline for thesis research; (d) justification for not using an existing departmental degree program. 5. The student must select an advisor from his or her department to chair the committee and, in consultation with the advisor, structure a committee consisting of at least five faculty members from the graduate faculty list who are willing to work on the in terdisciplinary degree program The committee must include at least two members from each of two doctorate -granting departments. The committee chair will convene a meeting to review and approve the proposed program. 6. University Admissions will send an \"Ad mission Referral\" document, signed by all committee members, to the heads of all departments from which the student proposes to use more than eight credits of course work, or from which faculty are requested to serve on the proposed committee. 7. Once the \"Admission Referral\" document has been approved by all departments, the committee chair will convene a meeting of the committee to review the student's program and make changes as necessary. In addition, the committee will set the format and date for the qualifying exam. An effort should be made to incorporate the interdisciplinary nature of the program into the qualifying exam. 8. When the student has passed the qualifying exam and the \"Admission Referral\" memorandum has been approved by the respective dep artment heads, the requirements for admission to the program are satisfied. Formal acceptance into a doctoral program may be required in order to receive financial assistance. 9. The number or courses required for degree completion will vary depending on t he student's program of study. Interdisciplinary doctorate degree students must meet the requirements for residency, registration, the comprehensive examination, the Final Examination, the dissertation, and the declaration of approved minor. Please see the \"Doctoral Degrees\" section of this catalog to review the full requirements for doctoral degrees. 10. The dissertation work shall include at least 18 credits of a 700 -level course. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DOCTORAL DEGREES Qualifying Examination Doctoral students must pass a qualifying examination. This examination is scheduled by the student's advisor and is administered by the major department. Its purpose is to determine the areas i n which the student shows strength or weakness, as well as the ability to assimilate subject matter presented at the graduate level. Scheduling the qualifying examination is based on the following criteria: (a) for students who enter the Graduate School wi th little or no previous graduate experience but wish to proceed directly to the doctorate, the qualifying examination should be taken after 12 credits of graduate work; (b) for students who enter with a master's degree or equivalent from another universit y, or another department, the qualifying examination should be taken before the completion of one semester of graduate work. The department may allow the master's final examination to serve as the doctoral qualifying examination or may require a separate e xamination for students who earn their master's degree at New Mexico State University, and will continue in the same department. Based on the result of the qualifying examination, the department will take one or more of the following actions: (a) admit the student to further work toward the doctorate; (b) recommend that the program be limited to the master's degree; (c) recommend a re -evaluation of the student's progress after the lapse of one semester; or (d) recommend a discontinuation of graduate work. I n all cases, University Admissions shall be notified of the results of the qualifying examination. Upon passing the qualifying examination, the student will be admitted to the doctoral program. The student's advisor and department head will then appoint the doctoral committee to prepare the student's preliminary program of study for the doctorate. This program shall be filed with University Admissions. Graduate Committee \u2014Doctoral The doctoral committee will be composed of at least four members of the graduate faculty holding doctoral degrees. The following rules apply to the composition of the committee: ]\u0001In addition to the committee chair, at least one other member must be from a discipline within the student's major are a, which may encompass more than one degree -granting department. ]\u0001One member of the committee may be from a related area of study other than the student's declared minor. ]\u0001If an approved minor is declared, at least one but not more than two members of the committee must be from the minor area. ]\u0001At least three committee members must be members of the graduate faculty in doctorate- granting departments. Of these three members: ]\u0001The committee chair must be a member of the graduate faculty in the student 's department (See the section \"Appointments Outside of Home Department\" in the \"Guidelines on Graduate Faculty Appointments\"). ]\u0001The home department of no more than one of the other two committee members from doctorate -granting departments may be outside the student's department. As indicated in the \"Guidelines for Graduate Faculty Appointments,\" any qualified member of the graduate faculty may join any graduate program within a department. Applicants will be approved by the graduate program to which the y GENERAL INFORMATION | 23 are applying, through a process to be determined by that program, before their application is forwarded to the dean of the Graduate School. One member of the committee must serve as the dean's representative. The dean's representative can be either the m ember from the related area or minor area or an independent member appointed by the dean of the Graduate School but must not be from the student's department. In programs where more than one department is a participant, the dean's representative may not be from any of those departments. Departments may structure committees that include more than the minimum number of members as long as the stated conditions of membership are satisfied. Additional voting and nonvoting members may be any person approved or appointed by the dean of the Graduate School. All members of the committee will attend the comprehensive oral and the final defense for the dissertation. No change in membership of the doctoral committee may be made without prior approval from the dean of th e Graduate School. Program of Study A student who has completed 12 credits of graduate work beyond the master's degree, or its equivalent, in residence at New Mexico State University, and has successfully completed the qualifying e xamination, should file the \"Program of Study and Committee for Doctoral Students\" form (also called \"Program of Study\") for the doctorate before registering for additional courses. This form may be obtained from University Admissions, department offices, or from the website of University Admissions: http://prospective.nmsu.edu/graduate/forms/index.html. The \"Program of Study\" should be completed in consultation with the advisor and other members of the doctoral committee. This form should include the cours e number and abbreviated title with the credit hours. For courses already completed, grades must be shown for both major and minor areas. The program recommended by the student's committee is subject to approval by the head of the major department, the hea d of the minor department (if applicable), the college dean, and the dean of the Graduate School. The program of study should be designed to meet the campus residency requirement described in \"Residency\" (p. 24) and should include a minimum of 30 graduate credits (from NMSU or other approved graduate programs) plus 18 credits of dissertation work (700 -level course). Comprehensive Examination Before admission to candidacy for a doctoral degree, the student must pass a comprehensive examination intended to test knowledge of the major and any approved minor fields of study. The student will be admitted to the examination after satisfaction of the language requirements (where appl icable), after completion of adequate course work to the satisfaction of the major department and the Graduate School, and when considered by the committee to be adequately prepared. University Admissions should receive the \"Program of Study and Committee for Doctoral Students\" and standardized test scores (if required by the department) after the student passes the qualifying examination and before the comprehensive examination . The oral examination form must be on file at University Admissions at least te n working days prior to the proposed date for the examination. The examination must be part written and part oral. The results of the oral examination will be reported to University Admissions. Any applicant for candidacy who fails the comprehensive exami nation may, upon recommendation of the committee and approval of the graduate dean, (1) be granted a second examination after a lapse of at least one semester or (2) be terminated from the doctoral program. The student must be duly registered for three credits of graduate course work in the Graduate School during the semester in which the comprehensive examination is taken. A student taking an oral examination during the summer must enroll for at least one credit for that term. In general, there should be a time lapse of at least one year between the comprehensive and final oral examination. However, due to the type of research required in some departments and the method of administering the written comprehensive in other departments, such a time lapse is no t always practical. In all cases there must be one semester between the comprehensive and the final oral examinations. Time Limit If more than five years have elapsed since the date of the comprehensive examination, the candidate will be required to take another comprehensive examination before admission to the final examination. Advancement to Candidacy A student will be formally advanced to candidacy upon the successful completion of the comprehensive ex amination, the recommendation of the committee, and the approval of the graduate dean. A minimum of nine credits must be taken after successful completion of the comprehensive exam. A student may not register for dissertation credits (700) prior to successful completion of the qualifying exam. The dissertation preparation shall total at least 18 credits of courses numbered 700. The doctoral committee can impose additional requirements for courses numbered 700. A student is admitted to the doctoral program a fter successful completion of the qualifying examination. After successful completion of the comprehensive examination, a student must continue to register for at least three credits of dissertation or graduate course work each regular semester until the d issertation is approved by the Graduate School and the copies have been accepted by the binding section in Branson Library. A student who fails to abide by this regulation will be considered withdrawn from the university, and, in order to resume studies, must formally apply for readmission and satisfy the requirements in effect at time of reapplication. Final Examination Every student working toward the doctoral degree will submit a dissertation embodying the results of original re search. The dissertation is expected to demonstrate the student's ability in independent investigation and to be a contribution to human knowledge. The dissertation shall display a mastery of the literature of the subject field and present an organized, co herent development of ideas with a clear exposition of results, and provide a critical discussion of the limits and validity of the student's conclusions. When a complete draft of the dissertation has been prepared, the student's doctoral committee (appoin ted after the qualifying examination) will conduct the final examination. The final examination is concerned primarily with the research work of the student as embodied in the dissertation, but it may be much broader and extend over the candidate's entire field of study. The intention of the final examination is to verify that the candidate has a satisfactory grasp of the major subject as a whole and has a general acquaintance with the fields of knowledge represented by the course of study. The final examin ation is entirely oral and is open to the public. The final examination must be completed in accordance with the schedule provided in the academic calendar. The form requesting this examination is to be submitted by the department to University Admissions ten working days before the examination is taken. This form may be found on the Web at http://gradschool.nmsu.edu/forms -index.html and is also available from the Graduate School and departmental offices. The student must ensure that each member of the exam ining committee receives a copy of the dissertation no later than seven working days before the date of the final examination. Any candidate who fails the final oral examination may (a) upon recommendation of the committee and approval of the graduate dean be granted a second examination after a lapse of at least one semester; or (b) be terminated from the doctoral program. Failure in the second examination disqualifies the candidate from obtaining the degree. Registration during Regular Semesters and Summe r Session After successful completion of the comprehensive examination, a student must continue to register for at least three credits of dissertation or graduate course work each spring and fall semester until the dissertation is approved by the Graduate School and the copies have been accepted by the binding section in Branson Library. A student who fails to abide by this regulation will be considered withdrawn from the university and, in or der to resume studies, must formally apply for readmission and satisfy the requirements in effect at time of reapplication. During spring and fall semesters the doctoral candidate must register for three units of dissertation or other graduate course work. The candidate must have also applied for the degree by filing the \"Application for Degree (Diploma)\" by the deadline specified in the academic calendar. If the final examination is to be held during the summer or the dissertation is to be completed during the summer, the student must register for one credit hour during the summer session in which the final examination will be held or the dissertation will be completed. In order to graduate in the summer the student must have filed the \"Application for Degr ee (Diploma)\" by the posted deadline for the semester in which degree requirements will be completed. Finalizing the Doctoral Dissertation After successful completion of the final examination a copy of the disse rtation must be submitted to the Graduate School for format review on or before the deadline. The deadlines are posted to the Graduate School website at http://gradschool.nmsu.edu/deadlines/deadlines.htm. The form and style of the dissertation must comply with the regulations given in the Guidelines for Preparing a Thesis or Dissertation http://gradschool.nmsu.edu/Guidelines. These guidelines also contain detailed information on the dissertation -approval process and binding. Candidates are encouraged to consult with the Graduate School on format, deadlines, and procedures before final typing. The dissertation is not complete until copies have been accepted for binding by the binding section staff and until the microfilm agreement form has been completed and received in Branson Library. 24| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2014 -2015 GRADUATE CATALO G Residency The requirements for the doctoral degree ordinarily cannot be met in less than three years following the bachelor's degree. The minimum campus residency requirement for the doctoral degree shall include enrollment in at least two semesters of classes taught by New Mexico State University faculty. DECLARATION OF APPRO VED MINOR Any doctoral applicant for candidacy may declare up to two approved minors in addition to the major area of study. The list of approved minors can be found in the Graduate Catalog in the section called Graduate Degree Programs, Specializations/Concentrations, and Approved Minors. Demonstration of competency in the minor area will be required a t both comprehensive and final examinations. FOREIGN LANGUAGE REQ UIREMENTS The Graduate School has no foreign language requirement. However, some departments require foreign languages for research. These requirements must be met before comprehensive orals are scheduled. For specific requirements for each doctoral degree, refer to the departmental sections of this catalog. RREESSEEAARRCCHH FFAACCIILLIITTIIEESS The university recognizes and supports the concept of off- campus study and research as a valuable experience for graduate students. These experiences may take the form of internships, intensive study of specialized techniques with personnel at other institutions, and conducting research at specialized rese arch facilities. Arrangements for such off -campus activities should be made with the student's committee and the graduate dean and should represent opportunities not normally available at this university. When the bulk of a student's research is to be conducted off -campus, both on - and off -campus advisors should be appointed and periodic meetings with the student's committee held to ensure timely progress. Such opportunities offer students considerable flexibility in their training and promote valuable cont acts between the student, the university, industry, and research institutions. Students are encouraged to pursue these opportunities with their advisors and the graduate dean. Agricultural Experiment Station The Agri cultural Experiment Station is the research division of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences. Faculty, professional personnel, and graduate students conduct basic and applied research concerned with biological, physical, and eco nomic phases of food and fiber production, processing, and distribution; consumer health and nutrition; and the social and economic aspects of rural living. Energy, environmental, and natural resource conservation aspects of these broad disciplines offer m any opportunities for the graduate student to undertake meaningful research investigations in both the laboratory and the field. There are eight departments on the main campus with excellent laboratory facilities for research. In addition, the station main tains 13 field research centers including eight agricultural science centers, a forestry research center, a livestock research center, an animal insect lab, and two research ranches. The station provides financial support to graduate research assistants an d cooperates with research institutes at the university and with various state and federal agencies in providing opportunities for graduate research programs covering a wide scope of student interests.

DEGREE: Master of Science MAJOR: Agricultural Biology MINOR: Agricultural Biology The complexity of managing insects, plant diseases, and weeds is increasing environmental concerns, costs, and regulations necessitate an integrated approach to management strategies. Future professionals in integrated pest management will be ecologically oriented, trained to manipulate biol ogical and cultural technologies while minimizing chemical control options. The Master of Science degree program in agricultural biology is designed to produce graduates with the academic and research background needed to facilitate effective, innovative, and environmentally sound protection of plants and animals from a wide and varied spectrum of pests. Students will be prepared for careers in research, extension, teaching, private consulting, industry, and government or to continue in a broad range of Ph. D. programs. Specific opportunities will include positions as agricultural consultants, technical and sales representatives for industry, state departments of agriculture and USDA specialists, agricultural extension agents, and industry research and enviro nmental technicians. There is currently a strong need for M.S. graduates trained in these areas, and the demand is expected to increase dramatically. Students may wish to concentrate their graduate program in entomology, plant pathology, or weed science, o r conversely may wish to be broadly trained in all three pest -management disciplines. Most students will be expected to complete a thesis. A non -thesis option is available, depending on prior training and experience and subject to approval by the departmen t head. A nonthesis research option requires completion of a research paper, suitable as judged by the student's graduate committee, for journal publication. Completion of an undergraduate degree essentially equivalent to that offered by the department is required for admission to the M.S. graduate program. Qualifications for admission will be reviewed by the departmental Graduate Admissions committee. Prospective graduate students must have at least a 3.0 undergraduate GPA, complete the GRE, and submit an official transcript, a letter of intent, and three letters of recommendation.

A | 37 major need exists to train the next generation of water resource researchers, educators, and managers to address these challenges, both ins ide and outside New Mexico. To help meet these needs, an interdisciplinary program in Water Science & Management (WSM) has been developed at NMSU by the departments of Agricultural Economics and Agricultural Business, Animal and Range Science, Civil Engine ering, Geography, and Plant and Environmental Sciences. The primary purposes of the interdisciplinary masters and doctoral degree programs in WSM are to provide graduate education for addressing state, national, and international water issues, and to train the next generation of water professionals needed to meet the challenges noted above. A Master of Science WSM degree can be earned with 26 credits of formal course work, plus additional thesis research credits, and a Doctor of Philosophy WSM can be earned with 30 - 40 credits of formal course work beyond the masters, plus additional dissertation research credits. Five fields of study are offered in the program and are detailed below (suggested classes for each area are detailed in the following section): ]\u0001Agricultural Water Resources relates to the major use of ground and surface water in providing safe and secure food systems while ensuring ecosystem services. This field of study includes water allocation, water conservation, and water management issues facing urban water supply and irrigated agriculture. ]\u0001Watershed, Riparian, and Aquatic Systems includes the processes of organizing and guiding land and other resources used in a river basin to provide desired goods and services without adversely affecting soil and water resources. Watershed, riparian, and aquatic system management involves an array of nonstructural (vegetation management) practices, as well as an array of structural (engineering) activities, when conditions warrant. ]\u0001Water Quality and Trea tment includes processes used to make water acceptable for desired end -uses. These can include use as drinking water, industrial processes, agricultural uses, and environmental management. The goal of water treatment processes is to remove existing contami nants in the water or reduce the concentration of such contaminants so the water becomes fit for its desired end -use. ]\u0001Water Economics and Policy examines the demand for water by all its competing uses, including irrigated agriculture, energy, urban supply, and environmental restoration and management. Policies are examined for their influence on water supplies, water demands, and economic values of water reallocations among agricultural, environmental, energy, and urban users. It examines the role of wat er markets, water user decisions, institutional adjustments, and water -related policies with respect to resource costs, water quality, profitability, and environmental effects. ]\u0001Water Informatics is an interdisciplinary science primarily concerned with t he collection, classification, manipulation, storage, retrieval and especially the dissemination of water information, including both human and machine readable documents. Examples of human readable documents include maps, field data sheets, operational schedules, and long term asset management plans with narrative text. Machine readable documents include files for geographic information systems (GIS), Global Positioning Systems (GPS), relational database management systems, and emerging applications. Admis sion Requirements for the Master of Science in water science and management include all general requirements for a graduate degree as set forth in the NMSU Catalog, plus the following: ]\u0001Possession of a bachelor's degree from an accredited university grade point average of 3.5 or higher on a 4.0 scale.

An undergraduate astronomy minor degree is offered as well. To be admitted as a regular student to the NMSU Graduate School as a major in astronomy, a student must present a suitable undergraduate background with emphasis (12 -16 credits) on junior -senior level physics, and mathematics. The prospective student is also required to take aptitude and physics (or approved specialized field) sections of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). Information on assistant ships and fellowships in teaching and research can be obtained from the department. Each entering graduate student will be assigned a committee that will guide the student in choice of courses, suggest training needed to remedy deficiencies and determine specific degree requirements in accord with the student's needs and objectives, and in agreement with departmental policies. The program requires 33 traditional course credit hours (11 classes), 4 seminar class credit hours, plus research in astronomy. Each student must demonstrate no later than during the second year sufficient academic and research ability to qualify for continuation in doctoral studies. It is possible, through arrangement with the Department of Physics, to obtain a Master of Science degre e in physics during progress toward the Ph.D. in astronomy. See the \"Department of Physics\" section in this catalog for details of that program. The M.S. degree in astronomy is closely connected with the astronomy Ph.D. program, and questions concerning re quirements should be directed to the department. Qualifying, Comprehensive and Final examinations are described elsewhere in this catalog. Questions concerning styles of the examinations should be directed to the department head. The department has access to several different observing facilities.

DEGREE: Master of Science MAJOR: Biology DEGREE: Doctor of Philosophy MAJOR: Biology The Department of Biology offers graduate study leading to the Doctor of Philosophy and Master of Science degrees. The Master of Science degree can be obtained through either a thesis option or a nonthesis option. Both options require 30 credits of course work. The non -thesis option can be completed as an accelerated (one- year) program concentrating on biotechnology. Our goal is to prepare students for careers in the various fields in biology through formal coursework and research experiences as well as through seminars and discussion groups. All prospective applicants must submit the materials specified in the current Department Graduate Application P acket that is available at the Graduate Student section of the Biology website http://bio.nmsu.edu/grads/. The Departmental Graduate Application Packet also describes how to apply for Graduate Assistantships. These assistantships are awarded based on depar tmental needs and student merit; in general they are reserved for Ph.D. and thesis Master of Science students, and are not available to non -thesis Master of Science students. For the accelerated non - thesis Master of Science students, the courses are desig ned to prepare students for biotechnology- related careers in basic and applied research; in product development and testing; and in policy - making, regulation, and law enforcement. The program of study includes practical training in molecular biology, gen omics and bioinformatics, statistical analysis, business, bioethics, and professional development skills. Additional graduate course work will provide students with further expertise in their individual areas of interest, including cell, molecular, and mic robial biology; environmental, ecological, and evolutionary biology; and general and integrative biology. Students who complete this training will be prepared for successful employment in academic, corporate, and government settings. There are three formal course requirements for all Biology Graduate students, with the exception of students in the accelerated non -thesis MS Biotechnology option. These core courses are Current Topics in Biology (BIOL 510, 3 cr.), Science and Ethics (BIOL 541, 1 cr.; or PHIL 5 40, 1-3 cr.), and the biology Seminar course (BIOL 610, 1 cr.). Students are required to successfully complete the Seminar course once each year that they are in the program. For other Master of Science studies and for the Ph.D., students can choose among the Department's three areas of emphasis: 1) Behavioral, Ecological and Evolutionary Biology, 2) Cell and Organismal Biology, and 3) Microbiology. All graduate students should consult with their faculty advisor and their graduate committee in | 43 developing a curriculum plan. Further details of typical course sequences in the different emphases are described in the Biology Graduate Handbook available for download from the Graduate Student section of the Biology website http://bio.nmsu.edu/grads/. The Behavioral , Ecological and Evolutionary Biology program is appropriate for graduate students who wish to specialize in areas of biology that study the various processes that encompass the behavior, ecology, and evolution of living and extinct taxa. The Cell and Orga nismal Biology program is appropriate for all Graduate students who wish to emphasize those areas of biology that integrate function and structure in cells, tissues, and organisms. The Microbiology curriculum is appropriate for graduate students who wish to specialize in areas of biology that study the various processes that occur in microbes (bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protists) such as their physiology, ecology, development, or evolution.

Admission to these programs without deficiency is based on an undergraduate program essentially equivalent to that pursued by a chemistry or biochemistry major at this university. An entering student is encouraged to take the Graduate Re cord Examination (aptitude) to increase his or her chances for financial support. All foreign students must take GRE and TOEFL and must demonstrate adequate English speaking and writing skills. Students who wish may take a minor in chemical toxicology or m olecular biology. The core course work required of students entering with no previous graduate study in chemistry or biochemistry consists of basic core courses completed in one of the following options: (i) two courses chosen respectively from two of the five major areas represented in the department apart from a student's elected field of thesis research; or (ii) one course chosen from the five major areas apart from the student's elected field of thesis research plus one graduate- level course in a discip line outside the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. A master's candidate will plan an appropriate program of further study with his or her advisor and is also required to prepare a thesis. The thesis requirement may be waived upon application to the department head, after completion of the doctoral comprehensive examination requirements. A chemistry student who successfully completes the Ph.D. qualifying examination will begin writing the cumulative examinations, which constitute the written portion of the comprehensive examination. A biochemistry student who successfully completes the Ph.D. qualifying examination will begin preparation of a research proposal which will be orally defended for completion of the comprehensive examination. After completi on of the qualifying exam, a doctoral committee is formed to assist the student in planning a program appropriate to his or her background and goals. Since research is central in both the master's and doctoral programs, the early selection of a research ad visor is encouraged. The student is expected to participate in the colloquia and seminar programs. Financial support is available to graduate students in chemistry and biochemistry through numerous teaching and research assistantships as well as federally supported traineeships and fellowships. Inquiries regarding these opportunities should be directed to the head of the department.

DEGREE: DOCTOR OF PH ILOSO PHY MAJOR: COMPUTER SCIE NCE Doctoral students may specialize in any of the areas in which computer science faculty members have active research interests. Through interdisciplinary arrangements with other doctoral departments at New Mexico State University, doctoral students may also specialize in such areas as computational biology, computer networks and architectures, and cognitive science. Doctoral students are expected to join the prog ram with a preparation equivalent to that required for the Master's degree in computer science at New Mexico State University. The requirements for the degree are as specified in the NMSU graduate catalog, with the following additional considerations: ]\u0001[For students who enrolled in the doctoral program before Fall 2014]: The qualifying examination is implemented as a written examination, which examines the depth of knowledge in five areas of computer science. The five areas are Formal Languages and Computa bility, Analysis of Algorithms, Programming Languages, one between Operating Systems and Computer Architectures, and a fifth area agreed between the student and the department's Graduate Committee. Doctoral students are required to take the qualifying exam ination on or before the date indicated in their departmental admission referral. Each student has three consecutive attempts to complete the five required areas. ]\u0001[For students who enrolled in the doctoral program on or after Fall 2014]: The qualifying e xamination consists of written exams in five subject areas: four of these are required areas, while the fifth is an elective area. The student will take four exams in the following required subjects: Operating Systems or Computer Architectures; Principles of Programming Languages; Design and Analysis of Algorithms and Data Structures; and Discrete Mathematics. The topics of each exam are listed on the departmental wbsite. The student is required to enroll in an elective course offered in the first semester of his/her enrollment at NMSU, which identifies the fifth subject fo the qualifying examination. The faculty in charge of the class will determine the exam topics of the elective subject. The student is required to take the qualifying examination at the en d of the first semester of enrollment as a doctoral student at NMSU; the only exceptions will be granted to students entering the doctoral program with significant undergraduate deficiencies - in such case the deadline for the qualifying examination will be indicated in the admission records. It is the responsibility of the student to ensure that the qualifying examination is taken within the prescribed deadline. Students failing to meet the deadline wil be automatically withdrawn from the doctoral program. If a student fails any of the exams, he/she must retake those exams in the following semester. If a student fails to pass all exams after the second attempt, he/she will be dismissed from the doctoral program. ]\u0001The comprehensive examination evaluates depth of knowledge in the specific research area selected by the candidate with the consent of his/her graduate committee. The comprehensive exam includes both a written part, in the form of an extensive survey paper, an annotated bibliography, and an oral exa mination. ]\u0001The student is required to submit and defend a prospectus, at the same time or after completing the comprehensive examination. The prospectus describes and motivates the specific research problem to be addressed in the doctoral dissertation. Students should contact the department for information on additional graduation requirements, or visit the on -line Graduate Handbook (http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/). DEGREE: SCIE NCE Each master's student normally must write a thesis (C S 599) or, with the advisor's permission, undertake a research project (C S 598). In either case, the number of required graduate credits is 33, including 6 for the thesis or project. In all cases, the students are required to sustain a final exam, covering the thesis/research project and the graduate course -work. The two parts of the exam bring equal weight. In no case may a C S course numbered below 500 be counted towards the require d number of credits. In particular, graduate students are expected to register for C S classes numbered 500 or above. The student's program must include: C S 510 Automata, Languages, Computability 3 C S 570 Analysis of Algorithms 3 One of the following: C S 573 Architectural Concepts II 3 C S 574 Operating Systems II 3 C S 584 Computer Networks II 3 One of the following: C S 571 Programming Language Structure II 3 C S 575 Artificial Intelligence II 3 C S 580 Compiler Construction 3 C S 581 Advanced Software Engineering 3 C S 582 Database Management Systems II 3 One additional course selected from: C S 550 Complexity Theory 3 C S 571 Programming Language Structure II 3 C S 572 Advanced Algorithms 3 C S 573 Architectural Concepts II 3 C S 574 Operating Systems II 3 C S 575 Artificial Intelligence II 3 C S 580 Compiler Construction 3 C S 581 Advanced Software Engineering 3 C S 582 Database Management Systems II 3 C S 584 Computer Networks II 3 C S 586 Algorithms in Systems Biology 3 One addi tional computer science course numbered above 550 and different from: C S 598 Master's Project 1-6 C S 599 Master's Thesis 1-6 C S 600 Pre-dissertation Research 1-15 and C S 700 Doctoral Dissertation 0-15 Courses not in Computer Science can be inclu ded in the student's program of study only if prior written approval has been obtained from the student's advisor and the departmental Graduate Committee. Further details can be found in the on - line Graduate Handbook (http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/). With the adv isor's consent, the student may instead complete a coursework -only Master degree; this requires 36 credits of regular course work, satisfying the same requirements listed above, except that the 6 credits of thesis or project are replaced by 9 credits of co urses numbered 550 or above and distinct from C S 589, C S 598, and C S 599. Students pursuing a coursework- only degree are expected to complete a written exam covering a selected subset of the 46| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2014 -2015 GRADUATE CATALO G students' plan of study. Further details can be found in the o n-line Graduate Handbook (http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/) MAJOR: BIOINFORMATICS The degree requirements include 30 graduate credit hours.

Full details of the program can be found at http://www.cs.nmsu.edu. Admission occurs in two steps. First, students will apply to the Computer Science department to receive approval for the BS+MS program. The student submits the pre -application whe n he/she is within 48 credits of earning a BS in Computer Science; an application form is provided in the department web site. Qualification for the BS+MS program will be based on the cumulative (non -grade replaced) grade point average in Computer Science and Math courses taken to that point, including at least two out of C S 370, C S 371, and C S 372 (at least 3.5) and recommendations by faculty members listed on the departmental application. Additional factors might be taken into account when available (e .g., TOEFL/IELTS scores, GRE scores). Students having a grade point average below 3.5 may be admitted on a case -by-case basis, depending on faculty recommendations and evaluations of the individual academic and professional history. Once the Computer Scien ce department has notified the applicant of acceptance in the combined BS+MS program, the applicant must then formally apply to the graduate school (prospective.nmsu.edu/graduate) for formal admission to the graduate program; this application to the gradua te school is made during the semester of graduation from the BS in Computer Science. REQUIREMENTS The curriculum for the first three years of the BS+MS program coincides with the requirements of the BS program. In particular, the general requirements inclu de a grade of a least a C - in each course to satisfy the departmental and non - departmental requirements. No course may be counted as satisfying both a departmental and no -departmental requirement. No course taken to satisfy either a departmental or non -departmental requirement may be taken S/U.

The programs are designed to prepare students both for diverse careers in the public sector and for further training at the doctoral level. The M.P.A. program is accredited by the Networ k of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs and Administration (NASPAA), a distinction held by fewer than one -quarter of M.P.A. programs nationwide. The M.P.A. program offers joint degrees with the Department of Criminal Justice (M.P.A./M.C.J.) and with the Dep artment of History (M.P.A/ M.A. in Public History). Students in a joint degree program can earn two master's degrees with fewer credits than would be required to earn those degrees independently. Admission Prospective graduate students in either the M. A. or M. P. A. should demonstrate a 3.0 grade point average for the second half of their undergraduate course work. For students with a GPA of less than 3.0, GRE scores are required, though this requirement may be waived if the undergraduate degree was awarded more than five years before applying. Applicants to either program are required to submit an application online. See instructions at: http://prospective.nmsu.edu/graduate/apply/index.html. Applications include three letters of recommendation, a writing s ample, and a personal statement concerning their interest in pursuing a graduate degree. Additional information concerning program requirements and the admission process can be obtained from either the department's M.A. chair or M.P.A. director. Under exce ptional circumstances the department may exempt students from the minimal requirements. Application for admission to the Graduate School should clearly indicate the program in which the student wishes to enroll. Applications for admission to the M.P.A. pro gram are reviewed twice a year, once in the Fall semester and once in the Spring semester. Students interested in a joint degree option must apply and be accepted in to the two departments separately, and indicate their interest on their applications in on e of the joint degree programs. General Requirements Students in both the M.A. and M.P.A. programs select either a thesis or non-thesis option. Students planning on continuing their studies in a doctoral program or wishing to establish expertise related to a specific career objective are strongly encouraged to select the thesis option. The non -thesis option is suggested for students desiring immediate employment or seeking to enhance their current employment situations. Course work outside the department mu st have prior advisor approval to ensure a well- integrated program of study. Complete information on the requirements for either program should be obtained directly from the department. Most M.A. and M.P.A. courses are offered in the evening. DEGREE: MASTE R OF ARTS MAJOR: GOVERNMENT The M.A. program provides general course work in each of the major fields of political science. Students may choose either the thesis option, under which they complete 30 credits of course work plus 6 thesis credits (GOVT 599), or the nonthesis option, with 30 credits of course work plus 6 hours of special research credit (GOVT 598) or 6 hours of approved internship credit (GOVT 510). Both the thesis and nonthesis options r equire a final oral examination; the non thesis option requires a written examination as well. The program provides a broad -based foundation in political science while allowing students to pursue specific areas of interest. All students are required to com plete a research methods class, either GOVT 502 Research Methods in Government 3 or GOVT 503 Qualitative Research Methods 3 In addition, students must take 3 of the following 6 courses (9 credits): GOVT 530 Seminar in Public Policy 3 GOVT 550 Seminar in American Politics 3 GOVT 560 Seminar in International Relations Theory 3 GOVT 570 Seminar in Comparative Politics 3 GOVT 580 Seminar in Political Theory 3 GOVT 590 Seminar Public Law and Legal Systems 3 The remaining credits required for the degre e are selected subject to advisor approval to satisfy particular academic interests or career goals. Flexibility in planning a program of study is permitted to meet the educational needs of a diverse student population. Structured areas of emphasis are ava ilable in several topical areas including security studies, Latin American affairs, and international affairs. The study program for each certification area must be approved by the M.A. Program Committee. Information on these areas may be obtained from the Department of Government. No more than 9 credits taken outside the department will be counted toward the degree.

In addition to fulfilling the basic requirements for admission to the Graduate School, applicants must present undergraduate passage of at least 12 credits in history with grades of B or higher, including 6 upper division history credits. Those lacking this preparation must normally make up deficiencies before beginning graduate course work. Candidates who choose a course of study requiring a foreign language will be responsible for their own language preparation. Students applying for admission to the graduate program in history a re required to submit an application form and a transcript to the Graduate School and a strong writing sample, three letters of recommendation ideally from History faculty members at NMSU or other institutions, and a two- to-three page statement of purpose to the Department of History, approximately four months in advance of the desired enrollment date. Applicants for graduate assistantships and fellowships must submit a letter of application, a transcript, and three letters of recommendation to the departme nt by February 15 for the fall semester, and by October 15 for the spring semester. Students who are not applying for graduate assistantships and fellowships may apply at any time for acceptance into the graduate program. Thirty -six credits (27 of which must be at the 500 level) are required for the thesis program, including at least 3 public history credits above the 500 level; four history graduate seminars that include the Craft of History seminar, two readings seminars from among HIST 590, HIST 591, HIS T 592, and HIST 593, and a research seminar; and a thesis (6 credits). With permission of the graduate advisor, a maximum of 6 credits may be taken in related fields outside the Department of History. A student choosing the thesis program must receive permission for his/her thesis by passing a thesis proposal defense after earning 12 graduate credits in History. The department will provide guidelines for the thesis defense. A student choosing the thesis program must pass a final oral examination over gradua te course work and the thesis. All graduate students will be required to present a research paper in a public forum approved by the department's Graduate Director. Thirty -six credits (27 of which must be at the 500 level) are required for the Public Histor y specialization. These include four history seminars: the public history seminar, Craft of History, one research seminar, and one readings seminar from among HIST 590, HIST 591, HIST 592, and HIST 593. Students complete a public history internship (3 cred its) and preparation of an article of scholarly quality (3 credits). Students in the Public History specialization must collectively pass 18 credits of nonpublic history courses, including the nonpublic history seminars noted above. They must collectively pass 18 credits in public history, which must include the public history seminar, the internship, and the article. The scholarly article is developed through work in the internship and will be of peer reviewed journal quality. The public history credits ma y include a maximum of 9 graduate level (450 -and-above) credits outside the Department of History with permission of the Director of the Public History Program. A student choosing the Public History specialization must pass an article proposal defense about the proposed scholarly article during the first semester after completion of the internship. The department will provide guidelines for the article defense. A student choosing the Public History specialization must give a public presentation of a portfo lio that includes his/her work and the scholarly article, and must pass an oral examination over graduate course work, the internship, and the article. Students who receive a Master's degree in this track will have a specialization in Public History added to their transcripts. Students choosing to pursue both the thesis track and Public History specialization must complete the course hours required for the public history specialization, perform an internship, and defend the proposed thesis before undertaking it using guidelines provided by the department, present the public history portfolio at a public presentation, complete the thesis, and defend their course work, thesis and public history portfolio at a final oral examination. In order to satisfactorily complete both programs, such students would complete 39 credits, including three hours of internship credit and six hours of thesis work. The Department of History and the Department of Government offer a joint degree in which students who are accepted into both of these programs may simultaneously earn both a Master of Arts in History degree with the Public History specialization, and a Master of Public Administration degree. The joint degree requires 57 total credits, while students who pursued both degre es as separate degrees would need to pass at least 72 credits. Students earning the joint degrees must pass a joint oral examination after passing required courses and completing internship credits in both programs. Students interested in the joint degree program should consult with the Director of the Public History Program and the Director of the Master of Public Administration Program. Students may earn a graduate minor in History by passing the following courses: Craft of History, one readings seminar from among HIST 590, HIST 591, HIST 592, additional 3 -credit 500- and-above courses, for a total of 12 graduate credits. Graduate students in History must maintain a 3.0 grade point average in their History courses. A graduate student earning a C or lower grade in one History course will receive a letter of warning. A graduate student earning two or more C or lower grades in History courses or whose History grade point average falls below 3.0 will be removed from the History graduate pro gram. Students must earn at least one B or higher grade in a seminar during their first year in the graduate program, and must take at least one seminar during each year in which they are enrolled in the program. If a graduate student receives one U ( Unsa tisfactory) grade on his/her thesis or internship, the student will receive a written warning, and if a student received two or more U grades on his/her thesis or internship, the student will be removed from the program.

It also prepares a student for future graduate work. A candidate for a master's degree may select up to two minors in addition to the major. A minimum of 8 credits of graduate work is necessary for a minor. Minimum Requirements for the Master's Degree 1. In fulfillment of the Graduate School requirement of a minimum of 30 semester cr edits of course work, the student must take at least 24 credits of mathematics or statistics, numbered above 500. 2. The student must complete, transfer, or challenge MATH 525, MATH 527, MATH 528, and MATH 581. 3. In addition, 6 of the 24 Math credits mu st be from the following list of courses: Algebra (MATH 582), Complex Analysis (MATH 591, MATH 592), Differential Equations (MATH 531, MATH 532), Logic and Foundations (MATH 557, MATH 585), Probability and Statistics (STAT 562, STAT 571), Real Analysis (MA TH 593, MATH 594) and Topology (MATH 541, MATH 542). 4. At most 6 credits of individual study courses such as MATH 540 may be used to fulfill the course requirement. 5. MATH 511 through MATH 516, and MATH 563 through MATH 569 may not be used to fulfill any of these requirements. 6. The student's program of study must be approved by the departmental Graduate Studies Committee. 7. The student must successfully complete a final master's examination. The Master's Final Examination The Master's final examinat ion is an oral examination administered by the student's committee and covers the student's coursework. The student's committee consists of at least three departmental members and a Graduate faculty member from another department who serves as the Dean's representative. If the student has a minor area of study, then a member must come from the minor department. The examination is restricted to course work presented in the student's program of studies. When a master's thesis has been written, the master's fi nal exam will be in part an oral defense of the thesis and in part a general examination of the candidate's course work. The oral exam must be completed at least 10 days prior to the end of the semester in which the candidate wishes to receive the degree. DEGREE: DOCTOR OF PH ILOSOPHY MAJOR: MATHEMATICS Candidates for the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Mathematical Sciences must pass a qualifying examination, three comprehensive written exami nations, a basic mathematical reading knowledge test in a language other than English, a comprehensive oral examination, a series of courses, and a final oral doctoral thesis examination. These are briefly described below. For more information, see the Gra duate School requirements in this catalog, and the Mathematics Graduate Student handbook at www.math.nmsu.edu. Qualifying examination: Every student admitted to the Ph.D. program must complete the Ph.D. oral qualifying examination. Its purpose is to determ ine the areas in which the student shows strength or weakness, as well as the ability to assimilate subject matter presented at the graduate level. Students who complete their mathematics master's degree at NMSU may request, at the time of applying for the ir master's oral final examination, that the Master's examination also fulfill the Ph.D. qualifying examination requirement. In all other cases, towards the end of the student's first semester in the Ph.D. program, the student and his or her advisor will c onvene an oral examination with three examiners, the examiners being the advisor and some of the student's current or past instructors. As a result of the Qualifying examination, the department will take one of the following actions: (1) admit the student to further work toward the Ph.D.; (2) recommend that the student's program be limited to a Master's degree; (3) recommend a reevaluation of the student's progress after the lapse of one semester; or (4) recommend a discontinuation of the student's graduate program in mathematics. Written comprehensive examinations: Candidates for the Ph.D. degree must pass written comprehensive examinations in three of the seven areas of algebra, complex analysis, differential equations, logic and foundations, real analysis, statistics, and topology. To ensure adequate breadth, a combination of three comprehensive examinations must include real analysis, and at least one of algebra and topology. The seven examinations are based on the following comprehensive examination sequ ence courses: Algebra (MATH 525, MATH 581, MATH 582), Complex Analysis (MATH 517, MATH 591, MATH 592), Differential Equations (MATH 518, MATH 531, MATH 532), Logic and Foundations (MATH 504, MATH 557, MATH 585), Real Analysis (MATH 527, MATH 528, MATH 593, MATH 594), Probability and Statistics (STAT 562, STAT 571), and Topology (MATH 541, MATH 542). Full time students should complete the comprehensive written exams in the first two years. Those who have not made substantial progress towards completion of th eir written exams at the start of the fifth semester may be removed from the program. Students who have not completed the written exams by the start of the sixth semester will normally have any departmental funding revoked. Exams are offered every August a nd January. A student must register to take exams in the semester prior to taking the exams. A student has three consecutive examination periods to complete the written comprehensive exam requirements (Example: if s/he starts in August, s/he has the August , January and August examination periods to complete the exams). This does not extend the time limit mentioned above. Students will normally not be given more than two attempts at any one exam. | 55 Course requirements: Before graduation, a student must pass a total of four comprehensive exam sequences, but needs to take the comprehensive examinations in only three of them. In addition, a student must pass four more (one- semester) MATH/STAT courses from the seven comprehensive exam sequences listed above. A student may pass any of the four comprehensive examination sequences before enrolling as a Ph.D. student, but the four additional courses have to be passed after enrolling as a Ph.D. student. The following courses will not count towards the course requirements : Any course below MATH 501, MATH 511 through MATH 516, and MATH 563 through MATH 569, MATH 540/STAT 540, MATH 598/STAT 598, MATH 599, MATH 600, MATH 700. Students and advisors are encouraged to consider further courses beyond this minimum. Foreign languag e examination: The department requires that each Ph.D. student pass a basic mathematical reading knowledge exam in a language, other than English, relevant to the student's research interests. This exam is coordinated by the student's advisor and consists of the open- dictionary written translation into English of a mathematical text of interest to the student. The language requirement must be fulfilled prior to the oral part of the Ph.D. comprehensive examination. Oral Comprehensive Exam: The student must t ake this exam at the end of the semester after completing the written comprehensive exams. The student should present a proposed direction for thesis work. Final Oral Exam: This should be an exam over the student's thesis and administered by the same commi ttee of the oral comprehensive (575) 646 -3437 nancyt@nmsu.edu A.

Integration of this knowledge into the context of complex living tissues interacting with the environment is the ultimate goal. This requires that the expertise from many diverse traditional disciplines be directed along converging experimental lines. The Ph.D. program in molecular biology is designed to facilitate an interdisciplinary approach to graduate research, utilizing both traditional techniques and the latest advances in biotechnology, including the extraordinary power of r ecombinant DNA methodology. Participants in this program will take core courses in biochemistry, molecular biology and cell biology. Subsequent course work will be tailored for the individual student, depending upon his or her research emphasis. Participation in regular seminar programs will be expected to provide students with the widest possible scientific background. Financial aid, in the form of a limited number of MB teaching and research assistantships, is available on a competitive basis. Research As sistantships may also be available from individual faculty within the Molecular Biology (MB) program. Only the most competitive students are admitted with assistantship support. The MB program offers curricula leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in the areas of biochemistry, molecular genetics, molecular biology, cell biology, bioinformatics, and microbiology. Admission to the MB Program without deficiency is based on an undergraduate program essentially equivalent to that pursued by an undergraduate majo r in chemistry, biology, agronomy, horticulture, biochemistry, or microbiology at this university. An entering student is required to complete the Graduate Record Examination (General Aptitude). Undergraduate deficiency courses must be passed with a minimu m grade of B. Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact at least three individual program faculty before applying to identify a prospective advisor and laboratory in which to pursue graduate research. Previous course records and GPA standings (typicall y minimum of 3.3/4.0), GRE scores (typically minimum of 300 combined verbal and quantitative), TOEFL scores of foreign applicants (typically minimum of 550 on the paper -based or 213 on the computer -based), a letter of interest from the applicant that ident ified faculty laboratories of interest, and three letters of reference regarding research performance or potential are weighted heavily during the selection process. Students with a B.S. degree in one of the disciplines listed above can expect to earn the M.S. degree in about 30 credits, including at least 6 credits of thesis research. The Ph.D. degree can be earned in about 30 to 40 credits of formal course work, plus additional thesis research credits, for a minimum total of 75 credits beyond the B.S. Bec ause research is central in both the M.S. and Ph.D. curricula, early selection of a research advisor is required. Ph.D. degree candidates will successfully complete a written and oral qualifying examination based on their proposed research and the subject matter in the core courses (below) at the end of the first year of study. Also at this time, the master's or doctoral committee is organized to assist in planning a program appropriate to the background and goals of the student. Ph.D. candidates will subse quently complete a comprehensive written examination and oral examination approximately at the end of the second year of study. A final, formal presentation and oral defense of the original research documented in the M.S. or Ph.D. thesis completes the degr ee requirements. The Molecular Biology program also offers formal minors in molecular biology or bioinformatics. The molecular biology minor consists of 10 credit hours including MOLB 545; either MOLB 520 or MOLB 542; any of the tier II courses; and one MO LB 590 seminar. The bioinformatics minor is jointly offered with the Department of Computer Science and consists of 9 credit hours for Master's students and 12 credit hours for Ph.D. students, including MOLB 452/GENE 452, and additional courses selected from those listed at http://research.nmsu.edu/molbio/. The courses selected will depend on whether the student is majoring in a biological or non -biological science and include courses from the graduate Computer Science and Molecular Biology curricula. Please inquire with the Molecular Biology Program office for the most recent requirements for the bioinformatics minor.

Admission to these programs is competitive and selection of applicants is based on undergraduate and/or previous graduate grade- point averages, perfo rmance on the general and subject Graduate Record Examination, other evidence of prior academic and research accomplishments submitted by the applicant, and references, as well as matching of the applicant's research interests to the Department's research activities, as described by the student's statement of purpose, in the case of applicants for the doctoral program. The M.S. in Physics with a concentration in Space Physics program provides students with a strong foundation in physics with an intensive fo cus on space physics. Graduate study in space physics at the master's level prepares graduates for continued and specialized study toward the doctorate program in space- related fields as well as for challenges they will confront in space industrial and gov ernment settings. All degree- seeking graduate students must satisfy the relevant Graduate School requirements, pass a qualifying examination based on undergraduate physics courses at the 400 level, successfully complete a 3 -credit, 500- level laboratory, an d demonstrate or develop knowledge of computer programming. Additional course requirements are described below; courses taken S/U may not be used to satisfy any of the degree requirements, including the lab requirement for Master's and Ph.D. students. The qualifying and comprehensive examination outcomes are decided by vote of the entire faculty, based on the recommendations of the corresponding examination committees. For the qualifying examination, the faculty may decide that a student pass at the doctora l level; pass at the master's level; be requested to retake the exam at the next available opportunity; or terminate graduate study. For the written part of the comprehensive examination, the faculty may decide that a student be given an unconditional pass ; be given a conditional pass, with the requirement that the student produce additional evidence of research accomplishments during the oral part of the exam before being granted admission to candidacy; repeat the written part the next time it is offered; or terminate graduate study. In addition, the faculty may decide to discontinue financial support to a student based on the student's performance on the qualifying or comprehensive examination. Students will receive written notification of the exam's outcome from the Graduate Physics Program Head within 30 days of the exam. Appeals must be addressed to the Physics Department Head within 30 days of receiving written notification of the exam's outcome and will be decided by the physics faculty. A student granted an unconditional or conditional pass on the written part of the comprehensive examination must take the oral part in the same semester that the written part was taken; the student's Ph.D. committee makes the final decision, following the oral part of t he comprehensive examination, on admission of the student to the candidacy to the doctoral degree. 58| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2014 -2015 GRADUATE CATALO G Students may choose areas of emphasis from a variety of experimental, theoretical, and computational re- search programs in the department.

DEGREE: Master of Arts MAJOR: Sociology DEGREE: MASTER OF AR TS MAJOR: SOCIOLOGY The Southwest and Border Region Our unique location attracts faculty who are interested in peoples of the southwest, particularly Hispanics/Latinos and American Indians. In addition, our proximity to the U.S. -Mexico border provides an ideal laboratory for the examination of such iss ues as globalization, transnational migration and the consequences of border development. Social Inequality Our faculty members examine the intersection of race, class and gender oppression in their teaching and research, with special attention to educatio nal, rural/urban, ecological and global disparities. One goal of this examination is to address social problems such as poverty and racial/ethnic inequality. The program is designed to prepare students for doctoral study in sociology and for employment in research and applied areas of the field. In addition to the on-campus program, we offer an online MA for students who are geographically distant from the NMSU main campus or who have full time jobs. Through small seminars, on campus graduate students engag e in discussions of subjects that often result in thesis and internship topics. Regardless of course format, faculty members and students work toward the mutual goal of developing each student's full potential. Students seeking a master's degree in sociolo gy should have taken one undergraduate course each in methods and statistics or their equivalent. Students who have not taken these courses should complete them before beginning their graduate study, or as soon as possible, in consultation with an academic advisor. Program Options and Requirements Graduate students in sociology have two program options, thesis or non - thesis. Faculty consider the students special interests and career plans in advising regarding their choice of program options. The thesis opt ion is typically selected by students who intend to pursue a Ph.D. degree, while the non- thesis option is commonly pursued by those desiring immediate employment in research and applied areas in government, education, social welfare and health. The non -thesis, coursework only option is currently the only option available for on -line MA students. All students must pass a final master's examination. Thesis Program Requirements In addition to the successful completion of an acceptable master's thesis, students who choose this option will take a minimum of 36 credit hours of graduate work distributed as follows: ]\u0001SOC 501, SOC 551, SOC 552, SOC 553 (12 credits total), to be taken within the first 27 hours of graduate credit.

Students will be advised upon their formal acceptance into the program. MAJOR: SPANISH The Degree Plan The degree plan requires a minimum of 36 credits in Spanish, of which at least 30 must be earned at the 500 level, and the remainder above the 450 level. The courses should be concentrated in the student's chosen area of stud y (linguistics or literature) as each student will be tested on a reading list that corresponds to each area study. A thesis is optional. Students authorized to complete a thesis may count a maximum of 6 credits of thesis work toward the degree. At the pre sent time, the thesis option is not available for online -only students. There are no required core courses at this time and a student should work closely with his/her advisor and the Graduate Director to establish an appropriate individual degree plan. All students in either the on -campus or online program may complete a minor at the master's level by taking 9 credits (3 courses) at the 500 level or above, in another area (department) of study, or within the department itself. For instance, a student studyi ng linguistics may wish to obtain a minor in literature or a student studying literature may wish to obtain a minor in linguistics. In either case, the minor credits count as part of the 36 total credits required for the degree. In all cases, the student should work closely with the Graduate Director to ensure his/her particular plan of study is acceptable to the program. Linguistics area of study courses include: SPAN 507 Technology Enhanced Language Learning 3 SPAN 508 Teaching Literature with Technology 3 SPAN 509 Teaching Culture with Technology 3 SPAN 510 Assessing the National Standards 3 SPAN 540 Introduccion a la Linguistica 3 SPAN 545 Advanced Dialectos del Espanol 3 SPAN 558 Bilinguismo 3 SPAN 560 Advanced Spanish Language Acquisition 3 SPAN 561 Advanced Spanish Phonetics 3 SPAN 562 Advanced Spanish Phonology 3 SPAN 570 Advanced Study in Technical Translation 3 SPAN 580 Research Methodology in Spanish Linguistics 3 SPAN 584 Spanish Morphosyntax 3 SPAN 585 Language Assessment 3 SPAN 589 Spanish Sociolinguistics 3 SPAN 591 Advanced Study in History of the Spanish Language 3 SPAN 592 Advanced Structure of Spanish 3 SPAN 593 Advanced Studies in U.S. Spanish 3 SPAN 594 Theory and Methodology of Spanish Pedagogy 3 SPAN 595 Advanced Topic s in Applied Spanish Linguistics 3 SPAN 597 Advanced Strategies for Teaching Spanish for Heritage/Native Speakers 3 | 61 SPAN 595: may vary by course subtitle Literature area of study courses include: SPAN 500 Methods of Research and Literary Criticism 3 SPAN 512 Contemporary Spanish -American Poetry 3 SPAN 520 Hispanic Micro Fiction 3 SPAN 521 Advanced Cuban Literature 3 SPAN 528 Advanced Hispanic Literature of the U.S. 3 SPAN 546 Advanced Poesia Modernista 3 SPAN 547 Advanced Hispanic Film 3 SPAN 548 Advanced U.S. -Hispanic Film 3 SPAN 552 Advanced Literature of the Mexican Revolution 3 SPAN 555 Advanced Spanish -American Literature Through the 18th Century 3 SPAN 556 Advanced 19 -Century Spanish -American Literature 3 SPAN 563 Advanced Study in Mexican Literature 3 SPAN 564 Advanced Caribbean Literature in Spanish 3 SPAN 566 Contemporary Spanish -American Novel 3 SPAN 567 Advanced Study in Chicano Literature 3 SPAN 573 Advanced Study in Creative Writing 3 SPAN 581 Advanced Prosa Modernista 3 SPAN 5 83 Advanced Study in Spanish -American Women Writers 3 SPAN 586 Contemporary Spanish -American Essay 3 SPAN 587 Contemporary Spanish -American Short Story 3 SPAN 588 Contemporary Spanish -American Drama 3 Courses that may apply to either area include SPAN 590 (see subtitles in schedule of courses to confirm subject of the course) SPAN 598, SPAN 599 (both courses require a course proposal and prior approval). Additional Language Requirement For both the on -campus and online degrees, the department requires that students fulfill a second language requirement (in addition to English and Spanish) by following an approved course of study. Typically, this is completed by taking a four-semester course of study, but may vary according to the languages available. Options for completing this requirement include taking classes at a local Community College or University, or online. Some students have met this requirement by studying abroad through NMSU. Students should consult the Graduate Director to establish a plan an d discuss how this requirement will be met. NOTE: evidence of fulfilling the second language requirement must be provided to the Graduate Director BEFORE taking final examinations. English Language Requirement International students are required to demonst rate proficiency in English and meet all international admissions requirements prior to beginning their program of study. Please see the section of the Graduate Catalog on international admissions requirements and scores required for either the TOEFL or IE LTS exam. NOTE: evidence of fulfilling the English Language Requirement must be provided to the Graduate Director AND the Graduate School BEFORE taking final examinations. Final Examinations Students must successfully complete a final department examinatio n (generally during the final semester of coursework) that is partially written and partially oral. Please consult the Graduate Director for specific information on dates and format for these exams. Final examinations are only available during the Fall and Spring semesters. Areas of Interest/Reading List As stated previously, each student needs to select an area of interest - Linguistics or Literature. At the end of the student's degree, the final examinations (written and oral) will be based on the reading s from the readings list in the student's selected area of study. For example, a student that has opted to specialize in literature is responsible for reading all the materials on the Literature Reading List. Likewise, a student that has opted to specializ e in linguistics is responsible for reading all the materials on the Linguistics Reading List. The student is responsible for the reading list that was in place the year s/he started the program. Each student is responsible for covering the reading materia ls listed. Please contact the Graduate Director for a detailed reading. Note that the list is dated, so make sure to refer to the correct list that covers the year/semester the student started the program. The student is responsible for covering ALL the re adings even if the student did not cover them as part of work done in class. Graduate Assistantships For the on- campus program only, the department awards graduate assistantships to qualified students. For this financial assistance, the student works up to 20 hours a week in departmental programs, chiefly in the teaching of elementary and intermediate Spanish courses in either the Heritage Language sequence or Spanish as a second Language sequence. Students interested in being considered for an assistantshi p should clearly state this interest in their introduction letter during the application process. The department offers a limited number of assistantships, and students should remember that not everyone that applies for this award receives one. Maintaining the award depends on the student's successful performance both academically and in the classes he/she teaches and is evaluated on a semester- by-semester basis. Students who receive an assistantship are required to take SPAN 594 (see course description) as part of their degree plan in order to help them prepare for teaching classes at NMSU. 62| NEW MEXICO STATE U Arizona)- financial accounting; M.

DEGREE: Master of Accountancy MINOR: Information Systems MASTER OF ACCOUNTANCY (MACC) The last two decades have witnessed a tremendous expansion in the knowledge base required for accounting professionals. The business environment has become increasin gly complex, as evidenced by the growth in the body of national and international accounting and auditing standards, taxation, SEC, and other regulatory requirements. The accountant must also be well versed in communications and analytical skills, computer -based information systems, professional ethics, and global issues. Neither the traditional four -year accounting program nor the MBA provides the educational breadth and depth necessary to fully prepare students for the demands now imposed by many accounti ng careers. The major objective of the Master of Accountancy (MAcc) program is to provide for these increased educational needs and to prepare students more adequately for careers as professional accountants in financial institutions, government, not -for-profit organizations, and public practice. The program is designed to provide a technical and theoretical foundation in accountancy at the advanced level and yet allow the student to take courses to accommodate individual needs. The MAcc program is recommen ded for those students wishing to fulfill the 150-hour education requirement which most states, including New Mexico, have legislated as a requirement for taking the Uniform CPA Examination. Graduate assistantships are available for a limited number of qua lified students. Interested persons are urged to apply well within the deadlines set by the Graduate School. Inquiries should be addressed to the Master of Accountancy Director. Admission requirements of the Graduate School must be met before the applicant may be admitted to the Master of Accountancy program. Consideration for admissions to the Master of Accountancy program is dependent on an applicant's undergraduate record and score on the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT). Specifically, an appli cant's undergraduate GPA is multiplied by a factor of 200 and the result is added to his/her GMAT score. The required total is 1100. Applicants scoring between 1000 and 1100 will be admitted to the program only with approval of the MAcc Admissions Committee. The minimum acceptable GMAT score is 400. An acceptable score on the GMAT must be submitted at least one month prior to the student's first enrollment unless the student meets one of the GMAT waivers listed below. In addition to the aforementioned entra nce requirements, an applicant's GPA in 7 upper division accounting prerequisites must be at least 3.0. For those students not receiving their undergraduate accounting degree at NMSU, it is expected that substantially all of the accounting prerequisite cla sses be from an AACSB accredited business school or the application will need to be approved by the MAcc Admissions Committee. In this case the Admissions Committee may require that some of these prerequisite courses be retaken at an AACSB institution such as NMSU. All grades, including those from the first attempt at repeated classes, will be used to compute upper division accounting prerequisite grade point averages to determine admission to the graduate program. At the suggestion of any faculty member, t he MAcc Admissions Committee will review the application of a student whose potential might not be accurately reflected by this calculation. GMAT Waivers: The GMAT requirement is waived for those who: 1. Are graduates of an undergraduate program in account ing from a US AACSB accredited business school with at least a 3.25 GPA overall and a 3.25 GPA in their eight upper division accounting courses; or 2. Hold a recognized professional accounting credential (such as CPA, CMA, CIA, CFE); or 3. Hold a post bacc alaureate degree (such as MBA, MS, MA, JD) from an approved, AACSB -accredited US university with a minimum 3.0 GPA in graduate course work. Candidates for the Master of Accountancy degree who have an undergraduate degree in accounting must successfully com plete a minimum of 30 graduate credits. Qualifying NMSU undergraduate accounting students can apply to have two graduate courses count for their undergraduate program as well as their graduate program. Candidates with an undergraduate degree in a field oth er than accounting must complete additional prerequisite work dependent upon previous courses taken. In any case, all candidates must present or fulfill the following requirements: Foundation Courses These courses are required of every student unless they can be waived. As a general policy, the courses upon which waivers are claimed must have been taken within seven years of enrollment in the program with a grade of B or better.

Three graduate degrees are available: (1) Master of Arts, (2) Specialist in Education and (3) Doctor of Phil osophy. The CEP Dept. offers a Counseling Program which leads to a Master of Arts in Counseling and Guidance. The program is accredited by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP). It prepares professional counselors to perform mental health counseling in agencies, hospitals, private practice and schools. Successful completion of the Counseling Program qualifies students to pursue licensure as clinical mental health counselors with the New Mexico Counseling and T herapy Practice Board and licensure as school counselors with the New Mexico Department of Education. The 60- credit counseling curriculum requires two years full time or three years part time study on campus, and covers the following areas: human developme nt; appraisal; planning; addictions; research; and professional issues. Specialized training and supervised experience is offered in mental health agencies, h ospitals and in schools. The CEP Dept. offers a School Psychology Program that leads to an Educational Specialists (Ed. S.) degree in School Psychology. The program has national approval through the National Association of School Psychologists. The program provides additional education beyond the M.A. to prepare professionals for licensure as school psychologists in New Mexico and throughout the United States. The School Psychology Program prepares its candidates to work with preschoolers, children, adolesc ents, and families. The various settings where School Psychologists are employed include public schools and other organizations that require advanced assessment, counseling, consultation and other interventions. The program trains its candidates to serve s tudents with diverse educational, psychological and emotional needs from various backgrounds. Such training also includes working with all school personnel to help make education a positive and rewarding experience for their students. Students admitted to the School Psychology Program also have the opportunity to achieve a Masters degree in Counseling & Guidance with a specialization in Educational Diagnostics on the way to obtaining the specialist degree. Students would need to complete additional curricul ar and field experiences and degree requirements. The CEP Dept. offers a doctoral Counseling Psychology Program that leads to a Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology. The program is accredited by the American Psychological Association (for more information on th is accreditation contact the Office of Program Consultation and Accreditation, APA, 750 1st Street, NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202.336.5979). The program is based on the scientist - practitioner model through which both research and service delivery skills ar e acquired. Graduates of the program are prepared to conduct research, provide service, teach and supervise. The program prepares students for licensure as psychologists. The three goals of the program are to: 1. Produce well -trained generalists in applied psychology capable of competently utilizing a wide variety of assessments, modalities and types of interventions, and in disseminating psychological information. 2. Nurture active learners and critical/scientific thinkers capable of integrative thinking, application of theory, hypothesis generation, and self -reflection. 3. To develop in students a contextual understanding of psychology and the environments in which they work and live so as to produce culturally- responsive, developmentally -aware, and streng ths-based psychology professionals. CEP faculty conducts periodic reviews of students' progress in the programs, including their academic performance, counseling and psychoeducational skills, professionalism, and ethics. An interview is required as part of the review. Deficits identified through faculty reviews may result in recommendations that students engage in remedial work or that they pursue alternative career goals. For information on admission procedures and requirements of degree programs in Counseling and Educational Psychology, contact the department office. Test scores on the Graduate Record Examination (aptitude) are required of all applicants. Other requirements include but are not limited to the following: application and fee, official transc ripts, three letters of recommendation, curriculum vita or resume, letter of intent and/or statement of purpose and list of completed upper -division and/or graduate course work related to counseling, school psychology, or counseling psychology.

Course work in the graduate program includes: water and wastewater treatment, solid and hazardous waste systems design, environmental chemi stry, environmental microbiology, environmental contaminant analysis, industrial pollution control, fate and transport of pollutants in engineered and natural systems and water quality in surface water and groundwater systems. Additional topics of interest to the students are covered through special topics classes and by courses taught outside of the College of Engineering. ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINE ERING M.S. PROGRAM The M.S. program requires either a thesis or a no n-thesis practice oriented experience. The non- thesis option is designed for students that are working full time in engineering practice, but is also available to other students interested in pursuing a non- thesis option. The thesis option consists of a mi nimum of 30 semester credit hours, including 6 credit hours of thesis. Students who are working full time in engineering practice may apply for the non -thesis option. This option consists of 30 semester credit hours of which up to 3 credit hours can be awa rded for a professional engineering design experience (ENVE 590) and up to 6 credit hours can be awarded for an engineering practicum (ENVE 598). Transfer credit for courses taken elsewhere is evaluated on an individual basis. Up to six semester hours of graduate level courses taken may be used to satisfy M.S. degree requirements provided that the credits were not used toward another degree. Required Curriculum The graduate environmental engineering program of the CAGE department expects all M.S. and Ph.D. students to meet certain requirements in pursuit of an advanced degree. Some of these requirements are related to the quantity, level, and quality of coursework. This Graduate Catalog details what is expected as a minimum for graduation, but it is up to th e student and his/her advisor and graduate committee to determine the plan of study for the student. The student and his/her advisor will create this program of study in the first semester of graduate work. Students desiring to work toward an advanced degr ee in environmental engineering must have completed undergraduate preparation similar to that required for a Bachelor of Science degree in an ABET accredited engineering program or must have adequate background, as determined by the graduate faculty of the program. The program administrator will approve exceptions to these requirements. The environmental engineering faculty will form a committee for every entering student. The faculty will evaluate the student's record and determine which deficiencies and/o r core courses, if any, are needed by the student. For all professional non -thesis programs, the department head will review the committee's decision. In order to provide consistency among plans of study for graduate students and to set a minimum set of co re or pertinent courses, it is the policy of the graduate environmental engineering program that each graduate student will fulfill the following course requirements (or equivalent).
