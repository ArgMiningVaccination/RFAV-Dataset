Below is a list of six immune-boosting nutrients and the different foods they can be found in, recommended by [Nicklaus Children's Hospital's #GiveMe5 program](/medical-services/food-and-nutrition/giveme5). Try mixing and matching different foods to ensure you receive the necessary nutrients to keep your immune system strong and healthy. Top Six Immune-Boosting Nutrients - Beta Carotene is an antioxidant that converts to vitamin A in your body. Vitamin A helps regulate the immune system and protects against infections by keeping skin and tissues healthy in the mouth, stomach, intestines and respiratory system. Vitamin A is found in plant foods such as sweet potatoes, carrots, broccoli, spinach, red bell peppers, apricots, eggs or foods labeled \"vitamin A fortified,\" such as milk or some cereals. - Vitamin C helps protect from infection by stimulating the formation of antibodies and boosting immunity. Foods rich in Vitamin C include citrus fruits such as oranges, grapefruit and tangerines, bell peppers, melons, papaya, berries, tomatoes, broccoli, or fortified cereals. - Zinc helps the immune system work properly and promote wound healing. Zinc tends to be better absorbed from animal sources such as milk, seafood, poultry and lean meats but can also be found in whole grain products, wheat germ, beans, tofu, seeds and nuts. - Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals and improves immune function. Foods rich in vitamin E include sunflower seeds, avocados, almonds, vegetable oils (such as sunflower or safflower oil), hazelnuts, peanut butter and fortified cereals. - Probiotics are \"good\" bacteria that promote gut health. They can be found in cultured dairy products such as yogurt and in fermented foods such as kimchi. - Protein plays a role in the body's immune system, especially in healing and recovery. Protein comes from both animal and plant-based sources, such as milk, yogurt, eggs, beef, poultry, seafood, nuts, seeds, beans and lentils. Nutrition is always important, especially in stressful times because stress can weaken our immune system. While we all have an inborn ability to withstand a reasonable amount of stress, let's commit to making better food choices together because they have profound impacts on our health.
