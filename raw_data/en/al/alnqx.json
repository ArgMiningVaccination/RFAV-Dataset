Two people both have similar symptoms of acid reflux. One person is possibly due to the inherent cold condition in the digestive system while the other person is due to excess heat in the stomach. These two people are told to have different body types. Traditional Chinese medicine focuses on balancing Yin and Yang energies within the body. Its ultimate goal is to reach optimal balance. Optimal balance leads to good overall health, whether it is physical, mental, emotional or spiritual. Once body has to reach the peak of its ultimate balance, it is considered healthy and this prevents illness and disease. According to traditional Chinese medicine, each individual is born with a certain body type and each organ is either Yin or Yang dominated. Our body type determines how we live and behave and how we deal with diseases and bacteria. As human beings, we try to balance Yin and Yang energies through our dietary guidelines. This means that our body works to balance the energies through the foods we prefer. The downside here is that sometimes, the energies in our bodies are so uneven and off balance that the diets we think are beneficial to us are actually hurting our health, which is why we have to be aware of our body type and the foods we need to harmonize our organs. There are different body constitutions in traditional Chinese medicine: - Yang/Hot Yin Deficient Sturdy Body Susceptible to hot temperatures Dry mouth Reddish complexion Easily irritated Insomnia Dark urine Hard Stools Red tongue with yellowish coating Prefer cold meals and beverages - Yin/Cold Yang Deficient Individuals have a frail body Usually feel cold Tend not to be sociable Pale or white complexion Clear Urine Soft Stools/Diarrhea Punk and bulky tongue Prefer hot meals and beverage Susceptible to cold temperatures - Phlegm/Damp Individuals have tend to be overweight Bloated due to retention of water Tire easily, often sleepy during the day Tend to snore while sleeping Low metabolism Moist tongue covered in greasy coating Sensitive to damp weather - Dry Individuals tend to be thin Difficult to put on weight Often feel thirsty Dry eyes, throat, lips and skin Often suffer from itchy skin, nose and eyes Prone to having constipation Sensitive to low levels of humidity - Neutral Appear to be healthy with skin color Don't have any of the above complaints Have proper appetite and sleep patterns Don't feel hot or cold easily Have normal urine and stools Tongue appears normal It's important to know that, sometimes, people have a mixed physical constitution. For example, someone can be cold and dry or damp and hot. Because of this, diets have to be individualized depending on someone's exact body type. "}
