Vaccines against dangerous diseases have saved millions of pets and nearly eliminated some fatal diseases that were once widespread. Unfortunately, many infectious diseases continue to pose a significant threat to unvaccinated cats. Pet Vaccinations We recognize that your pet is unique and that no single vaccine program will be ideal for every pet in every circumstance. [Forest Hills Cat Hospital's staff](https://foresthillscathospital.com/veterinarian-middle-village-ny/) is knowledgeable about veterinary vaccines, and our goal is to provide you with the best advice for keeping your pet healthy. Pet Vaccinations There are numerous vaccines available for use in dogs and cats, but not every pet requires every available vaccine. Some vaccines are considered core vaccines and should be given to all pets, whereas others are optional and may be given to pets based on a variety of factors, such as their risk of disease exposure. Vaccine recommendations may also change over the course of a pet's life as travel habits and other factors change. All of these factors will be taken into account when determining which vaccines your pet should receive. Panleukopenia (feline distemper), feline herpesvirus type I, feline calicivirus, and rabies are the most important vaccines for cats. They shield your cat from serious health problems. Depending on your cat's lifestyle, you may also want to get her vaccinated against the feline leukemia virus. During your feline's visit, we'll talk about his or her lifestyle and decide which vaccines he or she needs. To keep your cat safe, [your veterinarian](https://foresthillscathospital.com/veterinarian-middle-village-ny/) at Forest Hills Cat Hospital may recommend one or more of the following vaccines: Feline distemper (FVRCP) This is a combination vaccine that protects against feline viral rhinotracheitis, calicivirus, and panleukopenia, all of which are highly contagious and can result in severe disease and death. It is critical to keep your cat's distemper vaccination up to date. This vaccine is given to kittens in a series of three or four vaccines and then to adult cats every one to three years. Rabies Rabies is a preventable viral disease of mammals that is most commonly transmitted through a rabid animal's bite. The virus infects the central nervous system, resulting in brain disease and death. [Our veterinarians](https://foresthillscathospital.com/veterinarian-middle-village-ny/) at Forest Hills Cat Hospital recommend giving this vaccine to cats once a year. Feline leukemia (FeLV) Cats are commonly infected with the feline leukemia virus. It is the direct or indirect cause of more cat deaths than any other organism and is widespread in the cat population. This vaccine is given to kittens in two doses and then to adult cats once a year. Veterinary Services at Forest Hills Cat Hospital Pet Diagnostic Imaging Pet Worms, Fleas, and Other Parasites "}
