Takeda foundation day On Founder's Day, we recognize the unwavering philosophy of Takeda since 1781 - to work with integrity and always put patients first. In 1781, Takeda founder, Chobei I, began selling traditional Japanese and Chinese herbal medicines in Doshomachi, the medicine district of Osaka, Japan. He soon gained a reputation for business integrity and quality products and services. These values and characteristics have continued through the years and have become embedded in our uncompromising corporate philosophy, which still guides us today. 1781 Founding Over two centuries ago in 1781, 32-year-old Chobei Takeda I started a business selling traditional Japanese and Chinese medicines in Doshomachi, Osaka, the center of the medicine trade in Japan. His small shop bought medicines from wholesalers, then divided them into smaller batches and sold them to local medicine merchants and doctors. This was the beginning of the present-day Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. 1852 Chobei III to build a new home In April 1852, Chobei III demolished the old mansion in the southeast of Doshomachi Nakabashisuji and built a new home and a warehouse. These buildings lasted approximately 75 years until the construction of the head office building started in 1927. 1871 Import of Western medicines begin Chobei Takeda IV led other medicine retailers in turning his attention to Western medicine. He formed a cooperative union for purchasing Western medicines in Yokohama and began transactions with foreign trading companies. Western medicines imported at the time included quinine, an anti-malaria drug, and phenol, an anti-cholera drug. Takeda began direct imports from England, the U.S., Germany, Spain and other countries around 1895, and in 1907 obtained exclusive sales rights in Japan for products from the German company Bayer. Thus, the business that began as a shop selling old-fashioned Japanese and Chinese remedies steadily increased its selection of Western medicines, before shifting its basic orientation toward this kind of medicine. 1895 Pharmaceutical manufacturing business launched In 1895, the Company acquired Uchibayashi Drug Works to establish its own factory in Osaka and became a pharmaceutical manufacturer. Products such as bismuth subgallate (an antidiarrheal agent) and quinine hydrochloride were produced at this factory. In 1907, the Company became the first company in Japan to produce saccharin. 1914 Research activities begin with establishment of a research division In 1914, a research division is established. Around this time when the import from Germany has ended due to the World War I, Takeda began sales of its own products. Among these were Calmotin\u00ae(a sedative), Novoroform\u00ae(an analgesic) and Lodinon\u00ae(an injectable form of D-glucose). Takeda steadily expanded its pharmaceutical business and even began exports to the U.S., Russia and China. 1915 Takeda Pharmaceutical Company was established Soon after starting producing its own products, the testing division was formed. The research division, which researched and developed new pharmaceutical products, was also formed in 1915. The R&D system formed during this period became the foundation which lead to the growth of Takeda. 1920 Enhancements to the Takeda Store In 1920, the store was renovated and the roads in the roads in Doshomachi were also widened and wooden block pavements were laid. 1925 Incorporated as Chobei Takeda & Co., Ltd.
