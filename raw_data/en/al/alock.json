Optimizing operational efficiency through automation leads to lower running costs, the elimination of errors inherent in manual processes, a reduction in repetitive motion injuries, and improved accuracy and reliability of data. Laboratory workflows can be classified into three categories: manual, stand-alone automation (i.e., modular), and total lab automation (TLA). Size, complexity, and testing volumes are key factors in determining the best approach to automating a lab, and a properly designed business case outlining the long-term cost savings and growth capacity is critical to ensure sustained value.
