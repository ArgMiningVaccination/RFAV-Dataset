Soldiers, like you, have volunteered to serve and fight to protect their Families and friends from enemies that sought to do us harm, and to defend the ideals of our nation. We gain strength from training, and the basis for our training stems from a past deeply rooted in determination and adaptability. From the beginning American Soldiers were brave and fought with determination but were at a military disadvantage when fighting against highly trained and better organized British and Hessians Soldiers. To win the Revolutionary War, General George Washington's Army needed training, discipline, and esprit de corps. Seeking a solution, General Washington tasked Baron von Steuben with transforming the large group of hungry and exhausted men at Valley Forge into a disciplined fighting force. In the harsh Pennsylvania winter, Baron von Steuben The \"Blue Book\" 10 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 instructed a company of future leaders in basic military movements and tactical skills; those individuals were the predecessors of our Drill Sergeants! He developed that cadre until they could , in turn, train the entire Revolutionary Army in the art of basic military maneuvers. Through their perseverance and sense of duty, these dedicated troops achieved the hig hest standards. As a result, Washington's men fought skillfully and demonstrated the discipline of a professional Army. Ultimately, the Army won the Revolutionary war and independence after 8 years of fighting. Training to standard and developing the commitment to adapt and overcome adversity became the hallmark of the American Soldier. Baron von Steuben, by then the Army Inspector General, wrote the Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States \u2014now commonly referred to as the Blue Book \u2014an instructional guide for future generations. This book consists, of detailed training procedures, the standards of military conduct, and the fundamentals every Soldier needs to know. Use this version of the TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 often referred to as the \"Blue Book\" on the journey on which you are about to undertake. Just as Soldiers before you trained to serve and protect our Nation, this book will help you to learn, train and perform the tasks required of you to become Soldiers in the U.S. Army. 11 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Chapter 1 - The Army On 14 June 1775, the Second Continental Congress established \"the American Continental Army.\" The U.S. Army is the senior Service of the Armed Forces. As one of the oldest American institutions, it predates the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. For almost two and a half centuries, Army forces have protected this Nation. Our Army flag is ado rned with over 189 campaign and battle streamers to date, each one signifying great sacrifices on behalf of the Nation. The Army's mission is to fight and win the N ations wars through prompt and sustained land combat, as part of the joint force. 1-1. Why we have an Army It is the intent of Congress to provide an Army that is capable, in conjunction with the other armed forces, of... 12 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Preserving the peace and security, and providing for the defense of the United States, the Commonwealths and possessions, and any areas occupied by the United States; Supporting the national policies; Implementing the national objectives; and Overcoming any nations responsible for aggressive acts that imperil the peace and security of the United States. Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 3062(a) 13 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Figure 1- 1. Army timeline 14 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Figure 1- 2. Army timeline - 1775 to present 15 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 1-2. What the Army uniform represents Army uniform includes those designed for formal occasions, duty within an office or in garrison, and for tactical training and operations. Wearing the uniform of a U.S. Army Soldier is an honor and a privilege which must be earned. When we take our Oath of Service and are authorized to wear the uniform we incur a sacred obligation to live by and uphold the moral princ iples of the Army Ethic and perform our duty professionally. For Army Families, the uniform is a source of both pride and sacrifice. 16 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Living by and upholding the Army Ethic is our life -long commitment. For our veterans, it represents one of the most import ant periods of their lives...pride in honorable service, accomplishments as part of a team, and a life- long connection to the comrades with whom they served, and in some cases, lost during their time in uniform. When Soldiers return to society as private cit izens, they are expected to continue to be moral -ethical role models for their Families and communities, contributing to the well - being of the United States of America, as Soldiers for Life. For the American people, Soldiers are their sons, daughters, relatives, and neighbors. In us they see patriotism , honorable service, and courage. Being seen as defenders of our freedoms you are expected to earn and sustain the trust of our society. People around the world recognize the American Soldier as a symbol of t he United States and its values , democracy, and a commitment to defend the right of all people to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. To our enemies, the Soldier represents American strength, resolve, and a commitment to defend the values that we hold dear as a Nation. 1-3. Why we serve As Soldiers, we are committed to do our duty to contribute to the \"common defense;\" we share a love of our country and of our Army Family; we defend American values that frame the nation as expressed in the Declaration of 17 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Independence and the Constitution of the United States; and we serve \"not to promote war, but to preserve peace.\" 1-4. The Army's Motto - \"This We'll Defend\" The Army's motto remains as relevant today as it did at our Nation's founding. The pronoun \"We\" reinforces our collective team effort and \"Defend\" remains our Army's main mission. The Army continues this pledge into the future, as we have done since 1775. Department of the Army Emblem 18 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 1-5. Oath of Enlistment Figure 1-3. Army Oath of Enli stment Members of the American Armed Services swear or affirm to support and defend the Constitution of the United States \u2014not a leader, people, government, or territory. That solemn oath ties service in the Army directly to the founding document of the United States. The oath expresses a noble calling to honorable service on behalf of the American people. We serve because we believe America must be defended by a Professional Army of Soldiers and Army Civilians who are inspired to honorably fulfill their Oaths of Service. We accomplish our missions as a team, partnering with the other armed forces in the joint community and with government services that dedicate themselves t o defending the U.S. Constitution and protect the Nation's interests, at home and abroad, against all threats.\" 19 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 20 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Chapter 2 - The Army as a Profession 2-1. The Army Profession Our shared identity, as trusted Army professionals , derives from our shared understanding of and respect for those whose legacy we celebrate. We honor this cherished inheritance in our customs, courtesies, and traditions. Units and organizations preserve their storied histories and proudly display distinc tive emblems (regimental colors, crests, insignia, patches, and mottos). The campaign streamers on the Army flag remind us of our history of honorable service to the Nation. These symbols recall the sacrifices and preserve the ties with those who preceded us. Figure 2- 1. Army Profession 21 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 The essential Characteristics of the Army profession: Trust Military Expertise, Honorable Service, Stewardship and Esprit de Corps. Our Army Profession includes two mutually supporting communities of practice\u2014 The Profess ion of Arms, Soldiers of the Regular Army, Army National Guard, and U.S. Army Reserve. The Army Civilian Corps, composed of civilian professionals serving in the Department of the Army. Profession of Arms: Uniformed members of the Army Profession \u2014Soldiers. This includes the Regular Army, Army National Guard, and U.S. Army Reserve. The Army Ethic: The heart of the Army and the inspiration for our shared professional identity - Who we are and why and how we serve. It motivates and guides our conduct as Soldiers and Army Civilians who are bound together with the Army Culture of trust in common moral purpose. 2-2. What it means to be a Soldier Soldiers are trusted profession als of character, competence, and commitment. The Army is an honored profession, founded on the bedrock of trust - trust among leaders, peers, and subordinates; between Soldiers and Army Civilians; trust in the Army professionals, and their families; and trust between the A rmy and the American people. By our solemn oath, we are morally committed to support and defend the Constitution. This duty requires a foundation of trust with the American people who grant us autonomy to 22 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 use lethal force on their behalf, only because we h ave earned their trust. Army professionals understand and accept that they may give their lives and justly take the lives of others to accomplish the mission. The moral implications of this realization compel essential bonds of mutual trust within cohesive teams. The Nation tasks the Army to do many things besides combat operations, but ultimately, the mission of the U.S. Army is to fight and win our Nation's wars through prompt and sustained land combat as part of the joint force. The Army and each of its members must maintain the readiness to accomplish this mission, now and in the future. Once a Soldier, always a Soldier...A Soldier for Life. 2-3. Who we are not Army Professionals do not engage in or tolerate acts of misconduct or unethical decisions. Soldiers do not lie, cheat, or steal or treat others and their property with disrespect. Actions such as sexual harassment , sexual assault, and hazing are dishonorable and violate the Army Values and Army Ethic while destroying trust, unit cohesion, and es prit de corps. One incident is one too many. Sexual harassment is a form of gender discrimination that involves unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Sexual assault is a CRIME and c an result in a felony offense. Sexual assault is defined as intentional sexual contact, characterized by use of force, threats, intimidation or abuse of authority, or when the victim does not or cannot consent. Sexual assault includes rape, forcible sodomy and 23 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 other unwanted sexual contact that is aggravated, abusive, or wrongful or attempts to commit these acts. This includes touching of the breasts, buttocks, genitalia or any other part of the body to satisfy sexual desires. During training, there is no such thing as a consensual relationship. Hazing is defined as any conduct whereby one military member or employee, regardless of Service or rank, unnecessarily causes another military member or employee, regardless of Service or rank, to suffer or be exposed to an activity that is cruel, abusive, or harmful. Bullying is the use of force, threat, or coercion to abuse intimidate, or aggressively dominate others. The behavior is often repeated and habitual. 2-4. The Army's commitment to you Our commitment to you is to help guide you on this journey from an aspiring member of t he Army Profession to a Soldier who is certified in character, competence, and commitment. We are committed to providing you with a safe and secure environment where everyone can live, t rain, and learn, while developing into Soldiers of...

Acculturated with Army Values, the Soldier's Creed, and Army history. Who is a trusted mem ber of the Army team Committed to serving the Army and nation Who is physically fit, mentally capable, and committed to serve as a trusted member of a team in their first unit of assignment. 2-5. The journey begins When you took the Oath of Enlistment, you became a member of the Army Profession, albeit an aspiring professional. 25 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 The task at hand is to develop and certify you in Character, Competence, and Commitment. The responsibility for each individual's development and certification is a mutual one, a trusted bond, shared between you, your leaders, and the Army. The first certification in becoming an Army Professional includes the knowledge and skills to serve as a trusted Soldier in your first unit of assignment. 2-6. Army Values Figure 2- 2. Army Values 26 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Our ethical and moral foundation as Soldiers are soli dified in the seven Army Values : Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage. They are at the core of who we are as individuals, as Soldiers, as Professionals and as Americans. Whether on or off-duty, Soldiers live these values every day. The easiest way to remember the Army Values is through the acronym \"LDRSHIP\" . LOYALTY : Bear true faith and allegiance to the U.S. Constitution, the Army, your unit, and other Soldiers. Bearing true faith and allegiance is living up to your sworn oath. Believing in and dedicating yourself to the United States of America and the U.S. Army. A loyal Soldier is one who supports his or her leader and stands up for fellow Soldiers. Bu t your loyalty to the Nation and the Army exceeds any bonds of affiliation you may feel toward any Soldier or leader. DUTY : Fulfill your obligations. A duty is a legal or moral obligation to do what should be done without being told to do it. Doing your duty means accomplishing all assigned tasks to the best of your ability and contributing to mission success as part of a team. Duty also requires you to work hard every day to make right decisions and take the right actions, while continuously striving for excellence. Everyone in our Army contributes to the mission if they do their duty in the right way. 27 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 RESPECT : Treat people as you yourself would want to be treated. Respect allows us to appreciate the best in other people. Soldiers treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, creed or religious beliefs. Self -respect is also a vital ingredient and is a result from knowing you have put forth your best effort. Treating others with respect builds trust and unit cohes ion. The Army is one team, and all contribute best when they are treated with respect. SELFLESS SERVICE: Put the welfare of the Nation, the Army, and your subordinates before your own. In honorably serving your country, you are doing your duty loyally without thought of recognition, reward, or personal gain. Selfless service is the commitment of each team member to go a little further, endure a little longer, and look a little closer to see how he or she can add to the team effort without thought of per sonal gain or self -interest. HONOR : Live up to the Army Ethic and Army Values. As Army professionals we live by and uphold the moral principles of the Army Ethic in all aspects of life. An honorable Soldier is a trusted member of the Army profession. Honor means being truthful in your word and deed, demonstrating your character, competence, and commitment in honorable service. It is always doing what you know is right even when no one is looking. 28 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 INTEGRITY : Do what's right, legally and morally. Integri ty is a quality of character you develop by adhering to the moral principles of the Army Ethic. Once lost, it is the hardest to recover. It requires complete honesty in your words and actions, avoiding deceptions, being sincere, and candid. As your integri ty strengthens, so does the trust others place in you. Trust is the most important essential characteristic of the Army Profession. The more choices you make based on integrity, the more this highly prized value will characterize your relationships with Family and friends, and finally, define you as a person and a Soldier. Your reputation is based on your personal integrity. PERSONAL COURAGE : Face and overcome fear, danger, or adversity (physical or moral). Personal courage has long been associated with our Army. Courage is a matter of enduring physical duress and at times risking personal safety. We lead by example and do what is right despite risk, uncertainty, and fear. Facing fear or adversity may require continuing forward on the right path, especiall y if taking those actions are not popular with others. We realize that we may be harmed in performing our duty and accomplishing the mission. You can build your personal courage by daily standing up for and acting upon the things that you know are right. Note: Information identified by a \"star\" requires memorization. 29 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 2-7. The Soldier's Creed The Soldier's Creed I am an American Soldier. I am a warrior and a member of a team. I serve the people of the United States and live the Army Values. I will always place the mission first. I will never accept defeat. I will never quit. I will never leave a fallen comrade. I am disciplined, physically and mentally tough, trained and proficient in my Warrior tasks and drills. I always maintain my arms, my equipment and myself. I am an expert and I am a professional. I stand ready to deploy, engage, and destroy the enemies of the United States of America in close combat. I am a guardian of freedom and the American way of life. I am an American Soldier. Figure 2-3. Army Creed 30 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 2-8. Expectations for Army Soldiers and Leaders a.

A curious scou t looking behind doors and underneath tarps on patrol. They have an edge in combat because they see bad things before they happen. 31 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 f. American Soldiers are c onfident. Confident in themselves, at their job, with their weapon, in their teammates and their unit. g. American Soldiers act with disciplined initiative. Soldiers do the right thing even when no one is looking. Soldiers do not sit and wait for orders. They determine what needs to be done and do it without being told. Soldiers follow SOPs and orde rs but are smart enough to see when the plan is failing; no longer fits the situation or the enemy is presenting an opportunity; smart enough to come up with a new plan that will work and have the guts enough to do it. h. Army Leaders lead by personal ex ample. They share risks and hardships with their Soldiers. They lead by the concepts of mission command, mission orders and commander's intent to empower the disciplined initiative of their troops. They carefully plan, in advance, but stay flexible in exec ution. They are not afraid to take measured risks or to act decisively when the situation is uncertain. i. Army Leaders are responsible and accountable for their decisions, their troops, and their equipment. j. Army Leaders know that , foremost , they must train their Soldiers to fight, win, and come home alive. They know, \"the more we sweat in peace, the less we bleed in war.\" They know we do have to practice being operationally effective in miserable conditions and we will fight just like we have traine d. k. Army Leaders ensure their unit is secure, postured, and ready to move or fight on short notice. They check security before bedding down. They are never surprised by 32 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 the enemy because they take precautions to prevent surprise. 33 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Chapter 3 - The Reception Battalion 3-1. The Path Welcome to the r eception battalion. By being here, this means that you have met your initial entry qualificat ion requirements. While at the m ilitary entrance processing station (MEPS) you underwent a battery of aptitude tests and medical examinations to determine if you were qualified for military service. Congratulations, you passed! You've been vetted mentally, physically, and intellectually, by passing the Occupational Physical Assessment Test (OPAT), and the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB). You know what your future military occupational specialty (MOS) - in order words, what your job will be, and qualified for that job by taking and passing the OPAT, and were sworn into the U.S. Army. Now i t's time for you to begin the transformation to becoming a Soldier. You are at one of the following BCT/ OSUT locations: Fort Benning, Georgia Fort Jackson, South Carolina Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri Fort Sill, Oklahoma If your MOS is 11B/11C (Infantryman), 19D (Cavalry Scout), 19K (Armor Crewman), 12B (Combat Engineer) or 31B (Military Police Officer), you will conduct your BCT and occupational skills training in one course. This is called \"One Station Unit Training\" or \"OSUT\" and is conducted at Fort 34 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Benni ng for 11B and 19K Soldiers, and at Fort Leonard Wood for 12B and 31B Soldiers. All other Soldiers will go through BCT at one of the four locations listed above, and upon completion, will attend a follow -on course called \"Advanced Individual Training\" or \"AIT.\" This course may be at the same installation as your BCT training or may be at another location. At the successful completion of OSUT or AIT, you will be awarded your MOS and have a base understanding of character, competence, and commitment as a trusted Army professional and Soldier for Life. While at the r eception battalion, you will undergo further medical and dental processing. Medical and dental processing will include collection of blood for certain immunities, type, and deoxyri bonucleic acid (k nown as DNA ); hearing and vision exams (in addition to the MEPS exams); pregnancy screening; tuberculosis screening; immunizations; and a brief dental exam and x -rays. You will receive ear plugs, eyewear and eye protection, and personal protective items such as sunscreen. These are all items of \"individual medical readiness\" that you will maintain throughout your career. You will also undergo further administrative processing (personnel and finance records, and security clearance if applicable). You will re ceive a standard military haircut, be issued your initial clothing requirement, to inc lude physical fitness and Army c ombat uniforms (ACUs), footwear and miscellaneous clothing items. You will be taught how to properly wear the 35 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 clothing issued and begin to learn the basics of military culture. Your actions and ability to follow instructions will be monitored carefully. A drill sergeant or cadre member will take you through the stations required for you to enter into the Army. Follow all instructions and pay attention to detail. One of the key elements to being successful in the Army is ensuring you understand what is required of you and ask questions if you are unsure. A typical stay in the reception battalion lasts from 3- 5 days for BCT Soldiers and 5 -7 day s for OSUT Soldiers. When you complete reception in- processing, you will be assigned to a training company. Drill s ergeants will pick you up at the r eception battalion and travel with you to your BCT or OSUT company location. Eagle Cash Stored Value Card: While at the reception battalion, you will be issued a Stored Value Card which has a value of $350.00, your initial advance of pay. The stored value card reduces cash/check operations. The card can be used at the Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) sites (barber shops, clothing sales, and Post Exchange facilities). Any remaining value at expiration is returned to the Soldier; however, spending the full amount prior to completion of training is encouraged because t he Stored Value Card will expire 45 days from initial issue date. 36 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 3-2. Critical information needed upfront During your stay at the reception battalion, BCT or OSUT, you will be expected to read, study, and memorize necessary information. The purpose of the information is to introduce and reinforce who we are as Army Professionals and what we represent as Soldiers. Your job is to fully understand, comprehend and demonstrate your proficiency by reciting it to the drill sergeant and leaders either individually or as a group. 3-3. The Battle B uddy System Soldiers rely on one another to stay motivated and reach peak performance. Although required in Initial Military Training, Soldiers will form natural bonds with their fellow Soldiers as part of Army culture. To contribute to this team spirit, we live by the buddy system. A buddy team is usually defined as two Soldiers (same g ender) in the same unit who look after each other at all times. By getting to know other Soldiers on a professional and personal level, you learn how to improve yourself an d encourage others. Working together, you and your battle buddy learn initiative, responsibility, trust, and dependability. While at the r eception battalion, BCT or OSUT, same - gender Soldiers (male -male and female -female) are placed in buddy teams. With the requirement to excel in Army training, some Soldiers need more positive reinforcement than others. For that reason, you may also be paired based 37 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 on your strengths, so you and your buddy can complement each other's weaknesses. Battle buddy responsibilitie s: Never leave your buddy alone Never let your buddy go into an office or room by themselves ; even if a drill sergeant, or i nstructor says it's okay (If it happens, report it) Keep your buddy safe and free from harm Know the whereabouts of your buddy at all times Pass information to your buddy Encourage and support your buddy to train harder and do better Help your buddy solve problems Inform Cadre of any changes in your buddy's behavior In the end, the most rewarding part of the buddy system is making every Soldier your buddy; for any one of them could help you accomplish your mission or save your life. 3-4. Suicide prevention Everyone has the power and responsibility to protect Soldiers on and off the battlefield. This includes recognizing uncharacteri stic and suicidal behaviors. Effective suicide prevention requires everyone in the unit to be aware of the risk factors for suicide and know how to respond. Commanders, noncommissioned officers ( NCOs ), supervisors and battle buddies must lead the way. 38 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 If a Soldier seems suicidal, the time to take action is NOW. Talk to the Soldier before it is too late. What to look for: Warning s igns Distress can lead to the development of unhealthy behaviors. People closest to the Soldier (fellow Soldiers, family, and friends) are in the best position to recognize changes due to distress and to provide support. Look For : Comments that suggest thoughts or plans of suicide Rehearsal of suicidal acts Giving away possessions Obsession with death and dying Uncharacteristic behaviors Significant change in performance Appearing overwhelmed by recent stressor(s) Depressed mood; hopelessness Withdrawal from social activities Sleep difficulties Transitional periods Medical, behavioral, or disciplinary problems 3-5. Warrior Ethos The Warrior Ethos \u2014within the Soldier's Creed\u2014 describes a Soldier's selfless commitment to the nation, the mission, and fellow Soldiers. 39 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 All Soldiers are warriors \u2014prepared, trained and fully equipped for war. Soldiers defeat the enemy in close combat, resol ve conflict, and then restore the peace. They are also part of a team, bound to each other by integrity and trust. As Soldiers, you will always be under some level of physical and mental stress, regardless of your rank or specialty. Living by the Soldier's Creed and Warrior Ethos provides the inner strength and motivation you need to continue performing your duty and executing your mission. 3-6. The BCT/OSUT/AIT \"Golden Rules\" #1 DO NOT bully, haze, assault or harass a fellow Soldier DO help and assist your teammate #2 DO NOT use vulgar language, rude gestures or discriminate against others DO treat everyone with dignity and respect #3 DO NOT kiss, attempt to kiss or touch a fellow Soldier DO respect your teammate's personal space #4 DO NOT steal or take something that does not belong to you DO build trust with teammates through your ethical and disciplined actions #5 DO NOT go anywhere without your battle buddy DO report violations of policies and regulations to your platoon and com pany leadership 40 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 This page intentionally blank. 41 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Chapter 4 - BCT/OSUT/AIT 4-1. What to expect All phases of training develop character, competence, and commitment while instilling discipline . Training r einforce s the Army Values, improve s physical conditioning, and teach es basic combat and occupational skills. All of these contribute in the development of your individual skills and knowledge, resulting in a Soldier capable of serving as a member of a team in your first unit of assignment. BCT/OSUT/AIT are training courses that transform civilians into Soldiers. Over the course of a number of weeks you develop character, competence, and com mitment and earn the right to be called a Soldiers. BCT - 10 weeks 11B/C (Infantryman) OSUT - 22 weeks 12B (Combat Engineer) OSUT - 14 we eks 19D (Cavalry Scout) OSUT - 22 weeks 19K (Armor Crewman) OSUT - 22 weeks 31B (Military Police Officer) OSUT - 19 weeks, 1 day AIT - Varies by Military Occupational Specialty In the future ALL OSUT training may extend to 22 weeks in length to increase lethality . 42 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 4-2. The training company - Your unit Upon arrival to your training company, the drill sergeants and cadre will in- process you and assign you to a platoon, normally a group of 60 Trainees and three drill s ergeants comprise a platoon size element . Your drill sergeants are a mix of highly qualified male and female NCOs with 5- 15 years of experience in the Army. The c ompany commander (c aptain) is in charge of the company. The commander establishes policy and has legal discipline authority over you and all assigned company personnel. The platoon leader is responsible for accomplishing the platoon's training mission. The f irst sergeant (1SG), who is the master trainer , assists the commander and supervises the dr ill sergeants and other Soldiers and C ivilians assigned to the company. There are typically 12 drill sergeants assigned to the company. They are responsible for the training and testing you receive. You will also see a supply sergeant (could be a civilian) who is responsible for the linen, pillows, cleaning supplies and the work orders needed to maintain the company. The training NCO or training officer/ executive officer is responsible for updating and maintaining training records and the coordination of ea ch day's training events. 43 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 4-3. Separate and s ecure environment The Army provides a safe living and learning environment for all Soldiers. When you arrive at your company you will notice security measures established to protect you and your battle buddies. Alarms are placed on exterior doors and those doors that separate male and female Soldiers living quarters . This is to ensure no unauthorized entry during lights out or sleeping hours. Do not prop doors open or allow unauthorized persons to enter your barr acks bay or sleeping area. Cameras are installed in common areas (hallways, stairwells, lobbies, etc.) to assist cadre with identifying any misconduct during all hours of the day and night. The Army installed resource / hotline telephones in the barracks to assist Soldiers in reporting incidents, seeking help from an outside agency, or to check the weather /training. These hotlines are located in common areas and have multiple pre- programed lines for Soldiers to report incidents or reach important resources. Upon arrival to your B asic Combat Training (BCT) location you will receive a briefing on SHARP and be introduced to the individuals who are assigned as the sexual assault response c oordinator (SARC) and the unit victim advocate (VA). These are the NCOs and or civilians that will provide you with contact information to be used if violations are observed during your training. 44 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Their names and contact information are posted throughout the barracks and company area. Write their names and contact information in t he area provided in the front of this TRADOC Pamphlet 600 -4 Blue Book. 4-4. Drill s ergeants A drill sergeant is a symbol of excellence in IET, is an expert in all warrior tasks and battle drills, lives by and upholds the Army Values and Army Ethic , exemplifies the Warrior Ethos, and most importantly is the epitome of the Army as a trusted Army Professional. 45 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 A drill sergeant wears the distinctive \"campaign hat\" or \"bush hat\" and is responsible for coaching, counseling, mentoring, and transforming Trainees like you from a civilian volunteer to a combat -ready Soldier. When addressing a d rill sergeant your response will be, \"Yes, Drill Sergeant \"; \"No, Drill Sergeant \". This is a form of respect to the drill sergeant and their position. The badge has a s pecific meaning. It consists of 13 stars representing the original colonies. The torch, burning brightly in the center, symbolizes liberty. The snake is derived from the original \"Don't Tread on Me\" serpent, a symbol of American independence during the Rev olutionary War. Together with the torch and breastplate, it indicates readiness to defend. The breastplate is a symbol of strength. The green background is a vestment worn under the breastplate and called a jupon, which represents the new Army. The snake grasps, with its tail and teeth, a scroll inscribed with the U.S. Army's motto \"This We'll Defend.\" The heritage of the drill sergeant and NCO reaches back to the Revolutionary War and carries through to today's Army. Drill sergeants provide inspiration, di scipline, and technical competence within unit formations. 46 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 47 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Figure 4- 1. Drill Sergeant Creed DRILL SERGEANT CREED I am a Drill Sergeant . I will assist each individual in their efforts to become a highly motivated, well disciplined, physically and mentally fit Soldier, capable of defeating any enemy on today's modern battlefield. I will instill pride in all I train, pride in Self, in the Army, and in Country. I will insist that each Soldier meets and maintains the Army's standards of military bearing and courtesy, consistent with t he highest traditions of the U.S. Army. I will lead by example, never requiring a Soldier to attempt any task I would not do myself. But first, last, and always, I am an American Soldier, sworn to defend the Constitution of the United Sates against all enemies, both foreign and domestic. I am a Drill Sergeant. 48 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 4-5. The Soldierization process Initial Entry Trainees/ Soldiers complete a five -phase training program that prepares you for the transition from civilian volunteer t o Professional Soldier. The advancement through each phase is a major \"stepping stone\" in your life, because each stage repeatedly tests and pushes you to be your best. In a highly supervised environment, you will experience training that challenges you physically and mentally. Successful trainees model the actions, conduct , and adherence to the Army Values and Army Ethic exhibited by your drill sergeants . Each of the five phases is essential. They are identified by colors; each phase signifies a specific t urning point in becoming a Soldier. The Red, White, and Blue phases are part of BCT and the first 9 weeks of OSUT. The Black and Gold phases are part of AIT and the latter weeks of OSUT. 4-6. Daily schedule Typical schedule during BCT 0500 - First Call 0530 - Physical r eadiness training 0630 - Breakfast 0830 - Training 1200 - Lunch 1300 - Training 49 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 1700 - Dinner 1800 - Drill sergeant t ime 2030 - Personal t ime 2130 - Lights -out 4-7. Basic Combat Training (BCT) Red Phase . You begin the Soldierization process by learning discipline, standards, values, and teamwork. In Red 50 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 phase, you begin the process of becoming a Soldier by learning discipline, standards, and mutual trust and team work. In Red phase you will learn about the Army Ethic, including Army values, w arrior e thos, first aid, sexual harassment/assault response and prevention programs, customs and courtesies, and resiliency techniques. You will also participate in physical readiness training, road marches, confidence building exercises, and lear n how to march in a military formation. At the end of Red phase you will earn the Army unit patch that is worn on the left shoulder of your ACU uniform. This patch will be awarded during the final field training exercise called the FORGE. White Phase . You will learn rifle marksmanship and qualify on your assigned weapon. You will also continue your physical readiness training along with negotiating an obstacle course and train in the field on the basic Soldier skills necessary to meet the needs of an expedi tionary Army known as \" warrior tasks and battle drills\" or \"WTBDs\" . These skills help develop your confidence in becoming a trusted member of the Army team. At the end of white phase you will earn your rifle qualification badge. 51 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Figure 4- 2. M4 c arbine rifle left side Figure 4-3. M4 carbine rifle right side Blue Phase . This phase builds upon what you learned over the past two phases and reinforces the basic combat skills with a focus on teamwork and discipline. You will throw live hand grenades, train in chemical environments , conduct land navigation, and operate over multiple days in a field environment. After passing all your required tests and challenges during FORGE , you have earned the right to be called a Soldier 52 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 and qualify to wear the Army p atch, and the Army black beret as a rite of passage. 4-8. Warrior tasks and battle drills The Arm y has identified various basic WTBD that all Soldiers are required to train in order to succeed on the battlefield. These WTBDs are taught in BCT and cover critical skills associated with the ability to shoot, move, communicate, and survive in a combat environment . While in the r eception battalion, you received a copy of the Soldier Training Publication (STP) -21-1-SMCT Soldier's Manual of Common Tasks Warrior Skills Level 1. This manual covers all of the WTBDs you are required to know.

Military time Being a Soldier is a 24 -hour a day calling to honorable service, it is only fitting that military t ime is expressed using 24 hours. As a global military force, the U.S. Army constantly coordinates with bases and personnel located in other time zones. To avoid confusion due to time differences, the military uses Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), commonly referr ed to as military time. 56 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Table 4 -1. Military time Civilian Time Military Time Civilian Time Military Time 12:00 Midnight 0000 12:00 Noon 1200 12:01 AM 0001 1:00 PM 1300 1:00 AM 0100 2:00 PM 1400 2:00 AM 0200 3:00 PM 1500 3:00 AM 0300 4:00 PM 1600 4:00 AM 0400 5:00 PM 1700 5:00 AM 0500 6:00 PM 1800 6:00 AM 0600 7:00 PM 1900 7:00 AM 0700 8:00 PM 2000 8:00 AM 0800 9:00 PM 2100 9:00 AM 0900 10:00 PM 2200 10:00 AM 1000 11:00 PM 2300 11:00 AM 1100 11:59 PM 2359 4-11. AIT/OSUT Transition from BCT to AIT: Soldiers are to report to AIT on the scheduled report date. Soldiers who are authorized to travel to the AIT location with family members must arrive at the AIT location no later than 1800 on the Sunday prior to the scheduled AIT report date. Do not expect passes or privileges above what you were allowed in BCT, ensure you maintain any equipment you were issued, maintain 57 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 paperwork, and any publications issued during BCT. The buddy system remains in place throughout your training. In AIT and the final phases of OSUT, you will be trained in your selected military occupational specialty ( MOS ) (job training) and continue the physical conditioning required for you to excel in your future unit. During Black and Gold phases of AIT/OSUT , you will receive classroom instruction, hands -on training, and field training to enable you to become a valued team member as you transfer to your first unit of assignment. Black Phase . The Black Phase or sometimes referred to as \"Phase IV\" is the first phase of comprehensive MOS training that occurs during weeks 10- 13 of OSUT and the initial start of AIT. This phase will begin to develop your skills in your Army specialty through hands -on training, classroom instruction, and opportuniti es to apply those skills during various training exercises. During Personal Financial Management Training, you will receive 8 hours of specialized training in how to handle your finances. Upon completion of the finance training, you will be issued a certif icate. Ensure you take this certificate to your first unit of assignment, or you will be required to retake the training. Gold Phase . The Gold Phase or sometimes referred to as \"Phase V\" is the final and most progressive stage that covers weeks 14- 20+ of O SUT/AIT and the longer periods associated with specific MOSs. Some MOSs (AIT) may last 40 weeks or longer. 58 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 The phase will end with a tactical FTX , no less than 3 day and 2 nights (72 hours minimum) where you will apply the knowledge and experience you gained from BCT and most recent MOS training and apply it in a simulated combat environment. Graduation requirements . You must successfully accomplish the following requirements to graduate from OSUT/AIT: Complete the Army physical fitness test (APFT) scoring at least 60 points in each event. Goal is 70 points in each event for a total score 210) Pass MOS -specific critical tasks as identified by the proponent school. Complete the 8 hour personal financial training course. Complete the Army Traffic Safet y Training Program Individually pass the High Physical Demand Tests (HPDT) associated with your MOS .

If you exceed the body fat standards you will have six months (180 days) upon entering the Army to meet weight/body fat compliance with Army Regulation 600-9. 59 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 4-12. What is the difference between d rill sergeants and platoon sergeants (PSG) ? The difference between drill sergeants and platoon sergeants is the environment in which they train you. Your BCT experience will be highly supervised by drill sergeants as you are encouraged and evaluated on your ability to reach the highest Army standards. Th e drill sergeant enforces standards and their focus is on \"attention to detail\". Their job is to ensure you are mentally and physical fit to earn your place as a member of a team and be able to contribute as a soldier in AIT and first unit . During AIT and the latter portion of OSUT, the drill sergeant works with instructors and cadre members on a training environment that best prepares you for your first unit of assignment (FUA) . You will learn MOS skills and additional Soldier skills in an atmosphere geared to prepare you for the performance of that occupational specialty in a unit. In your first unit of assignment you will report to your platoon leader (PL)/platoon sergeant (PSG) and squad leaders (SQD LDR) that are assigned to your company. The roles of the PL/PSG and SQD LDR s are comparable even though they train Soldiers in different environments. Drill sergeants transform new recruits into Soldiers . PL/PSG and SQD LDRs reinforce the training you learned in BCT/AIT/OSUT and prepare you for your assignment in the company where standard operating procedures (SOP) are followed. PL, PSGs , SQD LDRs and MOS Instructors train Soldiers to become proficient at their MOS /Army job . 60 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Your SQD LDR and PSG will counsel and mentor you to help further develop your skills as a soldier and a member of the team. The P SG is normally a sergeant first class (E-7), but can be a staff sergeant (E-6), and has 3- 4 squad leaders that assist him/her in your development. PSG will help with assignment instructions, any training or family issues, and provide guidance throughout your assignment . 61 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 AIT drill sergeants' help Soldiers transition from a completely supervised environment to one that involves more individual responsibility. This gives you a better understanding of the duties, discipline, and responsibilities you must maintain as a Soldier. Your adventure has just started. Challenges await you and demand your complete attention to detail. Be proud of the accomplishments you complete and look forward to the journey ahead of you. Once a Soldier, always a Soldier. 62 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 4-13. General o rders/ special orders General orders: 1. I will guard everything within the limits of my post and quit my post only when properly relieved. 2. I will obey my special orders and perform all my duties in a military manner. 3. I will report violations of my special orders, emergencies, and anything not covered in my instructions to the commander of relief . BCT/OSUT/ AIT s pecial orders : Additional requirements or instructions imbedded within the general orders. 1. I will not do anything that would injure, degrade or harm my teammates...for I am an Americ an Soldier sworn to defend the v alues that we hold dear as a nation. 2. I will not go anywhere without my battle buddy, and will take action to protect him/her from harm, whether that harm is to them self or at the hand s of others...for I am the first line of defense in the protection of my teammates. 3. I trust my comrades with my life, but if I observe any threats against my battle buddy or my teammates, it is my personal responsibility to report that infraction to my leadership...for it is my duty as a Soldier to serve and protect others. 63 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 4-14. Guard duty One of the most important duties you will perform in the Army is guard duty. In a combat zone or unit area, cautious guards can mean the difference between life and death. However, guards are important everywhere due to the terrorist threats that can occur anywhere. Knowing your general orders and I nitial Military Training special orders, as mentioned earlier in this book, w ill have a major impact during guard duty. Reacti ng to an i nspecting officer When you are on guard duty and approached by an inspecting officer, these steps are followed: Stop walking and assume the position of attention. When the inspecting officer approaches, render a proper hand salute. When the salute is returned, execute order arms. Remain at attention. The inspecting officer will command, \"At ease.\" The inspecting officer may ask questions pertaining to your general orders, special orders, and what has transpired at your post. When finishe d with the inspection, the inspecting officer will say, \" Carry on.\" Assume the position of attention and render a proper hand salute, holding it until it is returned. Resume walking your post. 64 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Challenging unknown persons The following steps are carried out when challenging unknown persons (night) and summoning the commander of the relief: Upon seeing or hearing an unknown person, come to port arms. Issue the command \" Halt.\" (Person halts.) Call out \"W ho is/goes there?\" Unknown person identifies him/herself. State \" Advance to be recognized.\" Command \" Halt,\" when the person can be seen but not closer than 2 to 3 meters away. Say \"S tate your business.\" Unknown person states reason for presence in guarded area. Require the unknown person to place their identification on the ground and move back six steps. Check the identification while keeping the person under observation. If the identification and authorization do not match, move to the phone and call the commander of the relief while keeping the person under observation. Release the person to the commander of the relief and explain that their identification and authorization do not match. 65 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 4-15.

Proper wear of the Army uniform is a matter of personal pride for all Soldiers. It is indica tive of esprit de corps and morale within a unit. Soldiers have an individual responsibility to ensure their appearance reflects the highest level of professionalism. Your uniform is only part of your appearance. To look like a 66 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Soldier, you need to be phys ically fit, meet acceptable weight standards, and have a neat hairstyle in accordance with Army regulations , and conduct yourself at all times in a manner of your professional status with dignity and respect . Note: While attending BCT/OSUT/AIT some of the personal appearance allowances may be restricted w hile undergoing training. Your drill sergeants, cadre and instructors will inform you of these restrictions. See Army Regulation 670-1 and/or Department of Army Pamphlet 670-1 for additional inquiries conc erning Army uniforms and awards. Note: When traveling from BCT to AIT you will wear the ACU, or appropriate civilian attire, directed by the commander. Hairstyles While at BCT, you will receive a standard haircut. The purpose of the short cut is for hygiene purposes and extensive physical and outdoor activities you will undertake over the next 10 weeks. Once you graduate from BCT, you may have individualized haircut, as long as it conforms to Army regulation. Most Army Air Force Exchange Store (AAFES) barbers have a poster which shows authorized haircut styles. Male g rooming standards For male personnel , the hair must not fall over the ears or eyebrows, or touch the collar (except for closely cut hair at the back of the neck). 67 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Hair should be tapered, except that \"block cut\" in the back is permitted in moderate degree. Neither the bulk nor length of hair may interfere with the wearing of military headgear. Sideburns must be neatly trimmed, not flared, not come to a point, and must not extend downward beyond the lowest part of the exterior ear opening. The face must be clean- shaven. If a mustache is worn after graduation from BCT/OSUT/AIT, it must be neatly trimmed. No part of the mustache will cover the upper lip line or extend horizontally beyond or below the corner points of the mouth where the upper and lower lips join. 68 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 For female personnel, the requirements for hair regulations are to maintain uniformity within a military population for female Soldiers while in uniform, or in civilian clothes on duty, unless otherwise specified. Female hairstyles may not be eccentric or faddish and will present a conservative, professional appearance. For the purpose of these regulations, female hairstyles are organized into three basic categories: short length, medi um length, and long length hair. See Army Regulation 670- 1 for more information. Short length. Short hair is defined as hair length that extends no more than 1 inch from the scalp (excluding bangs). Hair may be no shorter than 1/4 inch from the scalp (unless due to medical condition or injury), but may be evenly tapered to the scalp within 2 inches of the hair line edges. Bangs, if worn, may not fall below the eyebrows, may not interfere with the wear of all headgear, must lie neatly against the head, and not be visible underneath the front of the headgear. The width of the bangs may extend to the hairline at the temple. Medium length. Medium hair is defined as hair length that does not extend beyond the lower edge of the collar (in all uniforms), and extends more than 1 inch from the scalp. Medium hair may fall naturally in uniform, and is not required to be secured. When worn loose, graduated hair styles are acceptable, but the length, as measured from the end of the total hair length to the base of the c ollar, may not exceed 1 inch difference in length, from the front to the back. Layered hairstyles are also authorized, so long as each hair's length, as measured from the scalp to the hair's end, is generally the same length giving a tapered appearance. Th e 69 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 regulations for the wear of bangs detailed above, apply. No portion of the bulk of the hair, as measured from the scalp, will exceed 2 inches. Long length. Long hair is defined as hair length that extends beyond the lower edge of the collar. Long hair will be neatly and inconspicuously fastened or pinned, except that bangs may be worn. The regulations for the wear of bangs detailed above, apply. No portion of the bulk of the hair, as measured from the scalp, will exceed 2 inches (except a bun, which may extend a maximum of 3 inches from the scalp) and be no wider than the width of the head. Long length hair may be worn in a ponytail during physical training. A single pony tail centered on the back of the head is authorized only when within the scope of physical training, except when considered a safety hazard. The pony tail is not required to be worn above the collar. When hair securing devices are worn, they will comply with the guidelines. Hairstyles otherwise authorized in this chapter (such as braids and twists) may also be worn in a ponytail during physical training. Braids, cornrows, and twists. Medium and long hair may be styled with braids, cornrows, or twists (see glossary for definitions). Each braid, cornrow, or twist will be of uniform dimensi on, have a diameter no greater than 1/2 inch, and present a neat, professional, and well -groomed appearance. Each must have the same approximate size of spacing between the braids, cornrows, or twists. Each hairstyle may be worn against the scalp or loose (free-hanging). When worn loose, such hairstyles must be worn per medium hair length guidelines or secured to the head in the same 70 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 manner as described for medium or long length hair styles. Ends must be secured inconspicuously. When multiple loose braids or twists are worn, they must encompass the whole head. When braids, twists, or cornrows are not worn loosely and instead worn close to the scalp, they may stop at one consistent location of the head and must follow the natural direction of the hair when wo rn back, which is either in general straight lines following the shape of the head or flowing with the natural direction of the hair when worn back with one primary part in the hair. Hairstyles may not be styled with designs, sharply curved lines, or zigzag lines. Only one distinctive style (braided, rolled, or twisted) may be worn at one time. Braids, cornrows, or twists that distinctly protrude (up or out) from the head are not authorized. Dreadlocks or locks . Female Soldiers may wear dreadlocks/locks in accordance with the guidance for braids, cornrows, and twists. Jewelry A wrist watch, identification bracelet, and up to two rings (a wedding set is considered to be one ring) may be worn with your uniform as long as they are conservative and tasteful. Soldiers may also wear one activity tracker, pedometer, or heart rate monitor. You may wear a religious medal on a chain around your neck provided neither medal nor chain can be seen. Earrings may be screw -on, clip -on, or post -type earrings, in gold, silver, white pearl, or diamond. The earrings will not exceed 6 mm or 14 inch in diameter, and they must be unadorned and spherical. When worn, the earrings will fit 71 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 snugly against the ear. Females may wear earrings only as a matched pair, with only one earring per ear lobe. Note: Females are not authorized to wear earrings with any class C (utility) uniform (ACU, hospital duty, food service, physical fitness, field, or organizational). Body p iercing No displaying objects, articles, jewelry, or ornamentation attac hed or affixed to or through the skin may be worn while in uniform. Neither can such adornments be worn while wearing civilian clothes (on or off duty) when on any military installation, or other places under military control. When not in uniform and off duty, earring wear is not restricted as long as the earrings do not create or support ear gauging (enlarged holes in the lobe of the ear, greater than 1.6mm). Follow A rmy Regulation 670-1 guidance. Cosmetics Standards regarding cosmetics are necessary to maintain uniformity and to avoid an extreme or unprofessional appearance. Males are prohibited from wearing cosmetics, except when medically prescribed. Females are authorized to wear cosmetics with all uniforms, provided they are applied modestly and conser vatively, and that they complement both the Soldier's complexion and the uniform. Leaders at all levels must exercise professional judgment when interpreting and enforcing this policy. Eccentric, exaggerated, or faddish cosmetic styles and colors, to include makeup designed to cover tattoos, are inappropriate with the uniform and are prohibited. 72 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Permanent makeup, such as eyebrow or eyeliner, is authorized as long as the makeup conforms to the standards outlined above. Eyelash extensions are not authorized unless medically prescribed. Females will not wear shades of lipstick that distinctly contrast with the natural color of their lips, that detract from the uniform, or that are faddish, eccentric, or exaggerated. Females will comply with the cosmetics policy while in any military uniform or while in civilian clothes on duty. Fingernails All personnel will keep fingernails clean and neatly trimmed. Males will keep nails trimmed so as not to extend beyond the fingertip. Females will not exceed a nail length of 14 inch, as measured from the tip of the finger. Females will also trim nails shorter if the commander determines that the longer length detracts from the military image, presents a safety concern, or interferes with the performance of duties. Females may wear clear acrylic nails, provided they have a natural appearance and conform to Army standards. Tattoos Note: Violation of tattoos policy by Soldiers may result in adverse administrative action and/or charges under the provisions of the Uniform Code of M ilitary Justice (UCMJ) . Tattoos and brands are permanent markings that are difficult to reverse (in terms of financial cost, discomfort, and effectiveness of removal techniques). Before obtaining 73 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 either a tattoo or a brand, Soldiers should consider talking to unit leaders to ensure that they understand the Army tattoo and brand policy. The words tattoo and brand are interchangeable in regards to this policy. The following types of tattoos or brands are prejudicial to good order and discipline and are, therefore, prohibited anywhere on a Soldier's body: Extremist. Extremist tattoos or brands are those affiliated with, depicting, or symbolizing extremist philosophies, organizations, or activities. Extremist philosophies, organizations, and activities are those which advocate racial, gender, or ethnic hatred or intolerance; advocate, create, or engage in illegal discrimination based on race, color, gender, ethnicity, religion, or national origin; or advocate violence or other unlawful means of depriving individu al rights under the U.S. Constitution, and Federal or State law (see A rmy Regulation 600-20). Indecent. Indecent tattoos or brands are those that are grossly offensive to modesty, decency, propriety, or professionalism. Sexist. Sexist tattoos or brands are those that advocate a philosophy that degrades or demeans a person based on gender. Racist. Racist tattoos or brands are those that advocate a philosophy that degrades or demeans a person based on race, ethnicity, or national origin. Tattoos or brands, regardless of subject matter, are prohibited on certain areas of the body as follows: 74 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Soldiers are prohibited from having tattoos or brands on the head, face (except for permanent makeup, neck (anything above the t -shirt neck line to include on/inside the ey elids, mouth, and ears), wrists /above the wrist bone, hands, except Soldiers may have one ring tattoo on each hand, below the joint of the bottom segment (portion closest to the palm) of the finger. Accessing applicants must adhere to this same policy. Soldiers may not cover tattoos or brands with bandages or make up in order to comply with the tattoo policy. 5-2. Army Combat Uniform (ACU)/ Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP) Boots New boots should fit properly when you receive them.

Some historians believe it began in late Roman times when assassinations were common. A citizen who wanted to see a public official had to approach with his right hand raised to show that he 95 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 did not hold a weapon. Knights in armor raised visors with the right hand when meeting a comrade. This practice gradually became a way of showing respect and in early American history sometimes involved removing the hat. By 1820, the motion was modified to touching the hat, and since then has become the hand salute used today. While in the Army, you salute to show respect toward an officer, flag, or our country. The proper way to salute with or without a weapon is described in Training Circular 3- 21.5. See Army Regulation 600- 25, for when to salute. Follow these rules: When you meet someone outside, salute as soon as you recognize that he or she is an officer, or if you are walking toward the officer, wait until you are about six steps away. Salute all officers (recognized by gr ade) in official vehicles identified by special plates or flags. Salute only on command when in a formation. If in a group and an officer approaches, the first Soldier to recognize the officer calls the group to attention and all personnel salute. If you approach an officer while you are double -timing alone, assume quick time, render the hand salute and give the proper greeting. When the salute is returned, execute order arms and resume double -time. The salute is always initiated by the subordinate and terminated only after acknowledgment by the individual saluted. 96 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Accompany the salute with an appropriate greeting, such as, \"good morning/afternoon, sir /ma'am .\" Salutes are not required to be rendered by or to personnel who are driving or riding in privately owned vehicles. It is not customary for enlisted personnel to exchange salutes, except in some ceremonial situations. Never render a salute with a noticeable object in your mouth or right hand. If you are on detail and an officer approaches, salute if you are in charge of the detail. Otherwise, continue to work. When spoken to, come to the position of attention while addressing an officer. Hand salute The Hand Salute is a one -count movement. The command is Present, ARMS. The Hand Salute may be executed while marching. When marching, only the Soldier in charge of the formation salutes. Figure 6- 1. Hand salute 97 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 When wearing headgear with a visor (with or without glasses), on the command of execution ARMS, raise the right hand sharply, fingers and thumb ext ended and joined, palm facing down, and place the tip of the right forefinger on the rim of the visor slightly to the right of the right eye. The outer edge of the hand is barely canted downward so that neither the back of the hand nor the palm is clearly visible from the front. The hand and wrist are straight, the elbow inclined slightly forward, and the upper arm horizontal. When wearing headgear without a visor (or uncovered) and not wearing glasses, execute the Hand Salute in the same manner as previous ly described, except touch the tip of the right forefinger to the forehead near and slightly to the right of the right eyebrow. When wearing headgear without a visor (or uncovered) and wearing glasses, execute the Hand Salute in the same manner as previous ly described, except touch the tip of the right forefinger to that point on the glasses where the temple piece of the frame meets the right edge of the right brow. Order Arms Order Arms from the Hand Salute is a one- count movement. The command is Order, AR MS. On the command of execution ARMS, return the hand sharply to the side, resuming the Position of Attention. When reporting or rendering courtesy to an individual, turn the head and eyes toward the person addressed and simultaneously salute. In this situation, the actions are executed without command. The Salute is initiated by the subordinate at the appropriate time (six paces) and terminated upon acknowledgment. 98 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Rendering customs and courtesies to NCOs and Warrant Officers When addressing an NCO you wi ll need to be at the position of Parade R est. The NCO may direct you to at ease, stand at ease; or rest. When walking with someone of higher rank, walk on the left side of the individual. Always greet individuals with the greeting of the day. Be respectful at all times. Warrant Officers will be treated in the same respect as Officers. Rendering Honor to the Flag The flag of the U.S. is the symbol of our Nation. The union, white stars on a field of blue, is the honor point of the flag. The union of the flag and the flag itself, when in company with other flags, are always given the honor position, which is on the right. The flag of the U.S. is displayed outdoors at all Army installations. The flag is displayed daily from reveille to retreat. If illuminated, i t may be displayed at night during special events or on special occasions deemed appropriate by the commander. When the flag is being raised in the morning or lowered in the evening, stand at attention on the first note of Reveille or \"To the Color s.\" \"Col ors\" refers to the flag of the U.S. and can include the unit flag. Give the required salute. You 99 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 normally face the flag when saluting, unless duty requires you to face in some other direction. At the conclusion of the ceremony, resume your regular duties. The flag, when flown at half -staff, is hoisted to the peak/top of the flagpole and then lowered to the half -staff position. At the end of the day, the flag is hoisted to the peak before lowered. \"Half -staff\" means lowering the flag to one- half the distance between the top and bottom of the staff. Whenever Reveille or To the Color s is played, and you are not in formation and not in a vehicle, come to attention at the first note, face the flag, and give the required salute. If no flag is near, face the music and salute. If you are in formation, salute only on the order \"Present arms.\" If you are in civilian clothing, stand at attention and place your right hand over your heart. Courtesies The following rules will help you conduct yourself appropriately in the presence of officers and those senior in grade: When talking to an Officer or Warrant Officer, stand at attention unless given the order \"At ease.\" When you are dismissed, or when the officer departs, come to attention and salute. When an officer enters a room, the first Soldier to recognize the officer calls personnel in the room to attention but does not salute. When indoors a Soldier only renders a salute when report ing to the officer or part of a ceremony requiring saluting. . When accompanying a senior, walk on his left. 100 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 When an officer enters a dining facility, unless he directs otherwise or a more senior officer is already present, the diners will be given the order \"At ease\" by the first person who sees the officer. You will remain seated at ease and will continue eating unless the officer directs otherwise. If you are directly addressed, you should rise to attention when seated in a chair. If you are seated on a bench, stop eating and sit at attention until the conversation ends. Note: The offi cer or NCO may give the directive \"Carry on.\" This means the Soldier or Soldiers should continue with whatever they were doing previously. This same directive is used in many other situations outside of formation, such as in the barracks and break areas. When outdoors and approached by an NCO, you should stand (when seated) and greet the NCO by saying, \"good morning, sergeant,\" \"good afternoon, ser geant,\" or \"g ood evening, sergeant (last name, if known).\" While going thr ough BCT, you will address all d rill sergeants as \"Drill Sergeant\". When you report to an officer and you are outdoors, approach the officer, stop about two steps from him, and assume the position of attention. Give the proper salute and say, for example, \"Sir/Ma'am, Private Smith reports.\" I f you are indoors, use the same procedures as above, except remove your headgear before reporting. 101 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 6-3. Bugle Calls Bugle calls are the musical signals that announce scheduled and certain non- scheduled events on an Army installation. Scheduled calls are p rescribed by the installation commander. According to Army customs, bugle calls traditionally signal troops for everything from meal times and recall formations, to rendering honors to the nation. Bugle calls normally sound in accordance with the major cal ls of the day -Reveille, Retreat, and Taps. Reveille The call signals the troops to awaken for morning roll call. Most often heard at physical training, it is used to accompany the raising of the National Colors. If outdoors at the first sound of Reveille, you should come to the position of attention and salute, facing the flag or the sound of the music. If not in uniform, come to attention and place your right hand over your heart. Retreat The call signals the end of the duty day and lowering of the National Colors. If alone, you should come to attention in the direction of the music or flag. Then, salute when you hear the first note of music after the cannon sounds. If not in 102 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 uniform, come to attention and place your right hand over your heart. Taps The cal l signals that unauthorized lights are to be extinguished. It is the last call of the day. If indoors there is no need to stand at attention and salute. The call is also sounded at the completion of a military funeral ceremony. You should come to attention and salute until the music completes. If not in uniform, come to attention and place your right hand over your heart. 6-4. Drill and Ceremonies Many drill procedures used by the U.S. Army today were developed during the Revolutionary War. The purpose of the drill then was to instill discipline in American Soldiers. As these Soldiers mastered the art of the drill, they began to work as a team and develop a sense of pride in themselves and in their unit. In today's Army, the same objectives -teamwork, confidence, pride, alertness, attention to detail, esprit de corps, and discipline are accomplished by drill. A drill consists of a series of movements by which a unit or individuals are moved in an orderly, uniform manner from one formation or place to another. Units vary in size, but in BCT, you will ordinarily be part of a squad, platoon, company or battalion. Strengthen Soldier proficiency with Army customs and courtesies and continue to enculturate pride in discipline within the force. 103 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 You will need to know the following drill terms: Element is an individual, squad, section, platoon, company, or larger unit formed as part of the next higher unit. Formation is an arrangement of the unit's elements in a prescribed manner such as a line formation in which the elements are side -by-side, or a column formation in which the elements are one behind the other. In a platoon column, the members of each squad are one behind the other with the squads abreast. Front is a space from one side to the other side of a formation, and includes the right and left elements. Depth is a space from the front to the rear of a formation, including the front and rear elements. Distance is the space between elements that are one behind the other. The distance between individuals is an arm's length, plus 6 inches, or approximately 36 inches measured from the chest of one Soldier to the back of the Soldier immediately to his front. Interval is the space between side- by-side elements. 104 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Rank is a line that is only one element in depth. File is a column that has a front of one element. Guide is the person responsible for maintaining the prescribed direction and rate of march. Post is the correct place for an officer or NCO to stand in a prescribed formation. Head is a column's leading element . Base is the element Cadence is a uniform rhythm or number of steps or counts per minute. 105 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Figure 6- 2. Drill and ceremony position Quick Time is a cadence of 120 counts (steps per minute) around which a movement is planned or regulated. Double Time is a cadence of 180 counts (steps per minute). Drill commands are oral orders given by your commander or leader, usually in two parts. The preparatory command 106 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 states the movement to be carried out and gets you ready to execute the order. The command of executio n tells when the movement is to be carried out. In the command \"Forward, march,\" the preparatory command is \"Forward,\" the command of execution is \"March.\" In some commands, the preparatory command and the command of executi on are combined. For example, \"f all in,\" \"at ease,\" and \"r est.\" These commands are given without inflection and at a uniformly high pitch and loudness comparable to that of a normal command of execution. If you are in a group of three or more, marching is required when moving from one lo cation to another. Most marching movements are a five- step process. This can be simplified into the acronym PICAA: P-preparatory command I-intermediate step C-command of execution A-action step A-additional step. Put simply , the Preparatory command, the command of execution and the action step\u2014executing the movement \u2014 are all given or executed when the same foot strikes the marching surface. The Intermediate step and Additional step are executed with the other foot. 107 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Chapter 7 - Physical Readiness As a Soldier, you are required to maintain a high level of personal readiness and resilience. Optimal personal readiness in building and maintaining the Soldier Athlete requires you to get sufficient sleep, maintain physical fitness and strength, and fuel your body with the right diet. These three key attributes (sleep, activity, and nutrition) are often described as the Performance Triad. The Performance Triad along with regular hygiene and resilience skills ensure you are prepared to perform at the elite level regardless of your MOS/Duty. You can get more information on the Performance Triad at http://armymedicine.mil/Pages/performance -triad.aspx . A personal mobile device application is available. 7-1. Army Physical Fitness Uniform (APFU) The components of the APFU are: 1. Jacket, running, black and gold. 2. Pants, running, black. 3. Trunks, running, black, moisture -wicking. 4. T-shirt, black, short sleeve, moisture -wicking. 5. T-shirt, black, long sleeve, moisture- wicking. 6. Cap, knit, black . The only insignia authorized for wear on the APFU is the Physical Fitness Badge. When the physical fitness badge is worn, it is sewn on the upper left front side of the APFU T - 108 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 shirt. On the APFU running jacket, the insignia is sewn centered 12 inch above the word \"Army.\" Soldiers are authorized to wear commercially purchased black spandex shorts under the APFU trunks. The length of the shorts must end above the knee or higher. The commercial shorts must be plain, with no logos, patterns, or obtrusive markings. Soldiers are not required to buy spandex shorts. This is an optional purchase. Only pregnant Soldiers are authorized to wear the APFU shirt outside of the trunks. Commanders may authorize the wear of commercial running shoes, calf -length or ankle -length plain white/black socks with no logos, gloves, reflective belts or vests, long underwear, and other items appropriate to the weather condition s and type of activity. If Soldiers wear long underwear or other similar items, they must conceal them from view when wearing the running jacket and pants of the APFU. 109 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Figure 7- 1.

It is a performance test that indicates a Soldier's ability to perform physically and handle his or her own body weight. APFT standards are adjusted for age and physiological differences between male and female. The APFT consists of three events: 1. Push -ups 2. Sit-ups 3. 2-mile run The events are performed in that order and on the same day. Soldiers are allowed a minimum of 10 minutes and a maximum of 20 minutes rest between events. All three events must be completed within two hours. Soldiers in BCT must attain 60 points in each event and an overall score of 18 0 points to meet APFT minimum standards. You should push yourself to achieve your maximum performance in each event. 113 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Soldiers in AIT and OSUT must also attain a score of at least 60 points on each event and an overall score of at least 180 points to graduate. The maximum score a Soldier can attain on the APFT is 300 points. Your g oal in BCT should be 65 points in each event and 70 points in each event in AIT/OSUT . The Army will replace the Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT) w ith th e Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) as the physical fitness test of record beginning in FY21. Figure 7-2. ACFT event pictures The ACFT is a six -event physical fitness test; the test events are administered in the following order: three repetition maximum d eadlift, standing power throw, hand -release push-up, sprint-drag-carry, leg tuck, and 2 mile run. There are no exceptions to the ACFT testing sequence and currently no alternative tests or test events. As a test of 114 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 record, the ACFT is intended to be completed in 70 minutes or less for two platoons of Soldiers with 16 lanes. Figure 7- 3. ACFT event timeframe 115 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Chapter 8 - Health and Safety 8-1. Nutrition Fuel the body for optimal performance As a Soldier, you are expected to achieve and maintain a high level of fitness - physical and mental. Fitness is not only achieved by your training, but also by how you fuel your body. Fueling with the wrong foods will lead to mental and physical fatigue and could play a large part in injuries and illnesses. T he right kinds of food can be found in Army dining facilities and in the civilian world \u2014optimal fueling requires a little knowledge, a little restraint, and a dedication to the Army Ethos that you have chosen. Remember: You can't \"out -exercise\" a poor diet . Fueling with the right amount of carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats promotes energy, endurance, stamina, and muscle growth. Benefits of proper fueling include: Maintaining a healthy weight Decreasing post -exercise muscle soreness Stronger and healt hier muscles To create a winning eating pattern, keep these concepts in mind: 116 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 1. Eat at least 3- 5 different kinds of nutrient -dense foods at each meal. The more types of food you eat, the more vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients you consume. Figure 8- 1. Five food groups - mealtime v isual General guidelines are to have: \u00bd of your plate full of a variety of fruits and vegetables \u00bc of your plate composed of complex carbohydrates \u00bc of your plate in the form of protein. Portion sizes will vary based on your energy needs and performance goals. Think in terms of the following: Energy: Fuel your body with complex carbohydrates and healthy fats. 117 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 2. Enjoy all foods in moderation. Aim for an eating pattern that provides 85 -90% nutrient -dense fo ods, and 10- 15% foods with fewer nutritional merits. The labeling program in the dining facilities can assist you in choosing nutrient -dense foods. 3. Make an effort to choose minimally processed, wholesome foods. Whole grains and starches are the fo undation of a high performance eating pattern. Grains are an excellent sources of carbohydrates, fiber, and B vitamins. They are the primary fuel for your muscles and brain, protect against muscular fatigue, and can reduce problems with constipation if high in fiber. Sources : Whole -grain cereals, oatmeal, whole- grain bread, brown rice, and quinoa. Vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin C, beta- carotene, potassium, magnesium, and many other vitamins, minerals, and other health- protective substances. Fresh vegetables are the best, but frozen vegetables are also a good second choice. Sources: raw or cooked broccoli, spinach, peppers, tomatoes, carrots 118 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Fruits add to the strong carbohydrate foundation for your performance eating pattern. Fruits are rich in 119 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 fiber, potassium, and many other vitamins, especially vitamin C. The nutrients found in fruits can aid in recovery after exercise and improve healing. Sources : whole fruit ( like bananas, apples, oranges, grapes), 100% fruit juice, dried fruit Protein rich foods from animal and plant sources should be eaten as a complement to the carbohydrate found in fruits, vegetables and grains. These foods provide the amino acids you need to build and repair muscles. Sources : chicken and turkey, fish, lean beef ( like top round, eye of round, round tip), peanut butter, legumes ( example kidney beans and black beans), and soy protein ( example is tofu) Dairy and calcium -rich foods are a quick and easy sources of protein, vitamin D, and calcium. Calcium and vitamin D help to maintain strong teeth and bones. Sources : low-fat (1%) or nonfat milk (skim), low -fat or nonfat yogurt, green leafy vegetables 4. Eat the right kinds of fat. Limit intake of \"hard\" saturated fats Sources : fat found on ani mal protein, butter Use more \"soft\" unsaturated fats Sources : olive oil, canola oil, fish, avocado, peanut butter, nuts and seeds Avoid trans fats (partially hydrogenated oils) Sources : found in commercially prepared foods 120 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 such as crackers, cakes, cookies, chips, and pastries Stay h ydrated Fluid needs vary greatly from person to person, and depend on intensity of work, level of heat stress, and sweat rates. The first step to being well hydrated is to drink fluids and eat foods high in water content throughout the day. Cool water is the beverage of choice for maintaining hydration. Recommended fluid intake ranges from 2 to 5 quarts per day. You may have a need for extra salt (a source of sodium) depending on the severity of sweat loss and the degree in which you are adapted (acclimatized) to the heat*. The consumption of food and beverages and adding salt to foods are the preferred methods to replacing sodium losses. Sports drinks may be an option for sodium replacement if you are not consuming enough food dur ing training and/or you are not acclimated to the heat*. Avoid putting sports drinks in your wearable hydration system, as this will increase the risk of harmful bacteria or mold growth. *Note: Heat acclimatization may take up to 21 days or more for untrained Soldiers. 121 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 The simplest way to determine if you are adequately replacing the fluid lost through sweat is to check the color and quantity of your urine. If your urine is dark and scanty, you need to drink more fluids or eat more foods with a high water content Fluids = water, sports drinks, 100% fruit juice, milk, milk alternatives (soy, almond) Foods = high-water -content fruits and vegetables, soup, yogurt Figure 8- 2. Are you hydrated? Urine color test 122 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Be smart about energy drinks Energy drinks are not the same as sports drinks and should never be used for hydration \u2014 cool, plain water should always be a first choice for hydration. Energy drinks generally contain large quantities of caffeine and may contain other ingredients, most of which do absolutely nothing to enhance performance or health. Also, the large quantities of caffeine can actually aggravate dehydration, and may also lead to increased anxiety, upset stomach, shakiness, headaches, and sleep issues. These potential side effects can actually reduce your ability to perform, NOT enhance it. Instead of reaching for energy drinks, it's best to feed your body energy throughout the day: Snack on carbohydrates and energy -rich foods such as dried fruits, nuts, trail mix, a commerci al sports bar or low -fat chocolate milk. Drink cool, plain water frequently, even if you aren't thirsty. Dietary supplements Many Soldiers use dietary supplements to improve performance, increase muscle mass, enhance energy, accelerate recovery, increase alertness, boost their immune system, and improve joint function. However, dietary supplements are not tested or approved by the Food and Drug Administration prior to being placed on the market, are often unnecessary, and can be dangerous and expensive. 123 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Operation Supplement Safety (OPSS) is a joint initiative between the Human Performance Resources Center (HPRC) and the Department of Defense ( DOD ) to educate Service Members and retirees, their family members, leaders, healthcare providers, and DOD civilian s about dietary supplements and how to choose supplements wisely. The OPSS website provides easy access to updated materials and databases for you to stay informed and make healthy dietary supplement choices. 8-2. Sleep The disciplined practices in sleep, activity , and nutrition comprise the Army's \"performance triad.\" By following the habits outlined below you will do the most for yourself to maximize performanc e, and avoid illness and injury. Make Sleep A Priority - Sleep is a biological need for brain functioning and is critical for sustaining the mental abilities required for success in BCT and advanced individual training. Soldiers require a minimum of 7 -8 hours of sleep every 24- hours. In BCT, you will have the opportunity for at least 7 hours of continuous sleep per night (unless you are scheduled for duty such as access control guard/fireguard or charge of quarter's runner). 124 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 During field training, the length of the training day and time for sleep will vary based on training requirements; however, your commander will ensure that the schedule allows sufficient time for sleep during field training. The MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU MUST REMEMBER: When you have the opportunity to sleep, do it. Insuf ficient sleep presents a risk to mission success. Sleep deprived Soldiers are likely to make mission critical and sometimes fatal errors. The demanding nature of military operations often creates situations in which obtaining enough sleep on a regular basis is difficult or impossible. Such chronic, insufficient sleep (anything less than 7\u20148 hours per 24) produces a sleep debt - a chronic state of increased sleep need that is characterized by impaired performance and readiness. The only way to eliminate the debt is to obtain sleep (just closing your eyes and resting is not the same as sleeping/napping). As a Soldier you must make sleep a priority! When you have the opportunity to rest or sleep, do it. 8-3. Activity During BCT you will obviously maintain a high level of activity. However once you graduate from AIT or OSUT, you will have much more control over your level of activity. You will need recreational -type activities to maintain your optimum performance; Army physical readiness training and the other hi gh-physical demands of your duties will not provide all the physical activity you need. 125 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Physical activity is more than just \"exercise\" or \"working out\"- it's living an active lifestyle. Whether it's walking the dog, doing yard work, or playing with your ki ds, regular movement throughout the day inspires positive health outcomes over time. Physical activity improves health in the following ways: Lowers risk of some chronic diseases and conditions such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, and canc er (for example, breast and colon). Aids in weight loss and prevents weight gain. Helps manage stress and may reduce depression. Strengthens bones, muscles, and joints. Boosts confidence and self-esteem. Amount and types of physical activity. To receive positive health outcomes you need at least: 150 minutes of moderate- intensity aerobic activity per week. 150 minutes is also: 2 hours & 30 minutes per week OR 30 minutes a day for 5 days OR 10 minutes of activity 3 times a day for 5 days. 2 days of muscle strengthening activities (like weight/resistance band training, calisthenics, and yoga). 10,000 steps during your everyday routine. Note: 10,000 steps is close to 5 miles. An inactive person may only average 1,000 to 3,000 steps a day, or about one mile. P ersons who walk no farther than 126 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 this in a normal day should add walking to their routines. Save time by bumping up the intensity. Do 75 minutes of vigorous -intensity activities per week (jogging, swimming laps, or hiking uphill). Pick activities you enjoy. Moderate- intensity activities include: brisk walking, doubles tennis, golf, and leisure biking. Invite Family, friends, and fellow Soldiers to join you. Take a fitness class, join a recreation league, sign up for a 5K run/walk, or start a walking group in your neighborhood. 8-4. Hygiene In addition to Army training, personal hygiene plays a crucial role in your overall physical readiness as a strong, productive Soldier. There are numerous health concerns that can arise if you do not conduct proper personal hygiene at home and in field environments. Hazard of communicable diseases Communicable diseases are caused by specific infectious organisms like viruses or bacteria transmitted from one person to another. The person who is infected may feel sick and look sick, or might carry the illness without feeling or looking sick. These diseases can rapidly degrade the medical readiness of military units and their ability to carry out their mission. They can also cause significant suffering and overwhelm the military health care system. 127 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 You received vaccinations to protect you against the increased risk of these infections when you entered the Army, and you will receive additional vaccinations prior to traveling to foreign areas. There are many communicable illnesses that do not have vaccines such as, the common cold and hepatitis C and D. Resistance to illness Vaccines do part of the job; the rest is up to you. You are immune to most illnesses most of the time because of your own immune system. It continues with thing s you do to protect yourself, like keeping yourself and your environment clean; wearing a clean uniform appropriate for the season; and avoiding contact with persons who are ill. Also, you should always cough into your arm and clean your hands frequently t o avoid spreading/receiving germs. Immediate hazards to your health Do not take chances with your health. If in doubt, get medical help. Injuries that pose a threat to your health or life are: Any eye injury Any human or animal bite that breaks the skin Allergic reaction to an insect bite, chemicals, or medications Bleeding that cannot be stopped Burns, including severe sunburn Feeling very hot and/or confused after being out in the heat 128 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Exposure to cold temperatures and you think you may have a cold injury Other symptoms of illnesses that can threaten your health or life include: Tightness, pressure, or pain in your chest that spreads to your neck, jaw, arm, or back Shortness of breath, or wheezing while resting Difficulty breathing, or the feeling of choking Coughing up blood Difficulty speaking, swallowing, or opening your mouth Stiff neck with fever Sudden loss of vision Very bad pain anywhere on your body Weakness and dizziness Blood in your urine or brown urine Vomiting up blood or what looks like coffee grounds Blood in your stool or black, tar -like stools You feel like you might hurt yourself or others Hip or knee injuries Painful teeth or swelling in your mouth or jaw If you experience any injuries or symptoms of illness, report them to your drill sergeant immediately to get health care. 129 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Bathe/shower daily Regular bathing with soap and water is important for both cleanliness and personal appearance. Bathing prevents hygiene- related diseases such as scabies, ringworm, athlete's foot, skin infections, and pink eye. You should especially wash your hands, face and ears, armpits, groin, and feet. In addition to washing your skin regularly you should wash your hair at least twice a week, shave daily and, avoid sharing combs or razors with others . Wash hands regularly Normally your immune system protects you against invasion by bacteria, viruses, and parasites; however, if your hands become contaminated with these organisms and you put them up to your nose or mouth, disease germs can invade your body and cause an infection. Many aspects of basic training can make you more vulnerable to respiratory illnesses, including close contact with other Soldiers. The physical and psychological stresses of military training can make you more vulnerable to illness. In addition, your immune system may not be ready to withstand the new organisms you are exposed to when first brought together as a group. Almost 90 percent of Soldiers get symptoms of respirator y illness at some point during BCT . In most cases, these illnesses are mild and trainees are able to continue training, but sometimes they progress to worse infections like pneumonia or meningitis. 130 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Washing your hands with soap and water is the most effective way to prevent the spread of bacteria and viruses which are major cause of food borne diseases and other illnesses. Although the use of hand sanitizers is effective for killing most of these harmful organisms on the hands, they are ineffective on hands that are heavily soiled with dirt, grease, and other deb ris. Therefore the use of hand sanitizers should not be used in place of hand washing, rather as a supplement to or a temporary alternative when hand washing is not available. Wash or sanitize your hands every time: After using the latrine Before eating or handling food After sneezing or blowing your nose It is important to practice good hygiene habits when you are in basic training, because it will become more difficult to wash your hands and bathe regularly when you are in the field or deployed. Dental health and readiness Brush and floss your t eeth. Keeping your mouth healthy maintains your dental readiness, and ensures that you won't suffer from pain, infection, or inability to eat high- performance foods. Poor oral health takes more Soldiers out of the f ight than the enemy does. Wisdom teeth and gum disease cause problems, but most dental emergencies are caused by tooth decay or its complications. 131 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Tooth decay is usually caused by bacteria (germs) that feed on starchy or sugary snacks and beverages, and by acids that wear away the surfaces of teeth. Soda, juice, sweet tea, sports drinks and energy drinks all contain sugar and acids that can damage teeth. Saliva is critical for protecting your teeth from decay by neutralizing acids, hardening teeth, and fighting germs. Stressful training or operations can decrease saliva flow, leaving you vulnerable to decay. Prevent dental problems in two ways: watch what you put in your mouth, and clean your mouth every day. Follow the guidelines in the Nutrition section above, and you will contribute toward a healthy mouth. Your teeth and gums need the same water intake, calcium, vitamins and minerals, and protein that the rest of your body does, as well as protection from sugars, acid content, and simple starches. In addition to a healthy diet: If you drink sugary drinks, make sure they are cold and minimize contact with your teeth. You can use a straw that reaches to the back of your tongue, or just chug the drink down all at once. Rinse your mouth with plain water af ter drinking sugary drinks If you drink juice, choose juice that has calcium added, to minimize acid damage. 132 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Use xylitol -sweetened gum or mints for 5 -10 minutes after meals and snacks to fight cavities. Avoid tobacco. Tobacco can cause gum disease and oral cancer. Use lip balm with sunscreen during sun exposure to prevent lip cancer. Clean your mouth every day: Brush 2- 3 times a day, every day, with fluoride toothpaste to remove food particles and harmful bacteria from your teeth. Fluoride helps repair earl y stage tooth decay. Brush before going to sleep to provide greater protection for your teeth. Use a soft or ultra-soft toothbrush that is small enough to fit around your back teeth. Brush your teeth for about 2- 3 minutes using a gentle, circular motion. P ay extra attention to the gum-line, back teeth, and areas around fillings, crowns or bridges. Brush your tongue and the roof of your mouth to remove germs that cause tooth decay and bad breath. If you have an appliance such as an orthodontic retainer or pa rtial denture, remove it before brushing your teeth. Brush all surfaces of the appliance also. Do not rinse your mouth after brushing. Just spit several times to remove excess toothpaste. 133 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Don't eat or drink anything for at least 30 minutes after you brush so the fluoride will stay on your teeth longer and protect them better If you can't brush: Swish with water after eating or drinking. Wipe your teeth with a clean cloth wrapped around your finger. Figure 8- 3. Flossing Rub toothpaste on the surfaces of your teeth with your finger. Floss once a day. Flossing removes bacteria and food in between teeth, where a toothbrush can't reach Use 18 inches of floss. Wrap the end of the floss around your middle finger and use your index finger to guide the floss. Insert the floss between your teeth. Pull gently side to side to get it through the tight spots, but be careful not to saw your gums! Use a different area of the floss for each space. Gently move the floss up and down against the tooth in back, then the tooth in front. Wrap the floss around the teeth as you're moving it up and down. 134 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Your gums may bleed at first when you start flossing every day. If bleeding continues to happen after a week or two of flossing, see your dentist. Remember - YOU control whether you get cavities or not! Whenever a dentist tells you there is a problem at your annual exam, get it treated as soon as possible. Note: Females should be extra vigilant about brushing with fluoride toothpaste 2 -3 times a day, to prevent cavities and bleeding gums. This is because females tend to make less saliva than males, which can leave them more vulnerable to decay. Fluctuations in female hormones can also negatively affect oral health. Hormones and oral contraceptives can increase bacteria levels in the mouth and cause changes in the blood vessels in the gums, leading to gingivitis. Figure 8- 4. Flossing between teeth Females who have gingivitis can experience an increase in symptoms during monthly hormonal fluctuations, resulting in tenderness, swel ling, and bleeding when brushing. Females who use oral contraceptives are also twice as likely to develop a dry socket after dental extraction. Smoking increases this risk. 135 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Hormone fluctuations and stressful environments have been associated with developme nt of painful mouth ulcers or canker sores. Nutritional deficiencies (vitamins B1, B2, B6, B12, folate, C and iron, magnesium or zinc) may also increase your risk of developing mouth ulcers, so eating fruits and vegetables can help. Over -the-counter remedies are effective for the discomfort caused by small ulcers. Larger or more painful ulcers may interfere with a normal diet. A dentist can prescribe medicine to reduce pain and accelerate healing of larger ulcers. Care for your feet and nails Athlete' s foot is caused by a fungus that lives in damp, warm, and dark areas like shower rooms, rubber boots, and old running shoes. Athlete's foot usually looks like little blisters between the toes. These can pop, causing itching and little sharp pains. Also, t he skin might crack or look scaly. You can get athlete's foot from walking barefooted on unclean facilities and not washing your feet. The symptoms include itching, flaking, and cracking between toes or on bottom of feet. To prevent Athlete's foot, do the following: Wear shower shoes while taking showers and when walking on the floor. Use a towel to dry thoroughly between your toes. 136 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Wear clean dry socks; never wear another Soldier's socks. Clean the showers and latrine floors daily. Sprinkle foot powder in your socks to help absorb the moisture. Remove the inserts from your boots at night to prevent fungus from growing. If you get athlete's foot, you need an anti -fungal solution or cream to treat it. Wear one pair of boots one day and change to your other pair the next day. In addition to preventing athlete's foot, you must also make sure you prevent ingrown toenails. Ingrown toenails are caused by a combination of tight shoes and trimming the toenails down to the edge of the nail. Symptoms include tenderness , swelling, sharp pain, redness, and discharge. You can prevent ingrown toenails by trimming nails straight across every two weeks. Seek medical attention for treatment, for surgery may be necessary to remove the nail from the skin. Cut toenails short and square 137 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Figure 8- 5. Trim your t oenails Prevent blisters Blisters are caused by friction from tight fitting shoes, breaking in new boots, and road marches. Symptoms are redness and tenderness of the skin. All blisters cannot be prevented, but they can be minimized. Wearing proper fitting boots and tight fitting, clean, dry socks free of excessive wear can prevent most blisters. Second skin (mole skin) on \"hot spots,\" knee- high nylons, and good personal hygiene will help reduce chances of getting a blister as well. 138 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Also, wear work gloves if working with equipment that you will be doing repetitive movements, such as raking or shoveling. Take the following measures to treat a blister: Wash with a mild soap and water and keep your skin clean and dry. Apply a topical anti -biotic ointment to prevent infection. Cover with bandage or second skin to prevent from opening. DO NOT purposely open a blister. If blister opens, treat as you would any open cut. Always leave the top skin of a drained blister. Pulling off the top layer of skin can damage the new skin underneath and cause infection. Protect your hearing Survival on the battlefield could depend on your ability to hear. Hearing loss caused by noise is painless, progressive, permanent, but also preventable. To prot ect your hearing, insert your earplugs correctly whenever instructed to wear them. Do not lose your earplugs. If you do lose your earplugs, notify your drill sergeant immediately. Always wear your earplugs to protect your hearing. Protect against the effects of heat, cold and insects While you are in BCT and AIT you may be exposed to extremes of heat and cold and biting insects. To protect you 139 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 from the effects of heat, cold, and insects your cadre will ensure that you have the following things: Safeguar ds against over -stress from heat, or over - exposure to cold, especially in your first couple weeks. Water and other beverages, and nutritious meals. You will probably be drinking more water and beverages than you are used to drinking. Protective clothing and sunscreen, and insect repellent. Your uniform is factory -treated with a conventional insect repellent for clothing. Instructions on what items of your uniform to wear, and how much water you should drink, on a given day. Reminders about symptoms and signs of hot and cold weather illnesses, to watch for in both yourself and your buddy. Questions about whether you have been ill, or are taking medication, that may increase your risk of heat and cold weather illness . Note: In case of a severe hot weather ill ness, your cadre may remove the outer clothing and apply ice water -soaked sheets to the affected Soldier. Here are a few things to remember all the time: Eat all your meals and drink all the water and beverages provided to you. Food and fluids are needed t o \"fuel\" your body's regulating systems for both heat and cold. 140 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Make sure your uniform is clean, worn as instructed, and all buttons and fasteners are serviceable. Apply sunscreen and insect repellent to your face, neck, and hands as instructed. Let your c adre know if you aren't feeling well, taking medications, and/or have unusual insect bite marks that look infected. Also let your cadre know if you think your buddy is not feeling well. Watch the amount and color of your urine as an indicator of whether you are drinking enough water and fluids. This is just as important in cold weather as it is in hot weather. When you are in AIT, if you purchase energy drinks, sports drinks, or supplements, ensure that you continue eating all meals and drink all the wate r and beverages provided to you. 8-5. Ready and Resilient Soldiers must cope with adversity, perform well in stressful situations, and learn to thrive in stressful environments. The ready and resilient Fitness program is designed to build resilience and enhance the performance of the Army Family Soldiers, their Families, and Army Civilians - through hands - on training and online self -development tools. Resilient individuals enhance Army performance and readiness. Resilience is the ability to grow and thrive in the face of challenges and bounce back from adversity. 141 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 The goal of ready and resilient Family Fitness is to increase your resilience and enhance your performance by developing and strengthening five dimensions of strength. 1. Social strength refers to developing and maintaining trusted, valued relationships and friendships that are personally fulfilling and foster good communication including a comfortable exchange of ideas, views, and experiences. 2. Emotional strength means approaching life's challenges in a positive, optimistic way by demonstrating self-control, stamina, and good character with your choices and actions. 3. Family strength is about being a part of a Family unit that is safe, supportive and loving, and provides the resources needed for all members to live in a healthy and secure environment. 4. Spiritual strength refers to one's purpose, values, beliefs, identi ty, and life vision. These elements, which define the essence of a person, enable one to build inner strength, make meaning of experiences, behave ethically, persevere through challenges, and be resilient when faced with adversity. An individual's spirituality draws upon personal, philosophical, psychological, and/or religious teachings, and forms the basis of their character. 5. Physical strength is about performing and excelling in physical activities that require aerobic fitness, endurance, strength , healthy body composition, and flexibility derived through exercise, nutrition, and training. The physical dimension also encompasses the Office of the Surgeon General (OTSG) Performance Triad initiative of sleep, 142 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 activity, and nutrition to improve personal and unit performance, resilience, and readiness. 8-6. Chaplains The chaplain is responsible for providing spiritual support to every Soldier in the unit. Although chaplains are part of a particular denomination, their mission is to ensure the spiritual needs of every Soldier are met. Each battalion in the Army has its own chaplain (normally a CPT). The chaplains and their assistants form the Unit's Ministry Team. Chaplains hold weekly services (while in garrison and in the field), are available for indiv idual counseling, and are one of the few members of the military who retain the privilege of confidentiality. The chaplain also plays a key role in helping promote programs, such as suicide prevention. In the BCT/OSUT/AIT environment, they are of particular value in helping Soldiers succeed under difficult and stressful conditions. They assist the commander in teaching, displaying, instilling the Army Values, and in maintaining high morale within the unit. 8-7. Risk management Every Soldier, regardless of r ank, is faced with making decisions. You will be challenged to make the right decisions about risk, decisions that will affect not only yourself, but also your team, Family, and friends. 143 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 The Army uses a system called Risk Management to help make those dec isions. A rmy Techniques Publication 5-19, Risk Management is the Army's doctrinal manual for risk management. Figure 8-6. Risk management cycle The system doesn't just apply in combat but to everything you do on or off duty. The whole goal is to preserve the Army's ability to fight and win by keeping you safe. The Army's Risk Management is a logical approach to risk - associated decision making that will help you make smart risk decisions and reduce the possibility of becoming a loss. As you progress throughout your career, you will learn more about the risk m anagement process. For now, you need to focus on a few items to ensure your safety while you are in Initial Entry Training: 144 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Hot w eather injury awareness Cold w eather injury awareness Weapon m uzzle aware ness Environmental hazards (insects, animals, poisonous plants, etc.) Follow all directions/orders at all times 145 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Chapter 9 - Discipline The Army is subject to military law and the laws of our government, and we strive to live as law -abiding Soldiers in whatever we do and wherever we go. Discipline is the practice of our profession in the conduct of duty, ethically, effectively, and efficiently meeting standards while striving for excellence. Military discipline is founded upon self -disciplin e, respect for authority, and the embracing of the professional Army ethic with its supporting core values. Military discipline is developed through individual and group training to create a mental attitude that will result in proper conduct and prompt obedience to lawful military authority. The Rules There are three basic rules you should follow: Follow Army regulations and the UCMJ . Take responsibility for your actions. Set the example, do what is right even when no one is watching and always keep your ha nds to yourself. While military discipline is the result of effective training, it affects every aspect of military life. It is a characteristic found in individuals and units that demonstrate: Unit cohesion, bonding, and a spirit of teamwork. Smartness of appearance and action. 146 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Cleanliness and maintenance of dress, equipment, and quarters. Respect to seniors and mutual respect between senior and subordinate personnel. Prompt and willing execution of both the letter, and the spirit of the legal orders of their lawful commanders. Fairness, justice, and equity for all Soldiers, regardless of age, race, ethnicity, religion, color, gender, or national origin. 9-1. Uniform Code of Military Justice The UCMJ is the statute that prescribes criminal law for Soldie rs. It applies to active duty Soldiers 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. Anywhere you are in the world, the UCMJ applies. All persons in the military service are required to strictly obey and promptly execute the legal orders of their lawful seniors. The U CMJ authorizes non -judicial punishment (administrative actions) by commanders and judicial punishment by court -martial (military courts). The UCMJ covers traditional offenses that can occur inside or outside of the military environment. Examples include assault, burglary, rape, and murder. It also provides for the punishment of strictly military offenses. Military offenses are those not common in civilian law. Examples include failure to repair, absence without leave, disrespect to NCOs and commissioned off icers, and 147 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 disobedience of orders. Common offenses in IET include, fighting, fraternization, failure follow instructions, and failure to adapt. The principle that an accused is innocent until proven guilty applies to both non- judicial punishment and court s-martial. You have the right to be informed of any charges against you, as well as the names of accusers and known witnesses. UCMJ: Non -judicial punishment Under the provisions of the UCMJ, Article 15, commanding officers may impose non -judicial punishmen t upon Soldiers who commit minor offenses within their units. The purpose of non- judicial punishment is to train, correct, and reform. It also promotes positive behavior changes in Soldiers without the stigma of a court -martial conviction. While Article 15s are often considered \"minor,\" common punishments include: revocation of pay, revocation of time (through extra duty) and revocation of rank . Some of the common UCMJ offenses in IET are: Refusing to train; disobey ing a lawful order; disrespect to an officer/noncommissioned officer; sexual harassment/assault, and missing formation. UCMJ: Court -martial There are three types of court -martial: summary, special, and general . Trials by court -martial are the military equivalent of civilian trials by judges and juries. The differences among the three 148 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 are based on their composition, level of authority, and severity of punishments authorized. A summary court -martial is composed of a commissioned officer on active duty with the grade of captain or above. The purpose of the summary court -martial is to make thorough and impartial inquiries into minor offenses and to make sure that justice is done, with the interests of both the government and the accused being safeguarded. A special court -martial consists of a military judge and not less than three panel members when required. It is held for relatively serious offenses. A general court -martial consists of a military judge and not less than five panel members when required. It is held for serious offenses. A general court -martial may impose any authorized punishment including the death penalty in certain cases. 9-2. Equal opportunity (EO) policy The EO program ensures an Army - wide, concentrated effort to maximize human potential and to ensure fair treatment for all persons based solely on merit, fitness, and capability in support of readiness. The EO philosophy is based on fairness, justice, and equity. The Army's EO program emphasizes fair and equal treatment for military personnel, and civilian employees without re gard to race, color, religion, gender, or national origin. This policy applies on and off post, extends to Soldiers, civilian employees, and Family members, and includes working, living, and recreational environments. 149 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Complaint process The EO complaints pr ocessing system addresses grievances that allege unlawful discrimination or unfair treatment on the basis of race, national origin, color, gender, religious affiliation, or sexual harassment. Attempts should always be made to solve the problem at the lowes t possible level within an organization. If a complaint is submitted, it will be investigated. Those personnel found in violation of the EO Policy are subject to punishment under the UCMJ. Within reason, Soldiers and other individuals are encouraged to att empt resolution of any complaints by confronting an alleged offender, or by informing other appropriate officials about the offensive behavior or unfair treatment. Also, individuals are responsible to advise their chain of command on the specifics of any discrimination or sexual harassment so appropriate action can be taken. Personnel must submit only legitimate complaints, and should exercise caution against frivolous or reckless allegations. Types of EO complaints The Army has two types of EO complaints w ithin its EO complaint process: informal, and formal. An informal complaint is any complaint that a Soldier, Family member or DA civilian does not wish to file in writing. 150 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Informal complaints may be resolved by the complainant directly with the assistance of another unit member, the commander, or another person in the complainant's chain of command. Typically, those issues that may be taken care of informally can be resolved through discussion, problem identification, and clarification of the issues. An inf ormal complaint is not subject to time suspense, nor is it reportable. A formal complaint is one that a Soldier, Family member, or DA civilian files in writing and swears to the accuracy of the information. DA Form 7279 (Equal Opportunity Complaint Form ) can be obtained at the unit or higher headquarters level. Formal complaints require specific actions, are subject to timelines, and require documentation of actions taken. Alternative measures Although handling EO complaints through the chain of command is strongly encouraged, this is not the only channel. Should a Soldier feel uncomfortable in filing a complaint with the chain of command, or should the complaint be against a member of the chain of command, there are a number of alternative agencies through which a complaint can be made. The following agencies are frequently used: EO adviser Chaplain Provost marshal 151 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Staff judge advocate Housing referral office Inspector general EO hotline Inspector general (IG): Serves as the eyes , ears, voice and conscience of the commander. The IG performs four basic functions: teaching and training; inspections; assistance, and investigations. Providing the commander impartial fact findings to improve the Army and support the Chain of Command. Right to a ppeal If a complainant perceives an investigation failed to reveal all relevant facts, or if actions taken on their behalf are perceived as insufficient, he or she has the right to appeal to the next higher commander. The complainant may not appeal the action take n against the perpetrator, if any is taken. 9-3. Policy on relationships between Soldiers The Army has historically relied upon customs and traditions to define the bounds of acceptable personal relationships among its members. Soldier relationships have always been judged with reference to customs and traditions of the service. It is difficult to predict which relationships (strong friendships, parent -child, sibling, career, and business) can create or appear to create an adverse impact on discipline, authority, morale or mission. Therefore, the Army prohibits 152 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 all unprofessional relationships that compromise the chain of command, will cause partiality or unfairness, involve the improper use of grade for personal gain, or are perceived to be exploitive or co ercive in nature. See TRADOC Regulation 350- 6, for the policy on relationships between Soldiers. Relationships that may create or appear to create an adverse impact on discipline, authority, morale, or mission accomplishment are also prohibited. To incl ude relationships (physical or sexual) between IET Soldiers and other IET Soldiers; regardless of Service, sex and/or gender; violations punishable under UCMJ . Professional r elationships : Professional relationships are interactions consistent with the Army Ethic, including Army Values. Professional relationships contribute to mutual trust and cohesive teamwork. Unprofessional r elationship: Unprofessional relationships occur when they detract from the authority of superiors or result in or create the appear ance of: favoritism, misuse of office or position, or the abandonment of organizational goals for personal interests. Unprofessional relationships negatively affect our ability to carry out our mission. History shows unprofessional relationships erode morale, respect for authority, unit cohesion, and mission accomplishment. Due to the damage to that might occur, maintaining an unprofessional relationship is specifically prohibited and could result in disciplinary action. 153 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Fraternization The Army's fraternization policy prohibits personal relationships between officer and enlisted personnel regardless of their service. Leaders and subordinates of any kind. NCO and Soldier. This policy applies to all regardless of Gender. Violations of the fraternization and improper relationships policy may be punished under Article 92 and/or 134, UCMJ, as a violation of a lawful general regulation. Categories of personal relationships may include: Dating Shared living accommodations Engaging in intimate or sexual relations Business enterprises Commercial solicitations Gambling or borrowing Writing personal letters Text messages Emails (Unrelated to the training mission) Personal telephone conversations (u nrelated to the training mission) Friending through Social media sites Improper relationships There are two major categories of illegal associations: relationships between permanent party members and 154 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 BCT/OSUT/AIT Soldiers (Cadre -Trainee) and relationships between BCT/OSUT/AIT Soldiers (Trainee- Trainee). Any relationship between permanent party personnel (command team, drill sergeants, and C ivilians) and Trainee Soldiers not required by the training mission is prohibited. There are no consensual relationships between cadre /permanent party - Trainee or betw een Trainee - Trainee during BCT/OSUT/AIT. Trainers will sign Department of Defense ( DD) Form 298 2 (Recruiter/Trainer Prohibited Activities Acknowledgment) , a form with explicit and strict command guidance that acknowledges their understanding and responsibi lities regarding the policies prohibiting inappropriate behaviors and relations outlined in DOD instructions. This form will be retained in the trainer's record while they are assigned to the training duty and will be revalidated annually. This includes, b ut is not limited to, the following: Drinking, dancing, or gambling. Writing and/or receiving personal letters or emails. Riding in permanent party privately owned vehicles. Having sexual conversations, contact (kissing, hugging, caressing, fondling, handh olding, etc.), or intercourse. Sending and/or receiving text messages or phone calls. 155 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Personal telephone conversations (Unrelated to the training mission) Friending through Social media sites IET Soldiers are prohibited from having any relationship with permanent party personnel without regard to the installation assignment of the permanent party member or the trainee. For example, personnel assigned or attached to the U.S. Army Recruiting Command may not have any relationship with potential prospects, ap plicants, and members of the Delayed Entry Program or Delayed Training Program, not required by the recruiting mission. DSs cannot have relationships with Trainees. After receiving the training on the policies stated in the DOD instructions all Soldiers wi ll sign DD Form 2983 (Recruit/Trainee Prohibited Activities Acknowledgment) , a form with explicit and strict command guidance acknowledging their understanding and responsibilities as outlined in the instructions. This form will be retained in the Soldier' s file until they detach from the training command or school to which they are assigned or attached. Unlawful associations between Trainee Soldiers involve any actual or attempted consensual contact or socializing between or among Cadre or Soldiers who are BCT/OSUT/AIT. Soldiers will therefore avoid the following associations and acts: Consensual contact or socializing (between or among Soldiers who are in BCT, OSUT or AIT) which involves handholding, embracing, caressing, 156 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 kissing, touching, massaging or fondling of a sexual nature, engaging in sexual intercourse, or sodomy. Use of sexually explicit, suggestive, or obscene language or gestures directed towards, or with respect to another Soldier in BCT, OSUT or AIT. Gender -based or race- based harassment or disparaging language or actions (by a Soldier or a group of Soldiers in BCT, OSUT or AIT) directed towards another Soldier or group of Soldiers in BCT, OSUT or AIT. Entry into the living quarters, latrines, or other areas designated for the exclusive use of Soldiers of the opposite sex, unless required by training mission/ official duties or for health or safety emergencies. However, language or socializing of a non- sexual, non- harassing nature between BCT, OSUT and AIT Soldiers is not illegal if the inter action is based on the esprit and enthusiasm generated by the basic training mission and the professional development associated with BCT, OSUT, and AIT. Finally, there is no prohibition against Trainee Soldiers of the same or opposite sex talking to one another or developing friendships. 9-4. SHARP A Soldier in the U.S. Army stands strong - a member of a band of brothers and sisters bound together by common moral purpose to accomplish the mission; timeless values and sharing a sense of trust with and duty and loyalty to their fellow Soldiers that is unlike any other in the world. 157 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Their willingness to sacrifice for each other, to never leave a fallen comrade, is what makes a Soldier strong - on the battlefield, and off. When sexual harassment or sexual assault occurs, it is not only a direct violation of our Army Values and Warrior Ethos, but also an assault on what it means to serve in the Profession of Arms and the Army way of life - a life in which it is our duty to protect and take care of each other no matter the time, place, or circumstance. As a band of Brothers and sisters, we have a personal and professional duty to intervene and prevent sexual harassment and sexual assault. Sexual assault is a serious crime punishable by the UCMJ . It betrays victims and their Families; erodes the bedrock of trust upon which the Profession of Arms is grounded; and has a corrosive effect on our unit readiness, team cohesion, and command environment. The damage resulting from sexual assault extends far beyond the victim, weakening the very health and morale of our Soldiers, breaking the bond of trust within our team, shattering the confidence Soldiers have in one another, and undermining unit readiness. Sexual assault can be prevented. As Soldiers, our Army Values demand that we act to stop these behaviors. There are no passive bystanders. Passive bystanders who do not assist, do not report, and do not try to help their fellow Soldiers as they see sexual harassment or sexual assaults occur are part of the problem. We must protect our team members. When we see or sense the risk of sexual harassment or sexual 158 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 assault, we have a duty to intervene and protect our fellow Soldiers At the Reception Battalion and during the initial phase of BCT and OSUT, Army leaders will provide y ou with information designed to inform, protect, and prevent you from becoming a victim of sexual harassment and assault, and if you do become a victim, provide you with options for reporting the incident and getting help. WHAT IS \"I. A.M. STRONG\"? Interve ne, Act, and Motivate (I. A.M.) STRONG is the Army's campaign to combat sexual harassment and sexual assault by engaging all Soldiers in preventing sexual assault before they occur. INTERVENE When I recognize a threat to my fellow Soldiers, I will have the personal courage to INTERVENE and prevent sexual assault. I will condemn acts of sexual harassment. I will not abide obscene gestures, language, or behavior. I am a Warrior and a member of a team. I will INTERVENE. ACT You are my brother, my sister, my fellow Soldier. It is my duty to stand up for you, no matter the time or place. I will take ACTION . I will do what's right. I will prevent sexual harassment and sexual assault. I will not tolerate sexually offensive behavior. I will ACT. MOTIVATE We are American Soldiers, MOTIVATED to keep our fellow Soldiers safe. It is our mission to prevent sexual harassment and sexual assault. We will denounce 159 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 sexual misconduct. As Soldiers, we are all MOTIVATED to take action. We are strongest...together Sexu al Harassment : Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that involves unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature.

Have sexual favors been demanded, requested, or suggested (especially as a condition of employment or career and job success)? 161 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Your options: Suggested individual actions to deal with sexual harassment include: Direct approach Indirect approach Third party. Report harassment to the chain of command. File a formal complaint. If you are uncomfortable because of certain sexual remarks or behaviors, you should be assertive. In responding to behavior that is or may become sexual harassment, you should tell the person how you feel. Describe what you do not like. Stay focused on the behavior and its impact. Clearly state what you want in the future. Tell any potential offender, \"I do not want to hear that again\" or, \"Do not touch me again.\" If harassment continues after you have warned the harasser of their words and actions, go to your immediate superior unless that is the person doing the harassing. In that case, go to their superior. If appropriate action is not taken, you may want to go up the chain of command to an EO advisor/ EO representative or SHARP representatives such as the SARC or VA. You can always tell a chaplain and ask for help. 162 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Sexual assault is an act intended to abuse, humiliate, harass, or degrade any person or to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person characterized by the use of force, threats, intimidation, or abuse of authority or when the victim does not or cannot consent.

Commanders and supervisors of perpetrators will take appropriate disci plinary action and/or administrative action. Male and female Soldiers can commit rape. The types of rape include physical and indirect force, date/acquaintance rape, and marital rape. Your responsibility as a Soldier is to treat your fellow Soldiers the same as you would treat your buddy, or how you would prefer to be treated. This means if you see a Soldier in danger or trouble, you must take action. What to do if you have been sexually assaulted If you have been sexually assaulted or think you have been, go to a safe location away from the perpetrator. If you want to talk with someone or want assistance, you have individuals who are ready to help.

While a chaplain cannot take a restricted report, chaplains may not disclose privileged communication revealed in the practice of their ministry without the individual's informed consent. The chaplain will rep ort incidents of sexual assault to the SARC only with the victim's consent. Unrestricted report : This option is for victims of sexual assault who desire medical treatment, counseling, legal assistance, SARC/SHARP Specialist and VA assistance .

To 167 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 honor these obligations we adopt, live by, and uphold the moral principles of the Army Ethic. Beginning with our solemn oath of service as defenders of the Nation, w e voluntarily incur the extraordinary moral obligation to be trusted Army professionals. Trusted Army professionals are Honorable Servants of the Nation \u2014Professionals of Character: We serve honorably \u2014according to the Army Ethic \u2014 under civilian authority wh ile obeying the laws of the Nation and all legal orders; further, we reject and report illegal, unethical, or immoral orders or actions. We take pride in honorably serving the Nation with integrity, demonstrating character in all aspects of our lives.

We continuously strengthen the essential characteristics of the Army Profession, reinforcing our bond of trust with each other and the American people. 9-6. Standards and principles of e thical conduct You are now part of an Army culture of trust. The Army Profession sets high standards of conduct and expectations for Soldiers to live up to not only laws and regulations, but also the moral principles of the Army. As a Soldier, you are also a member of the Executive Branch of the U.S. government. Your actions must uphold the letter and the spirit of US laws and regulations governing ethical conduct. The President has issued Executive Order 12731, known as the \"14 General Principles of Ethical Conduct\" These principles summarize the ethics laws and regulations all Soldiers must follow: 1. Public service is a public trust, requiring Soldiers to place loyalty to the Constitution, the laws and ethical principles above any private gain. 169 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 2. Soldiers will not hold financial interests that would conflict with the conscientious performance of their duty. 3. Soldiers will not engage in financial transactions using Government information that isn't avail able to the general public, or allow the improper use of such information to further any private interest. 4. All Soldiers will not, except as permitted by the Standards of Ethical Conduct, solicit or accept any gift or other item of monetary value fr om any person or entity seeking official action from, doing business with, or conducting activities regulated by the Army, or whose interests may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the Soldier's duties. 5. Soldiers will a lways put forth honest effort in the performance of their duties. 6. Soldiers will not knowingly make unauthorized commitments or promises of any kind appearing to bind the Government. 7. Soldiers will not use their public office for private gain. 8. Soldiers will act impartially and not give preferential treatment to any private organization or individual. 9. Soldiers will protect and conserve Federal property and will not use it for other than authorized activities. 10. Soldiers w ill not engage in outside employment or activities, including seeking or negotiating for employment, that conflict with official Government duties and responsibilities. 170 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 11. Soldiers will disclose waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption to appropriate authorities. 12. Soldiers will satisfy in good faith their obligations as citizens, including all financial obligations, especially those -- such as Federal, State, or local taxes -- that are imposed by law. 13. Soldiers will adhere to all laws and r egulations that provide equal opportunity for all Americans regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicap. 14. Soldiers will avoid any actions creating the appearance that they are violating the law or the ethical standards set forth in the Standards of Ethical Conduct. If you are ever confused as to what these requirements of ethical conduct mean, there are online and local resources to help make the right ethical decisions. One way to do that is to go to the Army's Office of General Counsel website and click \"ethics\" link. Your base legal office has an ethics counselor for advice, or TRADOC Ethics Counselor at (757) 501-5757 or 5659. 171 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Chapter 10 - Reference Material 10-1. The National Anthem Written by Francis Scott Key in 1814, the Star Spangled Banner was played at military occasions ordered by President Woodrow Wilson in 1916, and in 1931 w as designated as our national anthem by an Act of Congress. The Star Spangled Banner is the timeless rendition of our sacred American Flag and country's patriotic spirit. The Star Spangled Banner Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight' O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming. And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. Oh, say, does that Star -Spangled Banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? 172 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 10-2. The Army Song The Army Song tells the heroic story of our past, present, and future. It was originally written by First Lieutenant Edmund L. Gruber, a Field Artillery officer, in 1908 and it was adopted in 1952 as the official song of our Army. As a time-honored tradition, the song is played at the conclusion of every U.S. Army ceremony in which all Soldiers are expected to stand and proudly sing the lyrics. Army Song March along, sing our song, with the Army of the free. Count the brave, count the true, who have fought to victory. We're the Army and proud of our name! We're the Army and proudly proclaim. First to fight for the right, And to build the Nation's might, And The Army Goes Rolling Along. Proud of all we have done, Fighting till the battle's won, And the Army Goes Rolling Along. Then it's Hi! Hi! Hey! The Army's on its way. Count off the cadence loud and strong. For where e'er we go, you will always know, That The Army Goes Rolling Along. 10-3. The Code of Conduct The Code of Conduct is our guide for how all Solders, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard must conduct themselves if captured by the enemy. The Code of 173 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Conduct, in six brief articles addresses the intense situations and decisions that to some degree, all military services members could encounter. It contains the critical information for U.S. prisoners of war to survive honorably while faithfully resisting the enemy' s efforts of exploitation. a. I am an American, fighting in the forces which guard my country and our way of life. I am prepared to give my life in their defense. b. I will never surrender of my own free will. If in command, I will never surrender the members of my command while they still have the means to resist. c. If I am captured, I will continue to resist by all means available. I will make every effort to escape and aid others to escape. I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy. d. If I become a prisoner of war, I will keep faith with my fellow prisoners. I will give no information or take part in any action, which might be harmful to my comrades. If I am senior, I will take command. If not, I will obey the lawful orders of those appointed over me and will back them up in every way. e. When questioned, should I become a prisoner of war, I am required to give name, rank, servi ce number, and date of birth. I will evade answering further questions to the utmost of my ability. I will make no oral or written statements disloyal to my country and its allies or harmful to their cause. f. I will never forget that I am an American, fighting for freedom, responsible for my actions, and dedicated to the 174 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 principles which made my country free. I will trust in my God and in the United States of America. g. The Code of Conduct is our guide for how all Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines must conduct themselves if captured by the enemy. The Code of Conduct, in six brief articles, addresses the intense situations and decisions that, to some degree, all military service members could encounter. It contains the critical information f or U.S. prisoners of war to survive honorably while faithfully resisting the enemy's efforts of exploitation. Operations s ecurity (OPSEC ): OPSEC, is a mindset that all of us must use to protect our mission, personnel, and resources. It denies the adversary CRITICAL and SENSITIVE information about you, your organization, and missions that if observed by your adversary, can be used against us. If it's critical, wouldn't it be classifie d or something? OPSEC protects sensitive and/or critical information from adversary observation and collection in ways that traditional security programs cannot. While these programs, such as Information Assurance (IA), protect classified information, they cannot prevent all indicators of critical information, especially unclassi fied indicators, from being revealed. In concise terms, the OPSEC process identifies the critical information of military plans, operations, and supporting activities , and the indicat ors that can reveal it, and develops measures to eliminate, reduce, or conceal those indicators. So what is my critical information you may ask? First, check with your leadership, to learn what information your commander has deemed critical. It will be in your 175 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 commander's Critical Information List, or CIL. It contains informati on items that are vital to the unit's mission that if an adversary obtains it, correctly analyzes it, and acts upon it; could prevent or seriously degrade our mission success. What else is critical? A simple acronym to use is: CALI (Capabilities, Activitie s, Limitations and Intentions.) It also includes items marked For Official Use Only (FOUO), Personal Identifiable Information (PII), and sensitive medical information (HIPAA). It may also include, credit card numbers, security codes, passwords, home securi ty, financial history, and vacation plans. Always ask yourself, \"What would an adversary or Bad Guy do with the information?\" Who are the adversaries? Insiders, those with misguided or divided loyalties, careless or disgruntled employees. Foreign Intellige nce services (spies), or allied nations that collect to gain advantages over the US. Terrorists, criminals, hackers, scam artists, identity thieves, and the list goes on. How do they get my information? Social Engineering . Phone calls, emails (phishing), r equests for information about you or your organization. Is that really your bank or another unit asking for your information? Surveillance . What is in your trash/recycle bins, public web pages (.mil and unit social media sites), in your work area, or in your unencrypted emails? What discussions are you having in public? Phishing. Socially -engineered email containing infected attachments and/or hyperlinks that lead to web sites hosting malware. Personal Mobile Devices. Hackers are rapidly developing maliciou s applications and programs for new technologies. Very little security is built -in or readily 176 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 available on these devices. Social Media . What are you, your family, and fellow employees posting, texting, or placing on social media? Can it be used to social engineer or extort you? Can terrorists or criminals target you? Will it cause you or your unit harm or embarrassment? How do I protect our critical information? Encrypt your emails. DO NOT discard FOUO or other critical information in trash or recycle bins . Always think that your adversary will see all of your web postings and social media comments. Ask yourself, \"w hat could the wrong person do with this information? \" and \"c ould it compromise the safety of me, my family or my unit?\" Talk to your family and friends about OPSEC. They need to know what is critical and how to protect it from unscrupulous Figure 10- 1. Rules for OPSEC 177 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 characters and adversaries. They are proud of you and want to talk and post information about you, however, they need to know t he risks. We all need to do our part to protect our fellow Soldiers. Our adversaries are always on the lookout for us to show our capabilities, activities, limitations and i ntentions (CALI). Do your part to keep our Army strong, and practice good OPSEC! 10-4. Army Organizations Active Army and Reserve Component The U.S. Army consists of the Active Army, the ARNG and the USAR. Army unit organizations The squad/section is the smallest unit, consisting of eight to ten Soldiers. You will be assigned to a squad or a section when you report to your first unit. The platoon includes the Platoon leader, Platoon Sergeant, and two or more squads. (Normally 4 squads) The company includes the company commander, first sergeant, and two or more platoons. (Normally 3 to 4 squads per platoon) The battalion includes the battalion commander, his or her staff and headquarters, the command sergeant major, and approximately 3- 5 companies. 178 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 The brigade consists of two to five battalions. It includes the brigade commander, comm and sergeant major, and a headquarters. 179 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Chapter 11 - First Duty Station 11-1. Where Will I Serve? Our Army has Soldiers and units in every State, Commonwealth and Possession across the United States. If you are in the active component, you may find yourself stationed in Alaska, Hawaii, Japan, Germany, Korea, Italy, and Turkey. Our presence is needed around the world to defend citizens, preserve liberties, and fight for freedom. If your new unit has been designated to deploy to perform regional missions, the unit will prepare you for that deployment. 11-2. How can I prepare? The training you are receiving now is preparing you for the challenges you will meet in your first unit, as you join a new team, and establish a new group of \"battle buddies.\" Your first assignment will be even more challenging and even more rewarding than your BCT/OSUT/AIT experience, but only if you prepare yourself mentally for the journey. Have confidence and trust in your unit leaders that they will provide you wi th the knowledge, training, and physical preparation for that next gate in your professional development. 11-3. Promotions Progressing through the enlisted Army ranks is a major accomplishment. In the performance of your military duties, opportunities for education and self -development are available. This provides you with enhanced skills and allows 180 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 your leaders to assess your leadership potential. Opportunities for advancement are available for you if you are committed to pursuing these opportunities. There are two ways to get promoted to Specialist: One is automatic as long as you have no punitive actions with the following time in grade (TIG) [the amount of time you have served continuously on the rank/grade] and service (TIS) [the amount of time you have served in the Army]: Table 11 -1. Promotion time in service/grade Promotion Time in Service (TIS) Time in Grade (TIG) PVT - PV2 6 months N/A PV2 - PFC 12 months 4 months PFC - SPC 24 months 6 months The other is to receive a waiver from the Commander. The numbers available are few and depend on the Army's need for that specific rank. A waiver can be used to wave either TIS or TIG, but not both. The c ommander will pick the best Soldiers per rank to receive the waivers allocated each month. With a waiver, minimum promotion requirements are: 181 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Table 11 -2. W ith waiver promotion time in service/grade Promotion Time in Service (TIS) Time in Grade (TIG) PVT - PV2 4 months N/A PV2 - PFC 6 months 2 months PFC - SPC 18 months 3 months To get promoted to sergeant, specialists must meet the minimum TIS and TIG to be eligible and then must appear before a unit promotion board (battalion or higher) and be selected for promotion. Once the board selects you for promotion, then your promotion points are calculated. The Army assesses every month how m any s ergeants they need in your MOS. If the points drop below your number, you will be selected for promotion. The number varies from month to month. Promotions points are earned through merits (awards and certificates), schooling (both military and civilian education), and Soldie r proficiency scores (APFT and weapons qualification). Minimum TIS and TIG requirements are: Table 11 -3. Specialist promotion time in service/grade Promotion SPC - SGT Time in Service (TIS) Time in Grade (TIG) Primary Zone 35 months 7 months Secondary Zone 17 months 5 months 182 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 To excel as an Army Professional, every Soldier should set goals. Determine what you want from this opportunity to serve and continue the journey that you have embarked. Depending on the MOS and length of your contract, it is possible to make s pecialist or sergeant during your first enlistment. Whether you leave the Army at the conclusion of your enlistment or continue serving, your accomplishments will define who you are and inspire you to excel in and out of the military. Examples of goal -setting during you r first enlistment: Become proficient on every weapon system within your platoon Become licensed to drive every vehicle within your company Strive to obtain high individual scores on weapons and physical training Volunteer to attend resident military schools and courses when they become available in your MOS Work on your civilian education with a goal to receive an associate or higher degree before the end of your enlistment Represent your unit and compete for Soldier of the month selection You can learn more about promotions through your NCO support channel.

Soldier for Life Program The U.S. Army est ablished the Soldier for Life initiative in 1997 and increased focus in July 2012. The intent was to inspire Soldiers to identify with being Soldiers for Life. To be proud of their service to the Nation and conduct themselves as honorable men and women throughout their lives not only as Soldiers but as Civilians. When Soldiers return t o society as private citizens, they continue to be moral -ethical exemplars for their Families and communities. Every veteran of honorable service and Army retiree is a Soldier for Life and continues to contribute to the wel l-being of the United States of A merica. In 2012, the Army Transition Assistance Program was renamed the \"Soldier for Life\" program and redesigned to enhance employment preparation and opportunities for Soldiers leaving the Army after honorable service. Along with the Army Career and Alum ni Program (ACAP), the enhanced Soldier for Life program was established to maintain trust with our Army Family during and after service. This program is designed to enable Soldiers, Retired Soldiers, Veterans, and Families to leave military service \"Career Ready\", and connect to an established network to find employment, education, and health resources. It focuses on the current serving population to instill the Soldier for Life mindset of service. 186 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Soldier for Life- Transition Assistance Program promotes lifelong learning, individual development, and transition- related requirements throughout a Soldier's military Career. This program combines employment and education workshops and seminars tailored to prepare and connect transitioning Soldiers to meaningful civilian employment and education opportunities . Soldier for Life Centers are located on installations, posts, camps and stations where Soldiers and Families can find resources to assist them in making educated decisions and sound plans during all phases of their military lives: in - service, and post transition. The Soldier's for Life goal is to \"Start Strong, Serve Strong, and Continue Strong\" Once a Soldier, Always a Soldier..... a Soldier for Life! 187 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 This page intentionally blank . 188 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Appendix A References ARs, DA Pam phlets , FMs, and DA forms are available at https://armypubs.army.mil/ .

Some common entries in this section include: Base Pay: Soldiers base pay is taxable and is calculated according to pay grade and years of service. Allowances: Soldiers are entitled to non-taxable allowances in addition to monthly base pay. Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS). BAS is tax-free money the Army pays Soldiers who are not relying on Dining Facilities (DFACs) for all their meals ( for example, married Soldiers). Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) is tax-free money the Army pays Soldiers for housing. Clothing Allowance (CA). Active duty enlisted Soldiers are paid a tax free Clothing Allowance to defray the cost of maintaining uniforms and replacing worn -out uniforms. 3. Deductions. There may be several deductions taken out of Soldier's pay, such as taxes and fines. 194 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 4. Allotments.

B-2. Managing personal finances It is your duty as a Soldier to fulfill all your financial obligations and provide for your Family members. There are 195 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 several key components to achieving this task. Here are 5 ways to get started: Set financial goals. Whether it's to get out of debt or build wealth, start with a clearly defined goal. Plan for your paycheck with a budget to meet all your financial obligations. Protect against financial emergencies with adequate insurance, a proper estate plan, and emergency savings. Be responsible with Debt and Credit ...especially when purchasing a vehicle. Save for retirement by contributing at least 5% of your pay to your TSP. If you need assistance, visit your installation's Sol dier support center for money management services. Setting Financial Goals : Promotions, bonuses, incentive pay and other pay increases are likely to happen throughout your Army career. To make the most of these financial opportunities, it's a good idea to write out clearly defined financial goals. Examples of these goals might be to get out of debt, establish an emergency fund, invest towards retirement, or save for a major purchase. Financial goals provide you guidance on how to best utilize your money and make smart financial decisions. MyPay: Soldiers can review and print their leave and earnings statement, thrift savings plan i nvestments, savings deposit program Statement, allotments, savings bonds purchases, and direct deposit amounts at 196 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 https://mypay.dfas.mil/mypay.aspx. Ensure you visit the official military web site only. Sure -Pay program: The Army requires all Soldiers to enroll in the sure- pay program. This means that you must have your paycheck deposited directly to a checking or savings account. If you close or change this account, you must ensure that you go to MyPay and update account information. The Army will pay you once per month on the first of each month, or twice per month on the 1 st and the 15th - your choice based on your budget requirements. You must carefully review your monthly leave and earning statement to ensure that your pay is being deposited properly and you are receiving all of the benefits (Base Pay, Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH), et c.) that you are entitled. Bank deposit account: There are some key items to consider when choosing the financial institution at which you will keep your direct deposit account. First, inquire if there is a monthly service charge for maintaining a checking account. Numerous institutions offer free checking, a s long as you have set up Sure- Pay. The Army requires frequent moves so find an institution that can accommodate your mobile lifestyle. Next, create a plan for every dollar for every paycheck. Build a budget and track all cash inflows and outflows. Remember to allocate some for savings and some for investing. 197 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Finally, it's a recommendation to establish a separate savings account for emergencies. Start with a small goal, like a $1,000 balance, and then s ave towards 3 -6 months of living expenses. Service Members Civil Relief Act (SCRA): The SCRA offers many benefits and protections to Soldiers and their Families. It allows a service member to postpone or suspend certain civil actions while mobilized or deployed for active duty, including evictions, mortgage foreclosures, bankruptcies and other civil lawsuits. It covers all military service members from the date they enter active duty through 30 to 90 days after active duty discharge. The SCRA also offers pr otection against high interest rate debt secured prior to entry into Active Duty; capping interest rates on qualifying debt at 6%. Ensure you call all debtors (credit cards, car loans, personal loans, etc.) as soon as possible and notify them of your servi ce, and that the SCRA should apply to your debt. Failure to comply can result in legal action. Military Lending Act: The Military Lending Act limits the annual percentage rate for credit to no more than 36 percent and includes associated costs of the loan, like fees and the sale of credit products sold with the loan. This rate is known as the military annual percentage rate, or MAPR. Additionally, the Military Lending Act prohibits mandatory arbitration, difficult contract provisions, using an allotment to secure the loan, waiving Servicemembers Civil Relief Act rights, charging a penalty for early payments, using a post - dated check to secure a loan, refinancing certain loans and the use of bank accounts and car titles to secure certain 198 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 other loans. Current protections cover payday, vehicle title and tax refund anticipation loans. Purchases made through rent-to-own and overdrafts on checking accounts are not covered. Lastly, while a local bank may be your best option, you may have to change accounts when you make a permanent change of station move. Check writing: You must pay close attention to each transaction to ensure you always know your checking account balance; this ensures you have sufficient funds in the account and do not write a fraudulent check. Managing debt and maintaining good credit are important to your Army career. Establish a good credit reputation by paying back debts on time, every time, and avoid carrying debt whenever possible. Be thoughtful when making a major purchase, especially when buying a vehicle. Carefully weigh the impact of a purchase to your current and future situation. There are several consequences for writing a bad check, service charges, negative credit ratings, and additional punishments if the check was used on post. Retiremen t - Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) : Although retirement may seem a long way off, the sooner you start saving the better off you will be. A delay of only 5 years in starting contributions could mean several hundred thousand dollars later! The Army's retirem ent contribution system is the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). TSP contributions can be started on 199 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 MyPay and managed at: https:// www.tsp.gov. In most cases for new Soldiers the ROTH option (paying taxes upfront but no taxes on interest when the money is withdrawn) is better, but it is important to research all options and talk to the financial planner at your Soldier Support Center. Military One Source : Military One Source and many other resources are available online to help you determine how much to save, and how much money will be needed in retirement. The DOD Blended Retirement System (BRS) information The new retirement system is known as the \"Blende d Retirement System\" or BRS. The \"blending\" in BRS comes from the blending of two major sources of retirement income: the existing annuity provision for those who retire after 20 or more years of service, PLUS the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) . The TSP is a government run 401(k) retirement account that allows members to invest their own money in either stocks or government securities and also get a contribution to that accoun t from their employer. BRS will use the annuity formula currently in place: the average of the service member's highest 36 months of basic pay times 2.5% of their years of service -- but the 2.5% is adjusted downward by half of a percentage point, from 2.5 to 2%. The best part of having a TSP contribution really applies to those who don't stay in the military long enough to get a retirement check. The government says that 83% of people who join the military don't stay long enough to retire, so when they leave after 5 or 10 years of military service they 200 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 basically get nothing towards their future retirement. This plan changes that. By contributing to the TSP, military members can leave the service at any time and have an existing retirement fund that they can take with them anywhere. Even if they get out of the military before completing 20 years they would keep the money they have in their TSP fund. The new system is made up of 3 specific components: 1. Defined Benefit: Retired pay will be 2% times the number of years of service. If you retire at 20 years of service you get 40% of your final base pay. If you retire at 30 years of service you get 60% of your final base pay. You can either get your full retirement when eligible or opt to get a lump- sum benefit at retirement. If you take the lump- sum you will get a reduced monthly retirement check until age 67. 2. Defined Contribution: The military will contribute 1% of your base pay to your TSP. You will be automatically enrolled with a 3% base pay contribution to your TSP. (You can change this at any time.) The military will match up to 5% of your contribution after 2 years of service. You can always stop contributing to the TSP, get a loan of your TSP balance, or withdraw your money from the TSP account. 201 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 3. Continuation Pay: When you reach 12 years of service and commit to 4 more years of service you will be eligible for a cash incentive of 2.5 to 13 times your regular monthly basic pay if you are active duty and 0.5 to 6 times you monthly basic pay if you are in the reserves. For More Information about The Blended Retirement System: DFAS has several resources that explain the BRS on their website. Members will receive BRS training at their units. The D epartment Of Defense also has a BRS calculator online. 202 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Figure B -2. Retirement system B-3. Tri -Service Health Care (TRICARE) The Army is dedicated to taking care of its most important assets, Soldiers and military Family members. 203 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 TRICARE is the Department of Defense's worldwide health care program available to eligible beneficiaries from the uniformed services. TRICARE is free to Soldiers but may involve some out - of- pocket expen ses for Family members. The cost varies depending on the Soldier's rank and the specific TRICARE program option in which the Family member is enrolled. Through the TRICARE program, Family members can also go to civilian health care providers if they desire. But before going to a civilian practitioner, Fam ily members should talk to the beneficiary counseling and a ssistance coordinator at the nearest military health care facility to see if there are any out-of-pocket expenses. The beneficiary counseling and assistance coordinator will confirm your registration in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), and can provide a list of doctors in your local area who will accept TRICARE patients. When permitted, visit TRICARE online for more inform ation on your military health benefits and regional health plans \u2014 B-4. Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (SGLI) As a United States Soldier, you may encounter hostile situations while stationed abroad and in combat. The well - being of your Family is of t he greatest concern to the Army. One of the many benefits afforded Soldiers is the opportunity to purchase very low -cost life insurance. SGLI provides up to a maximum of $400,000. SGLI automatically covers you for this maximum amount unless you select , in writing a lesser amount, in increments of $50,000. You may also decline SGLI altogether, but this decision is so 204 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 important that you must also do that in writing. The payment is deducted automatically from your pay each month. Soldiers with Families almost always select coverage in the maximum amount. Spouses and children are eligible for Family SGLI. Coverage for a spouse is automatically $100,000 unless a lesser amount, in steps of $10,000, is chosen. When permitted, visit the Service member's Life Insurance website maintained by the Department of Veterans Affairs for additional information and assistance with enrollment \u2014 B-5. Dental The level of dental ca re will vary from post to post, but it is available for all Soldiers. Family member care is generally not available at military dental facilities. Family members may get dental insurance through the TRICARE Dental Program (TDP) . The TDP is dental insurance in which you pay a monthly fee in exchange for Family coverage. It is a voluntary, cost effective, comprehensive program offered wor ldwide by the Department of Defense to Family members of all active duty branches of the military, Selected Reserve, and Individual Ready Reserve members and their Family members. Just as is the case for TRICARE health care, Family members must be register ed in DEERS to be eligible for the TRICARE Dental Program. In order to participate, the Soldier must have 12 months left on his or her service commitment at the time of enrollment, and submit an enrollment form with the first month's 205 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 premium or enroll onli ne using a charge card. The monthly premiums will usually be deducted from the Soldier's pay, although there are other payment options. Depending on the dental procedures performed, treatment may be completely covered by the insurance, or there may be co -payments required. There is a maximum annual amount that TRICARE will pay for any one beneficiary. Once that yearly amount is reached for the individual, all costs above the maximum must be paid for by the Family. When permitted, complete information and instructions on how to enroll and find a local dental provider are available on-line at the TRICARE Dental site . B-6. Army Emergency Relief Army Emergency Relief (AER) is a private nonprofi t organization incorporated in 1942 by the Secretary of War and the Army Chief of Staff. AER's mission is to provide emergency financial assistance to Soldiers and their Families. What can AER do?

The Army -wide annual AER fund campaign is conducted 1 March -15 May. You can contribute to your local AER fund campaign or send your contribution to AER National Headquarters. All contributions are tax deductible. Unsolicited donations are accepted any time by mail or on-line. For more information contact your local AER officer or visit the AER website . B-7. Soldier for Life and c redentialing If you serve faithfully and honorably, you are a Soldier for Life, whether you are in the active or reserve components, or serve for one enlistment or a long career. The Army wants to be a partner in your lifelong success. Everyone leaves active duty at some point, and most will 209 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 need (or want) a civilian job. We want to help you have a successful transition to civilian life and civilian employment. It's never too early to start thinking about your long -term goals and taking steps, even small ones, to achieve them. While in the Army, you will learn valuable skills. Strive to be the best in your specialty. One of the reasons veterans sometimes have trouble finding jobs is that they have trouble explaining their military experience in terms that are meaningful to civilian employers. One of the best ways to do that is by earning a credential . A credential is government license (usually state governments) or a certification from a non- government credentialing agency. Commercial truck driver's licenses and medical licenses are examples of government -issued credentials. Non-government cre dentialing agencies that offer certifications include the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence, the American Culinary Federation, and the American Welding Society. You can learn about credentials related to your MOS on the website \" Army Credentialing Opportunities On -line (or do a search under \"Army COOL\"). You will learn more about credentialing in your military training and from the leaders in your unit of assignment. Soldiers in some fields are required to earn credentials, such as an FAA license for Air Traffic Controllers, but for most Soldiers, credentialing programs are voluntary. 210 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 You may work on a credential on your own, or you might have the opportunity to participate in an Army sponso red credentialing program. Most of these programs are offered to students in Army schools. When you go to an Army School, you might be asked if you want to volunteer to take a credentialing exam. The Army might give you study material, including web-based training. They might pay your fees and make arrangements for you to take the exam. We encourage you to take advantage of these programs, take them seriously, and study. You might earn a valuable credential that will someday make your job application stand out. The Army believes that studying for a credential in your field makes you a more well-rounded Soldier, and it is one sign that you are a true professional in your military specialty. It is difficult to provide general information about credentials, because there is so much variety among military specialties and among credentials and credentialing agencies. Some military specialties (for example, Motor Transport Operators, Wheeled Vehicle Mechanics, Food Service Specialists, and many others) closely matc h civilian jobs. Other valuable military specialties, such as Infantrymen and Armor Crew Members, do not match civilian jobs. If you are in a specialty that does not closely match a civilian job and does not have a lot of credentialing opportunities, there are several things you can do. 211 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Some of these are good ideas for all Soldiers: In the words of the Chief of Staff of the Army, the best credential is often a college degree. When you finish your Initial Military Training, talk the Career Counselor in your unit and to an Education Counselor, they can advise you about continuing your education. Remember that you are still learning life skills that will be valuable to an employer. Army Veterans tend to be reliable, hard -working, goal -oriented, \"team players\" a nd drug -free. As a future Non - Commissioned Officer (sergeant), you will learn leadership, effective communication, how to train others, and how to supervise a job site. Even if your \"main job\" doesn't match a civilian job, take advantage of any opportunit ies that come your way to learn new skills, for example, computer skills and operating and maintaining different types of equipment. Keep checking! The Army is developing new credentialing opportunities. Tips and Precautions: One of the reasons that some credentials are so valuable is that they are hard to get. If you sign up for a credentialing exam, study! If you did your best, don't be discouraged if you don't pass on the first try. Remember everything you learned by studying to take the exam, and consi der trying again. 212 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 If you choose a credential to work on, be sure that the credential is the right one for you. Before you spend your money or use up some of your military benefits, make sure that the credential is offered by a reputable agency and is known and valued by employers. Many credentials have re- certification requirements or continuing education requirements. Know what they are. Army COOL, Army Career Tracker, and credentialing agency websites contain a wealth of information. Talk to your instruct ors and leaders, your unit Career Counselor and education counselors. Ask questions! B-8. Information websites for family members The Army recognizes the important role that spouses and Family members play in supporting Soldiers and in keeping our Army com munities strong. Each Army installation has its own website that is full of useful information for your Family and can be found by searching for the name of the installation on the internet. Be sure to look for the official site indicated by the ending \"army.mil\" in the web address. We have provided you with a few useful websites to vital information sources throughout this Blue Book and additional sources are located below. It is extremely important to you and the Army that we link your Family members with resources to help integrate them into the Army lifestyle. 213 TRADOC Pamphlet 600- 4 Use these websites and the others embedded in this book as you progress through your career from BCT to your first unit of assignment.
