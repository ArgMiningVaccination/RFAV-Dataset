Pull the tick out perpendicularly to the skin. Do not aggravate the tick. Pull gently and swiftly. Do not apply Vaseline or any other agent (including lighting it on fire) prior to removal. However, you may apply an antimicrobial ointment, liniment or salve to the area after removal. Take homeopathic Ledum 30 C (up to three times per day) if embedded and you can't get the head out. Take for 1-3 days. If you have identified it as a female deer tick, send it away for testing so you know what you are dealing with. You can also have it tested for co-infections for an additional fee.

You can pick up a tincture at the office: 4 dropperfuls, three times per day. Plus the homeopathic tick borne infection nosode. THOUGH if you get a rash, fever, stiff neck/joints, headache etc, begin antibiotics treatment right away. Doxycycline is usually the best choice for older kids and adults. 100 mg 2x/day. There is now evidence to suggest that the preventive, one-day course of doxycycline is not effective. * If the tick comes back positive, I recommend continuing treatment with antibiotics and herbs. Get yourself tested (western blot), 4-6 weeks after initial tick bite, though is you have been on antibiotics, then the test may come back falsely negative. If you have questions that have not been answered after reading this, please schedule an appointment. Thank you. *For references please see Dr. Betty Malone's work on the prophylactic doses and duration of antibiotics "}
