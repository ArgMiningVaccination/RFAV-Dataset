What is Immunity: Immunity of an individual is defined as the ability of the body to defend itself against disease-causing organisms. In our daily life, our body comes in contact with several pathogens, but only a few results into diseases. This is because our body has the ability to release antibodies against these pathogens and protects the body against diseases. This defence mechanism is called immunity & Ayurveda helps to Boost Immunity Naturally. The work of the immune system is to protect the body from possibly harmful substances by recognising and responding to antigens and pathogens. Antigens are substances (usual proteins) that present on the surface of viruses, cells, fungi, or bacteria. And also, some of the chemicals, drugs, toxins, and foreign particles (such as a splinter) can also be antigens. Thus, the immune system recognizes and destroys, or tries to destroy, substances that contain antigens. We hope now you understand what is immunity, Further, let us explain the type of Immunity. Types of Immunity - There are Mainly Two Types of Immunity: - Innate immunity or natural immunity - Acquired immunity or adaptive immunity Innate Immunity: This type of immunity is present in an organism by birth. This is activated immediately when the pathogen attacks. It includes certain barriers and defense mechanisms that keep foreign particles out of the body. This immunity helps us by providing the natural resistance components, including natural killer cells, salivary enzymes, intact skin, and neutrophils, etc. which produce an initial response against the infections at birth prior to exposure to an antigen. Cells involved in innate Immunity: Phagocytes, Macrophages, Basophils, Neutrophils, Eosinophils, Natural killer cells, and Dendritic cells. Acquired Immunity: Acquired Immunity is the immunity that our body gains or acquired over time. The ability of the immune system is to adapt itself to disease and generate pathogen-specific immunity. This type of immunity acquires immediate after birth. Hence it is called as the acquired immunity. The main work of this type of immunity is to relieve the victim of the infectious disease, and also prevent its attack in the future. Ayurvedic Concept of Immunity: In Ayurveda, Immunity is termed as 'Vyadikshamathva' The word Vyadhikshamathva is formed by two words Vyadi + Kshamathva : - Vyadhi means - Disease - Kshamathva means - Resistance Hence, it is defined as the capacity of the body to resist the body. Some Ayurvedic Acharyas has termed other names for immunity, they are : - Vyadhi bala viroditvam - means the capacity of the body to fight against the manifested diseases. - Vyadhi utpadaka pradibandhakatvam - It describes that the capacity of the body to resist the pathogenic process of forming diseases. In other words, [Immunity in Ayurveda](https://www.deepayurveda.com/product/da-immuno-immune-booster-herbal-supplement/) defines as the prevention of disease and quick recovery from disease. A healthy immune system is represented by the physical, mental, and emotional, as well as the spiritual resilience of an individual. This resilience is a result of the purified essence of the Tridosha (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha). Our immunity is related to the health of our tissues. The quintessence of all the tissues of the body is known as 'Ojas'. Ojas is described as vital energy which prevades all cells, tissues, and spaces. It is if two types : - Para Ojas : It exists in a quantity of eight drops and is located within the heart, when it decreases or loses, it leads to death. - Apara Ojas : It is distributed throughout the whole body. Types of Immunity in Ayurveda - It can be classified into 3 Types : - Sahaja Bal (natural or congenital) - It comes from the parents. According to Ayurvedic theory on genetics, genetic factors are defined at the cellular level and entire cell is referred to as beeja; beeja bhaga is the nucleus, and avayava are the chromosomes. If genes of the parents are healthy, the same health is seen in the children, whereas if their genetic composition includes susceptibility to certain diseases, those diseases will also carried over the next generation. - Kalaja Bal (time, age, and season) - It is inclusive of one's time, day of week, and place of birth and their impact. Certain places have stronger and healthier environmental and climate conditions like, places with an abundant of ponds, water, pleasant climatic conditions. Kapha dominating areas are contributing to stronger immunity. - Yuktikruta Bal (acquired) - It represents acquired immunity. Major Functions of Immunity (Vyadikshamathva): - Having a mind free of depression and anxiety (Harsh) - Improves health (Arogya anuvarthana) - Inhibits the effects of diseases (Vyadi bala vighatha) - Heals wound (Vrana dosha nigraha) Seasonal Effects on Immunity: According to the Ayurvedic concept, season from autumn to winter or winter to spring, tend to have a weakening effect on our immune system and body, and we become more susceptible to various infections. Our metabolic and digestive system functions vary in each season. As a result, during the transition between one season to another, our digestive fire (agni) can fluctuate, this can lead to incomplete digestion and build-up of partially digested food (ama) in our tissues. If we don't adopt dietary and lifestyle changes and appropriate Ayurvedic seasonal guidelines, Ama became more toxic and effectively leads to the formation of various diseases. If our immune system is not that strong, our body becomes a fertile ground for harmful bacterias, allergens, and viruses. Factors that Promote Immunity: - Excellence of the qualities of sperm and ovum of the parents - Birth in a country where people are naturally strong - Favorable season and time - Regular exercises - Excellent physical strength - Excellence of mind How We Can [Increase ](https://www.deepayurveda.com/product/natural-immune-booster-pack/) [Immunity in Ayurveda](https://www.deepayurveda.com/product/da-immuno-immune-booster-herbal-supplement/): A person can follow these guidelines in their daily lifestyle to maintain & to improve immunity: - By maintaining tripodes of life - Food (ahara), Sleep (nindra), and Celibacy - Regular use therapies (rasayana), Aphrodisiacs (vajeekarana) - By adopting Ayurvedic guidelines regarding Seasonal regimen (ritucharya), Daily regimen (dincharya) - Maintaining proper digestive power. - Regular use of Rasayana, it will help for promoting good health, and also rejuvenates the body.
