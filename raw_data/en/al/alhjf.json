They are not standards of care and compliance to guideline recom mendations is voluntary. The International Chiropractors Association (ICA) r ecognizes that alternative practices and approaches are possible and may be pr eferable under certain clinical conditions. Nothing in these guidelines s hall be taken as a legal or absolute clinical measure against which the behavio r, activities or performance of any individual practitioner in any specific case should be held. The ultimate judgement regarding the propriety of an y specific procedure or clinical decision must be made by the attending doc tor in light of the circumstances presented by each individual patient. It is not the purpose of this document, which is ad visory in nature, to take precedence over any federal, state or local statute , rule regulation or ordinance which may affect chiropractic practice, or over a r ating or determination previously made by judicial or administrative proce eding.5FOREWORD The International Chiropractors Association (ICA) r ecognizes, as do all realistic and responsible professional organizations, that in the current cli mate of accountability and concern for quality and appropriateness of care, clinical practice protocol s and guidelines for all health professions are in the public interest. It is vitally important to recognize, ho wever, that such protocols and guidelines are not a substitute for legal obligations and authorities, nor a replac ement for the best clinical, ethical and profession al judgement of the attending doctor. All doctors of chiropractic must practice within t he rules and procedures established in their respec tive states and jurisdictions, and within their best jud gement. The protocols and guidelines presented he re recognize and respect these immutable obligations o n the doctor's part, also recognizing that no gener al guidelines can offer specific recommendations for c are for any individual patient as each patient is n ot only different, but unique in their condition and need f or care. These practice protocols are a reflection of the gr owing consensus within the chiropractic profession on the general parameters of chiropractic science a nd practice. They are also offered to the professi on and the public in the context of the Statement on the Chir opractic Paradigm first developed and adopted by th e Association of Chiropractic Colleges and subsequent ly endorsed, approved or adopted by most of the maj or chiropractic organizations in the United States. This Paradigm Statement has been unanimously appro ved and adopted by the Board of Directors of the Intern ational Chiropractors Association, and the ICA hear tily embraces and shares the core values reflected in th is widely adopted position statement. These pract ice protocols seek to embody the spirit of this broadl y supported position statement which reads, in part , as follows: Chiropractic is a health care discipline which emph asizes the inherent recuperative power of the body to heal itself without the use of drugs or surgery. The practice of chiropractic focuses on the relatio nship between the structure (primarily the spine) and function (as coordinated by the nervous system) and how that relationship affects the preservation and restoration of health. In add ition, Doctors of Chiropractic recognize the value and responsibility of working in cooperation with other health care practitioners when in the best interest of the patient. ICA has submitted this document for profession-wide and public examination and comment for a period of six months via the Internet and through widespre ad circulation of printed copies of this protocol i n draft form prior to publishing this completed version. Over 20 0 comments and submissions were received from the chiropractic profession during that time. All of t hose comments were carefully reviewed and evaluated by the Clinical Practice Protocols and Guidelines Committe e of the International Chiropractors Association an d major revisions and corrections of the draft were made as a result of this extensive positive input. Over 1 00 comments were also received from members of the public. The nature of those public comments and inquiries assi sted the committee in shaping this document to provide f or better patient/consumer understanding of chiropr actic procedures and practice protocols. For a period of nearly two years, the draft of this document was subject to the critical review and in put from the Board of Directors, Representative Assembl y and postgraduate councils of the International Chiropractors Association. These organizational bod ies are comprised of over l00 individuals from all parts of the United States and Canada, as well as many natio ns around the world. In many respects, this group fulfilled6an organizational peer review function both before and after the document was submitted for profession -wide and public comment. The input from these people has ha d a significant impact on the nature and quality of the final version of these protocols. ICA fully appreciates the likelihood of important improvements coming from the on-going research and review process and pledges full and objective consi deration of all new clinical, scientific, and other relevant developments. ICA is committed to the maintenance of this document and pledges ongoing review and the issuance of a revised edition of these guidelines n o less than every four years, or as dictated by res earch, legislative, legal or other developments. The procedure and methodologies employed in the dev elopment of these guidelines were initially drawn from procedures developed by Herve Guillain, M.D., S enior Policy Analyst, with the Agency for Health Ca re Policy and Research, Washington, DC. However, thes e AHCPR procedures were developed to evaluate specific conditions and the effectiveness of the va rious treatments offered for those conditions. The reach of this document extends far beyond any one specific condit ion and attempts to deal with the practice of an en tire profession. Therefore, other authorities, includin g state and federal statutes, educational standards and requirements, the judicial record, and professional consensus, have been consulted. Furthermore, these protocols are intended to refle ct the core values and policies of the Internationa l Chiropractors Association, as articulated in the ab ove referenced Statement on the Chiropractic Paradi gm. The International Chiropractors Association underst ands that there are wide areas in chiropractic clinical practice where no concrete parameters will ever be possible and that there remains a wide are a of discretion available to the individual practitioner . The judgement of the practitioner is vital in th ese areas, and it is hoped that these protocols offer any doctor o f chiropractic support and guidance in these areas of discretion to help meet the needs of the patient in a clinical ly sound and ethical manner. In a paper entitled, \" The Agenda for Health Care Policy and Research and the Development of Clinical Guidelines,\" Dr. Herve Guillain wrote: \"The mission of the Agency is to enhance the qualit y, appropriateness, and effectiveness of health care services as well as to improve access to these services.\" This is also the central mission of these chiroprac tic clinical practice protocols. Chiropractic care has been evaluated to a greater d egree than most medical interventions. A large and growing body of clinical research comprised of tria ls, observations, outcome assessments, etc. exist a s a basis for evaluating chiropractic procedures. Overwhelmi ngly, regardless of methodology, chiropractic has b een demonstrated to be safe and effective for patients of all ages. ICA also recognizes that the operatio nal basis for many health care procedures rests on decades o f clinical experience, and that \"gold standard\" res earch findings simply do not exist as a means to definiti vely evaluate most aspects of all health care pract ices. ICA values and respects the great body of clinical experience collectively gained in over a century of clinical chiropractic practice. That body of knowl edge and experience is a worthy basis on which to b ase procedural and clinical protocols until such time a s replicated research findings offer a basis for ch anging prevailing thinking. The International Chiropracto rs Association is dedicated to fully exploring and understanding the potential of chiropractic science, and its limi tations. The ICA urges the widest possible researc h on all aspects chiropractic science and practice and under stands that such findings might certainly have a si gnificant impact on the nature of these practice protocols. After careful review of all literature and document s produced to date and an evaluation of the other7sources of authority and experience, we are confide nt that the enclosed practice protocols offer a res ponsible and clinically sound guide to the practice of chiro practic worldwide. Understanding These Practice Protocols: A. Introduction The majority of standard procedures utilized by all health providers, have not been validated by forma l scientific methodology. Various sources have cited findings that indicate only about 15% of medical interventions are supported by valid evidence and m any may have never been assessed objectively at all ( Smith R, Eddy D). Thus, where possible valid evidence wi ll be used and appropriately weighted. In those fr equent situations where such studies do not exist, the cum ulative weight of clinical experience will be the f rame of reference and the validating mechanism for protocol components. B. Format These protocols and guidelines appear in topic chap ters under the following headings: Chiropractic Science and Practice; Authorities and Definitions; Basic Essential Care; Subluxation Guidelines; Chiropractic Child Care Public Health; Collaborative Care; Consultation , History and Examination; Record Keeping and Patient Consents; Clinical Impression; Modes of Care; Frequency and Duration of Care; Reassessment; Assessment; Professional Development. Diagnostic Imaging; Instrumentation; and Contraindi cations and Complications. Each chapter is organized according to a similar ou tline, namely: I. Overview; II. List of Subtopics; III. Literature Review; IV. Recommendations; V. Comments , Summary or Conclusion; and VI. References. There are instances, however, in which a slightly varied format is followed, depending on the nature of the information presented. The \"Recommendations\" in each chapter are the guide lines. Subjects covered by guidelines in each chapter are indicated in the \"list of subtopics.\" Ratings Systems - Procedure Ratings (System I) This system is suited to scientific/technical areas of practice: 1. Procedures are judged, in descending order of app roval, established, promising, equivocal, investigational, doubtful and inappropriate. 2. The first three ratings (established, promising, and equivocal) are all positive. The remaining three ratings ( investigational, doubt ful, and inappropriate) are negative. A procedure currently rated \"investigational\" has the potential to be raised to an acceptable level and a positive rating on the basis of future clinical and scientific evidence. A specific procedure may have more than one current rating depending upon the circumstances in which it is used. As noted previously, the rating chosen for a proced ure is linked to the quality of evidence in support of utilization of that procedure.8Procedure Ratings (System II) This system is suited to procedural/administrative aspects of practice. Accordingly it is used in chapters such as Collaborative Care, Consultation, History and Examination, and Record Keeping and Pa tient Consents . 1. Rating levels are: necessary, recommended, discr etionary and unnecessary. 2. Rating is once again linked to quality of evidenc e - see Figure 2 for details. Special Rating System for Complications A special third rating system has been developed fo r the unique area of potential complications of hig h- velocity thrust procedures. - Contraindications an d Complications) The basic rating is the level of contraindication, which may be: No identifiable contraindication Special circumstances: Situations in which clinic al findings indicate the need for additional evaluation or in which high-velocity thrust procedu res may be used with additional appropriate care and/or modification\" Special circumstances situations to identifiable co ntraindication: \"careful clinical judgment dictates whether special care is needed or an ident ifiable contraindication is present with each specific patient\" Identifiable contraindication. Chapter 17 lists the various potential complication s and/or the need to adapt or modify high-thrust procedures under categories of: Articular Derangements Bone Weakening and Destructive Disorders Circulatory and Cardiovascular Disorders Neurological Disorders Rating System (III) A. Types 1. Strong positive recommendation: The doctor of ch iropractic, under most circumstances, would employ the procedure. 2. Positive recommendation: The doctor of chiropra ctic, under many circumstances would employ the procedure. 3. Discretionary: The chiropractor under some circu mstances would employ the procedure. 4. No recommendation: The circumstances within whic h this procedure would be appropriate have not been determined. B. Support Categories: 1. E: Based on available expert opinion, clinical e xperience or effectiveness studies. 2. L: Based on available refereed literature or pub lished monographs, legal decisions and/or authority ,9statutory authority, statement of professional cons ensus. 3. C: Based on available controlled studies. Procedure Ratings (System I) Established: Accepted as appropriate by the practicing chiroprac tic community for a given indication in the specified patient population. Promising : Given current knowledge, this appears to be appr opriate for the given indication in the specified patient population. As more experience and long-te rm follow-up are accumulated, this interim rating w ill change. This connotes provisional acceptance, but permits a greater role for the current level of clinical us e. Equivocal: Current knowledge exists to support a given indic ation in a specified patient population, though value can neither be confirmed nor denied. As more evidence and experience accumulates this rating wi ll change. Expert opinion recognizes a need for cauti on in general application. Investigational : Evidence is insufficient to determine appropriat eness. Further study is warranted. Use for a given indication in a specified patient populatio n should be confined to research protocols. As mor e experience and evidence accumulate, this rating wil l change. Doubtful: Given current knowledge, this appears to be inapp ropriate for the given indication in the specified patient population. As more experience and long-te rm follow-up are accumulated, this interim rating w ill change. Inappropriate: Regarded by the practicing chiropractic community as unacceptable for the given indication in the specified patient population. Quality of Evidence Class I: Evidence provided by one or more well-designed co ntrolled clinical trials; or well-designed experim ental studies that address reliability, validity, positiv e predictive value, discriminability, sensitivity, and specificity. Class II: Evidence provided by one or more well-designed co ntrolled observational clinical studies, such as case-control, cohort studies, etc.; or positive pr edictive value, discriminability, sensitivity, and specificity; and published in refereed journals. Class III: Evidence provided by expert opinion, descriptive studies or case reports. Strength of Recommendation Ratings Type A: Strong positive recommendations. Based on Class I evidence or overwhelming Class II evidence when circumstances preclude randomized clinical trials. Type B: Positive recommendation based on Class II evidenc e. Type C: Positive recommendation based on strong consensus of Class III evidence. Type D: Negative recommendation based on inconclusive or conflicting Class II evidence. Class E: Negative recommendation based on evidence of inef fectiveness or lack of efficacy based on Class I or Class II evidence. Figure 2 Procedure Ratings (System II)10Necessary : Strong positive recommendation based on Class I evidence, or overwhelming Class II evidence when circumstances reflect compromise of patient sa fety. Recommended : Positive recommendation based on consensus of Cl ass II and/or strong Class III evidence. Discretionary: Positive recommendation based on strong consensus of Class III evidence. Unnecessary: Negative recommendation based on inconclusive or conflicting Class II, III evidence. Quality of Evidence The following categories of evidence are used to su pport the ratings: Class I: A. Evidence of clinical utility from controlled stud ies published in refereed journals. B. Binding or strongly persuasive legal authority su ch as legislation or case law. Class II: A. Evidence of clinical utility from the significant results of uncontrolled studies in refereed journals. B. Evidence provided by recommendations from publish ed expert legal opinion or persuasive case law. Class III: A. Evidence of clinical utility provided by opinions of experts, anecdote and/or by convention. B. Expert legal opinion. REFERENCES Rachlis N, Kuschner C.

References12- 13 -I. OVERVIEW Chiropractic is a very specific health care science applied by doctors of chiropractic who practice under an extensive body of authorities. T hese authorities have evolved over more than a century of legislative and judicial development, ed ucational growth, practical experience and professional consensus. Like other first professio nal degree holders, the doctor of chiropractic is a carefully regulated professional who must qualify o n a number of levels to obtain the right to practic e. This introductory chapter outlines the exact natur e of the authorities under which contemporary doctors of chiropractic practice and sets out those basic definitions that explain and delineate the essential elements of chiropractic science and its practice. Chiropractic science is an approach to human health that was developed through extensive anatomical study in which the elements of the human system, particularly the spine and nervous system continue to be examined in an effort to unde rstand the relationship between the state of those anatomical elements and optimal human health. The basic premise of chiropractic science is that abnormalities and misalignments of the spine, defin ed as subluxation(s) in chiropractic science, can and do distort and interrupt the normal function of the nervous system and may create serious negative health consequences. The correction and/or reduction of subluxation(s) through the adjustment of spinal structures can remove nervous system interference and restore the optimal function of the body. Essential to basic chiropractic theory is the concept of the inh erent ability of the human body to effectively heal itself, comprehend the environment and function in a normal manner. This concept is important since chiropractic perceives spinal subluxation(s) as bar riers to normal function and obstacles to the body' s innate intelligence. Chiropractic has enjoyed over a century of lively a nd serious scientific and conceptual debate. The chiropractic profession has benefited enormous ly from this on-going self-examination and reality testing based on the scientific and research record . The outcome of those years of critical evaluatio n and debate, which remain on-going, has been a stron g consensus regarding the nature of chiropractic science and practice and the key definitions that s et chiropractic apart as a distinct, unique health care science and practice. This consensus is best depic ted by the unanimous adoption of a paradigm statement by the Association of Chiropractic Colleg es, International Chiropractors Association, American Chiropractic Association, Federation of Ch iropractic Licensing Boards, Council on Chiropractic Education, the National Board of Chiro practic Examiners and the Congress of Chiropractic State Associations. This paradigm statement reads as follows: Chiropractic is a health care discipline which emph asizes the inherent recuperative power of the body to heal itself without the use of drugs or surgery. The practice of chiropractic focuses on the relatio nship between the structure (primarily the spine) and function (as coordinated by the nervous system) and how that relationship affects the preservation and restoration of health. In add ition, Doctors of Chiropractic recognize the value and responsibility of working in cooperation with other health care practitioners when in the best interest of the patient. II. THE CHIROPRACTIC PARADIGM Purpose The purpose of chiropractic is to optimize health.- 14 -Principle The body's innate recuperative power is affected by and integrated through the nervous system. Practice The practice of chiropractic includes: establishing a diagnosis; Facilitating neurological and biomechanical integri ty through appropriate chiropractic case management; and promoting health. Foundation The foundation of chiropractic includes philosophy, science, art, knowledge, and clinical experience. Impacts The chiropractic paradigm directly influences the f ollowing: education; research; health care policy and leadership; relationships with other health care providers; professional stature; public awareness and perceptions; and patient health through quality care. The Subluxation Chiropractic is concerned with the preservation and restoration of health, and focuses particular attention on the subluxation. A subluxation is a complex of functional and/or str uctural and/or pathological articular changes that compromise neural integrity and may influence organ system function and general health. A subluxation is evaluated, diagnosed, and managed through the use of chiropractic procedures based on the best available rational and empirical evidence. III. CHIROPRACTIC EDUCATION To obtain a license to practice chiropractic in any of the 50 states requires the degree of doctor of chiropractic from an accredited chiroprac tic educational institution or program. Chiropract ic educational standards are strict and demanding, req uiring study in the basic sciences comparable to medical, dental and osteopathic curricula. This ed ucation consists of four or more years of full-time , in-residence study is required in human anatomy, ph ysiology, biomechanics, chiropractic diagnosis/analysis, adjustive techniques, public hea lth issues and chiropractic philosophy. Chiropractic college students must complete a rigor ous and uniquely specialized program of classroom and practical training that includes more than 2,000 hours of study of the anatomy, dynamics and biomechanics of the human spine and th e nature and components of the spinal subluxation complex. No other health care professi onal devotes this level of serious scientific study- 15 -to the human spine. A detailed examination of the curricula offered by federally accredited chiroprac tic institutions illustrates the uniqueness of chiropra ctic and the highly specialized nature of chiroprac tic professional education. Chiropractic students are thoroughly trained in the appropriate use of sophisticated diagnostic technology including imaging procedures such as x-r ay, thermography, video-fluoroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging and other state-of-the-art invest igative technologies and procedures. The capacity to evaluate the health care needs of the chiropract ic patient, including appropriate referrals to othe r health professionals when necessary, is an importan t objective of chiropractic education . Chiropractic education is designed not only to impa rt scientific knowledge, but to develop clinical skills and proficiencies that \"represent t hose minimal skills a candidate should demonstrate when presenting for The ACC Chiropractic Paradigm Patient Health Through Quality Care PhilosophyScience ArtExperience Knowledge PURPOSE To optimize healthPRINCIPLE The body's innate recuperative power is affected by and integrated through the nervous systemPRACTICE Establish a diagnosis Facilitate neurological and biomechanical integrity through appropriate chiropractic case management Promote healthHealth Care Policy and LeadershipPublic Awareness and Perception Professional Stature Education RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERSResearch-16-licensure after completing the educational program. \" These areas of clinical competency include the taking of patient histories, physical e xaminations, imaging studies, chiropractic analysis/diagnosis or clinical impressions, referra l, care plans, spinal adjusting, case follow-up, re cord keeping and others. Nearly 14,000 students attend the 16 chiropractic c olleges accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of the Council on Chiropractic Educat ion (CCE), according to 1999 data. The Commission on Accreditation is recognized by the U. S. Department of Education. The standards adopted by the Council on Chiropractic Education, \" indicate the minimum education expected to be received in the accredited institutions that train students as chiropractic primary health care provid ers.\" CCE standards were developed to reflect the needs o f chiropractic professional education and as a measure of the quality of programs offered by chiropractic teaching institutions. Chiropractic education, even prior to the existence of the CCE, offered professional instruction sufficient to meet the requirements for licensure in the various state s. The forward to the \"Standards for Chiropractic Institutions\" of the CCE defines the role of a doct or of chiropractic and his/her professional educati on as follows: \"A Doctor of Chiropractic is a physician whose purp ose is to help meet the health needs of the public as a member of the healing arts. He/she gives part icular attention to the relationship of the structu ral and neurological aspects of the body and is educate d in the basic and clinical sciences as well as in related health subjects. Chiropractic science conc erns itself with the relationship between structure (primarily the spine), and function (primarily coor dinated by the nervous system), of the human body as that relationship may affect the restoration and preservation of health.\" \"The purpose of his/her professional education is t o prepare the doctor of chiropractic as a primary health care provider; to provide the s tudents with a base of knowledge sufficient for the performance of his or her professional obli gations as a doctor of chiropractic. As a portal of entry to the health delivery system, the doctor of chiropractic must be well educated to diagnose for chiropractic care, to provide chiro practic care, and to consult with, or refer to, other health care providers as indicated.\" Most CCE accredited chiropractic colleges have soug ht to further demonstrate their academic strength by qualifying for recognition and accredit ation by regional accrediting agencies. For exampl e, Life University in Marietta, Georgia, is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and School s; and Palmer College of Chiropractic in Davenport, Io wa, is accredited also by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, etc. IV. THE LEGAL ESTABLISHMENT OF CHIROPRACTIC The practice of chiropractic is a privilege authori zed by the legislatures of the various states under the authorities reserved to the states in the U.S. Constitution. The realities of chiropractic practice flow from this legal establishment, and, u ltimately, in every instance, the doctor of chiropr actic will be held accountable to such provisions, statut es and regulations as have been established by stat e law. Any attempt to encode professional practice g uidelines for the chiropractic profession must begi n with a thorough, objective examination of this lega l establishment and reflect the realities, authorit ies and limitations contained therein. The legal development of chiropractic began shortly after the initial articulation of chiropractic principles and, by the 1920s, chiropractic was well on the way to formal legal recognition and regulat ion through licensure in numerous states. The first la w passed by a state legislature authorizing and regulating the practice of chiropractic as a separa te and distinct health care profession was in Kansa s on March 20, 1913. This action was followed in qui ck succession by the legislature of North Dakota-17-in that same year, and by Arkansas, Oregon, Nebrask a and Colorado, by 1915. This represented the beginning of a recognition process that was not com pleted until 1974 when Louisiana finally adopted a chiropractic licensure law. The statutes governing the practice of chiropractic are worded similarly in every state. All states statutes have recognized chiropractic as a primary contact health care profession applying its unique science and procedural approach to health care. Co mmon to all state statutes is an emphasis on the spinal adjustment procedure and such diagnostic act ivities as are necessary to properly perform this function and to protect the public. A second commo n thread running through the legal mechanisms establishing chiropractic is the drugless and non-s urgical nature of chiropractic science. Chiropract ic like podiatry, dentistry, and optometry exist as a legal exception to the practice of medicine with it s own area of application and clinical expertise care of the articulations of the human frame, particularly the spine, through the application of chiropractic adju stments, etc. as a science and art. The status of the doctor of chiropractic, as establ ished by statute, training and experience, includes the ability and authority to evaluate the general health status of an individual for certific ation purposes, in the context of a required physical for school, employment, sports and, as federally authorized, approval to operate heavy transportatio n machinery. The U.S. Department of Transportation authorizes DC's to perform physical examinations for long-distance truck drivers, etc. Such physicals are a routine part of chiropractic p ractice. The clinical competence to perform such evaluations and through standard health status measures such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc., make a statement about the general health of an individual does not necessarily include an obligation or authority to develop a full-body medi cal diagnosis or to perform procedures outside the recognized scope of chiropractic. In the presence o f abnormal findings in the course of routine physic al examinations for specific purposes, such as those c ited above, the DC follows the standard chiropractic care pathways as described in chapter 2, making such care decisions (including referral) as are clinically indicated on an individual basis. Doctors of chiropractic are also obligated to perfo rm certain public health functions that are common to all primary contact, doctor level health care professionals. Many state laws obligate the doctor of chiropractic to report child abuse, spous e abuse, certain communicable diseases and other findings to public health authorities. Likewise, th e doctor of chiropractic may have responsibilities under state laws and regulations to take action in the pr esence of substance abuse. The process by which the several state legislatures developed statutory language and authority for the practice of chiropractic have bee n very specific in identifying chiropractic as a br anch of the healing arts that is separate and distinct f rom all others. In particular, statutes tend to be especially clear and specific in identifying chirop ractic as a practice apart from, distinct from and not the practice of medicine. The following citations from a number of current state statutes convey this distinct, \"not medicine\" element in chiropractic's legal establishment: Idaho : Chiropractic practice, as herein defined is hereby declared not to be the practice of medicine... (Idaho Code Title 54, Chapter 7: 54-704 Chiropracti c practice, No. 3.) Kentucky: The practice of chiropractic shall not include the practice of medicine or osteopathy... (Kentucky Revised Statutes Annotated Title XXVI Cha pter 312: 312.015 Definitions for Chapter, No. 5.) Maine : \"...and chiropractic is declared not to be the pract ice of medicine, surgery, dentistry or osteopathy.\" (Maine Revised Statutes Annotated, Title 32 Chapt er 9, Subchapter 1, 451.Definitions)-18-Maryland :Except as otherwise provided in this title, \"practi ce chiropractic\" does not include the use of drugs or surgery, or the practic e of osteopathy, obstetrics, or any other branch of medicine. (Annotated Code of Maryland Title 3, Subtitle 1 sec tion 3- 101.Definitions, (f)(3). Minnesota :The practice of chiropractic is not the practice of medicine, surgery, or osteopathy. (Minnesota Statutes Annotated Health Chapter 148 , Sec. 148.01.Chiropractic, No. 2.) An enormous body of judicial decisions and opinions , going back nearly 100 years, likewise identifies chiropractic as a practice different fro m medicine. Such decisions reflect the strong posi tions outlined in statutory languages regarding the separ ateness of chiropractic. This statutory and judici al record has clarified the status of chiropractic bey ond dispute and/or doubt, and has established chiropractic as a science, art, philosophy and prac tice distinct and separate from medicine. The other common theme is the legislative guarantee to the chiropractic professional of access to appropriate diagnostic technology. All jurisdic tions in the U.S. authorize x-ray applications and a list of other technologies is common in state statutes. Also, there are common limitations, such as the prohibition of the use of x-ray technology for the rapeutic, as opposed to diagnostic purposes. Many states have demonstrated through legislation a comm itment to arm the DC with diagnostic technologies appropriate to actual practice needs, and to protec t the patient. State laws have clearly established chiropractic as a separate professional endeavor and spell out in considerable detail the parameters of chirop ractic practice. The specialized nature of chiropractic is particularly evident when one contr asts chiropractic scope and licensure to the practi ce of medicine in all its branches. The Statutory Establishment of Chiropractic Respons ibility for Clinical Activity Related to the Nervou s System The scopes of practice established by state legisla tures are, in most instances, quite specific. Among the core concepts embodied in law is the rela tionship between the chiropractic adjustment and/or manipulation and the functions of the nervou s system. Most states have enacted statutes that contain spec ific references to the neurological responsibility of the doctor of chiropractic, relat ing nerve interference to human dysfunction. This nerve interference is recognized by statute to have health consequences in the human body and constitutes the primary chiropractic diagnosis. No state statute requires a patient to present condit ions or symptoms other than the finding of such nerve in terference to fall within the realm of chiropractic professional competence. Examples of state statutes that identify caring for the nervous system as a primary responsibility of the doctor of chiropractic includ e: Alabama : The term\" chiropractic,\" when used in this artic le, is hereby defined as the science and art of locating and removing without th e use of drugs or surgery any interference with the transmission and expression of nerve energ y in the human body. (Code of Alabama 1975 Title 34, Chapter 24, Article 4, Division 1 Se ction 34-24-120 (a) Colorado : \"Chiropractic\" means that branch of the healing ar ts which is based on the premise that disease is attributable to the abnorma l functioning of the human nervous system. It includes the diagnosing and analyzing of human ailments and seeks the elimination of the abnormal functioning of the human nervous system by the adjustment or manipulation, by-19-hand, of the articulations and adjacent tissue of t he human body, particularly the spinal column . (Colorado Revised Statutes Annotated Title 12, A rticle 33 Part 1 Section 12- 33-102(1) Florida :\"Practice of chiropractic\" means a noncombative pri nciple and practice consisting of the science, philosophy, and art of t he adjustment, manipulation, and treatment of the human body in which vertebral subluxations a nd other malpositioned articulations and structures that are interfering with the normal gen eration, transmission, and expression of nerve impulse between the brain, organs, and tissue cells of the body, thereby causing disease, are adjusted, manipulated, or treated, thus restoring t he normal flow of nerve impulse which , produces normal function and consequent health by c hiropractic physicians using specific chiropractic adjustment or manipulation techniques\" (West's Florida Statutes Annotated, Title XXXII, Chapter 460, 8a). Indiana :\"Chiropractic\" means the diagnosis and analysis of any interference with normal nerve transmission and expression, the proce dure preparatory to and complementary to the correction thereof by an adjustment of the a rticulations of the vertebral column, its immediate articulation, and includes other incident al means of adjustments of the spinal column and the practice of drugless therapeutics. (West's Annotated Indiana Code Title 25, Article 10 Chapter 1, 25-10-1-1, Sec 1 (1) Maryland :\"Practice chiropractic\" means to use a drugless sys tem of health care based on the principle that interference with the t ransmission of nerve impulses may cause disease. \"Practice chiropractic\" includes the diagnosing an d locating of misaligned or displaced vertebrae and, through the manual manipul ation and adjustment of the spine and other skeletal structures, treating disorders of th e human body. (Annotated Code of Maryland Title 3 Subtitle 1 Section 3-101 (f)(1)(2) Tennessee :\"Chiropractic\" means a system of healing based on t he premise that the relationship between the structural integrity of th e spinal column and function in the human body is a significant health factor and the normal transmission of nerve energy is essential to the restoration and maintenance of health. The practice and procedures used by the doctor of c hiropractic shall include the procedures of palpation, examination of the spine a nd chiropractic clinical findings accepted by the board of chiropractic examiners as a basis f or the adjustment of the spinal column and adjacent tissues for the correction of nerve interf erence and articular dysfunction. (Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 63 Chapter 4, 63-4-101(a)(b) The Legislative Establishment of Subluxation as an Element in Chiropractic Practice The concept of the subluxation has previously been defined via the consensus paradigm statement quoted earlier. This clinical element of chiropractic is recognized not only in chiropracti c education, literature, philosophy and practice, it is strongly established in both state and federal legislation as a primary element of chiropractic cl inical responsibility. These laws also identify th e adjustment of the subluxation to restore normal ner ve function as a unique service not provided by medicine, osteopathy or any other health care disci pline. Many states specifically identify the concept of su bluxation in their chiropractic practice statutes. Most states imply an understanding of th e subluxation complex by specifying the responsibility of the doctor of chiropractic for ad justing the spine and adjacent tissues for the-20-elimination of nerve interference. Examples of state statutes that expressly identify the detection of and caring for subluxation(s) as the core of chiropractic practice include: Arizona :A doctor of chiropractic is a portal of entry healt h care provider who engages in the practice of health care that include s: the diagnosis and correction of subluxations, funct ional vertebral or articular dysarthrosis or neuromuscular skeletal disorders fo r the restoration and maintenance of health. Treatment by adjustment of the spine or bodily arti culations and those procedures preparatory and complementary to the adj ustment including physiotherapy related to the correction of subluxat ions. ( Arizona Revised Statutes Annotated, Title 32, Chapter 8, Article 2 32-925(a), No. 1, 3) Connecticut: The practice of chiropractic means the practice of that branch of the healing arts consisting of the science of adjustmen t, manipulation and treatment of the human body in which vertebral subluxations and other malp ositioned articulations and structures that may interfere with the normal generation, transmiss ion and expression of nerve impulse between the brain, organs and tissue cells of the b ody, which may be a cause of disease, are adjusted, manipulated or treated. (Connecticut General Statutes Annotated Title 20, Chapter 372, Section 20-24, (1) District of Columbia : \"Practice of Chiropractic\" means the detecting an d correcting of subluxations that cause vertebral, neuromuscular , or skeletal disorder, by adjustment of the spine or manipulation of bodily articulations for t he restoration and maintenance of health. (District of Columbia Code 1981, Part 1, Title 2, C hapter 33, Subchapter I 2- 3301.2(3)(A) Delaware :The practice of chiropractic includes, but is not l imited to, the diagnosing and locating of misaligned or displaced vertebrae s ubluxation complex. (Delaware Code Annotated, Title 24, Chapter 7, 701 b.) Florida :\"Practice of chiropractic\" means a noncombative pri nciple and practice consisting of the science, philosophy, and art of t he adjustment, manipulation, and treatment of the human body in which vertebral subluxations a nd other malpositioned articulations and structures that are interfering with the normal gen eration, transmission, and expression of nerve impulse between the brain, organs, and tissue cells of the body, thereby causing disease, are adjusted, manipulated, or treated, thus restoring t he normal flow of nerve impulse which produces normal function and consequent health by c hiropractic physicians using specific chiropractic adjustment or manipulation techniques ...(Florida Statutes Annotated Title XXXII, Chapter 460, Section 460.403 (8)(a) Idaho :\"Adjustment\" means the application of a precisely c ontrolled force applied by hand or by mechanical device to a specific focal po int on the anatomy for the express purpose of creating a desired angular movement in skeletal joint structures in order to eliminate or decrease interference with neural transmission and correct or attempt to correct subluxation complex. (Idaho Code, Title 54 Chapter 7, 54-704 (1)(a.) Maine :Chiropractic. \"Chiropractic\" means the art and scie nce of identification and Correction of subluxation and the accompanying phys iological or mechanical abnormalities. The term subluxation, as utilized within the chirop ractic health care system, means a structural-21-or functional impairment of an intact articular uni t. Chiropractic recognizes the inherent recuperative capability of the human body as it rel ates to the spinal column, musculo-skeletal and nervous system. (Maine Revised Statutes Annotated, Title 32, Chap ter 9, Subchapter 1 section 451 (1). Massachusetts :\"Chiropractic\", the science of locating, and removin g interference with the transmission or expression of nerve force in the human body, by the correction of misalignments or subluxations of the bony articulat ion and adjacent structures, more especially those of the vertebra column and pelvis, for the purpose of restoring and maintaining health. (Massachusetts General Laws Annotated Part I, Title XVI, Chapter 112, Section 89) New York :The practice of the profession of chiropractic is defined as detecting and correcting by manual or mechanical means structural imbalance, distortion, or subluxations in the human body for the purpose of removing nerve interference and the effects thereof, where such interference is the result of or related to distortion, misalignment or subluxation of or in the vertebral column. (Consolidated Laws of New York, Chapter 16 Title VIII, Article 132, Section 6551 (1.) Other state statutes that define and identify the s ubluxation specifically include Kentucky, Nevada, New Jersey, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Washi ngton. These statutes are accessible via the Internet web sites of the various states as well as the ICA website http://www.chiropractic.org While the practice of various health professions is established and regulated by the states, federal statutes and regulations have a powerful an d growing impact on health care organization and delivery. The concept of the subluxation is clearl y and emphatically recognized in federal statutes i n a number of contexts. Indeed, no federal program r ecognizes chiropractic outside the context of the subluxation. The federal statutes governing the Medicare program , where chiropractic services have been included since the early 1970's, defines chiropract ic and reimbursable chiropractic services as: A chiropractor who is licensed as such by the State (or in a State which does not license chiropractors as such, is legally authorize d to perform the services of a chiropractor in the jurisdiction in which he performs such servi ces), and who meets uniform minimum standards promulgated by the Secretary, but only fo r the purpose of subsections (s)(1) and (s)(2)(A) of this section and only with respect to treatment by means of manual manipulation of the spine (to correct a subluxation demonstrated by X-ray to exist) which he is legally authorized to perform by the State or jurisdiction in which such treatment is provided. (42 USC Sec. 1395x (r)(5). Medicare extends these concepts in the statute into the regulations governing the program with an express definition: A chiropractor who is licensed by the State or lega lly authorized to perform the services of a chiropractor, but only with respect t o treatment by means of manual manipulation of the spine to correct a subluxation demonstrated by x-ray to exist. (42 CFR 482 SubpartB Section 482.12 (7) (c)(1)(v) Federal statutes establishing chiropractic particip ation in the Medicaid program employ the same terminology as in the general Medicare program . Federal Employee health Benefit Programs recognized chiropractic on terms negotiated between public employee representative committees and various insurance carriers but the federal workers compensation program identifies and defines-22-chiropractic, once again, very specifically to incl ude chiropractors and chiropractic services as foll ows: The term \"physician\" includes chiropractors only to the extent that their reimbursable services are limited to treatment consisting of man ual manipulation of the spine to correct a subluxation as demonstrated by x-ray to exist. Adjustment and/or Chiropractic Manipulation: The Co re of Chiropractic Practice Without question, the adjustment and/or manipulatio n of the spine and its adjacent structures represents the essence of chiropractic patient care as established by state statute. No less than 38 state statutes employ the term \"adjustment\" in refe rence to the procedures applied by the doctor of chiropractic. Most state statutes are very specifi c regarding the authority of the doctor of chiropra ctic to apply the adjustment and/or manipulation process to the area of the human spine and its articulations. State statutes recognize that chiro practic science is anatomically very specific to th e spine but with broad body implications. No less th an 18 state statutes include the concept of manipulation, and in almost every instance it is ut ilized in addition to the term \"adjustment\" Clearl y, the terms are not meant to be synonymous. Colorado :\"Chiropractic\"...includes ...the elimination of the abnormal functioning of the human nervous system by the adjustment or manip ulation, by hand, of the articulations and adjacent tissue of the human body, particularly the spinal column. (Colorado Revised Statutes Annotated, Title 12, Article 33, Part 1: 1 2-33-102 (1) Connecticut :The practice of chiropractic means the practice of that branch of the healing arts consisting of the science of adjustmen t, manipulation and treatment of the human body in which vertebral subluxations and other malp ositioned articulations and structures that may interfere with the normal generation, transmiss ion and expression of nerve impulse between the brain, organs and tissue cells of the b ody...are adjusted. (Connecticut General Statutes Annotated, Title 20, Chapter 372, 20-24 (1 ) District of Columbia :\"Practice of Chiropractic\" means the detecting and correcting of subluxations that cause vertebral, neuromuscular , or skeletal disorder, by adjustment of the spine. (District of Columbia code 1981, Part I, Title 2, Chapter 33, s2-3301.2 (3)(A) Georgia :\"Chiropractic\" means the adjustment of the articula tion of the human body, including ilium, sacrum, and coccyx...The adjustmen t referred to in this paragraph and subsection (b) of Code Section 43-9-16 may only be administered by a doctor of chiropractic authorized to do so by the provisions of this chapt er.

Chiropractic: A Drugless Science In the legislative process that established chiropr actic and in the subsequent regulatory-23-procedures that amplify and implement legislative d irectives, chiropractic is often defined by what is included within the professional scope of chiroprac tic practice as well as what is expressly prohibite d. Among the prohibitions that characterize chiroprac tic is the absence of authority to prescribe or administer drugs. All fifty states expressly prohi bit the prescription or administration of federally controlled substances by a doctor of chiropractic. No state authorizes the doctor of chiropractic to administer or prescribe anesthesia, vaccines or ser ums or radioactive substances for therapeutic purposes. State statutes tend to be quite specific in this area as is shown in the excerpts from stat e statutes presented below. Alabama : ...but chiropractors are expressly prohibited from prescribing or administering to any person any drugs included in m ateria medica (Code of Alabama 1975 Title 34 Chapter 24 Article 4 Division 1, s 34-24-1 20 (c).

(Tennessee Title 63, 4-101 \"Chiropractic\" Defined-B Mandatory practices (d)(1) . The Implications for the Guidelines Process The authorities established by law and the consensu s that has evolved via such widely recognized bodies as the Council on Chiropractic Ed ucation and the Association of Chiropractic Colleges represent powerful elements that must be i ncluded in the development of any chiropractic practice guidelines. Legal requirements represent absolutes. Consensus statements, definitions and positions adopted by diverse and widespread profess ional bodies within the chiropractic profession-24-are part of the self-defining, self-governing proce ss that any serious, mature profession should expec t to see emerge. Along with more specific literature and clinical studies, these bodies of \"evidence\" can and should be an integral part of the body of data on which guidelines are based. V. THE ETHICAL CONTEXT OF CHIROPRACTIC PRACTICE The most stringent statutory provisions and the str ictest standards and guidelines for the practice of any profession gain a vital additional dimension wh en placed in a well defined and demanding ethical context. To foster this important state of profess ional awareness and to protect the profession and the public, the Board of Directors of the Internati onal Chiropractors Association established an extensive Code of Professional Ethics. This code i s presented as an important element of the conditions and terms on which chiropractic should b e practiced. It is the intent of these practice protocols and guidelines to reflect the values and objectives of this code of ethics in every aspect i n its various components. The International Chiropractors Association Code of Ethics This Code of Professional Conduct was first develop ed by the International Chiropractors Association and officially adopted by its Board of Directors in 1985. PREAMBLE behavior and recommended for al l doctors of chirop ractic and chiropractic assistants. The following basic principles should be guiding factors in the p ractice of chiropractic and upheld at all times. Consider the well-being of the patient. The primary effort and ultimate goal should be for \"the greatest good of the patient\". Honor your profession, its history and tradition. Respect your patient's rights of confidentiality in the doctor-patient relationship. Recognize chiropractic's limitations and acknowledg e the special skills of other health care professions in the prevention and care of dise ase. Let professional responsibility, integrity and high standards of competence and skill be your guiding tenets. The ICA Code of Ethics comprises a doctor of chirop ractic's duties and obligations to his or her patients, the public and each other. The ethical f oundations upon which these principles are based are established moral obligations that ensure the d ignity and integrity of the profession. The primary duty of every doctor of chiropractic is to abide by federal, state, provincial, and local statutes establishing the privileges of pract icing chiropractic as well as the basic moral oblig ations imposed by this Code of Ethics. 1.DUTIES, OBLIGATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF DOCTORS OF CHIROPRACTIC TO THEIR PATIENTS. The overriding objective of these principles is for the doctor of chiropractic to render the greatest possible service and care to mankind.-25-Principle 1A. Availability and Accessibility The doctor of chiropractic should make himself/hers elf available, but more importantly, be accessible to patients in need of his/her professio nal services. The doctor of chiropractic shall, to the best of his/her ability and immediate circumstantia l limitations, render all possible assistance to an y patient(s) in emergency health care situations. Ex cept in emergency situations, a doctor of chiroprac tic has the right to accept or reject a particular pati ent. Principle 1B. Confidentiality The doctor of chiropractic is obliged to keep the t rust and confidence of the patient and the patient's family. The following rules should be ad hered to: 1.The doctor of chiropractic shall not discuss patien t information with one patient about another patient. 2.The doctor of chiropractic shall not discuss any pa tient information with relatives or friends of the patient without the consent of the patient, preferably in writing. 3.The doctor of chiropractic shall not discuss any pa tient information with visitors to the office or hospital. 4.Patient information should not, under any circumsta nces, be discussed with the news media without written patient consent. 5.The doctor of chiropractic shall not discuss patien t information with other employees, except in conference and/or consultation. Discussi on about patients should be avoided in patient areas. A patient's privacy should be re spected at all times. When consulting another doctor of chiropractic health care provider , it should be done privately and out of the range of the patient's hearing. 6.The doctor of chiropractic shall not discuss patien t information with his/her own relatives or friends. 7.The doctor of chiropractic shall not discuss any pa tient information over the telephone with anyone without the patient's consent, preferably in writing. Medical/Health Records The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals (JCAH) stipulates the following minimum standards in assessing hospital accreditation compl iance with medical record taking and confidentialit y of the information contained therein. The ICA endo rses the JCAH standards in principle: Medical records are confidential, secured, current, authenticated, legible, and complete. The medical record is the property of the hospital or clinic and is maintained for the benefit of the patient, the medical staff, and the hospital. The hospital or clinic is responsible for safeguard ing both the records and its informational content against loss, defacement, tampering, and from use by unauthorized individuals. Written consent of the patient or his legally quali fied representative is required for the release of medical information to persons not otherwise authorized to receive the information.-26-Where certain portions of the medical record are so confidential that extraordinary means are necessar y to preserve their privacy such as in the care of some psychiatric disorders, these portions may be stored separately, provided that the complete record is re adily available when required for current medical c are or follow-up, review functions, or use in quality assu rance activities. Principle 1C. Release of Confidential Patient Records The doctor of chiropractic shall comply with a pati ent's written authorization to provide records or copies of records to individuals the patient des ignates to inspect or receive all or part of said records. Further, doctors of chiropractic shall ab ide by the general standards for patient records confidentiality and release promulgated by the Amer ican Medical Records Association (AMRA). The AMRA standards, listed below, are endorsed by the I nternational Chiropractors Association and henceforth are an integral part of the ICA Code of Professional Ethics. All requests for health records or health informati on shall be referred to the health records departme nt of a hospital or clinic. Release of health information to the patient shall be carried out in accordance with all applicable le gal requirements and written institutional policy. A p roperly completed and signed authorization is requi red. Subject only to specific contraindications describe d below, and to any legal constraints such as those governing minors and those adjudicated as incomplete, a patie nt or his representative may have access to his own health record for review, upon written request with reason able notice. A patient may have access to records of his/her care during or after discharge from care. A copy o f the requested health information will be provided after completion and upon written request by the patient and payment of a reasonable fee. The health care provider is not required to permit the patient access to his/her health record if the provider reasonably concludes that: Knowledge of the health care information would be i njurious to the health of the patient, or Knowledge of the health care information could reas onably be expected to cause danger to the life or s afety of any person. If the health care provider denies a patient's requ est to see or copy, in whole or in part, his health record based on the above grounds, the provider must either: Provide a summary of the health record, according t o the requirements of this section. If the health care provider chooses to prepare such a summary of the record rather than allow access to the entire record, he or she shall make such a summary of the records, available to the patient within ten (10) working days from the date of the patient's request . However if more time is needed because the record is extraordinary in length or because the pa tient was discharged from a licensed health facilit y within the last ten (10) days, the health care prov ider shall notify the patient of this fact and the date that the summary will be completed, but in no case shall more than thirty days (30) elapse between the request by the patient and the delivery of the summ ary. In preparing the summary of the record, the health care provider shall not be obligated to incl ude information which is not contained in the origi nal record; or The provider must permit inspection by, or provide copies of, the health record to another health care practitioner who is licensed to care for the same c ondition as the health care provider and who has-27-been so designated, in writing, by the patient. The health care provider shall inform the patient of th e provider's refusal to permit him/her to inspect or obtain copies of the requested records, and inform the patient of the right to require the provider to per mit inspection by, or provide copies to another hea lth care practitioner who is licensed to care for the s ame condition as the health care provider and who h as been so designated, in writing, by the patient. In either event, the health care provider shall mak e a written record, to be included with the health records requested, noting the date of the request and expla ining the health care provider's reason for refusin g to permit inspection or provide copies thereof, including a d escription of the specific adverse or detrimental c onsequences to the patient which the provider anticipates would occur if inspection or copying were permitted. In the event that the patient wishes to correct dat a, it shall be done as an amendment, without change to the original entry, and shall be clearly identified as an additional document appended to the original hea lth record at the direction of the patient. This document shall then be regarded as an integral part of the health record. Upon request of the pa tient, the provider will furnish copies of the amendment to an y person to whom the disputed information has been properly released. Whenever health information is requested subsequent to the amendment, the copy sent shall in clude the amendment. The provider will make these policies known to pati ents upon request. Following authorized release of patient information , the signed authorization will be retained in the health record with notation of the specific informa tion released, the date of release and the signatur e of the individual who released the information. Release of Primary Records All requests for health records or health informati on, including requests for information on patients currently under care, shall be directed to the health record department. Release of information from the health record shall be carried out in accordance with all applicable l egal, accrediting, and regulatory agency requirements, an d in accordance with written institutional policy. All information contained in the health record is c onfidential and the release of information will be closely controlled. A properly completed and signed author ization is required for release of all health infor mation except: As required by law. For release to another health care provider current ly involved in the care of the patient. For medical care evaluation, or For research and education in accordance with condi tions specified below. In keeping with the tenet of informed consent, a pr operly completed and signed authorization to releas e patient information shall include at least the following da ta: Name of institution that is to release the informat ion Name of the individual or institution that is to re ceive information Patient's full name, address and date of birth Purpose or need for information Extent or nature of information to be released, wit h inclusive dates of care (Note: An authorization specifying \"any and all inf ormation...\" shall not be honored).-28-Specific date, event or condition upon which author ization will expire unless revoked earlier Statement that authorization can be revoked but not retroactive to the release of information made in good faith. Date that consent is signed (Note: Date of signatur e must be later than the date of information to be released.), and Signature of patient or legal representative (Note: In the case of care given to a minor without parental knowledge, the institution shall refrain f rom releasing the portion of the record relevant to this episode of care when responding to a reques t for information for which the signed authorization is that of the parent or guardian. An authorization by the minor shall be required in this instance.) Information released to authorized individuals or a gencies shall be strictly limited to that informati on required to fulfill the purpose stated on the authorization. Authorizations specifying \"any and all informatio n...\" or other such broadly inclusive statements shall not be hono red. Release of information that is not essential to the stated purpose of the request is specifically prohi bited. Following authorized release of patient information , the signed authorization will be retained in the health record with notation of the specific information released, the date of release and the signature of the indiv idual who released the information. Health records shall be available for use within th e facility for direct patient care by all authorize d personnel as specified by the chief executive officer and docume nted in a policy manual. Direct access to health records for routine adminis trative functions, including billing, shall not be permitted, except where the employees are instructed in polici es on confidentiality to penalties arising from vio lation. Health records shall be available to authorized stu dents enrolled in educational programs affiliated w ith the institution. Students must present proper iden tification and written permission of the instructor with their request. Data compiled in educational studie s may not include patient identity or other information which could identify the patient. Health records shall be made available for research to individuals who have obtained approval for thei r research projects from an institutional review board or appr opriate chiropractic staff committee, administrator or other designated authority. Research projects which invo lve use of health records shall be conducted in acc ordance with institutional policies on the use of health re cords for research. Any research project which inv olves contact of the patient by the researcher must have written permission of the patient's attending doctor and/or by the chief executive officer of the facility or his/her designee, prior to contact. An institutional polic y on use of medical records in research should guide these acti vities. If facsimiles of health records are provided to aut horized internal users, the same controls will be applied for return of these facsimiles as for retur n of the original health record. Wherever possible , internal users will be encouraged to use the origin al health record rather than to obtain a facsimile. The names, addresses, dates of admission or dischar ge of patients shall not be released to the news me dia or commercial organization without the express writ ten consent of the patient or his authorized agent. Requests for health information received via teleph one will require proper identification and verifica tion to assure that the requesting party is entitled to receive su ch information. A record of the request and inform ation released will be kept.-29-Principle 1D. Limits of Chiropractic Care The doctor of chiropractic shall attend to his/her patient as often as necessary according to his/her professional judgment to ensure the well-be ing of the patient and continued progress. However, a doctor of chiropractic shall scrupulousl y avoid unnecessary care. The doctor of chiropractic shall neither exaggerate nor minimize the gravity of a patient's condition, nor offer any false hope or prognosis. It is also the doctor of chiropractic's duty to acq uaint a close friend or relative of a patient who is inca pable of caring for himself/herself with the patien t's condition, the care being provided and the particul ar care needed by the patient. Once committed to serving a patient, a doctor of ch iropractic should not terminate his/her professional services without notice, allowing the patient reasonable time to obtain alternative professional services and giving the discharged pat ient all papers and documents as required by the Professional Code of Ethics. Principle 1E. Patient's Bill of Rights Within the Health Care Set ting A patient should expect and receive from doctors of chiropractic entrusted with the responsibility of delivering chiropractic care cons ideration of their basic rights as human beings to independence of expression, decisions and actions; and concerns and respect for their personal dignity at all times. The following patient's rights are an integral part of the ICA Code of Professional Ethics and the patient should be advised of these rights by hi s/her doctor of chiropractic. 1.The patient has the right to impartial access to ch iropractic care without regard to race; sex; cultural, national, or ethnic origins; economi c, educational, religious, or political affiliation; and without having to disclose the sou rce of payments for his/her care. 2.The patient has the right to be interviewed and exa mined in surroundings that permit reasonable visual and auditory privacy. Individual s not directly involved in his/her care will not be present without the patient's permission. T he patient has the right to be advised of the presence of any individual during consultati on and/or care and the reason of their presence. 3.The patient has the right to have a person of his/h er sex present during certain physical examinations by a doctor of chiropractic of the opp osite sex and the right not to remain disrobed any longer than is required for accomplish ing the examination for which the patient was asked to disrobe. 4.The patient should know the identity and profession al status of individual(s) providing service to him/her and to know who has the primary responsibility for coordinating his/her care. This includes the right to know the professi onal relationships among individuals who are caring for him/her as well as the relationship to any other health care or educational institution involved in his/her care. 5.The patient has the right to expect information fro m the doctor of chiropractic coordinating-30-his/her care concerning the diagnosis/analysis, pro gnosis and the planned course of care in terms that the patient is able to understand. W hen it is not clinically advisable to give such information to the patient, the information sh ould be made available to a legally authorized representative of the patient. 6.The patient has the right to actively participate i n any and all decisions regarding his/her care. To the extent permissible by applicable law, this will include the right to refuse care even after being informed of possible adverse conse quences of his/her decision. When a patient or his/her legally authorized representat ive refuses procedures which prevent the doctor of chiropractic from providing care in accor dance with professional standards, the relationship with the patient may be terminated upo n reasonable notice. 7.The patient has the right not to be subjected to an y procedure(s) without voluntary consent of the consent of his/her legally authorized repres entative. When alternatives to chiropractic care exist, the patient can be expecte d to be informed of these alternatives. 8.The patient has the right to expect confidential ca re of all communications and records pertaining to his/her care. The patient also has t he right to have his/her health care record read only by individuals directly involved in his/h er care or in monitoring of its quality and by other individuals only on the patient's written authorization or that of his/her legally authorized representative. Written permission shal l be obtained before health care records are made available to anyone not directly concerned with the patient's care. 9.The patient has the right to leave or voluntarily b e discharged from chiropractic care even against the best advice of the attending doctor of chiropractic. 10.A patient can expect reasonable continuity of care. He/she shall be informed in advance of the time(s) and location(s) of appointments as w ell as the name and capacity of the doctor of chiropractic/health practitioner who will be providing care. 11.A patient has the right to be advised if the doctor of chiropractic and/or other attending physicians or other concomitant health care personn el propose to engage in or otherwise perform human experimentation affecting his/her car e. The patient has the privilege and right of refusing to participate in any research pr oject. Participation by patient in clinical training programs or in the gathering of data for r esearch purposes should always and everywhere be voluntary. 12.The patient has the right to be informed of continu ing health care requirements following discharge from care in the out-patient or in-patien t setting. 13.The patient has the right upon request to receive a n itemized, detailed and thorough explanation of total charges billed for services re ndered, regardless of the source of payment. The patient has the right to timely notic e prior to termination of his/her eligibility for reimbursement by any third-party payor for the cost of his/her care. 14.The patient shall be advised of his/her rights and shall be instructed as to the rules and policies which apply to his/her conduct as a patien t in the out-patient and/or in-patient setting. 15.The patient shall have all his/her rights also appl ied to the person or persons who may assume the legal responsibility to make decisions o n the patient's behalf regarding the-31-care of the patient should the patient be a legal m inor or otherwise incapacitated. 16.The patient has the right to expect reasonable safe ty insofar as the health care environment is concerned. 17.The patient at his/her own request and expense, has the right to consult with another health care practitioner. Patient's Responsibilities 1. Provision of Information A patient has the responsibility to provide, to the best of his/her ability and knowledge, accurate an d complete information about present complaints, past illnesses, accidents, hospitalizations, medication s, and other matters relating to his/her health. It i s the patient's responsibility to report any new ep isode of trauma or any unexpected changes in his/her heal th condition to the practitioner. The patient is responsible for letting the doctor of chiropractic know if he/she does not fully comprehend the practitioner's contemplated course of care. 2.

He/she is also responsible for being respectful of the property of other persons and of the offices and environment in which care is rendered. Principle 1F. Freedom of Choice The doctor of chiropractic shall recognize the righ t of the patient to select his/her own method of health care. The doctor of chiropractic shall a lso respect the patient's right to change his/her c hoice of providers at will. This may be separate, concom itant or complementary to chiropractic care where cooperation with another provider may be required a nd concurrent procedures do not conflict. The doctor of chiropractic should ensure that patie nts possess enough information to enable the patient to make an informed intelligent decisio n with regard to any proposed chiropractic care.-32-Principle 1G. Consultation and Referral In difficult or protracted cases, consultation(s) w ith other health care providers are recommended and advisable. Having requested the op inion, the doctor of chiropractic shall make available any relevant information and indicate cle arly whether he/she wishes the colleague to continu e care of the patient. The doctor of chiropractic shall be ready to act up on a patient's expressed desire for a consultation with another doctor of chiropractic or provider even though he/she may not feel the need for consultation. The doctor of chiropractic shall, when his/her opin ion has been requested by a colleague, report in detail his/her findings and recommendatio ns to the colleague and may outline his/her opinion to the patient. He/she will continue with the care of the patient only at the specific request of the attending doctor of chiropractic or health care pro vider, and with the consent of the patient. The doctor of chiropractic shall make available at a patient's request a report of his/her findings and a description of his/her care of the patient. Principle 1H. Remuneration The health and welfare of the patient should always be paramount and expectation of remuneration or lack thereof shall not in any way a ffect the quality of service rendered to the patien t. The doctor of chiropractic is entitled to receive p roper and reasonable compensation for his/her professional services commensurate with the value of the services rendered compared to the fees commonly assessed in the community by other me mbers of the profession based on usual and customary practices, experience, time, reputation, the nature of the patient's condition and the patient's ability to pay. The doctor of chiropract ic should be prepared to discuss his/her fees with individual patients and should initiate discussion when fees are expected to exceed usual and customary charges. The doctor of chiropractic should support proper ac tivities designed to enable access to necessary chiropractic care on behalf of individual s who are unable to pay reasonable chiropractic fees or who are otherwise legally destitute. Principle 1I. Termination of Patients Since patients have the right to dismiss providers at will for reasons satisfactory to themselves, likewise, a doctor of chiropractic may decline to a ttend to a patient if professional ethics and perso nal self-respect and dignity are compromised. The doct or of chiropractic is encouraged to terminate a doctor-patient relationship when it becomes reasona bly clear that the patient is not benefiting from chiropractic care. Having accepted a patient, a doctor of chiropractic shall give the patient the best chiropractic care possible within the confines of his or her exp ertise. If a doctor of chiropractic decides to withdraw fro m a particular case, the patient or the patient's legal representative shall be given sufficient noti ce to enable him/her to obtain another health care provider.-33-Principle 1J. Guarantees The doctor of chiropractic shall not offer or guara ntee a cure to any patient either verbally or in writing. The doctor of chiropractic may give a patient a rea sonable estimate regarding the length of time/number of visits that may be required to favor ably address a particular condition, but he/she should scrupulously avoid protracted or unnecessary care without some favorable remission of the patient's complaint(s). Principle 1K. Practices or Questionable Propriety The doctor of chiropractic shall avoid participatin g or assisting in all practices of questionable propriety either with his/her patients, colleagues, family or other business associates. The doctor o f chiropractic shall conduct his/her pr actice in surroundings which will not compromise the quality of patient care. The doctor of chiropractic shall not initiate or ot herwise knowingly participate in any illegal or fraudulent action. He/she should maintain the high est standards of professional conduct so the practice is above reproach. The doctor of chiropractic shall not take physical, emotional, or financial advantage of the public or any patient he/she serves. Principle 1L. Diagnostic Procedures The doctor of chiropractic shall recommend and use only those diagnostic and analytical procedures, laboratory and imaging techniques allow able by applicable state and/or provincial law that are in the best interests of the patient, will assi st in the patient's diagnosis/analysis and care, an d are necessary for the well-being of the patient. Furth ermore, a doctor of chiropractic shall recognize his/her responsibility in advising patients of diag nostic/analytic findings and any attendant recommendations therefrom. The doctor of chiropractic shall ensure that a pati ent is adequately prepared for examination and care and it suitably attired for such purposes. Principle 1M. Patient Benefits The doctor of chiropractic shall be required to ass ist patients in securing any benefits due the patient by supplying the information required, if p ossible, in response to a patient's request for assistance. When acting at the request of a third or other part y, the doctor of chiropractic will ensure that the patient understands the doctor of chiropractic' s legal responsibility before conducting any-34-examination and/or care procedures. Principle 1N. Equality The doctor of chiropractic shall render responsible chiropractic care to any and all individuals regardless of race; sex; cultural, national or ethn ic origins; religion; political persuasions or abil ity to recompense. Principle 1O. Practice Aims The doctor of chiropractic shall conduct his/her pr actice with courtesy, honesty, and a high- degree of professional competence in the proper car e of the patients with due regard and respect for the patient's unequivocal rights and personal digni ty. The ultimate end is the greatest good of the patien t. 2. DUTIES, OBLIGATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DOCTOR OF CHIROPRACTIC TO THE PUBLIC Principle 2A. Demands Upon the Profession The doctor of chiropractic shall recognize that, wi th respect to licensed professionals dedicated to the promotion of health, prevention of illness a nd alleviation of suffering, the public demands the highest standard of integrity and dedication from t he practitioner and that the practitioner should ac t accordingly. The doctor of chiropractic shall recognize that the practice of chiropractic shall recognize that the practice of chiropractic is a privilege and tha t he/she must merit and retain the respect of the p ublic for this privilege. The doctor of chiropractic who is also a public off icial, either elected or appointed, full or part- time, should not engage in activities which are, or may be perceived to be, in conflict with their professional duties. Principle 2B. Observance of Law and Codes The doctor of chiropractic shall observe the approp riate laws, decisions and regulations of federal, state and local governmental agencies and cooperate with the pertinent activities and policie s of associations legally authorized to regulate or a ssist in the regulation of the chiropractic profess ion. The doctor of chiropractic should be actively conc erned with improvements in licensing procedures consistent with the development of the profession a nd of relevant advances in science. The International Chiropractors Association holds t hat the best interest of both the public and the chiropractic profession are served by maintaini ng chiropractic as a separate and distinct, drugles s, non-surgical alternative form of health care. To t his end, it is the doctor of chiropractic's duty to provide chiropractic care. It is the responsibilit y of any licensed health care practitioner not to p ractice within the field of any other licensed health pract itioner unless properly qualified by education, deg ree and licensing by proper respective authorities.-35-Principle 2C. Participation in Community Affairs The doctor of chiropractic shall be a responsible c itizen and participate in the public affairs of his/her state and/or local community in order to im prove law, administrative procedures and public policies that pertain to chiropractic and the healt h care delivery system. The doctor of chiropractic shall be ready to take t he initiative in the proposal and development of measures to benefit the general public health an d well-being and should cooperate in the administration and enforcement of such measures and programs to the extent consistent with the law and with chiropractic principles. Principle 2D. Advertising The doctor of chiropractic may advertise, but adver tising should be accurate, truthful, and in good taste. Advertisements should not be misleadin g or deceptive and should accurately represent the doctor of chiropractic's professional status an d area of special competence. Advertising should not appeal primarily to an indiv idual's anxiety or create unjustified expectations or claim cures or absolute results. The doctor of chiropractic should conform to all ap plicable state laws, regulations and judicial decisions in connection with personal advertising. The doctor of chiropractic should avoid advocacy of any product if he/she is identified as a member of the chiropractic profession, except in ce rtain situations where advocacy of the product will reflect on chiropractic's health care specialty and is in the best interest of the consumers' health. Under no circumstances should advocacy of a product be undertaken to promote the doctor of chiropractic's personal practice. Principle 2E. Depositions The doctor of chiropractic may testify either as an expert or when his/her patients are involved in legal proceedings, workers' compensation cases, or in other similar administrative proceedings in personal injury or related cases. 2.DUTIES, OBLIGATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DOC TOR OF CHIROPRACTIC TO THE PROFESSION The doctor of chiropractic shall maintain the integ rity, competency and high standards of the chiropractic profession by continuously striving to improve his/her skills and competency by keeping abreast of current developments contained in chirop ractic, health and scientific literature, and by participating in continuing chiropractic educationa l programs. The doctor of chiropractic should, at all times, av oid the appearance of professional impropriety and should recognize that his/her behavior may have an impact on the profession's ability to serve the public. He/she should endeavor to promote the publ ic's confidence in the chiropractic profession. The doctor of chiropractic shall avoid impugning th e reputation of his/her colleagues.-36-The doctor of chiropractic shall promote and mainta in cordial relationships with other members of his/her profession and other professions for the exchange of information advantageous to the public's health and well-being. Principle 3A. Contractual Agreements The doctor of chiropractic shall, when aligning him self/herself in practice with other doctors of chiropractic, insist that they maintain the standar ds enunciated in this Code of Professional Ethics a nd the provisions of their respective Chiropractic Act . The doctor of chiropractic shall enter into a contr act with an organization only if it will allow him/her to maintain his/her professional integrity. Principle 3B. Research and Study The doctor of chiropractic shall recognize that he/ she has a responsibility to the profession and the public when interpreting scientific knowledge f or the public. He/she should do so objectively and not be guided by personal philosophy or personal ag grandizement. VI. Statements of Off icial ICA Policy Over the many decades of the existence of the Inter national Chiropractors Association, the organization's Board of Directors has felt it neces sary to present statements of official policy on issues of concern to the science, practice and admi nistration of chiropractic. The following position statements represent the official consensu s of ICA's Board of Directors and present the organization's official public position on a wide v ariety of issues. ICA POLICY STATEMENT ON Professional Impairment Through Substance Abuse The impairment of a doctor of chiropractic through chemical dependence (drug or alcohol) represents a potentially serious threat to the delivery of qua lity care and to public confidence in the chiroprac tic profession at large. ICA holds that it is the resp onsibility of doctors of chiropractic suffering fro m such conditions to seek appropriate professional help fo r reasons of personal health and professional reliability. Furthermore, the ICA holds that ethic al professional peers should make every effort to a ssist doctors of chiropractic who are known to them to be impaired through chemical dependency to obtain appropriate professional help in confidence and wit h dignity. ICA POLICY STATEMENT ON Spinal Adjustment and Spinal Manipulation The ICA holds that the chiropractic spinal adjustme nt is unique and singular to the chiropractic profession. The chiropractic adjustment shall be def ined as a specific directional thrust that sets a vertebra into motion with the intent to improve or correct vertebral malposition or to improve its juxtaposition segmentally in relationship to its art icular mates thus reducing or correcting the neuroforaminal/neural canal encroachment factors in herent in the chiropractic vertebral subluxation complex.-37-The adjustment is characterized by a specific thrus t applied to the vertebra utilizing parts of the vertebra and contiguous structures as levers to dir ectionally correct articular malposition. Adjustment shall be differentiated from spinal manipulation in that the adjustment can only be applied to a verte bral malposition with the express intent to improve or c orrect the subluxation, whereas any joint, subluxat ed or not, may be manipulated to mobilize the joint or to put the joint through its range of motion. Chiropractic is a specialized field in the healing arts, and by prior rights, the spinal adjustment is distinct and singular to the chiropractic professio n. ICA POLICY STATEMENT ON Animal Adjusting Animal adjusting can, in many situations, be an eff ective and humane service. Many doctors of chiropractic, through their own experiences, testif y as to the beneficial results of adjustments and a s D.D. Palmer stated, chiropractic care applies to \"a ll vertebra\". The chiropractic adjustment of subluxations in animals applies to their ills in th e same nature as humans. Recognizing the above considerations, the ICA recommends that such servic es should be provided by chiropractors in accordance with existing regulations. ICA POLICY STATEMENT ON Child Care The International Chiropractic Association recogniz es that infants suffer many birth traumas including traction, rotation and lateral flexion of the head relative to the thorax. With the use of forceps, s uch forces can be extreme (Towbin, 1969, Developmental Child Neurology). Forces of traction, rotation and lateral flexion, etc. sustained by the cervical spine when the skull is used as a lever during delivery, have been shown to subluxate the atlanto- occipital and atlanto-axial joints (Gutmann, G., It is also recognized that day-in, day-out trauma i s a continual part of childhood life which can crea te spinal misalignment and aberrant motor function. Asymmetrical development is extremely rare in fetus es (Farfan, 1973), but is actually a developmental process of growth due to asymmetrical stresses on g rowing tissues. Abnormal posture and spinal misalignment cause abnormal stresses, strains, comp ression, tension, etc., on vertebral structures, para-spinal tissues, the pelvis and lower extremiti es during development which may lead to permanent structural change and spinal malformation, e.g., sc oliosis. The ICA recommends the earliest possible evaluation, detection and correction of chiropracti c lesions (subluxation) in children, especially inf ants, to maximize the potential for normal growth and dev elopment. ICA POLICY STATEMENT ON Political Organization Membership and Post Graduate Credentialing The International Chiropractors Association holds t hat is inappropriate to require initial membership, and/or continued membership in a political organiza tion to receive, hold, or maintain a postgraduate specialty certification or diplomate in chiropracti c. It is not in the best interest of the D.C., the pro fession as a whole, nor the public we serve to hold forth the necessity of such political affiliation. -38-ICA POLICY STATEMENT ON Surface Electrode Paraspinal Electromyography (EMG ) The ICA acknowledges that analysis of the vertebral subluxation and its effects on the human body is paramount to chiropractic practice. The ICA acknowl edges that surface EMG studies are a part of the practice of chiropractic when used to evaluate the muscular changes associated with the vertebral subluxation complex. Surface electrode paraspinal electromyography (EMG) is a non-invasive diagnostic technique used to measure the electrical activity in the muscles surrounding the spine. Such information may be presented as numerical valu es, or used to create an image. Protocols and normative data for paraspinal EMG sca nning in chiropractic practice have been published in refereed, peer-reviewed journals. Fur thermore, courses in the use of paraspinal EMG scanning have been offered and are being offered und er the aegis of CCE accredited chiropractic colleges. ICA POLICY STATEMENT ON Fluoridation The countries of the world are facing an increasing ly complex and serious problem with respect to the delivery of pure drinking water to their citizens. The addition of any medication or substance to pu blic drinking water constitutes a form of mass medicatio n. The proponents of artificial water fluoridation hav e not proven it to be safe and/or without possible cause of future bodily harm. The International Chiropractors Association conside rs public water fluoridation to be possibly harmful and a deprivation of the rights of citizens to be f ree from unwelcome mass medication. The ICA is opposed to the addition of fluoride in any of its f orms of drinking water supplies of our nation's cit ies and municipalities. ICA POLICY STATEMENT ON Open Access to Chiropractic Licensure The International Chiropractors Association support s the principle of free and open licensure for qualified candidates in all states and jurisdiction s. Furthermore, the ICA holds that any licensing authority which restricts access to licensure for q ualified graduates for political reasons or restric ts competition in a state or jurisdictions is in viola tion of the public trust and is engaging in grossly unfair behavior at the expense of the consumer and the chi ropractic profession. ICA POLICY STATEMENT ON Low-Force Adjustive Techniques The International Chiropractors Association recogni zes chiropractic techniques that utilize low-force adjustments and soft tissue contacts to achieve correction of the varied compon ents of the subluxation complex. Such techniques, when utilized in attempts to reduce and stabilize biomechanical lesions through alteration of the biodynamics of the musculoskeleta l system, are recognized as part of chiropractic practice. ICA POLICY STATEMENT ON \"Manipulation\" Under Anesthesia-39-The International Chiropractors Association holds t hat within the armamentarium of chiropractic techniques efficient methods exist that address the pain profiles of even the most sensitive patient. Furthermore, the chiropractic adjustment relies on the body's own inherent constructive survival mechanisms to innately accomplish adjustic correcti on. In light of the above considerations, the Internati onal Chiropractors Association holds that anesthesi a is inappropriate and unnecessary to the deliverance of a chiropractic adjustment. ICA POLICY STATEMENT ON The Multi-Disciplinary Practice The International Chiropractors Association recogni zes that doctors of chiropractic may employ or be employed by other licensed professionals, but that the establishment of such relationships solely for the purpose of insurance or other payment raises se rious ethical questions. ICA POLICY STATEMENT ON Pre-Chiropractic College Undergraduate Degree Requi rements The International Chiropractors Association strongl y opposes state regulations, statutes or criteria f or licensure that impose a bachelor's degree requireme nt prior to entry into a chiropractic professional program. ICA views the establishment of such a req uirement as unnecessary, inconsistent with the requirements for licensure in other professions and discriminatory. Such pre-matriculation degree requirements create a class of citizens that will p ermanently be barred from licensure. ICA also view s such artificial and arbitrary barriers to licensure as raising serious legal issues, and to be contrar y to both the public's and the chiropractic profession's best interest. ICA POLICY STATEMENT ON Questionable Qualifier Terms While encouraging chiropractic postgraduate educati on and chiropractic diplomate programs, the International Chiropractors Association holds that Diplomate Programs are not chiropractic specialties and qualifier terms used in conjunction with the ti tle Chiropractor or the term Chiropractic that impl y specialization or skill in another health care fiel d is inappropriate. Such usage serves to confuse t he public's perception of chiropractic and is not in t he public's and the profession's best interest. ICA POLICY STATEMENT ON Unethical Patient Recruitment The International Chiropractors Association recogni zes that in the highly competitive modern health economy, the Doctor of Chiropractic often must enga ge in public education, various methods of practice promotion and, perhaps, advertising to est ablish and maintain a viable practice. The ICA further recognizes that this process is a difficult and challenging one. The difficulty of the market ing task, however, does not absolve the Doctor of Chiro practic from maintaining the highest ethical and professional standards in the marketing process. -40-The International Chiropractors Association holds t hat the enticement of potential patients into any chiropractic clinic or office on the basis of the a ssertion or representation to the potential patient that research will or is being conducted, at no charge t o that subject patient, is inherently suspect. The ICA further holds that attempts to convert such \"resear ch subjects\" into paying patients, either via self- payment or through third-party payers, represents u nethical behavior contrary to the interests of the consumer, the chiropractic profession and the insur ance system. The ICA recognizes the danger such schemes hold for the chiropractic profession at large and the damage these unethical and repugnant activities can and will do to public perception of the integrity and reliability of the chiropractic profession as a whole. The ICA encourages appropriate authorities to caref ully examine patient recruitment schemes that contain the elements of deception and misrepresenta tion embodies in such research-practice promotion schemes, and take such action as is appro priate to protect the public. ICA POLICY STATEMENT ON Referral The unique, non-duplicative role of the Doctor of C hiropractic as a primary health care provider is a product of the system of chiropractic education and the licensing and regulatory authority of the stat es. The primary obligation of Doctors of Chiropractic is to provide the highest quality of care to each patient within the confines of their education and their legal authority. It is the position of the International Chiropractors Association that this p rimary obligation includes recognizing when the lim its of skill and authority are reached. At that point, it is the ICA's position that doctors in all field s of practice are ethically and morally bound to make pa tient referrals to practitioners in other fields of healing when such referrals are necessary to provid e the highest quality of patient care. This interchange of professional referrals includes, but should not be limited to, doctors of medicine, osteopathy and chiropractic. Doctors of Chiropractic are also obligated to recei ve referrals from other health care providers, applying to those patients the same considerations for quality and appropriateness of care as with any other patient. It is the position of the ICA that the professional obligation to the patient includes honest, full and straightforward communication with the ref erring provider on the issue of optimal patient car e. ICA POLICY STATEMENT ON The Right to Practice Chiropractic The International Chiropractors Association has bee n alerted to attempts within healing arts instituti ons to train health care providers other than chiroprac tors to deliver chiropractic vertebral adjustments. Such efforts jeopardize the boundaries between the healing arts professions. Competent expertise cannot be gained through such \"short\" courses and t hey pose a danger to the health care consumer. The International Chiropractors Association holds t hat the only person legally allowed to provide chiropractic care should be one who has graduated w ith a Doctor of Chiropractic degree granted by a Council on Chiropractic Education accredited chir opractic institution or equivalent and who has passed the Boards required for licensure in the jur isdiction in which he/she practices. The International Chiropractors Association holds that no institution or entity should purport to prepare a practitioner to deliver the chiropractic adjustment without filling the above-stated requirement. ICA POLICY STATEMENT ON ICA Position on \"Specialties\"-41-The International Chiropractors Association (ICA) i s a professional organization dedicated to advancin g the chiropractic profession and representing and pr omoting the interests of doctors of chiropractic an d the patients they serve through advocacy, research and education. ICA's mission is to move the profession forward while preserving chiropractic's unique identity as a separate, distinct and drugles s health care profession. The International Chiropractors Association does no t endorse or recognize any post-graduate educational program or certification as a formal sp ecialty as the term applies routinely in other doct oral level health professions. ICA understands that no profession-wide consensus exists regarding postgraduate education and credentials and that no recognized accrediting body presently offers such status. ICA offers through its system of postgradu ate councils several educational programs in numerous areas of study. The objective of these pr ograms is to enhance the knowledge and clinical skills of chiropractic practitioners. ICA recogniz es that many options exist in postgraduate educatio n and encourages all doctors of chiropractic to parti cipate in substantive programs to maintain familiar ity with trends and developments, to maintain professio nal informational exchanges, and to enhance clinical skills. The Postgraduate Councils of the International Chir opractors Association meet the constitutional requirements of the ICA to foster the professional and technical development of the doctor of chiropractic and maximize the personal and professi onal fulfillment of the chiropractor within the traditional principles and values of chiropractic. Council membership is open to all licensed doctors of chiropractic regardless of their affiliation wit h ICA. Doctors of chiropractic who are not Council m embers may also enroll in the diplomate/certificati on educational programs. However, to obtain diplomate or certification status and to maintain that statu s, doctors must be members of that Council and fulfill the requirements for continued postgraduate education as set forth in the Council bylaws. The ICA publishes a Membership Referral Directory of Councils . All diplomates listed in this Directory have completed the 3-year, 300+ hours of postgraduate cl assroom instruction through a CCE-accredited institution and passed the Council's Board Examinat ion. Fellows have achieved their status with additional postgraduate teaching and research/publi shing requirements as well as other significant voluntary efforts for the chiropractic profession. The International Chiropractors Association holds t hat clear and concise communication to the public regarding health care is both vital and critical. Further, the public needs to clearly understand the skills, talents, and competencies each member of th e health care community brings to their benefit. Professional titles and identifiers can be confusi ng to the public. Health care professionals of all kinds must take whatever steps are necessary to accuratel y identify themselves to the public, avoid misrepresentation and reduce confusion wherever pos sible. It is in this spirit that the International Chiropractors Association is opposed to the use of terms such as \"chiropractic physician\" or \"chiropractic sports physician\" or \"chiropractic me dicine\". The ICA perceives that the public, the chiropractic profession and the medical profession are all well served by the avoidance of the use of such terms. ICA POLICY STATEMENT ON Spinal Sprain and Strain Injuries Inherent in most spinal sprain and strain injuries, there exists a biomechanical neurological componen t of articular malposition referred to chiropracticall y as subluxation. Such subluxation, if not address ed and merely treated with soft tissue therapeutics an d/or joint immobilization forms of care may lead to-42-joint fixation and/or instability and loss of motor unity integrity. It is the opinion of the International Chiropractor s Association that in such injuries evidence of the chiropractic vertebral subluxation complex should b e analyzed and, if present, be corrected by specifi c chiropractic articular adjustment before immobiliza tion procedures are applied. Lack of such correcti on of articular misalignment (subluxation) may result in permanent impairment, for waiting more than an hour, much less days, may lead to joint fixation, m otion impairment, neurological insult and/or hypermobility of the intervertebral motor unit. Ad justive reduction of the articular subluxation must be accomplished with due regard to soft tissue injury, attempt to enhance recovery and contribute to the prevention of future joint motion impairment, neuro logical impairment and deteriorative pathological consequences. ICA POLICY STATEMENT ON The Use of Anabolic Steroids The use of anabolic steroids presents a serious hea lth hazard to athletes of all age groups. The use of such growth and performance drugs is rapidly on the rise in all forms of sports. The easy availabi lity of such drugs from illegal sources is increasing to feed a growing demand. The International Chiropractors Association recogni zes the hazards presented by the illegal distributi on and use of anabolic steroids and other related drug s and strongly encourages doctors of chiropractic to incorporate factual information on this problem, as appropriate, in patient and community education programs. The ICA supports strong legislation to deter the di stribution and use of these substances and urges a vigorous program of education be undertaken by pu blic health authorities. The ICA pledges to do all it can as a responsible professional society, to educate the public both to the damages of steroi d use and to the benefits of drug-free athletic compe tition. Subluxation is a responsible and credible diagnosis for the doctor of chiropractic and this condition should be recognized and reimbursed as a primary di agnosis by all third-party payment organizations, both public and private. The analytical/diagnostic determination of a sublux ation indicates the need for chiropractic care. ICA POLICY STATEMENT ON Immunization and Vaccination The International Chiropractors Association recogni zes that the use of vaccines is not without risk an d questions the wisdom of mass vaccination programs. Chiropractic principles favor the enhancement of natural immunity over artificial immunization. The ICA supports each individual's right to select his or her own health care and to be made aware of the possible adverse effects of vaccines upon a hum an body. In accordance with such principles and based upon the individual's right to freedom of cho ice, the ICA is opposed to compulsory programs which infringe upon such rights. The International Chiropractors Association is supp ortive of a conscience clause or waiver inICA POLICY STATEMENT ON Subluxation as an Acceptable Primary Diagnosis-43-compulsory vaccination laws, providing an elective course of action for all regarding immunization, thereby allowing patients freedom of choice in matt ers affecting their bodies and health. ICA POLICY STATEMENT ON Videofluoroscopy Definition: Videoflouroscopy, Dynamic Spinal Visualization or C ineradiography is the specific, chiropractic, radiographic procedure, study, and in terpretation of the dynamics and kinetic properties of the spinal column and its immediate a rticulations. The International Chiropractors Association holds t hat videoflouroscopy, also known as cineradiography or dynamic spinal visualization, is a technology that is especially useful in the observation, determination and classification of ki netic irregularity as seen in the vertebral subluxa tion complex. A significant body of valid scientific li terature has been found to support this conclusion. The International Chiropractors Association officia lly recognizes videoflouroscopy to be an acceptable part of chiropractic care for the Doctor of Chiropr actic who is trained in this procedure.

OVERVIEW The doctor of chiropractic is a primary care, direc t access, first professional degree level provider who serves as a portal-of-entry into the h ealth care system. ICA understands the term primary care provider to be defined as: Any health care pro vider capable of providing first level contact and intake into the health delivery system, any health care provider licensed to receive patient contact i n the absence of physician referral. All laws and re gulations in the United States allow any citizen to seek the services of the doctor of chiropractic wit hout referral from any other provider. Individuals are free to seek basic essential care on the same indiv idual initiative basis that applies to other direct access providers. Only the doctor of chiropractic is professionally c ompetent to evaluate the chiropractic needs of a patient and to determine the level of service appropriate to meet those needs. Chiropractic intervention is indicated in all insta nces where the objective and/or subjective presence of subluxation can be demonstrated and/or in a setting of routine checkups. Patient needs must be individually determined on the basis of rec ognized procedures, but the issue of clinical necessity of providing adjustive care shall be base d on the presence of subluxation, and/or other structural misarticulations, which may or may not ha ve yet manifested subjective symptoms. The International Chiropractors Association recogni zes subluxation as an acceptable primary diagnosis, and includes the following official poli cy statement in their body of formally adopted posi tion statements: Subluxation is a responsible and credible diagnosis for the doctor of chiropractic and this condition should be recognized and reimbursed as a primary diagnosis by all third-party payment organizations, both public and private. The analytical/diagnostic determination of a sublux ation indicates the need for chiropractic care. Chiropractic understands that illness, dysfunction (lack of wellness), etc., is the product of the body's inability to maintain itself or to successfu lly adapt to its environmental circumstances. While recognizing that illness has multiple origins, chir opractic science holds that under normal circumstances, the self-healing powers of the body will be sufficient to deal with illness or dysfunct ion. The doctor of chiropractic's duty is to assist the body in this process, and to remove as many barrie rs as possible to self-healing. Chiropractic perceives the correction of subluxatio n at the earliest possible moment as the most basic, essential responsibility of the doctor of chiropractic. The adjustment of the subluxation( s) determined to be present is held by the chiropracti c profession to be the unique, fundamental intervention chiropractic has to offer. II LITERATURE REVIEW From the very beginning, the chiropractic model of health has had as its foundation the maxim that a human being is an ecologically and biologica lly unified organism. The relationship between a patient's internal and external environment must be understood. A major chiropractic premise is that the inherent recuperative power of the body aids re storation and maintenance of health. These assumptions comprise a wellness paradigm embraced b y the great majority of the chiropractic profession. A. The Objective Determination of Subluxation46The chiropractic literature specifically addresses the means of objectively identifying the presence of vertebral subluxation(s), apart from su bjective patient complaints and/or symptoms. Such reproducible, reliable procedures are the cornersto ne of chiropractic practice. A detailed review of instrumentation, imaging, and other procedures is p resented in later chapters. It is essential to not e here and refer the reader to those detailed discuss ions later in this work; as such objective indicato rs are the foundation for the clinical merit of basic essential care. Strong consensus as to acceptable objective procedu res has emerged and such procedures have been incorporated into chiropractic education, authorizing legislation and routine chiropractic practice. Kent, Grostic, et al conducted a consensu s study employing a variety of sound procedures that identified the following procedures as, \"havin g progressed beyond the experimental stage, and are acceptable procedures for general clinical prac tice.\" Those procedures were: a. Palpation (static and motion). b. Postural analysis. c. Orthopedic and neurological examination. d. X-ray spinography. e. Video fluoroscopy. f. Computed tomography. g. Magnetic resonance imaging. h. Skin temperature differential analysis, including thermography. i. Paraspinal EMG scanning. Of the procedures identified by Kent and Grostic, s ix represent imaging or instrumentation procedures that are extensively addressed in Chapte r 13, Diagnostic Imaging and Chapter 14, Instrumentation. Those chapters should be consulte d regarding the contribution those procedures make towards the objective determination of the pre sence of subluxation. Of the non-imaging and instrumentation procedures r outinely employed by doctors of chiropractic, palpation is perhaps the primary proc edure most universally applied. Indeed, Hass and Panzer state: The hands are the primary tools of the chiropractic and are of utmost importance in identifying subluxation. Faye and Wiles define palpation as: ...the use of tactile senses to determine varia tions in tissue consistence to recognize whether these variations are normal or ab normal. During palpation, the practitioner senses variations in temperature, shape and contour , textures, resistance, and motion. Palpation is usually conducted with a light, medium, or deep touch, using the pads of the fingertips...There are two basic classifications of manual palpation, static and dynamic. Palpation provides the doctor of chiropractic with unique information about the state of the patient and the relationship of the various spinal segments in the patient. Bryner and Bruin found that chiropractic colleges responding to their survey ut ilize palpation in basic diagnostic instruction, wi th an emphasis by those responding on motion palpation an d joint play assessment. Palpation has been a key element in the chiropracti c examination process from its very beginnings. D.D. Palmer and Dr. B.J. Palmer both w rote extensively on palpation and co-developed a variety of techniques, including nerve tracing, s tatic and motion forms of palpation. An abundance of chiropractic texts exist which prov ide extensive and detailed procedural guides to palpation. Haldeman, et al, Faye and Scha fer, Gillet and Schafer provide extensive discussions of palpation procedures and articles nu mbering in the hundreds have been published on various aspects of palpation and the subluxation.47Akin to palpation, range of motion studies provide the doctor of chiropractic with important information about the state of a patient from indiv idual testing and observation. Meeker writes, Assessing the range of limb and trunk motion is sti ll considered to be one of the most objective ways to judge disability of the motor system and is a standard pa rt of the chiropractor's diagnostic procedures. Blunt, Gatterman and Bereznick offer a highly detailed dis cussion of mobility in the human spine and attempt to quantify ranges of normal for the various segmen ts of the spine. In their analysis, the characteristics and analysis of normal dynamic regional and inter-s egmental motion are explored to understand a devian ce from these patterns that characterizes the abnormal moti on of a subluxation complex. A continuum of abnorm al motion is described, from hypomobility to hypermobi lity and instability. Blunt, et al note that, ...the literature spawns a wide range of techniques used to evaluate and describe ranges of motion. The utility and validity of all such procedures is related to the degree to which such procedures allow the patient's status to be quantified and measured, and the validity of the scales of normal and abnormal against which an individual patient's findings are compared. There is consensus, however, regarding the importance of range of motion studies in gathering subluxation related information and such procedures continue to commend themselves to chiropractic practice beca use of the objective nature of findings. Muscle testing is also routinely employed in chirop ractic practice as a basis for gathering objective indications regarding the status of patie nts. Meeker writes, Assessment of muscle function for strength and quality of contraction is a standard t est of the motor system. Manual muscle testing is popular and, indeed, forms the basis of several techniques used by chiropractors. In the general healthcare literature (Mayer and Gatchel, 1988) muscle weaknes s is related to a number of complaints and dysfunctions. In recent years, the development of sophisticated muscle testing equipment, including computerized muscle testing equipment, has changed the status of these procedures somewhat from individual evaluations done by the DC to measures t hat fall into the category of instrumentation. A fuller discussion of such computerized muscle testi ng activities is found in Chapter 16. Subsequent chapters provide detailed discussions of the standard as well as the developmental means of determining the presence of subluxation by objective means. Those chapters should be consulted for detailed information of the various procedures employed. The essential point necessary to the discussion here is that a wide ran ge of accepted, accurate means of determining the presence of subluxation have been developed and tha t strong consensus exists within the chiropractic profession as to what those means are and how and w hen they should be applied. B. The Progressive Nature of Spinal Subluxation Behavior such as physical and emotional stress, ten sion, chemical/environmental stressors, repetitive motion, over-extension of spinal tissues and/or characteristics such as posture, weight, or even footwear can establish patterns of progressive subluxation that lead to the degeneration of spina l segments . As well, injury, periods of confined in activity or immobilization such as a long hospital stay, and congenital structural problems may give rise t o subluxation. There is growing consensus in the chiropractic prof ession that inter-vertebral subluxation occurs as a result of numerous postural and traumat ic insults, initially creating segmental dysfunctio n with its motion disturbance and inflammatory and is chemic sequelae, and subsequently results in: 1. JOINT INSTABILITY, 2. SPINAL DEGENERATION, and 3 . ABNORMAL STABILIZATION, as the final attempt by the body to ameliorate the spinal lesion . Attempts have been made to quantify the degene ration process and terms such as \"phase of subluxation degeneration\" have been commonly used t o identify the progressive stages of the subluxation lesion, although there is no single, u niversally agreed upon description of subluxation phases operative in the profession at this time. T he terms \"subluxation\" and \"vertebral subluxation complex\" are, however, universally employed to desc ribe the subluxation lesion, regardless of stage or point of progression. 48 A three-phase model of subluxation generation has been developed by numerous sources. Sandoz, Leach and Gibson have extensively developed this approach to classifying the degeneration process. According to this approach, since the ver tebral subluxation complex (VSC) is associated with pathophysiological sequelae of the correctable lesio n regardless of the phase or stage of degeneration with which it has been associated, th e three-phase model will be utilized in these discussions. Sandoz may have articulated the natural history of the vertebral subluxation complex more thoroughly than any other chiropractic theorist in his paper \"The Natural History of a Spinal Degenerative Lesion.\" According to the Sandoz Model, Phase 3 is asso ciated with episodic fixations. A vertebral fixati on occurs when a vertebra becomes temporarily immobili zed in a position that it may occupy during any phase of physiological spinal movement. The final stage of spinal dysfunction is terme d VSC Phase 3: this is phase of stabilization, of f ixation to the point of frank immobilization, and the final phase of repair. This phase is characterized by s igns of advanced degenerative joint disease such as ossi fication of the longitudinal ligaments, formation of uncovertebral arthrosis and, in the most advanced cases, vertebral ankylosis. Since hypermobility is such a central and perh aps more commonly recognized component of spinal dysfunction, a brief review of scientific literatur e regarding the role of immobilization in promoting spinal dysfunction and degeneration will be helpful to our discussion of the phases of the Vertebral Subluxation Complex. Muscular atrophy following immobilization has been extensively investigated. In addition to functional, structural and biochemical properties o f immobilization, Appell has discussed oxygen suppl y and use, connective tissue changes and recovery fro m immobilization. These sorts of studies, including the postmortem examinations of Hadley and others, show that the earliest phase of Vertebral Subluxation Complex (Spinal Dysfunction with its pr imary characteristic of restricted joint mobility) can create not only the second phase of VSC--the instab ility often associated with the radiographically demonstrable intervertebral subluxation\u2014but also le ad to the stabilizing and immobilizing final phase of VSC--the response referred to as osteo-arthrosis or degenerative joint disease to the point of vertebral ankylosis. In human research, the role of immobilization in promoting osteoarthritis and impeding healing is well established. Immobilization promotes thickeni ng of the joint capsule and results in increased capsular tension, compression of articular cartilag e, subsequent disturbance of chondrocyte metabolism, fibrillation, depletion of glycosaminog lycans and finally, arthritic changes to the joint. Pain can trigger the immobilization and can result from the arthritic changes as well, thus completing a deleterious cycle. A few examples of acceptable chiropractic diag noses using the unified model for phases of vertebral subluxation complex follow: 1. VSC PHASE 1 LESION: Dysfunction with right rotation, restr iction, and cervicogenic headache. 2. VSC PHASE 2 LESION: Grade 2 Spondylolisthesis of L5 (Unstable on flexio n of the trunk) with mild degenerative joint disease at L5/S1 (explain p articulars of degenerative joint disease in a separ ate radiology report) and sciatic neuritis. 3. degener ative joint disease49in a separate radiology report) with right lateral bending restriction and cervicalgia. A three-phase model for the progression of the ver tebral subluxation complex (VSC), based upon a synthesis of the literature, includes: VSC Phase 1 , the phase of spinal dysfunction; VSC Phase 2, the phase of instability; and VSC Phase 3, the final ph ase of abnormal stabilization. Research on immobilization degeneration, in addition to other b iomedical research, lends strong support for this model to predict progression of spinal degenerative lesions. Spinal degeneration and its reversibility has bee n the subject of considerable scientific debate. O.J. Ressel, based on a comprehensive revie w of 329 published references and a series of detailed case studies, concluded that chiropractic intervention not only halted spinal osteoarthritis, but also reversed the deterioration process by measurab le levels. Conversely, individuals who exercise in a manner that puts the spine through a full rang e of motion on a periodic basis, develop the supporting muscles of the vertebrae and foster stro ng circulation, and promote spinal health through such activities. The incidence of spinal degenerative disease is wel l established. Tencer, et al, stated that osteoarthritis is detectable in 35 percent of the U .S. population by age 30 and Lawrence stated that ten percent of all individuals in the U.S. between the ages of 14 and 24 had roentgeno-graphically identifiable osteoarthritis. Numerous studies have also indicated that spinal degeneration plagues men and women equally and Anderson, Buerger, et al have indicated that osteoarthritis is not influenced by climatic, geographic or ethnic considerations. S pinal degeneration is demonstrably a near-universal condition. The erosion of spinal tissues is seen by some as s imply a natural and predictable manifestation of the aging process. Indeed, the nea rly universal incidence of spinal degeneration is powerful evidence that this is a plausible assertio n. The response of spinal tissues to the chiropract ic adjustment, as demonstrated by Ressel, indicates th at the process of spinal degeneration is not an unstoppable process and that chiropractic adjustmen ts revivify the spinal tissues through the restoration of normal nerve function as well as sti mulate biochemical changes that enhance the performance of spinal tissues. The relationship between neurological deficit-relat ed spinal degeneration and the subluxation represent one of the most exciting research frontie rs of human health. Likewise the health implication s of the chiropractic adjustment, which works to elim inate such neurological deficits and conditions caused thereby, are already well established, but r equire massive new research if the precise mechanisms of the healing process are to be fully u nderstood. Spinal degeneration associated with the subluxation complex has been well documented and much written about. Erhardt demonstrated in great d etail the progression of the untreated subluxation via x-ray. Lantz, Harrison, Junghanns, and Eisenste in, likewise have shown the progressive nature of the subluxation. Such evidence indicates the high c linical utility of early chiropractic intervention, regardless of the presence of subjective symptoms. The degenerative nature of the subluxation has been widely described in terms of phases. Commonly, four phases of subluxation degeneration a re recognized and have been widely described in the literature. As well, these four phases corr espond to x-ray findings and can be demonstrated clearly via diagnostic imaging. Four-Phase Definition of Subluxation While not in conflict in any way with the thre e-phase model of subluxation, some researchers and practitioners have elected to utilize a four-phase approach to describing the degenerative progression of the subluxation. This model is, however, freque ntly used in interpreting radiological findings.50 In this approach, a \"Near Normal\" spine is pre sented as a model or baseline. This concept has been defined as follows: Near Normal: Prior to the emergence of any phase of subluxation degeneration, a patient who is in a state of basic effective functioning can be chara cterized as near normal. Such patients present with an absence of significant or outstanding clinical indicators and functions within normal limits.51PHASE I - SUBLUXATION no radiographic degenerative changes mild aberrant motion mild muscle involvement mild local tissue inflammation mild biochemical changes/pathology mild soft tissue degradation mild neurological involvement PHASE II - SUBLUXATION mild to moderate radiographic degenerative changes mild to moderate aberrant motion mild to moderate muscle involvement mild to moderate local tissue inflammation mild to moderate biochemical changes/pathology mild to moderate soft tissue degradation mild to moderate neurological involvementPHASE III SUBLUXATION Moderate radiographic degenerative changes Moderate aberrant motion Moderate muscle involvement Moderate local tissue inflammation Moderate biochemical changes/pathology Moderate soft tissue degradation Moderate neurological involvement PHASE IV - SUBLUXATION severe radiographic degenerative changes severe aberrant motion severe muscle involvement severe local tissue inflammation severe biochemical changes/pathology severe soft tissue degradation severe neurological involvement C. Early Detection, Early Intervention and \"Wellness \" Enhanced public awareness of environmental, psychos ocial, and physiological issues through education and community action has forced early det ection/early intervention into the public health agenda as a significant new priority. Smoking cessa tion, weight control, nutritional considerations, stress reductions, advice about exposure to environ mental pollutants and education in respect to the potential dangers of over-the-counter drugs are exa mples of initiatives affecting the chiropractic pat ient population worldwide. However, the most important and vital preventive measure which has been severely neglected care the importance of which has been illustrated in this chapter is spinal health education and prevention services, best introduced during routine check ups. These guidelines hopefully will aid in rectifying this situation Coile offers this historical input: \"Thirty years ago, Rene Dubos, a research microbiologist, suggested in Mirage of Health that the advancements he and others had made in the development of antibiotics and therapeutics had less to do with th e real health of populations than a variety of economic, social, nutritional, and behavioral facto rs. Five years later, the U.S. Surgeon General's landmark report clearly revealed the links between smoking and diseases such as emphysema, chronic bronchitis, hypertension, and lung cancer. \"A new awareness of the contribution of lifestyle, environment, and genetics infused medicine in the decade following. Sometimes called the 'wel lness movement', this new orientation broadened the paradigm of traditional biomedicine. Since Dub os' essay on health, a body of research findings has accumulated that demonstrates the validity of a more comprehensive approach to health, one which recognizes the many antecedents and co-factor s in the disease and healing process. \"Although not fully accepted by all physicians, the holistic concept of health is gaining stature. Dozens of studies by employers have begun to quant ify the beneficial impact of health promotion programs in terms of reduced health care utilizatio n and lower health care costs.\" Long-term care concepts and considerations in chiro practic have been discussed by a number of authors. Jamison offers a comprehensive overview of the current trends in chiropractic, and worksheets for health care assessment. McDowell an d Newell describe general health care indicators52and instruments. Jamison reviews the improvement of basic health status by alteration of behavior, especially through health education. Some recent surveys focus upon neuro-musculoskeleta l chiropractic practice, but other current literature takes a firm stance on the importance of maintaining a focus on prevention and health promotion, through routine checkups. A detailed analysis of a database collected during a three-year randomized study of senior citizens over 75 years of age revealed that patient s who received chiropractic care reported better overall health, used fewer prescription drugs, and spent fewer days in hospitals and nursing homes than elderly non-chiropractic patients. The chiropr actic patients were also more likely to exercise vigorously and more likely to be mobile in the comm unity. Eighty-seven percent of the chiropractic patients d escribed their health status as good to excellent, compared to only 67 percent of the non-c hiropractic patients. Furthermore, the chiropractic patient spent 15 percent less time in nursing homes and 21 percent less time in hospitals than the non - chiropractic patients. III. LIST OF SUBTOPICS A.

Initial Presentation-Referral Needs 4. Determining Appropriate Chiropractic Care 5. Care Delivery 6. Re-Evaluation for New Condition or Re-Injury 7. Progress Evaluation 8. Duration of Care C. Referral A. Basic Essential Care Subluxation is a progressive condition and it is th erefore in the patients essential interest to have subluxation addressed through the chiropractic adjustment at the earliest moment. Delay in receiving chiropractic care can result in increasin gly severe subluxation dysfunction and require an extended period of chiropractic procedures to corre ct, proportionally prolonged according to duration of the period of neglect. Such early detection and intervention to address em erging subluxation patterns is basic, essential patient care, and is addressed at the rou tine checkup and prevention visit. When the objective indicators of subluxation show the presen ce of a defined spinal lesion, the doctor of chiropractic is alerted to the specific anatomical and physiological basis for chiropractic interventi on. Subluxation(s) have been demonstrated to be present in persons of all ages, from the newborn infant to the most senior citizen. Likewise, author izing laws and regulations empower doctors of chiropractic to care for patients of all ages with no exceptions, and chiropractic education instructs professionals in training in the proper procedures and techniques necessary to address the spinal needs of all patients, including infants and the el derly. The Council on Chiropractic Education (CCE) the agency recognized by the United States Departme nt of Education for the accreditation of chiropractic professional programs recognizes no ex ceptions or limitations on the appropriateness of53chiropractic procedures because of age. The Interna tional Chiropractors Association recognizes the utility and appropriateness of chiropractic procedu res for all persons regardless of age, and views efforts to restrict the access of any age group to chiropractic services as profoundly discriminatory, contrary to the laws of the several states and unsu pported by the scientific literature. Periodic chiropractic examinations to determine obj ectively the presence of subluxation(s) are in the patient's interest, and are called routine c heckups and prevention visits. This is often refer red to as maintenance or wellness care. The frequency o f the need for such examinations must be determined on the basis of individual evaluation. Such periodic examinations are a vital component of quality basic health care. In the absence of su bjective patient complaints of specific symptoms, t he doctor of chiropractic must focus on objective meas ures and fully educate the patient on the status of their condition, and the measures to be taken to ac hieve optimal health. Routine checkups provides both patient and doctor w ith the opportunity to examine environmental circumstances, behavioral factors and individual patient characteristics that may contribute to spinal problems. In addition to the a djustment of any subluxation(s) demonstrated to be present, if at all, in the course of routine checku ps, the doctor of chiropractic may assist patients in altering conditions that might contribute to or set the state for on-going and/or progressively severe subluxation patterns. Such care efforts emphasize p atient responsibility and may include exercise programs, weight loss, dietary counseling, life sty le modifications, education on body postures and mechanics, mental attitude, coordination training, safety habits, ergonomics, spinal hygiene, modification of life stressors, etc. Health care policy makers, providers and consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the merits of early detection and early intervention in all human health concerns. From tooth decay to cancer, the progressive nature of human deteriorati on means that in both human and economic terms, early detection and early intervention are highly d esirable goals. B. Chiropractic Patient Evaluation and Care Pathway This decision tree regarding the pathways and evalu ation process for a patient presenting at the chiropractic office is based on the doctor of c hiropractic's competence to evaluate the general health status and needs of each patient and determi ne the appropriateness of chiropractic care and/or the need for referral to other provider(s) for urge nt care, additional diagnostic evaluation in the co ntext of another branch of the healing arts, concurrent c are, or no care at all, etc. It also recognizes tha t the majority of patients making the decision to seek th e services of any health care professional do so on the basis of some self-perceived symptom, problem o r health concern, or at the behest of a patient or guardian. This patient care pathway is graphica lly presented in Table 1. P. 26(a) 1. Routine Checkup and Prevention/Wellness Care 2. Initial Presentation--Is Emergency Care Needed Upon presentation of each new patient, the doctor o f chiropractic determines whether there is any condition, element or crisis that requires t he immediate referral for emergency life-saving car e or urgent care. The attending doctor of chiropractic is competent t o determine, on the basis of immediate findings whether the patient is in immediate need o f emergency intervention. 3. Initial Presentation--Is the Care of Another Prov ider Needed In the course of this evaluation, the attending doc tor determines whether there are findings that indicate the need for referral to another prov ider.54If indications for immediate referral are not prese nt, the patient proceeds along the care pathway to the next level. If such a referral is n ecessary it does not preclude concurrent chiropract ic care. 4. Determining Appropriate Chiropractic Care - Are T here Potential Restrictions On Chiropractic Care The elimination of imperatives to refer having been undertaken, the next step on the chiropractic care pathway centers on the development of an appropriate course of adjustive care, if needed. In that process, the patient's needs and c ircumstances are evaluated to determine whether there is a need, and if so whether there are any r estrictions on the delivery of adjustive care. Thi s evaluation process will direct the attending doctor to employ specific chiropractic techniques that ar e appropriate to the status of the patient. 5. Care Delivery Having carefully worked through the evaluation proc ess eliminating potential red flags to standard care and techniques, the doctor of chiropr actic next outlines and delivers a program of adjustive care according to the individual needs of the patient, based on the lifestyles and presentin g factors, i.e. phase of subluxation. 6. Re-Evaluation for New Condition(s) and/or Re-Inju ry On each encounter, the doctor of chiropractic will determine whether new conditions and/or injuries might require alterations in the care plan . If there are no such indications, the program of care previously devised will continue. 7. Progress Evaluation After a reasonable period of care, each patient's p rogress will be evaluated to determine the effectiveness of the chosen course of care and to d etermine whether alterations in that program are indicated, ad determined by the clinician. 9. Duration of Care (see Chapter 11) C. Referral Referral is a professional obligation that is prese nt throughout all phases and aspects of the chiropractic practice. The primary obligation of Do ctors of Chiropractic is to provide the highest qua lity of care to each patient within the confines of thei r education and their legal authority. It is the po sition of the International Chiropractors Association that this primary obligation includes recognizing when the limits of skill and authority are reached. At that point, it is the ICA's position that doctors i n all fields of practice are ethically and morally bound to make patient referrals to practitioners in their own an d/or other fields of healing when such referrals are nec essary to provide the highest quality of patient ca re. This interchange of professional referrals includes , but should not be limited to, doctors of chiropra ctic, doctors of medicine, and osteopathy. Doctors of Chiropractic are also obligated to recei ve referrals from other health care providers, applying to those patients the same considerations for quality and appropriateness of care as with any other patients. It is the position of the ICA that the professional obligation to the patient includes honest, full and straightforward communication with the referring provider on the issue of optimal patient care.55IV.

Overview This component of the International Chiropractors Association protocols and guidelines represents the incorporation of a fully compatible clinical practice document developed by a parallel guidelines committee. The focus of t his section is on the subluxation, the core of chiropractic clinical responsibility. In m any respects, this chapter is a summary document that addresses in an efficient and concent rated format the essentials of subluxation detection and care. This section is the intellectual product of an inde pendent panel of chiropractic researchers, educators and practitioners, the Counc il on Chiropractic Practice (CCP), consisting of William Ralph Boone, Ph.D., DC, Terry A. Rondberg, DC, Harold G. McCoy, DC, Emmanuel T. Akporiaye, Ph.D., Robert Bla nks, Ph.D., Patrick Gentempo, DC, John J. Gerhardt, M.D., Veronica Gutierrez, DC, Jonathan Hatch, Esq., Jay Holder, DC, Carol James (consumer representative), Matthew McCoy, DC, Stephen F. Renner, DC and Steven Shochat, DC. This panel was chaired by Christopher Kent, DC, who also served as a member of the ICA Guidelines Commi ttee. The CCP effort came to fruition in 1998, and this text has been incorporat ed into the ICA protocols and guidelines with the permission of the CCP and upon vote of the ICA Board of Directors. These guidelines were specifically compiled accordi ng to strict evidenced-based guidelines development procedures. Evidence-based clinical practice is defined as \"The conscientious, explicit and judicious use of t he current evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients...(it ) is not restricted to randomized trials and meta-analysis. It involves tracking down the b est external evidence with which to answer our clinical questions.\" (Sackett, DL. Edito rial: Evidence Based Medicine, Spine, 1998; 23(10):1085. RATINGS AND CATEGORIES OF EVIDENCE RATINGS Established: Accepted as appropriate for use in chiropractic pra ctice for the indications and applications stated. Investigational: Further study is warranted. Evidence is equivocal , or insufficient to justify a rating of \"established\". Inappropriate: Insufficient favorable evidence exists to support t he use of this procedure in chiropractic practice.67CATEGORIES OF EVIDENCE E. Expert opinion based on clinical experience, basi c scientific rationale, and/or individual case studies. Where appropriate, this c ategory includes legal opinion. L. Literature support in the form of reliability and validity studies, observational studies, \"pre-post\" studies, and/or multiple case studies. Where appropriate, this category includes case law. C. Controlled studies, including randomized and non- randomized clinical trials of acceptable quality. The entire following text represents the unaltered work of the CCP panel. The International Chiropractors Association wishes to e xpress sincere appreciation for the efforts of those who participated in this important endeavor. ICA wishes to highlight the full compatibility of the findings of this group wi th those of the ICA Guidelines Committee. That these parallel yet independent eff orts developed such highly consistent findings is an indication of the fundame ntal validity of the respective conclusions and practice recommendations. History and Chiropractic Examination II CASE HISTORY RECOMMENDATION A thorough case history should precede the initiati on of chiropractic care. The elements of this history should include general information, reason for seeking chiropractic care, onset and duration of any symptomatic problem, fami ly history, past health history, occupational history, and social history. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L Commentary The purpose of the case history is to elicit inform ation which might reveal salient points concerning the patient's spinal and general health that lead the chiropractor to elect appropriate examination procedures. The case histor y may provide information which will assist the chiropractor in determining the saf ety and appropriateness of chiropractic care as well as the nature of additional analytical procedures to be performed. History taking is considered a key element of quality patie nt care necessary for effective doctor- patient communication and improved patient health o utcomes.(1-4) Verbal, nonverbal and cognitive assessment are also included in the p atient history. The chiropractic case history should emphasize eliciting information rele vant to the etiology and clinical manifestations of vertebral subluxation.68CHIROPRACTIC EXAMINATION RECOMMENDATION The initial chiropractic examination shall include a case history and an assessment for the presence of vertebral subluxation, which, if pr esent, is to be noted with regard to location and character. A review of systems may be conducted at the discretion of the practitioner, consistent with individual training a nd applicable state laws. Reassessments may be conducted periodically through out a course of chiropractic care to assess patient progress. Such reassessments typi cally emphasize re-examination of findings which were positive on the previous examin ation, although need not be limited to same. Reassessment is also indicated in the case of trauma or change in the clinical status of a patient. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L Commentary The term subluxation has a long history in the heal ing arts literature. It may be used differently outside of the chiropractic profession. The earliest non-chiropractic English definition is attributed to Randall Holme in 1668. Holme defined subluxation as \"a dislocation or putting out of joynt\"(5) In medical literature, subluxation often refers to an osseous disrelationship which is less than a disloc ation.(6) However, B.J. Palmer, the developer of chiropractic, hypothesized that the \"v ertebral subluxation\" was unique from the medical use of the term \"subluxation\" in that i t also interfered with the transmission of neurological information independent of what has come to be recognized as the action potential. Since this component has yet to b e identified in a quantitative sense, practitioners currently assess the presence and cor rection of vertebral subluxation through parameters which measure its other componen ts.(7) These may include some type of vertebral biomechanical abnormality,(8-14) soft tissue insult of the spinal cord and/or associated structures(15-49) and some form o f neurological dysfunction involving the synapse separate from the transmissio n of neurological information referred to by Palmer.(50-57) As noted, chiropractic definitions of subluxation i nclude a neurological component. In this regard, Lantz (58) stated \"common to all conce pts of subluxation are some form of kinesiologic[al...sic] dysfunction and some form of neurologic[al...sic] involvement.\" In a recently adopted position paper, The Association of Chiropractic Colleges accepted a definition of subluxation as follows: \"A subluxatio n is a complex of functional and/or structural and/or pathological articular changes th at compromise neural integrity and may influence organ system function and general hea lth.\"(59) The case history and examination are means of acquiring information pert inent to the location and analysis of subluxation. This information is primarily used to characterize subluxation regarding its presence, location, duration, and type. Additionall y, the information gained through69analysis guides the practitioner to ascertain which chiropractic techniques best suit the patient to effect correction of the condition. Data collected during the patient's initial consult ation and examination, pertaining to the health history and presenting concerns, thus suppor ts the decision-making process of the practitioner. This information, relayed by the practitioner to the patient, further serves to incorporate the patient into the decision -making process regarding chiropractic care. Elements of the Examinati on History Important elements of the case history include prev ious and present social and occupational events revealed by the patient; unusua l sensations, moods or actions relative to the patient, with dates of occurrence a nd duration; previous chiropractic and non-chiropractic intervention; and other factors. T he case history usually includes the following: 1. Patient clinical profile. A. Age. B. Gender. C. Occupation. D. Other information germane to the presenting compla int, if any. 2. Primary reasons for seeking chiropractic care. A. Primary reason. B. Secondary reason. C. Other factors contributing to the primary and seco ndary reasons. 3. Chief complaint, if one exists. This may include onset and duration of symptoms as well as their subjective and objective character istics, and location, as well as aggravating or relieving factors. A Trauma, by etiology, when possible. B. Chief complaint. C. Characteristics of chief complaint. D. Intensity/frequency/location, radiation/onset/dura tion. E. Aggravating/arresting factors. F. Previous interventions (including chiropractic ca re), treatments, medications, surgery. G. Quality of pain, if present. H. Sleeping position and sleep patterns.704. Family history. A. Associated health problems of relatives. B. Cause of parents' or siblings' death and age of d eath. 5. Past health history. A. Overall health status. B. Previous illnesses. C. Surgery. D. Previous injury or trauma. E. Medication and reactions. F. Allergies. G. Pregnancies and outcomes. H. Substance abuse and outcomes. 6. Social and occupational history. A. Level of education. B. Job description. C. Work schedule. D. Recreational activities. E. Lifestyle (hobbies, level of exercise, drug use, nature of diet). F. Psychosocial and mental health. Chiropractic Analysis Complementing the case history is the necessity of conducting a thorough chiropractic analysis. This involves procedures which indicate t he presence, location, and character of vertebral subluxation. Inherent in this process is the noting of unusual findings, both related and unrelated to vertebral subluxation. Thi s information is useful in determining the safety and appropriateness of chiropractic care . The analysis is based partly upon the recognition t hat vertebral subluxation may be asymptomatic, yet still exert various physiological effects. Thus, by assimilating information relative to certain body systems, the p resence of vertebral subluxation may be inferred. Examination protocols have been develo ped by field practitioners and researchers. Many of these protocols have been deem ed acceptable by the various chiropractic educational institutions. This accepta nce is expressed either through adding the protocols to the curriculum, or awarding contin uing education credit to post-graduate seminars instructing these protocols, thus judging them to be sufficient in safety, efficacy, and validity to be included in clinical p ractice. Manual palpation is a basic element of the chiropra ctic examination. This aspect of analysis includes palpation of the bony elements of the spine and includes assessment of the motion of the spine as a whole as well as th e individual vertebral motion segments. Palpation of the numerous muscles which a ttach to and control the stability, posture, and motion of the spine is included. Stati c vertebral position is analyzed for abnormality. The chiropractor is additionally inter ested in locating areas of abnormal71segmental motion to identify hypermobile segments a nd segments with decreased joint play (hypomobility). Palpation may also include eva luation of soft tissue compliance, tenderness, and asymmetric or hypertonic muscle con traction. The presence of vertebral subluxation may bring with it varying deg rees of attendant edema, capsulitis, muscle splinting, and tenderness to digital palpati on. There may be tenderness of the spinous processes upon percussion of these structur es when vertebral subluxation is present. Neurological components of the subluxation, postura l distortions and other factors may bring deep and superficial myospasm to muscles of t he spine, pelvis and extremities. Palpation may reveal myofascial trigger points whic h are associated with the articular dysfunctions accompanying vertebral subluxations. M uscular involvement may manifest as \"taut and tender\" fibers. Visual inspection of the spine and paraspinal regio n may reveal areas of hypo- or hyperemia associated with vertebral subluxation. Ob servation of patient posture is an important element of chiropractic analysis.(60-62) Posture has far-reaching effects on physiology, biomechanics, psychology, and esthetics .(63) Proper body alignment relates to functional efficiency while poor structu ral alignment limits function. Changes in posture are considered in some chiropractic approac hes as a measure of outcome.(64- 69) Plain film radiographs, as well as other forms of imaging may provide information concerning the integrity of osseous and soft tissue s as well as juxtapositional relationships. Other assessments such as leg length analysis,(70-94) palpatory and strength challenges(95-130) are also employed to as sess states of muscular responses to neurological facilitation. Spinal distortions an d resultant neurological interference may create postural or neurological reflex syndromes which result in a functional change in apparent leg length. This information is also combi ned with skin temperature assessments(131-138) and/or electromyography(139-16 7, 175-180) as well as technique-specific examination procedures to evalua te the integrity of the nervous system.(181-182) Although clinical tradition suppor ts the use of orthopedic and neurological tests in chiropractic practice, resear ch to support the applicability of many of these tests to the assessment of vertebral sublu xation is lacking or negative.(168- 174). Orthopedic and neurological tests are indica ted only when relevant to the assessment of vertebral subluxation, or when determining the safety and appropriateness of chiropractic care. It is recognized that research will continue to evo lve the most efficacious applications of assessment techniques described in this document. However, the literature is sufficiently supportive of their usefulness in rega rd to the chiropractic examination to warrant inclusion as components of the present reco mmendation. The chiropractic examination may include, but not b e limited to: 1. Clinical examination procedures. A. Palpation (static osseous and muscular, motion). B. Range of motion.72C. Postural examination. D. Muscle strength testing. E. Orthopedic/neurological tests. F. Mental status examination procedures. G. Quality of life assessment instruments. H. Substance abuse and outcomes. 2. Imaging and instrumentation A. Plain film radiography. B. Videofluoroscopy. C. Computerized tomography. D. Magnetic resonance imaging. E. Range of motion. F. Thermography. G. Temperature reading instruments. H. Electromyography. I. Pressure algometry. J. Nerve/function tests. K. Electroencephalography. 3. Review of systems. A. Musculoskeletal. B. Cardiovascular and respiratory. C. Gastrointestinal. D. Genitourinary. E. Nervous system. F. Eye, ear, nose and throat. G. Endocrine. Clinical Impression An appropriate interpretation of case history and e xamination findings is essential in determining the appropriate application of chiropra ctic care within the overall needs of the patient. The clinical impression derived from p atient information acquired through the examination process is ultimately translated in to a plan of corrective care, including those elements which are contraindicated. The clinic al impression serves to focus the practitioner on the patient's immediate and long-te rm needs. It is through this process that a clear picture is created regarding the patie nt's status relative to chiropractic care. Initial Consultation The initial consultation serves the purpose of dete rmining how chiropractic care can benefit the patient. It is during this interchange that the practitioner presents and discusses examination findings with the patient. Ad ditionally, during the initial consultation, the practitioner should take the oppo rtunity to present his/her practice objectives and terms of acceptance. The terms of ac ceptance provides the patient with73information regarding the objectives, responsibilit ies and limitations of the care to be provided by the practitioner. This reciprocal ackn owledgment allows both practitioner and patient to proceed into the plan of care with w ell-defined expectations. While not limited to the following, it is suggested that the initial consultation include the following parameters: 1. Description of chiropractic: Chiropractic is a pr imary contact health care profession receiving patients without necessity of referral from other health care providers. Traditionally, chiropractic focuses on t he anatomy of the spine and its immediate articulations, the existence and nature o f vertebral subluxation, and a scope of practice which encompasses the correction of vertebral subluxation, as well as educating and advising patients concerning this condition, and its impact on general health. 2. Professional responsibility: To assess the propri ety of applying methods of analysis and vertebral subluxation correction to pa tients; to recognize and deal appropriately with emergency situations; and to rep ort to the patient any nonchiropractic findings discovered during the cour se of the examination, making referral to other health professionals for care or for evaluation of conditions outside the scope of chiropractic practice. Such re ferral does not obviate the responsibility of the chiropractor for providing ap propriate chiropractic care. 3. Practice objective: The professional practice obj ective of the chiropractor is to correct or stabilize the vertebral subluxation in a safe and effective manner. The correction of vertebral subluxation is not consider ed a specific cure or treatment for any specific medical disease or symptom. Rather , it is applicable to any patient exhibiting vertebral subluxation, regardles s of the presence or absence of symptoms and diseases. References 1. Bates B. A guide to physical examination.

When using instrumentation, baseline values should be determin ed prior to the initiation of care. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L Commentary The chiropractor uses a variety of procedures to as sess the vertebral subluxation. These methods may include history taking, physical examination, imaging procedures and instrumentation. Through information gained fro m research and personal experience, the chiropractor generally assigns a pe rsonal value to each procedure in a particular clinical circumstance. The intent of thi s chapter is to describe clinical applications for the various instruments that may b e used by chiropractors in examining their patients for evidence of vertebral subluxatio n. Definition of instrumentation: The use of any tool or device used to obtain objective data, which can be recorded in a reproducible manne r, about the condition of the patient relative to vertebral subl uxation. Such instrumentation as that described below may provide information concerning the biomechanical and/or neurological aspects of vertebral subluxation. POSTURAL ANALYSIS Sub-Recommendation Postural analysis using plumb line devices, compute rized and non-computerized instruments may be used to evaluate changes in post ure associated with vertebral subluxation. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L Posture analysis is recommended for determining pos tural aberrations associated with vertebral subluxation. The findings of such examina tions should be recorded in the patient record. In order to encourage standardizati on of reporting, it is suggested that findings be recorded in a form consistent with manu facturers' recommendations. Posture analysis may include the use of such device s as the plumb line, scoliometer and posturometer.(1-8) Posture is often analyzed by x-ray methods(9-13) simply by visualizing the patient and making determinations b ased on that visualization. The procedure is often enhanced by a plumb line and oth er vertical and horizontal lines.89BILATERAL AND FOUR-QUADRANT WEIGHT SCALES Sub-Recommendation Bilateral and four-quadrant weight scales may be us ed to determine the weight distribution asymmetries indicative of spinal abnor malities. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L Unequal weight distribution has been shown to be in dicative of spinal abnormalities.(14- 18) Weight scales are a simple and effective means to determine weight distribution asymmetries. MOIR\u00c9 CONTOUROGRAPHY Sub-Recommendation Moir\u00e9 contourography may be used to provide a photo graphic record of changes in body contour associated with vertebral subluxation. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L Moir\u00e9 contourography is a photographic technique wh ich yields information regarding body contours and their variations for the purpose of evaluating structural abnormality. It is useful to the chiropractor because body surface asymmetries may be indicative of the presence of vertebral subluxation.(19-33) INCLINOMETRY Inclinometry may be used as a means of measuring mo tion against a constant vertical component of gravity as a reference. Changes in ran ges of spinal motion may be associated with vertebral subluxation. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L Mechanical, electronic and fluid-filled inclinomete rs are available.(34-38) Inclinometer measurements have been thoroughly studied regarding their ability to measure complex motions of the spine.(39-49) Inclinometers are cons idered superior to goniometers for assessing spinal motion.(50) Inclinometers have bee n shown to be accurate within 10% of those obtained by radiographic evaluation.(51) A chieving acceptable reliability is dependent upon use of standardized procedures. GONIOMETRY Sub-Recommendation90Goniometry, computer associated or not, may be used to measure joint motion. Inclinometry is superior to goniometry when standar dized procedures are employed. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L A goniometer is a protractor that may be held in th e proximity of the area being measured to provide a means by which to determine d egrees of motion.(35) Although goniometry is common, a wide range of variance has been reported, (56-59) expressing up to 10\u00b0-15\u00b0 error.(60, 61) ALGOMETRY be used to measure pressure-pain thre shold. Changes in sensory function associated with vertebral may produce changes in pressure-pain thresholds. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L A pressure-pain threshold meter yields a measuremen t of when a patient feels a change from pressure to tenderness as the device pr oduces mechanical irritation of deep somatic structures. Pressure-pain-threshold me asurements produce acceptable levels of reliability.(62-66, 142-145) Algometry ha s been shown to be very useful in measuring changes in paraspinal tissue tenderness a s the thresholds are symmetrical.(145) This renders the procedure applic able to chiropractic analysis. CURRENT PERCEPTION THRESHOLD (CPT) TESTING Sub-Recommendation Current perception threshold devices may be used fo r the quantitative assessment of sensory nerve function. Alterations in sensory nerv e function may be associated with vertebral subluxation. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L The current perception threshold device is a variab le voltage constant current sine wave stimulator proposed as a simple noninvasive and qua ntitative measure of peripheral nerve function.(67-71, 137-141) One type of current perception threshold instrument, the neurometer, has been shown to be appropriate fo r rapid screening for neural dysfunction.(69) ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY (EEG) Sub-Recommendation91Electroencephalographic techniques including brain mapping and spectral analysis, may be used to assess the effects of vertebral subl uxation and chiropractic adjustment associated with brain function. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L Standard EEG and computerized EEG techniques, inclu ding spectral analysis and brain mapping, have been shown to change following chirop ractic adjustments or manipulation.(72, 161, 204) Such procedures may be useful in evaluating possible effects of chiropractic care on brain function. SOMATOSENSORY EVOKED POTENTIALS (SSEP) Sub-Recommendation Somatosensory evoked potentials may be used for loc alizing neurological dysfunction associated with vertebral subluxations. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L Somatosensory and dermatomal evoked potentials are used for localizing neurological abnormalities in the peripheral and central conduct ing pathways. These findings are useful as objective indicators of the level or leve ls of involvement.(73-86, 154) One study reported that improved nerve root function wa s observed in subjects who received a high-velocity chiropractic thrust; similar change s were not observed in controls.(73) SKIN TEMPERATURE INSTRUMENTATION Sub-Recommendation Temperature reading devices employing thermocouples (liquid crystal, telethermography, mul tiple IR detector, etc.) may be used to detect temperature changes in spinal and paraspi nal tissues related to vertebral subluxation. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L The measurement of paraspinal cutaneous thermal asy mmetries and other measurements of anomalies have been shown to be a m ode of sympathetic nervous system assessment, (88, 90, 91, 93-95, 97-103, 160) which may be used as one indicator of vertebral subluxation. Demonstrable ch anges in thermal patterns have been observed following chiropractic adjustment.(19, 92) Thermocouple instruments have been shown to demonstrate an acceptable level of re liability and clinical utility applicable to the assessment of vertebral subluxati on related temperature changes.(87, 89, 96, 104) Normative data have been collected con cerning the degree of thermal92asymmetry in the human body in healthy subjects.(10 5) These values may serve as one standard in the assessment of sympathetic nerve fun ction and the degree of asymmetry as a quantifiable indicator of possible dysfunction .(106) SURFACE ELECTROMYOGRAPHY Sub-Recommendation Surface electrode electromyography, using hand-held electrodes, or affixed electrodes, may be used for recording changes in the electrical activity of muscles associated with vertebral subluxations. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L, C Surface electromyographic techniques using both han d-held electrodes and affixed electrodes have demonstrated an acceptable level of reliability for general clinical usage.(107-112, 114-121, 129-136, 159) Other studie s have demonstrated that significant changes in muscle electrical activity o ccur following adjustment or spinal manipulation.(111, 113, 126, 136) Protocols and nor mative data for paraspinal EMG scanning in chiropractic practice have been publish ed.(122-125, 127-128) Surface EMG techniques may be used to assess changes in paraspi nal muscle activity associated with vertebral subluxation and chiropractic adjustm ent. MUSCLE STRENGTH TESTING Sub-Recommendation Muscle strength testing may be used to determine bi lateral differences or other differences in patient resistance. These differences may be characterized by the experienced examiner based on various technologies. Manual, mechanized and computerized muscle testing may be used to determin e changes in the strength and other characteristics of muscles. These changes may be a result of alterations of function at various levels of the neuromuscular sys tem and/or any other system related to the patient. Such changes may be associated with vertebral subluxation. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L Muscle testing as a means of evaluation and diagnos is of patients within chiropractic as well as other disciplines, is well documented.(146- 153, 155-158, 163-177) Muscle testing techniques may be used to assess the effect of vertebral subluxation on various aspects of muscle strength. Research has shown manu al muscle testing to be sufficiently reliable for clinical practice. (148, 149, 153, 156, 169, 170, 171, 175) Studies concerning manual muscle testing have also demonstr ated electromyographic differences associated with various muscle weakness es, and differences in somatosensory evoked potentials associated with wea k versus strong muscles.(146,93147) Other studies have demonstrated the clinical u tility and reliability of hand-held muscle strength testing devices.(151, 152, 157, 172 ) QUESTIONNAIRES Sub-Recommendation Questionnaires may be used in the assessment of the performance of activities of daily living, pain perception, patient satisfaction, gene ral health outcomes, patient perception outcomes, mental health outcomes, and overall quali ty of life, throughout a course of chiropractic care. Questionnaires provide importan t information, but should not be used as a substitute for physical indicators of the pres ence and character of vertebral subluxations. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L There are a variety of questionnaires of demonstrat ed reliability and validity which may be used to document outcomes,(178-203) including pa in and symptoms, although these are not necessary correlates of vertebral subluxati on. However, correction of vertebral subluxation and reduction of the abnormal spinal an d general functions associated with it may be accompanied by reduction or elimination o f pain and symptoms. It must be emphasized that the clinical objective of chiroprac tic care is the correction of vertebral subluxations. No questionnaires exist which assess the presence or correction of vertebral subluxation. Therefore, it is inappropria te to employ questionnaires to determine the need for chiropractic care, but quest ionnaires are appropriate as one aspect of monitoring patient progress and the effec tiveness of subluxation-based care.

New results. ILAC Journal, May 1996: 10.110IV Radiographic and Other Imaging RECOMMENDATION Diagnostic imaging procedures may be utilized to ch aracterize the biomechanical manifestations of vertebral subluxation, and to det ermine the presence of conditions which affect the safety and appropriateness of chir opractic care. Sub-Recommendation Plain film radiography is indicated: to provide inf ormation concerning the structural integrity of the spine, skull and pelvis; the misal ignment component of the vertebral subluxation; the alteration component of the vertebral subluxation; and the postural status of the spinal column. Imaging proc edures, including post-adjustment radiography, should be performed only when clinical ly necessary. It is common for lines of mensuration to be drawn on radiographs to assess subluxation and alignment. These procedures may be done by hand, or the chiropractor may utilize computerized radiographic digitization procedures. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L Commentary In considering the use of imaging methods employing ionizing radiation as a component of patient assessment, the clinician should determi ne if the methods of subluxation correction, patient safety, and management require the use of such procedures. The patient should be asked about any conditions which may contraindicate certain imaging procedures. Reliability studies of several systems of biomechan ical analysis, including radiographic marking systems, have been published. Imaging is a necessary component of a number of different chiropractic analyses. The preponderan ce of evidence supports the reliability of these procedures when properly performed.(1-8, 1 2, 15-27, 29-32, 36-39, 42-61, 64- Moreover, radiographic imaging has revealed statist ically significant changes in the direction of atlas positioning following chiropract ic adjustment(s).(14, 28, 33-35, 146- 148) The effect of chiropractic care on lateral cur vature of the cervical spine has been investigated, with significant changes in the cervi cal curve noted in patients receiving chiropractic care.(9, 62, 63, 69, 149-152, 156-158) Sub-Recommendation Imaging procedures employing ionizing radiation sho uld be performed consistent with the principles of obtaining films of high quality w ith minimal radiation. This may include111the use of gonad shielding, compensating filters, a nd appropriate film-screen combinations. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L A number of dosimetry studies using supplemental fi ltration and single-speed screens have revealed that in the case of 14 x 36 inch AP f ull-spine radiographs, the radiation levels were less than sectional films of like-sized subjects. Shielding of radiosensitive structures may be used when it does not obliterate structures of clinical interest. Such shielding results in a reduction of radiation expos ure.(10, 11, 13, 160) Conclusion The judicious use of spinographic techniques can be valuable in characterizing aspects of the biomechanical manifestations of vertebral su bluxation.(146, 154, 155, 187-193) The use of post-adjustment radiographs may also ass ist the chiropractor in determining effects of chiropractic adjustments on the spine wh en other less hazardous examination techniques cannot reveal the desired information. VIDEOFLUOROSCOPY Sub-Recommendation Videofluoroscopy may be employed to provide motion views of the spine when abnormal motion patterns are clinically suspected. Videofluoroscopy may be valuable in detecting and characterizing spinal kinesiopatholog y associated with vertebral subluxation. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L Commentary A videofluoroscopic system consists of an x-ray gen erator capable of operating at low (1/4 to 5) milliamperage settings, an x-ray tube as sembly, an image intensifier tube, a television camera, a VCR, and a monitor. The heart of the system is the image intensifier tube. This tube permits imaging at very low radiation levels. It is used instead of intensifying screens and film as a image recepto r. The role of videofluoroscopy in the evaluation of a bnormalities of spinal motion has been discussed in textbooks, medical journals, and chiropractic publications.(19, 20, 23, 80-83, 140, 145, 163, 164, 168-170, 172-179, 186, 2 20) Studies have appeared in the literature comparing the diagnostic yield of fluoro scopic studies versus plain films, as well as reporting abnormalities detected by fluoros copy which could not be assessed using plain films.(161, 165-167, 171, 180, 183-185)112Reliability has been addressed in a number of studi es.(162, 181, 182, 214) Additionally, in a study evaluating the interexaminer reliability of fluoroscopic detection of fixation in the mid-cervical spine, two examiners reviewed 50 v ideotapes of fluoroscopic examinations of the cervical spine. The examiners achieved 84 percent agreement for the presence of fixation, 96 percent agreement for the absence of fixation, and 93 percent total agreement. The Kappa value was .80 (p .001). The authors concluded, The current data indicate that VF determination of fixation in the cervical spine is a reliable procedure. (181, 214) Conclusion Observational and case studies support the use of v ideofluoroscopy to evaluate vertebral motion when this information cannot be ob tained by other means. Sub-Recommendation Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) MR imaging may be employed to assess suspected neop lastic, infectious and degenerative conditions of the spine and related ti ssues as well as the stages of subluxation degeneration. Its use is generally rest ricted to instances where the desired information cannot be obtained by less costly proce dures. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L Commentary Magnetic resonance imaging enables clinicians to ob tain clear images of the human body without ionizing radiation. Literature supports the use of MR imaging for the d etection and characterization of numerous manifestations associated with subluxation degeneration.(84-107, 141-143, 194-198, 212) These studies cover a nomena, including: 1. Osseous malalignment 2. Intervertebral disc Osteophytosis Corrugation/hypertrophy of ligamentum flava 5. Spinal canal stenosis 6. Foraminal stenosis 7. Disc herniation and disc bulging 8. Facet asymmetry 9. Facet degeneration 10. Altered cerebrospinal fluid dynamics 11. Cord compression 12. Gliosis and myelomalacia11313. Spinal cord atrophy Conclusion MRI may be employed to disclose manifestations of v ertebral subluxation when this information cannot be obtained by more co st-effective means. MRI is also appropriate for evaluating patients wit h clinical evidence of conditions which may affect the safety and appropri ateness of chiropractic procedures. Sub-Recommendation Computed Tomography (CT) CT imaging may be employed to assess osseous and so ft tissue pathology in the spine and contiguous tissues. Its use is generally restri cted to instances where the desired information cannot be obtained by less costly proce dures. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L Commentary Computed tomography (also referred to as CT or CAT scanning) is an imaging technique which produces axial (cross sectional) im ages of body structures using x- radiation. Computer reconstruction methods may be u sed to depict other planes. Manifestations of subluxation degeneration which ma y be demonstrated by CT scanning include disc lesions, spinal canal stenosi s due to infolding of the ligamentum flava, osteophytosis, and bony sclerosis.(108-139, 144, 199-201, 210, 211, 213, 220) In addition, CT may be used to evaluate developmental variance and pathologies which could affect the chiropractic management of a case. Conclusion CT may be employed to disclose manifestations of ve rtebral subluxation when this information cannot be obtained by more cost-effecti ve means. CT is also appropriate for evaluating patients with clinical evidence of condi tions which may affect the safety and appropriateness of chiropractic procedures, particu larly fractures, degenerative changes, and osseous pathology. Sub-Recommendation Spinal Ultrasonography Spinal ultrasonography may be used to evaluate the size of the spinal canal, and to detect pathology in the soft tissues surrounding th e spine. Its applications in the114assessment of the facet inflammation and nerve root inflammation remain investigational at this time. Ratings: Established for determining spinal canal size. Investigational for facet and nerve root inflammation. Evidence: E, L Commentary Sonographic imaging is a technique which utilizes e choes from ultrasonic waves to produce an image on a cathode ray tube. Sonographic techniques have been employed to measur e the lumbar canal, as well as determining focal stenosis and disc disease.(202-20 9, 221, 222) A small study compared sonographic results in patie nts with back pain previously examined by MRI, x-ray and standard orthopedic exam ination. The study concluded that the correlation with MRI, x-ray, orthopedic an d neurologic examination was approximately 90 percent.(207) Conclusion The low cost, availability, ease of application, an d noninvasive nature of sonographic imaging make it an attractive addition to the chiro practor's armamentarium. Furthermore, it has the potential to image various components of the vertebral subluxation. However, caution must be exercised in evaluating the claims of promoters of sonographic equipment, particularly those relati ng to the assessment of nerve root inflammation or facet joint disease. Further resear ch toward the establishment of chiropractic protocols should be undertaken to expl ore the clinical utility of spinal sonography in chiropractic practice. Sub-Recommendation Radioisotope Scanning (Nu clear Medicine Studies) Radioisotope scans performed by qualified medical p ersonnel may be used by a chiropractor to determine the extent and distributi on of pathological processes which may affect the safety and appropriateness of chirop ractic care when this information cannot be obtained by less invasive means. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L Commentary In this procedure, bone-seeking radioisotopes are i njected, and an image is produced demonstrating the degree of uptake of the radioisot opes. The examination is sensitive to regional changes in osseous metabolism, but is n ot specific. Abnormal bone scans115may be due to metastasis, infection, fracture, oste oblastic activity or other pathology.(215-219) No studies or case reports were found linking abnormal bone scans with vertebral subluxation. Bone scans may ha ve limited value in determining the safety and appropriateness of chiropractic procedur es. Conclusion Radioisotope scans have a limited role in chiroprac tic practice. Bone scans are a sensitive, but nonspecific indicator of abnormal me tabolic activity in bone. References 1. Rochester RP.

Nineteenth Annual Meeting of the American Roentgen Ray Society. May 13-18, 1990, Washington, DC.132V Clinical Impression and Assessment RECOMMENDATION Practitioners should develop a method of patient as sessment which includes a sufficient diversity of findings to support the clinical impre ssion as related to vertebral subluxation.(1-24) In this regard, it is considered inappropriate to render an opinion regarding the appropriateness of chiropractic care without a chiropractic assessment, including a physical examination of the patient by a licensed chiropractor. When management of patient care is carried out in the co llaborative setting, the chiropractor, as a primary contact health care provider, is the o nly professional qualified to determine the appropriateness of chiropractic care. The uniqu e role of the chiropractor is separate from other health disciplines,(25-35) and should be clarified for both the patient and other practitioners. The patient assessment, specif ic to the technique practiced by the chiropractor, should minimally include a biomechani cal and neurophysiological component. It is inappropriate to make a retrospect ive determination of the clinical need for care rendered prior to the assessment. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L Commentary The procedures employed in the chiropractic assessm ent may include some or all of, but are not limited to the following: Physical examination: Palpation (static osseous, static muscle, motion). Range of motion. Postural examination Comparative leg length (static, flexed, cervical sy ndrome). Manual muscle tests. Nerve function tests. Mental status examination and psychosocial assessme nt. Instrumentation examination: Range of motion. Thermography. Temperature reading instruments. Muscle testing. Electromyography. Pressure algometry. Nerve-function tests. Electroencephalography and brain mapping. Bilateral four quadrant weight scales.133Imaging examination: Spinography. Videofluoroscopy. Computerized tomography. Magnetic resonance imaging. Following the determination of a clinical impressio n, the patient should be made aware of the findings and consent to the proposed plan of care. Literature support for the use of these technologies may be found in the chapters on chiropractic examination, instrumentation and diagnostic imaging (Chapters 1, 2, 3). References 1.

U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, 1990.136VI Reassessment and Outcomes Assessment RECOMMENDATION Determination of the patient's progress must be mad e on a per-visit and periodic basis. This process provides quantitative and qualitative information regarding the patient's progress which is utilized to determine the frequen cy and duration of chiropractic care. Per-visit reassessment should include at least one analytical procedure previously used. This chosen testing procedure should be performed e ach time the patient receives chiropractic care. Concomitant with this process, the effectiveness of patient care may also be monitored through the development of an outcomes assessment p lan. Such a plan may utilize data from the patient examination, assessment and r eassessment procedures. Patient- reported quality of life instruments, mental health surveys, and general health surveys are encouraged as part of the outcomes assessment p lan. The analysis of data from these sources may be used to change or support cont inuation of a particular regimen of patient care and/or change or continue the operatio nal procedures of the practice. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L Commentary The reassessment provides information to determine the necessity of an adjustment on a per-visit basis. Partial reassessment involves du plication of two or more preceding positive analytical procedures. Full reassessment i nvolves duplication of three or more preceding positive analytical procedures. Any addi tional or complementary analytical procedures should be performed as indicated by the patient's clinical status. The frequency of partial and full reassessments should be at the discretion of the practitioner, consistent with the objectives of the plan of care. A substantial body of literature attests to the met hods and significance of measuring outcomes.(1-100) For the practicing chiropractor th e implication is that regular evaluations of practice and procedures provides a f orm of quality control. Outcomes assessments can alert the practitioner to problems with, as well as reinforce, aspects of practice which might otherwise be overlooked. In ad dition, on-going evaluation provides information about the clinical value of care to bot h patients and third-party providers. It is important to point out that there is no one \"ide al\" way to assess outcomes. While the responsibility to conduct this type of assessment r ests with the chiropractor, so does the choice of how it is to be implemented. References 1. Mrozek J, Wiles M.

No m ode of care should be used which has been demonstrated by critical scientific study and field experience to be unsafe or ineffective in the correction of vertebral subluxat ion. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L Commentary This chapter is concerned with the modes of adjusti ve care (techniques) associated with the correction of vertebral subluxation. The litera ture reveals many articles on adjusting modes. These articles include technique description s, various applications of techniques, and reliability studies usually assessi ng inter- and intra-examiner reliability. A number of review articles provide discussion of t he modes of care. Available research data has been complemented with professional opinio n, derived from two separate forums of chiropractic experts' The International S traight Chiropractic Consensus Conference, Chandler, Arizona (1992) and the Counci l on Chiropractic Practice Symposium on Chiropractic Techniques, Phoenix, Ariz ona, (1996), both of which served to validate procedures by common knowledge and usag e. The intent of this chapter is not to include nor ex clude any particular technique, but rather to provide a guideline, drawing upon the com monality of various techniques, which contributes to the chiropractic objective of correcting vertebral subluxation. Any technique which does not espouse the correction of subluxation would be considered outside the scope of the Guidelines. A list of descriptive terms and definitions related to chiropractic adjustive care as commonly practiced follows: Adjustment: The correction of a vertebral subluxati on. Adjustic Thrust: The specific application of force to facilitate the correction of vertebral subluxation. Adjusting Instruments: Fixed or hand-held mechanica l instruments used to deliver a specific, controlled thrust to correct a vertebral subluxation. Amplitude: Magnitude; greatness of size or depth. Blocking Technique: The use of mechanical leverage, achieved through positioning of the spine or related structures, to facilitate the correction of vertebral subluxation.146Cleavage: The movement of one vertebra between two other vertebrae. Concussion: An adjustic thrust produced by arrested momentum. Momentum is the result of weight (mass) in motion and also of s peed. An adjustic concussion depends more on speed than mass. High Velocity Thrust with Recoil: A controlled thru st delivered such that the time of impact with the vertebra coincides with the chir opractor's contact recoil, thus setting the vertebra in a specific directional moti on. Impulse: A sudden force directionally applied to co rrect a malpositioned joint. Low Velocity Thrust with Recoil: A controlled thrus t administered at low speed with a sudden pull-off by the practitioner, setting the segment in motion. Low Velocity Thrust without Recoil: A controlled th rust administered at low speed coupled with a sustained contact on the s egment adjusted. Low Velocity Vectored Force without Recoil: A short or long duration (usually ranging from 1 to 20 seconds) contact with the segm ent being adjusted, with or without a graduation of force. Manually Assisted Mechanical Thrust: A manually del ivered specific thrust enhanced by a moving mechanism built into the adjus ting table. Manipulation: The taking of a joint past its passiv e range of motion into the paraphysiological space but not past the anatomic l imit, accompanied by articular cavitation (Kirkaldy-Willis). It is not synonymous with chiropractic adjustment, which is applied to correct vertebral subluxation. Multiple Impulse: Impulses delivered in rapid succe ssion. Recoil: The bouncing or springing back of an object when it strikes another object. Tone: The normal degree of nerve tension. Thrust: The act of putting a bony segment in motion using a directional force. Toggle: A mechanical principle wherein two levers a re hinged at an elbow giving mechanical advantage. Combinations of toggles may b e used to multiply or strengthen mechanical advantage. Toggle Recoil with Torque: A method of using the to ggle with rotation twist) as the toggle straightens, causing the adjusting conta ct to travel in a spiral path.147Torque: A rotational or twisting vector applied whe n adjusting certain vertebral subluxations. Velocity: The speed with which a thrust is delivere d. Conclusion Considerable evidence substantiates the adjustment being administered for the purpose of correction of vertebral subluxation.(1-11) Studi es regarding the different modes(4, 12- 86) compare low force methods to those employing a high velocity thrust without recoil, and low velocity vectored force without recoil, hig h velocity thrust with recoil, low velocity thrust with and without recoil, manually a nd mechanically assisted thrusts, blocking techniques, and sustained force. These stu dies are often presented in the context of effects on various physical and physiolo gical parameters. Although providing useful information, the majority of these studies are limited by uncontrolled variables and lack of statistical powe r. They do, however, demonstrate that the application of various modes of adjustive care is accompanied by measurable changes in physical and physiological phenomena. Th e importance of this information, in terms of its linkage to processes used by the bo dy in the correction of subluxation, will be assessed through continued research. These guidelines consider(86) the modes of adjustiv e care in common usage, which adhere to one or more of the descriptive terms pres ented in this chapter, as appropriate for correction of subluxation. However, studies reg arding their theoretical basis and efficacy are often conducted by advocates of (those practicing or instructing) the respective techniques. While the information attai ned in the numerous investigations is not in question, since many of the studies have not passed the scrutiny of peer and editorial review, it is suggested that the advocate s of particular modes of adjustive care encourage research by chiropractic colleges, indepe ndent universities and other facilities to extend the level of credibility alrea dy achieved. Continuing research and reliability studies are nec essary to better understand and refine the underlying mechanisms of action common t o the various modes of adjustive care. In addition, it is suggested that more observ ational and patient self-reporting studies be conducted which deal with quality of lif e assessments and overall \"wellness,\" to demonstrate the pattern of health benefits which heretofore have been the purview of the patient and the practitioner. A conference spon sored by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service Agency fo r Health Care Policy and Research, proposed many different approaches for st udying the effects of treatments for which there is no direct evidence of health out comes.(87) The CCP recognizes that many subluxation-based chir opractors do not adhere, in totality, to the current hypothetical model thus fa r described. These practitioners consider two additional components. One is interfe rence with the transmission of148nonsynaptic neurological information which is homol ogous to the Palmer concept of mental impulse. The other limits the misalignment component of the subluxation to the vertebrae and their immediate articulations. While these practitioners may adhere to some concepts of other subluxation models, their pr actice objectives are based on correction of the vertebral subluxation as proposed by Palmer, which has recently been elaborated by Boone and Dobson.(88-90) References 1.

Journal of Vertebral Subluxation Research 1997; 1(3)25-33.155VIII Duration of Care for Correction of Vertebral Su bluxation RECOMMENDATION Since the duration of care for correction of verteb ral subluxation is patient specific, frequency of visits should be based upon the reduct ion and eventual resolution of indicators of vertebral subluxation. Since neither the scientific nor clinical literature provides any compelling evidence that substantiates or correlates any specific time period for the correction of vertebral subluxation, this recommendation has several components which are expressed as follows: a) Based on the variety of assessments utilized in t he chiropractic profession, the quantity of indicators may vary, thus affecting the periodicity of their appearance and disappearance, which is tantamount to correcti on of vertebral subluxation. b) Vertebral subluxation, not being a singular episo dic event such as a strain or sprain, may be corrected but reappear, which necess itates careful monitoring and results in a wide variation in the number of ad justments required to affect a longer-term correction. c) Based on the integrity of the spine in terms of d egree and extent of degeneration, the frequency of assessments, and the necessity for corrective adjustments, may vary considerably. d) Because the duration of care is being considered relative to the correction of vertebral subluxation, it is independent of clinica l manifestations of specific dysfunctions, diseases, or syndromes. Treatment pr otocols and duration of care for these conditions are addressed in other guideli nes, which may be appropriate for any practitioner whose clinical interests inclu de alleviation of such conditions. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L Commentary Attempts have been made to identify an appropriate number and frequency of chiropractic visits based on type of condition and degree of severity.(1-24) Unfortunately, these recommendations are based mere ly on consensus, and research to support these recommendations is lacking. Moreo ver, little to no delineation has been made in the duration of care literature base b etween care for specific symptomatic profiles such as low-back pain, and long-term sublu xation-specific care. Two studies were found which addressed quality of l ife issues in patients under chiropractic care. One large, well-designed retrosp ective study assessing patient reported quality of life found no clinical end poin t where improvement reached a plateau.(25) A second study involved a detailed exa mination of a database collected during a randomized clinical trial testing the effe ctiveness of a comprehensive geriatric156assessment program. It was reported that compared t o non-chiropractic patients, chiropractic patients in this population were less likely to have been hospitalized, less likely to have used a nursing home, more likely to report a better health status, more likely to exercise vigorously, and more likely to b e mobile in the community. Furthermore, they were less likely to use prescript ion drugs.(26) It is the position of the Guideline Panel that indi vidual differences in each patient and the unique circumstances of each clinical encounter preclude the formulation of \"cookbook\" recommendations for frequency and durati on of care. The appropriateness of chiropractic care should be determined by objective indicators of vertebral subluxation. References 1. Balduc H. How chiropractic care can promote welln ess.

As with any age group, however, care must be taken to select adjustment methods most appropriate to the p atient's stage of development and overall spinal integrity. Parental education by the subluxation-centered chiropractor concerning the importance of evaluating children fo r the presence of vertebral subluxation is encouraged. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L Commentary Schneier and Burns(1) published the results of a bli nded study describing the relationship of atlanto-occipital hypermobility to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). These authors described the phenomenon of atlas inv ersion where the posterior arch of C-1 enters the foramen magnum. They further stated, Relative measurements suggested that a correlation existed between instab ility in the atlanto-occipital articulation and sudden infant death syndrome. Inst ability is a manifestation of vertebral subluxation. These findings corroborate those of Gilles, Bina an d Sotrel in their paper, Infantile atlanto-occipital instability.(2) These investigato rs studied 17 infant cadavers. Eleven were SIDS cases and six were non-SIDS cases. Ten of the 17 cases demonstrated atlas inversion, and all ten cases were in the SIDS group. These authors also suggested that atlanto-occipital instability may be a factor in other conditions. They stated, At this early stage in the development of o ur notions about the potential contribution of atlanto-occipital instability to de aths in infants, it is very difficult to assess the role of this proposed mechanism in the death of an infant with a conventional disease. Thus, one might anticipate that the contro ls will be contaminated by children who had a conventional disease, but whose death was , in fact, caused by this mechanism. Towbin(3) addressed the clinical significance of sp inal cord and brain stem injury at birth, noting that such damage is often latent and undiagnosed. According to Towbin, Death of the fetus may occur during delivery or, wi th respiratory function depressed, a short period after birth. Infants who survive the i nitial effects may be left with severe nervous system defects. In some, the neurologic seq uellae are attributable directly to the primary lesion in the cord or brain stem; in ot hers, secondary cerebral damage results, a consequence of the imposed period of hyp oxia at birth. Chesire(4) described three cases of traumatic myelopathy in children wit hout demonstrable vertebral trauma. In this paper, the classical mechanism of trauma is said to be hyperextension of the cervical spine in a difficult breech delivery. Alth ough tetraplegia may result, the x-rays are described as usually normal. Complicated delive ries represent a higher risk to the160child of suffering spinal cord damage during the bi rth process. High cervical spinal cord injury in neonates is a specific complication of fo rceps rotation. The vacuum extractor exerts considerable traction force. Fetal skull fr acture can result, and its true incidence may be higher than expected, considering that few n eonates with normal neurologic behavior undergo skull x-ray.(5-7) Byers(8) publish ed an excellent review paper addressing spinal cord damage during the birth proc ess. Traction and rotational stresses applied to the spinal axis were listed as causes of spinal cord injury during birth. The vagus nerve is involved in mechanisms associate d with control of tidal volume, breathing rate, and respiratory reflexes. Sachis et al.(9) performed histological examinations of the vagus nerve in infants who died of SIDS and those who died of other conditions. Significant differences were note d between the two groups. Several hypotheses were proposed by authors to explain the data, including damage to the vagus nerve resulting in delayed development. Gutman(10) described how relational disturbance bet ween occiput and atlas can lead to blocked atlantal nerve syndrome in children and adu lts. The author listed a variety of conditions which appear clinically related to this syndrome. Although SIDS was not discussed as an entity, the author stated that a br ain stem component is a part of this syndrome. It was concluded that for those affected, manual treatment by a qualified practitioner is appropriate. In her paper Physical stresses of childhood that co uld lead to need for chiropractic care, presented at the first National Conference on Chiro practic and Pediatrics, McMullen(11) stated, Any condition that arises to change the nor mal birth process frequently results in subluxation at the level of greatest stress. Severe subluxation resulting in nerve damage may be clinically obvious at birth (e.g., Bells, Er bs and Klumpkes palsies), however, more frequently the trauma remains subclinical with symptoms arising at a later time. These symptoms include, but are not limited to, irr itability, colic, failure-to-thrive syndromes, and those syndromes associated with lowe red immune responses. These subluxations should be analyzed and corrected as so on as possible after birth to prevent these associated conditions. Bonci and Wynne(12) and Stiga(13) published papers discussing the relationship between chiropractic theory and SIDS etiology. Bank s et al.(14) stated Functional disturbances in the brainstem and cervical spinal c ord areas related to the neurophysiology of respiration may contribute the c linical factors associated with sudden infant death syndrome...Any process, whether genetic, biochemical, biomechanical or traumatic, that alters normal deve lopment of the respiratory control centers related to spinal constriction and compress ion following birth trauma may be contributory to sudden infant death syndrome. Other traumatic events of childhood may produce ver tebral subluxations. Orenstein et al.(15) did a retrospective chart review involving 73 children who presented at a children's hospital with cervical spine injuries. S ixty-seven percent of these injuries were161traffic related resulting from motor-vehicle crashe s. The injured children were passengers in an automobile, pedestrians, or bicycl ists. The mean age of the patients surveyed was 8.6 years, with bimodal peaks at 2 to 4 and 12 to 15 years. The authors noted that younger children sustained more severe i njuries than older children. Distraction and subluxation injuries were the most common injuries in children aged 8 years and younger. Fractures were more common in ol der children. Glass et al.(16) evaluated 35 children with lumbar spine injuries following blunt trauma. Thirty-one of these children were injured in motor- vehicle crashes. Abnormalities noted on plain radiographs and CT scans included subluxat ion, distraction, and fracture alone or in combination. The authors stated, Children inv olved in motor-vehicle crashes are at a high risk for lumbar spine injuries Lumbar spine radiographs are necessary in all cases with suspected lumbar spine injury This paper underscores the need to evaluate the entire spine in cases of motor-vehicle accident s, not just the cervical region. It may be cited when claims for lumbar radiographs are que stioned in cases of children involved in car accidents. Rachesky et al.(17) reported that on the cervical s pine radiographs of children under 18 they examined, vehicular accidents accounted for 36 % of radiographic abnormalities. It was further stated that clinical assessment of a co mplaint of neck pain or involvement in a vehicular accident with head trauma would have id entified all cases of cervical spine injury. Other authors have described aspects of cervical sp ine injuries in children involved in motor-vehicle accidents. Hill et al.(18) noted that 31% of the pediatric neck injuries reviewed were the result of motor-vehicle accidents . In younger children (under 8 years of age) subluxation was seen more frequently than f racture. Agran(19) stated that non- crash vehicular events may cause injuries to childr en. Non-crash events discussed in this paper included sudden stops, swerves, turns, a nd movement of unrestrained children in the vehicle. Roberts et al.(20) described a case where a child i nvolved in a motor-vehicle accident sustained a whiplash injury resulting in immediate neck and back pain. Neurobehavioral abnormalities increased in the two-year period foll owing the accident. Four years after the accident, symptoms persisted. Position emission tomography (PET scan) demonstrated evidence of brain dysfunction. The clinical manifestations of pediatric cervical s pine injury may be diverse. Biedermann(21) stated that a wide range of pediatri c symptomatology may result from suboccipital strain. The disorders reported include fever of unknown origin, loss of appetite, sleeping disorders, asymmetric motor patt erns, and alterations of posture. Maigne(22) stated that trauma to the cervical spine and head can cause such problems as headaches, vestibular troubles, auditory problem s and psychic disturbances. Gutmann(23) discussed the diverse array of signs an d symptoms which can occur as a result of biomechanical dysfunction in the cervical spine. Others have also reported various pathoneurophysiological changes in children ,(24-31) as well as reduction of162pathology following chiropractic care.(29,31-41,44) In the chiropractic literature, Clow(42) published a paper addressing pediatric cer vical acceleration/deceleration injuries. Two peer reviewed journals, Chiropractic Pediatrics and the Journal of Clinical Chiropractic Pediatrics are being published to diss eminate critically reviewed papers in this field. Additionally, courses in pediatrics are offered at the professional and postgraduate levels at accredited chiropractic coll eges and by the International Chiropractic Pediatric Association. The pediatric case history and physical examination necessarily differ in content and scope from those of adult patients. Even taking int o consideration the difference between the two populations, however, a recent quas i meta-analysis reveals an extremely low risk for chiropractic pediatric patie nts receiving adjustments.(43) References 1.

Chiropractic Pediatrics 1994; 1(2):21-23.166X Patient Safety RECOMMENDATION Patient safety encompasses the entire spectrum of c are offered by the chiropractor. Consequently, it is important to define at the onse t, the nature of the practice as well as the limits of care to be offered. Minimally this sh ould include a Terms of Acceptance document between the practitioner and the patient. Additionally, all aspects of clinical practice should be carefully chosen to offer the pa tient the greatest advantage with the minimum of risk. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L Commentary Patient safety is assured by more than the practiti oner's causing no harm. Since every consumer of health care is ultimately responsible f or his/her own health choices, patient safety is also a matter of the availability of accu rate and adequate information with which the patient must make these choices. The pati ent's expectations should be consistent with the provider's goals. If the patien t perceives those goals as anything different, proper and safe choices cannot be assure d. Thus, it is important to recognize that chiropractic is a limited, primary profession w hich contributes to health by addressing the safe detection, location, and correc tion or stabilization of vertebral subluxation(s). It is important that the chiropract or take the steps necessary to foster proper patient perception and expectation of the pr actitioner's professional goals and responsibilities. It is within this context that pa tient safety is addressed in this chapter. A Terms of Acceptance is the recorded written inform ed consent agreement between a chiropractor and the patient. This document provide s the patient with disclosure of the responsibilities of the chiropractor and limits of chiropractic, and the reasonable benefit to be expected. This enables the patient to make an informed choice either to engage the services of the chiropractor, aware of the inte nded purpose of the care involved, or not to engage those services if the proposed goals are not acceptable or not desired. This embodies the responsibility of assuring patien t safety by not providing false or misleading promises, claims or pretenses to the pat ient.(1-7) Professional Referral: Professional referral requir es authority and competence to acquire accurate information concerning matters wit hin the scope and practice of the professional to whom a referral is made. There are two types of professional referrals made by chiropractors: (A) Intraprofessional referral: Chiropractors, by virtue of their professional objective, education, and experience, have authority and compe tence to make direct referrals within the scope and practice of chiropractic. Such a referral may be made when the attending chiropractor is not able to address the s pecific chiropractic needs of a particular patient. Under these circumstances, the chiropractor may refer the patient167directly to or consult with another chiropractor be tter suited by skill, experience or training to address the patient's chiropractic need s. (B) Interprofessional referral: In the course of p atient assessment and the delivery of chiropractic care, a practitioner may encounter fin dings which are outside his/her professional and/or legal scope, responsibility, or authority to address. The chiropractor has a responsibility to report such findings to the patient, and record their existence. Additionally, the patient should be advised that it is outside the responsibility and scope of chiropractic to offer advice, assessment or sign ificance, diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment for said findings and that, if the patien t chooses, he/she may consult with another provider, while continuing to have his/her chiropractic needs addressed. Rare case reports of adverse events following spina l manipulation exist in the literature. However, scientific evidence of a c ausal relationship between such adverse events and the manipulation is lacking . Furthermore, spinal adjustment and spinal manipulation are not synonymo us terms. In the case of strokes purportedly associated with manipulation, the panel noted significant shortcomings in the literature. A summary of the relevant literature follows: *Lee(8) attempted to obtain an estimate of how ofte n practicing neurologists in California encountered unexpected strokes, myelopathies, or radiculopathies following chiropractic manipulation. Neurologists were asked the number of patients evaluated over the preceding two years who suffered a neurolo gical complication within 24 hours of receiving chiropractic manipulation. Fifty-five strokes were reported. The author stated, Patients, physicians, and chiropractors sho uld be aware of the risk of neurologic complications associated with chiropractic manipula tion. No support was offered to substantiate the premise that a causal relationship existed between the stroke and the event(s) of the preceding 24 hours. *In a letter to the editor of the Journal of Manipu lative and Physiological Therapeutics, Myler(9) wrote, I was curious how the risk of fatal stroke after cervical manipulation, placed at 0.00025%(10) compared with the risk of ( fatal) stroke in the general population of the United States. According to data obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics, the mortality rate from stroke i n the general population was calculated to be 0.00057%. If these data are correct, the risk of a fatal stroke following cervical manipulation is less than half the risk of fatal st roke in the general population. *Jaskoviak(11) reported that not a single case of v ertebral artery stroke occurred in approximately five million cervical manipulations a t the National College of Chiropractic Clinic from 1965 to 1980. *Osteopathic authors Vick, et al.(12) reported that from 1923 to 1993, there were only 185 reports of injury associated with several milli on treatments.168*Pistolese(13) has constructed a risk assessment fo r pediatric chiropractic patients. His findings covering approximately the last 30 years i ndicate a risk of a neurological and/or vertebrobasilar accident during a chiropractic visi t about one in every 250,000,000 visits. *An article in the Back Letter(14) noted that In sc ientific terms, all these figures are rough guesses at best... There is currently no accu rate data on the total number of cervical manipulations performed every year or the total number of complications. Both figures would be necessary to arrive at an accurate estimate. In addition, none of the studies in the medical literature adequately contro l for other risk factors and co- morbidities. *Leboeuf-Yde et al.(15) suggested that there may be an over-reporting of spinal manipulative therapy related injuries. The authors reported cases involving two fatal strokes, a heart attack, a bleeding basilar aneurys m, paresis of an arm and a leg, and cauda equina syndrome which occurred in individuals who were considering chiropractic care, yet because of chance, did not r eceive it. Had these events been temporally related to a chiropractic office visit, they may have been inappropriately attributed to chiropractic care. *In many cases of strokes attributed to chiropracti c care, the operator was not a chiropractor at all. Terrett(16) observed that mani pulations administered by Kung Fu practitioner, GPs, osteopaths, physiotherapists, a wife, a blind masseur, and an Indian barber were incorrectly attributed to chiropractors . As Terrett wrote, The words chiropractic and chiropractor have been incorrectly used in numerous publications dealing with SMT injury by medical authors, respect ed medical journals and medical organizations. In many cases, this is not accidenta l; the authors had access to original reports that identified the practitioner involved a s a non-chiropractor. The true incidence of such reporting cannot be determined. Such report ing adversely affects the reader's opinion of chiropractic and chiropractors. *Another error made in these reports was failure to differentiate cervical manipulation from specific chiropractic adjustment. Klougart et al.(17) published risk estimates which revealed differences which were dependent upon the type of technique used by the chiropractor. The panel found no competent evidence that specific chiropractic adjustments cause strokes. Although vertebrobasilar screening procedu res are taught in chiropractic colleges, no reliable screening tests were identifi ed which enable a chiropractor to identify patients who are at risk for stroke. After examining twelve patients with dizziness repr oduced by extension rotation and twenty healthy controls with Doppler ultrasound of the vertebral arteries, Cote, et al.(18) concluded, We were unable to demonstrate that the e xtension-rotation test is a valid clinical screening procedure to detect decreased bl ood flow in the vertebral artery. The value of this test for screening patients at risk o f stroke after cervical manipulation is169questionable. Terrett(19) noted, There is no eviden ce which suggests that positive tests have any correlation to future VBS (vertebrobasilar stroke) and SMT (spinal manipulative therapy). Despite this lack of evidenc e, some have suggested that failure to employ such tests could place a chiropractor in a less defensible position should litigation ensue following a CVA.(20) References 1.

Gaithersburg, MD 1992.171XI Professional Development RECOMMENDATION Continuing professional development, as in all resp onsible health professions, is a necessary component of maintaining a high standard for both the practitioner and the profession. Continuing development should be direct ed to areas germane to each individual practice, including but not limited to: credentialing, continuing education programs, participation in professional organizatio ns, ethics forums, and legal issues. Rating: Established Evidence: E, L Commentary Continuing professional development is currently wi dely mandated by most licensing jurisdictions, or encouraged through most professio nal organizations. Perhaps the most compelling reason for advocating this type of on-go ing education is to afford practitioners the opportunity to keep abreast of cu rrent issues, techniques, and methods which serve to enhance patient care. The fact that most programs are conducted by individuals skilled in the topics presented, also p rovides a high ratio of quality information delivered in a relatively short period. Thus, professional development serves not only the practitioner, but ultimately benefits the patient through enhanced practice skills acquired in different areas by the chiroprac tor.(1-14) In addition to formal postgraduate education course s, other opportunities for professional development may include: - Reading scholarly journals - Attending scientific symposia - Participation in research - Publication of clinical and scientific papers - Audio and videocassette courses - Teleclasses - Distance education programs References 1.

List of Subtopics III. Recommendations IV. Comments V. References173OVERVIEW This section of the ICA protocols and guidelines wa s compiled by a special committee of the International Chiropractors Association's Council o n Chiropractic Pediatrics. This committee consisted of a corp of specially trained and skille d individuals, all of whom have earned diplomate status through years of postgraduate study in chiro practic child care through the ICA Council. The following protocols and guidelines are a refle ction of the growing consensus within the chiropractic profession on the general paramete rs of chiropractic science and practice as it pertains to the care of the pediatric population. P ediatrics being defined as the time from conception through adolescence. These guidelines a re also offered to the profession and the public in the context of the recent Statement on th e Chiropractic Paradigm referenced earlier in the general text of the ICA protocols. The Council on Chiropractic Pediatrics of the International Chiropractors Association has developed this compon ent of the general protocols and guidelines to provide the chiropractic practitioner with speci fic advice and support in addressing the needs of a very special segment of the chiropractic patie nt population, children. All laws governing the authority and responsibiliti es of doctors of chiropractic provide for full access to and responsibility for the care of c hildren, as they do for patients of all ages. While recognizing that differences in approach and manner may be necessary in addressing the needs of various age groups, the ICA understands that the basic principles of chiropractic apply to patients of all ages and that chiropractic interven tion through the adjustment of the spine to restore normal nerve function is an appropriate, re sponsible and highly effective means of clinical care for even the smallest of children, wh en clinically indicated by objective findings and other standard chiropractic clinical procedures. A growing body of clinical research, comprised of c ase studies, trials, observations, outcome assessments, etc. coupled with existing ins urance underwriting experience has demonstrated that regardless of methodology, chirop ractic has been demonstrated to be safe and effective for children. As has been previously noted, to obtain a license t o practice chiropractic in any of the 50 states requires the degree of doctor of chiropracti c from an accredited chiropractic educational institution recognized by the US Department of Educ ation. This education consists of four or more years of full-time, in-residence study is requ ired in human anatomy, physiology, biomechanics, chiropractic diagnosis/analysis, adje ctive techniques, public health issues and chiropractic philosophy. Chiropractic Education ful ly encompasses the field of pediatrics. Chiropractic students are thoroughly trained in the appropriate use of currently accepted diagnostic technology including imaging procedures such as x-ray, thermography, video- fluoroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging and other i nvestigative technologies and procedures as it pertains to use with children. The capacity to evaluate the health care needs of the pediatric patient, including appropriate referrals to other h ealth professionals when necessary, is an important objective of chiropractic education. The status of the doctor of chiropractic, as establ ished by statute, training and experience, includes the ability and authority to e valuate the general health status of an individual for certification purposes, in the context of a req uired physical for school, employment, sports174and, as federally authorized, approval to operate h eavy transportation machinery. The U.S. Department of Transportation authorizes DC's to per form physical examinations for long- distance truck drivers, etc. Such physicals are a routine part of chiropractic p ractice. The clinical competence to perform such evaluations and through standard healt h status measures such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc., make a statement about the genera l health of an individual does not necessarily include an obligation or authority to develop a ful l-body medical diagnosis or to perform procedures outside the recognized scope of chiropra ctic. In the presence of abnormal findings in the course of routine physical examinations for spe cific purposes, such as those cited above, the DC follows the standard chiropractic care pathw ays (including referral) as are clinically indicated on an individual basis. Doctors of chiropractic are also obligated to perfo rm certain public health functions that are common to all primary contact, doctor level hea lth care professionals. Many state laws obligate the doctor of chiropractic to report child abuse, spouse abuse, certain communicable diseases and other findings to public health author ities. Likewise, the doctor of chiropractic may have responsibilities under state laws and regulati ons to take action in the presence of substance abuse. State laws have established chiropractic as a separ ate and distinct professional endeavor and detail the parameters of chiropractic practice. No state of the United States has limited in any fashion, either expressly or by impl ication, the practice of chiropractic to exclude any age group. The doctor of chiropractic is a primary care provid er, who serves as a portal-of-entry into the health care system. The ICA Council on Chiropr actic Pediatrics recognizes that the term primary care provider to be defined as: Any health care provider capable of providing first level contact and intake into the health delivery system, and any health care provider licensed to receive patient contact in the absence of physician referral. All laws and regulations in the United States allow any citizen to seek the services of th e doctor of chiropractic without referral from any other provider. The Council further recognizes that the doctor of chiropractic is also a primary care provider for the care of the pediatric patient. Only the doctor of chiropractic is professionally competent to evaluate the chiropract ic needs of the pediatric patient and to determine the level of service appropriate to meet those needs. Chiropractic intervention is indicated in all insta nces where the objective and/or subjective presence of subluxation can be demonstra ted. Patient needs must be individually determined on the basis of recognized procedures, b ut the issue of clinical necessity of providing adjustive care shall be based on the pres ence of the vertebral subluxation complex, regardless of the presence of subjective symptom ot ology. The International Chiropractors Association's Counc il on Chiropractic Pediatric recognizes the vertebral subluxation complex as an acceptable primary diagnosis for the pediatric patient. Pediatric Patient Evaluation and Care Pathway in Ch iropractic Practice175The evaluation process for a pediatric patient is b ased on the doctor of chiropractic's physical examination , health history and assessment of the immediate needs of the patient. Additional information might also be obtained from the parents or other individuals in immediate contact with a child patient, especially in circums tances where a pediatric patient is unable to communicate the details of their complaint or situa tion. The appropriateness of chiropractic care and/or the need for referral to other provider (s) for urgent care, or for additional diagnostic evaluation is initially determined. In the absence of the necessity for immediate referral the doctor of chiropractic can determine the appropriateness o f the following: 1) Chiropractic care 2) Chiropractic care and further non-urgent diagnos tic evaluation 3) Chiropractic care and further non-urgent diagnos tic evaluation in the context of another branch of the healing arts 4) Chiropractic care and concurrent care 5) Referral to other providers ( such as special ed ucators, and social service providers) Referral is a professional obligation that is prese nt throughout all phases and aspects of the chiropractic practice. The primary obligation o f Doctors of Chiropractic is to provide the highest quality of care to each patient within the confines of their education and their legal authority. It is the position of the International Chiropractors Association's Council on Chiropractic Pediatrics that this primary obligation includes re cognizing when the limits of skill and authority are reached. . This interchange of professional ref errals should include, all professionals who work with children, including but not limited to pe diatricians, secondary medical professionals such as gastroenterologists, hematologists, and opr thopedists, osteopathic doctors, speech therapists, occupational therapists, physical thera pists, special educators, Doctors of Chiropractic are also obligated to accep t referrals from other professionals, applying to those patients the same considerations for quality and appropriateness of care as with any other patients. VERTEBRAL SUBLUXATION COMPLEX AND THE CHILD A. Definition of Subluxation The subluxation complex includes any alteration of the biomechanical and physiological dynamics of contiguous spinal structures which can cause neuronal disturbances, complication of functional and/or structural and/or pathological articular changes that compromise neural I integrity and may influence organ system function a nd general health. Subluxation is evaluated and managed through the application of chiropracti c procedures based on the best empirical evidence and clinical experience. The VSC is postulated to be comprised of the follow ing components:1761) Kinesiopathology - alteration in biomechanics 2) Myopathology- alteration in muscle form or functi on 3) Histopathology- alterations in cellular form or f unction 4) Neuropathophsyiology - alternation in nerve form or function 5) Pathophysiology- alteration in organ system func tion, and loss of cellular homeostasis The chiropractic literature specifically addresses the means of objectively identifying the presence of vertebral subluxation(s), apart from su bjective patient complaints and/or symptoms. Such reproducible, reliable procedures are the corn erstone of chiropractic practice. A detailed review of instrumentation, imaging, and other proce dures is presented in later chapters. Objective procedures have emerged and such procedur es have been incorporated into chiropractic education, authorizing legislation and routine chiropractic practice. Those procedures are: a. Palpation (static and motion). b. Postural analysis. c. Orthopedic and neurological examination. d. X-ray spinography. e. Video fluoroscopy. f. Computed tomography. g. Magnetic resonance imaging. h. Skin temperature differential analysis, including thermography. i. Paraspinal EMG scanning. B. Possible Causes of Subluxation The causative factors of subluxation in the pediatr ic population are numerous and varied. Their occurrence may begin in utero. Chiropractic science has always held that physical, chemical and emotional trauma exists at the root of the subluxation. With the growing body of information in the fields of psychoneuroimmunology, molecular genetics, and environmental toxicology, the tenets of chiropractic continue t o be validated. The following have been proposed to be contributing factors in the formatio n of the vertebral subluxation complex: 1) In utero constraint 2) Birth malposition 3) Birth malpresentation 4) Birth complications 5) Pre-natal complications 6) Congenital malformations 7) Neonatal injury 8) Developmental delay 9) Routine falls 10) Accidents17711) Sports injury 12) Emotional stress 13) Toxic exposure 14) Repetitive motion C. The Progressive Nature of Spinal Subluxation Behavior such as physical and emotional stress, ten sion, chemical/environmental stressors, repetitive motion activity patterns, ove r-extension of spinal tissues and/or characteristics such as posture, weight, or even fo otwear can establish patterns of progressive subluxation that lead to the degeneration of spinal segments. Spinal degeneration and its reversibility has been the subject of considerable scientific study. O.J. Ressell, based on a comprehensive review of 329 published references an d a series of detailed case studies concluded that chiropractic intervention not only h alted spinal osteoarthritis, but also reversed the deterioration process by measurable levels. Phase I and Phase II subluxations as outlined elsewh ere in these guidelines are the more commonly encountered types in the pediatric populat ion. Based on lack of time and chronicity, in incidences of Phase III and Phase IV subluxation is rarely seen in the pediatric population. D. Early Detection, Early Intervention and \"Welln ess\" Enhanced public awareness of environmental, psychos ocial, and physiological issues through education and community action has forced e arly detection/early intervention into the public health agenda as a significant new priority. Many states already have early intervention programs for the pediatric population, as well as f ederally mandated insurance coverage for all children. A vital measure in early intervention pr ograms which has been neglected is the inclusion of conservative chiropractic spinal healt h care and education. Most effectively introduced at birth all children should be monitore d for the presence of subluxation. In the child with developmental delay who are often enrolled in state early intervention programs it is imperative that the child have routi ne chiropractic evaluations in addition to the multidisciplinary care that early intervention prov ides. Subluxation(s) have been demonstrated to be present in persons of all ages, from the newborn infant to the most senior citizens. Likewis e, authorizing laws and regulations empower doctors of chiropractic to care for patients of all ages with no exceptions, and chiropractic education instructs professionals in training in th e proper procedures and techniques necessary to address the spinal needs of all patients, includ ing infants and the elderly. The Council on Chiropractic Education (CCE) the agency recognized by the United States Department of Education for the accreditation of chiropractic pro fessional programs recognizes no exceptions or limitations on the appropriateness of chiropract ic procedures because of age. The International Chiropractors Association recognizes the utility and appropriateness of chiropractic procedures for all persons regardless of age, and v iews efforts to restrict the access of any age group to chiropractic services as profoundly discri minatory, contrary to the laws of the several states and unsupported by the scientific literature . CHECK-UPS, EXAMINATIONS, & WELLNESS178The practice of chiropractic includes chiropractic examination and analysis to provide for prevention, acute chiropractic intervention, chroni c case management, and long-term care plans. This section focuses on wellness and preven tive care (designed to reduce the future incidence of illness or impairment) and health prom otion (based upon optimal function). Some confusion arises from the use of various terms to describe such care-including supportive care, maintenance care and preventive ca re. In this section, it is called Check-ups Prevention and Wellness care. Long-term ongoing health management has been a sign ificant component of the chiropractic model of health care. Surrounding thi s is a wellness paradigm that recognizes related influences on health, emphasizes drugless, non-surgical management, and takes a positive dynamic view of health. In addition to pe riodic routine checkups, the model looks to the whole individual and requires active patient partic ipation. Prevention efforts emphasize patient responsibility and may include exercise programs, weight loss, dietary counseling, life style modific ations, education on body postures and mechanics, mental attitude, coordination training, safety habits, ergonomics, spinal hygiene, modification of life stressors, etc. Routine check-ups provide an ongoing basis for such patient education efforts as well as early detection of subluxation. These routine check -ups form the basis for wellness care for children. As states elsewhere in these pages, the p rogressive nature of the subluxation, and the ubiquitous nature by which it can be present in the child, necessitates, that chiropractic care become a routine part of all care for children. Chi ldren who not have routine chiropractic check- ups, may be at risk of developing progressive spina l degeneration as a result of trauma, and other degenerative causes. Emerging evidence from both the molecular genetics field as well as from clinical studies such as the recent one done on colic, give credence to the evidentiary presence of illness or dis- ease as a result of the presence of subluxation. It is the position of the Council on Pediatrics tha t all children regardless of age, be checked on a routine basis for subluxations. This type of health care management program, which combines health promotion, routine checkups prevention services, and patient p articipation, is gaining much more widespread understanding and acceptance in today's more health conscious society. In recent years, cost containment of health care ha s become a regional and national priority. It is certainly a concern of responsible health care providers and consumers, as well as health care insurers. A major chiropractic premise is that the inherent r ecuperative power of the body aids restoration and maintenance of health. These assum ptions comprise a wellness paradigm embraced by the great majority of the chiropractic profession. The vertebral subluxation, along with other factors such as poor nutrition, trauma, heredity, congenital weaknesses, fatigue, mental and environmental stressors and sedentary li festyles, are viewed as lowering resistance179and creating physical disharmony. The chiropractic model requires active patient participation. In the case of the child, this participation is req uired both of the child and the parent or guardian. It is Recommended with respect to the care of child ren that: I Doctors of chiropractic provide a unique body services. They do not duplicate the services of other health care providers. Recommendation: 1. Doctors of chiropractic may restrict themselves t o procedures necessary for the detection, analysis, control, reduction and correct ion of vertebral subluxations so as to non-duplicate services available from other h ealth care providers. 2. Wherever possible, a doctor of chiropractic shoul d avoid duplication of services by using the results of tests which may have alread y been performed by other providers. It is self evident that unreasonable and unnecessar y analytical procedures drive up health care costs. Therefore, the doctor of chiropractic should utilize the optimal number and types of analytical procedures, specific to the ind ividual patient, necessary to obtain the pertinent data for the detection, analysis, control , reduction and correction of vertebral subluxations. II. The Doctor refrain from over-utilization of chir opractic services. Recommendation: 1. Reassessments should be performed to adequately a ssess frequency of visits therefore providing the highest quality care in the most cost effective manner. III Patient Education Once educated about the benefits of chiropractic ca re, the patient should assume the role of becoming responsible for his/her own he alth as it relates to chiropractic care. A patient / parent that understands the benefits o f chiropractic care will utilize these services as a preventative type measure, thus assis ting in the cost containment of the overall health care system. Recommendation: The doctor of chiropractic should assume the respon sibility of educating the patient as to the benefits of vertebral subluxation correction and prevention and how it relates to their overall health and the health of e veryone in the community.180IV Patient Responsibility In the interest of reducing health care costs, the doctors of chiropractic should always try to instill in the patient the following concepts of patient responsibility: 1. The patient should assume responsibility for thei r own health and that of their family where applicable and take appropriate care o f them. 2. Compliance with the chiropractors recommendations , leading to reduction of visit frequency as soon as possible. 3. The more responsible each patient is for their ow n fees the less burden they will be on the nation's health system. 4. The patient, as well as the chiropractor, should accept the responsibility to avoid over utilization. V. Routine Check-ups/Prevention Services 1. Disclosure: Routine check-ups and prevention services are an in tegral part of the patients overall health care. It is necessary for the pract itioner to clearly understand the type and nature of this care they are being given a nd to give proper patient disclosure by the D.C. 2. Use of Chiropractic Adjustments The clinical experience of the profession developed over a period of more than 100 years suggests that the use of chiropractic adj ustments in a regimen of routine check-ups/prevention services has merit. 3. Health Screening The importance of health preventive strategies is w idely recognized. These services may have value in identifying early or potential manifestations of a health problem. 4. Health Promotion: Preventive orientation to health through health pro motion is well established. Health promotion provides the opportunity for chirop ractic practitioners to promote health through assessment, education, and counselin g on topics such as nutrition, exercise, stress reduction, life style p atterns, mental attitude, spinal hygiene, weight reduction, smoking cessation, and e rgonomics, among others. 5. Wellness Care:181Chiropractic is the largest, most established and w idely licensed of the wellness oriented health professions. Wellness and the cons cientious management of lifestyle strategies have gained popularity and acc eptance. Chiropractic practitioners may choose to expand their practices to include those services that may influence a person's attainment of optimum perf ormance and behavior, and in so doing, improve health status. This kind of c are is performance specific (i.e., quality of life) rather than condition (e.g., sympt om) specific and is not intended to duplicate or invade the realms of other health care disciplines. COLLABORATIVE CARE All patients of all health care providers have the right to expect health care services at the highest level of quality. The preservation of pati ent trust and confidence depends on this. When the needs of the patient demand the inclusion of ot her providers or institutions in the program of care, extra caution and extra effort are required t o ensure that no gaps in service or conflicts will be allowed to jeopardize the quality of care. The chiropractic practitioner should be aware of programs of cooperation and/or collaboration, which can assist the patient. Relationships between health care professionals can only become more complex, and possibly more contentious as we presently enter an era of great change and instability in health care. Concepts such as \"managed care,\" \"preferred provider\" and \"gatekeeper physician\" are becoming the new currency of health care policy. A s efforts to control health care costs center more and more on the managed care theory of cost an d utilization containment, a credible protocol for interaction becomes an urgent necessit y. To ensure that all requirements for patient care ca n truly be addressed, this new model must consider cooperative relationships in all sett ings, including institutional settings such as the hospital, nursing home, and hospice, and among all health care professionals. The model to be devised must be comprehensive, clear to all parties involved, and flexible and dynamic enough to adapt to the daily realities of practice. The special needs of children demand that in all si tuations, the chiropractic profession take steps to ensure that relationships with other providers are governed by the needs of the patient. Likewise, doctors of chiropractic must ca refully safeguard the rights of chiropractic patients and ensure that other providers are consci ous of the need to conduct patient care in a totally objective and professional manner. When pr ofessions interact in the delivery of health care services, economic and social factors as well as professional territorialism should never be allowed to override the fundamental obligation to t he patient. There is no place for such distractions in the delivery of quality health care . II. LIST OF SUBTOPICS Reasonable Patient Expectations in the Cooperative and Collaborative Care Setting A. The Patient and the Primary Care Provider B. Freedom of Choice and Informed Consent182C. Professional Knowledge and Understanding D. Referrals E. Exchange of Information and Records between Provi ders F. Professional Interaction in the Hospital or Other Institutional Setting. G. Economic Considerations Collaboration can be defined as the reciprocal inte r-professional interaction of two or more health care providers. Collaborative care inv olves this interaction in the management of the patient's current health status. Collaborative care, therefore, includes care in a private practitioner's office, where interaction exists on a daily basis between the practitioner and his/her assistants, as well as care within a complex instit utional setting such as a medical specialty ward in a hospital and care within a managed care s etting. Various specialty fields exist within chiropractic and are available as a resource. Hospitals and other institutional inpatient setting s represent to some degree a new frontier for chiropractic. Chiropractic has an eno rmous impact to make in this context. As well, hospitals are of great social, political and econom ic importance in North America. It is here that the largest publicly supported concentration of lea ding-edge diagnostic equipment is to be found. Hospitals are also the scene of the vast majority o f clinical information gathering and research. Collaborative care is neither new nor unique to thi s generation of providers, though cooperative relationships between the medical and c hiropractic professions have been less frequent in the past. The federal court judgment i n 1987 in Wilk et al. vs. AMA et al., which effectively eliminated formal barriers previously e stablished to the collaboration of the chiropractic and medical professions, has been a ke y factor in increasing cooperation. However, as greater emphasis is now being placed on the concept of nominating one primary care doctor as a \"gatekeeper\" whose function is to ensure appropriate care yet contain specialist and other costs, new effort is required to understa nd the appropriate role of different health disciplines. This is a difficult task for a number of reasons. Firstly, from an organizational viewpoint, much of modern medicine is based on a \"problem-oriented model\" rather than one based eith er on the management of chronic illness or disease prevention. The problem-oriented model is less conducive to an interdisciplinary team approach than a \"goal-oriented model\" where the pat ient's achievement of highest possible level of health is the goal of all concerned. When incorporating chiropractic care into patient c are guidelines, it is always understood that the role of the doctor of chiropractic is sepa rate from other health disciplines and should be presented as such. Whatever the unique needs of th e individual patient, the objective of chiropractic remains the same. The correction of v ertebral subluxations is the goal of chiropractic regardless of whether any other diseas e or condition is presented. As the doctor of chiropractic participates more and more in other patient care settings, the importance of keeping the body free from sublux ation is paramount to promoting a return to the patient's full health potential. Through great er understanding of the chiropractic objective by both the patient and collaborating professional, th e pursuit of cooperation and quality patient care can be enhanced. Clarity of roles is vital. This clarity is depende nt to some extent on the probability of a successful care outcome and to some extent upon the provider chosen. This should be183understood when clinical policies and guidelines ar e made on decision-making in patient management. Dixon has noted that while policies ca n be helpful in simplifying complex clinical dilemmas, they have at times been adopted without e vidence of benefit and that research studies using appropriate clinical methodology shou ld be encouraged in order to prevent useless or even dangerous algorithms of care. The development of wise patient care guidelines, in corporating the many approaches available in health care today, should provide for the most effective balance of resources for the patient's needs. Determining the role of each prof ession in the various algorithms for patient management should reflect the varying and unique ne eds of each individual patient. Developing such algorithms, which are currently not in place n ationwide, may reasonably be expected to have a significant impact on health outcomes in gen eral, as well as on the difficult inter- professional issue of cost-containment. To that en d, for example, Wenneberg has stated that patients' understanding of their care options is an ticipated to be a major contributing factor in their care selection. He noted that health care al location by patient preference is likely to be cost-effective because patients prefer and select l ess invasive, less expensive treatments. It is in the best interest, therefore, of all concerned t hat the health care system have all its professional resources, and ready information on th em, available to all patients. Initially, as the chiropractic profession explores the arena of collaborative care more fully, documents generated by practitioners engaging in th is work and setting out inter-professional referral protocols can serve as guidelines. As par t of the health care system at large, however, the chiropractic profession must now begin to focus more of its resources in researching and developing clinical standards relevant to collabora tive care. As noted earlier, such efforts are needed to meet the many and varied needs of all pat ients. CONSULTATION, HISTORY & EXAMINATION I. OVERVIEW The chiropractic case history and pediatric examina tion are concerned with the accumulation of information pertinent to the overal l health status of the child. The history and examination of the child is unique and age specific , and needs to be employed when a child presents for chiropractic care.

Specific literature on the appropriate history and examination techniques for the chiropractic practitioner can be found in numerous texts. The reader is directed to those texts listed in the bibliography for detailed description of such techniques. The intent of this chapter is not to serve as a teaching tool. Rather, the purpo se is to assist in establishing guidelines related to acceptable history techniques to be used by the practitioner. The history-taking procedure has been considered th e most clinically sophisticated and complex task used by health care providers. Its pu rpose is to provide the clinician with one or more diagnostic impressions. These are then confir med or altered following the judicious selection of additional tests -- and it can be note d in the literature that this process does indeed occur. Much of the information that will lead a cl inician to a management plan then is gained very early in the doctor patient/parent interaction . The history and physical examination of the child i s extremely important. Firstly, it requires the participation of the parent/guardian/c are-giver as well as that of the child. In the very young child the information obtained in the history is solely dependent upon the parent/ guardian/ care-giver. In addition it is important to note tha t the parent who is not the primary caregiver may not be the best source of information with respect to the history. It is therefore incumbent upon the doctor of chiropractic to encourage all who car e for the very young child to participate in the history taking process. With respect to the older c hild, the child's own participation in the history process is invaluable and should encouraged. When a long term or chronic problem is at issue, it is important to gather additional information after obtaining the proper consent form s, from the child's other health-care providers as well as teachers, coaches, and others. MODES OF CARE This section provides a generic topical summary of typical chiropractic procedures in current use for the pediatric population. Most chir opractic named technique procedures consists of a combination of various analytic and treatment components. Clinical practice and scientific investigation are ongoing processes and it is under stood that this document is a dynamic entity that will require modifications as new knowledge be comes available. A. Use of ineffective or unsafe mode of care Due to the developing nature of the pediatric spine and nervous system, some modes of care need to be modified. The nature of the pediatr ic spine is cartilaginous with active growth plates.190The normal ranges of motion of the pediatric spine exceed those of the adult. Any adjustment performed which velocity, thrust, extens ion, lateral flexion, rotation, extension, flexion, axial distraction and traction require modification for the pediatric patient. Any lack of specificity in adjusting the pediatric spine is contraindicated. B. Chiropractic adjustment modes 1. High velocity thrusts with high force CONTRAINDICATED 2. High velocity thrusts with recoil INDICATED WITH MODIFICATION TO ROM AND THRUST 3. Low velocity thrusts without recoil INDICATED WITH MODIFICATION TO ROM AND THRUST 4. Low velocity thrusts with recoil INDICATED WITH MODIFICATION TO ROM AND THRUST 5. Sustained force INDICATED WITH MODIFICATION TO FORCE 6. Blocking techniques INDICATED WITH MODIFICATION TO EQUIPMENT 7. Manually assisted mechanical thrusts INDICATED WITH MODIFICATION TO THRUST 8.

Nutritional Advice INDICATED 10. Lifestyle Recommendation INDICATED 11. Wellness Care/Prevention - Health Promotion/Spin al Hygiene INDICATED FREQUENCY & DURATION OF CARE Specific parameters of care appropriate for each in dividual pediatric case areimpossible to define. Each case must be evaluated with compli cating factors, concomitant conditions and all other extenuating circumstances taken into cons ideration in order to assure the patient maximum benefit through chiropractic care. Pediatric patients progress at a different rate from adults therefore it is important that adult guidelines not be overlaid on the pediatric p atient. Since the nature of pediatric care is somewhat different again, individualization is para mount. In addition, the subjective and objective findings associated with chiropractic care of the p ediatric patient is significantly different than th at of the adult population. Principles of Case Management192The primary missions of health care delivery are to provide sufficient care to restore health, maintain it, and prevent the occurrence or recurrence of injury and illness. The practical boundaries on what will constitute necessary and su fficient care are situational. However, guidelines framing expectations of care outcome can be drawn from the literature and adapted by practical experience on a case-by-case basis. Chiropractic shows the unique ability to determine sub-clinical spinal disorders such as any of the components of the vertebral subluxation complex, known to precede symptoms/end stage conditions eliminating the need for the most part of crisis intervention. A key principle is that chronicity should be prevented wherever possib le. Patients who are at risk for becoming chronic show characteristic patterns involving thei r illness and life situations. III. RECOMMENDATIONS The frequency with which a particular patient need s to see their chiropractor is based on the subjective findings, if applicable and the obje ctive clinical findings and the opinion of the doctor. There is no set template on the number of v isits needed to obtain maximum chiropractic improvement for the population as a whole. Each pa tient who presents at the chiropractic clinic is unique and different and must be treated as such . Some of the factors which need to be taken into con sideration is the age of the patient, type of work or daily activities, trauma or aggrava tion, stability and function ability of supporting structures (muscles and ligaments) the structural i ntegrity of the spine and its articulations (degeneration, demineralization, biomechanical loss or failure). These and other factors are the considerations which go into making a plan of care/ number of visits for each patient. After a patient starts an initial program of care t hey will be re-examined/re-assessed at proper intervals. This is done to determine the pa tient's response to care and if the frequency can be reduced or needs to be increased and/ or if a referral is necessary. The re-exam/re- assessment may be performed several times during th e course of care until the patient reaches maximum chiropractic improvement (MCI). Maximum im provement varies with each patient and will depend on those factors noted above. Once a pa tient reaches MCI they are released from care and recommended to a PRN basis or other type p rogram which they and their chiropractor agree upon. The following shall serve as a guideline. It is im portant to note that with proper documentation additional care or alteration of care schedule may be warranted for the categories of conditions and levels of care listed herein. Additional Definitions Phase I, II, III, IV: These phases refer to the radi ographic presentation of the (subluxation) degeneration which occurs in the spine. (Hadley MD) . Acute: New condition, not exceeding 12 months durati on Chronic: Old condition, duration of longer than 12 m onths193Trauma: Onset due to accidental/intentional injury. Non-trauma: Symptoms which arise insidiously. Clinical: That condition which has overt signs and s ymptoms. Subclinical: A condition the signs of which require investigation and in which overt symptoms have yet to occur, and would go unnoticed with progressive degeneration until it becomes clinical. The nature of chiropractic care for the pediatric p atient is unique. While one child may seek chiropractic care for the subluxation patterns that occur as part of the birth process, another may seek chiropractic care as a result of a genetic disorder which has causes subluxation as a significant chronic component. The nature of the care therefore, with respect to the duration is significantly different. Subluxation as we have seen earlier in these guidel ines can result from a myriad of stresses on the pediatric spine. The child who pres ents without symptomatology may still present with spinal subluxations. Frequently in the pediatric population, due to the nature of the growing spinal structures, and the lack of a maturi ty of the neurological system, the presence of subluxation is without pain or symptomatology. In t he presence of symptomatology, it is likely that the level of subluxation is greater, and may r equire a longer duration of care, with a greater frequency. In addition the chronic nature of a pediatric condi tion, such as cerebral palsy may require life- long chiropractic care to minimize subluxation and to maintain optimum functioning in the child and subsequently in the adult. Accidents are the lading cause of pediatric morbidi ty. Trauma therefore needs to be addressed frequently in the pediatric population, a nd the subluxation patterns and changes caused thereby. Birth trauma, generalized falls and developmental patterns, may present another level of subluxation in the child. Automobi le accidents, and the flexion-extension injuries caused by these accidents can have a significant im pact on the developing spine of the child, and therefore the subluxations caused by these auto mobile accidents need to be addressed by chiropractic care. The following are some of the ca tegories of possible subluxation causes in the child: ACUTE- trauma, accidents, falls, birth trauma, toxic exposure NORMAL DEVELOPMENT- achievement of normal milestones such as sitting up crawling, walking etc. ABNORMAL DEVELOPMENT- those caused by the presence o f congenital/ genetic considerations such as portcullis, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, and autism, ADD/ADHD PATHOLOGY- those caused by the presence of pathology such as fracture, disease etc.194While these categories are not all inclusive, they should serve as a guideline. There can be considerable overlap between the categories in a child and there can also be the presence of only one category. The question of supportive care for the child is of ten presented. The following can serve as a guideline for supportive chiropractic care for children: The necessity of long term palliative care or suppo rtive care should accomplish one or more of the following goal in order to be considere d necessary and appropriate: 1. Care of an exacerbation to return the patient to pre-exacerbation status. 2. Improvement or maintenance of activities of daily living. 3. Improvement or maintenance of work status. 4. Increase of functional strength. 5. Increase stamina, endurance and activity toleranc e. 6. Increase functional range of motion. 7. Improve mental attitude. 8. Decrease need for, or amount of, medication. 9. Prevention of surgical intervention when appropri ate. 10. To attain optimal expression of life. V. COMMENTS In the course of the management of a chiropractic c ase the objective indicators of vertebral subluxation(s) and other dysfunctional ar ticulations and structures demonstrated during Level I (see glossary for definition of levels of c are) care may decrease. As the patient's clinical indicators are minimized and spinal function improv es and stabilizes, the frequency of care is reduced and the patient is advanced to Level II car e. Some of the variables considered during the evaluation of the patient's status include, but are not limited to age, occupation/lifestyle, past metabolic history, past history of injuries/fractur es/surgeries, structure, irreg ularities, bone density irregularities, articular irregularities, joint irregularities, chronic adapt ive postural and structural changes, chronicity, th e number of spinal subluxations present, patient tole rance to active care, and the degree of patient cooperation.195When a patient has demonstrated sufficient reductio n of clinical indicators of vertebral subluxation and other dysfunctional articulations a nd structures, they should be advanced from Level II care. The chiropractor should then recomm end Level III care. At some point during a patient's care, the practiti oner may note that those clinical indications of vertebral subluxation and other dysf unctional articulations and structures (including, but not limited to those found by motio n and static palpation, instrumentation, radiography, etc.) are becoming either more or less noticeable. In order to ascertain the optimal elapsed time period between chiropractic office vis its, the practitioner would then begin the process of decreasing or increasing visit frequency . Should the indicators for the presence of a vertebral subluxation and other dysfunctional artic ulations and structures are imperceptible or absent, in the clinical opinion of the practitioner , office visit frequency would be decreased. At some point in this process, however, the indicators for the presence of a vertebral subluxation and other dysfunctional articulations and structure s may again be manifested, necessitating a chiropractic adjustment and a reassessment of visit frequency. The concerns of the public regarding health care ha ve shifted to an active responsibility for their physical well being. Patients who unders tand the major objective of chiropractic knowingly choose this approach to help them maximiz e their health potential. Scientific evidence identifies components of the vertebral subluxation and other dysfunctional articulations and structures and may reveal physiologic changes that occur after the correction of the vertebral subluxation and other dysfunctional articulations a nd structures. Moreover, it is observed clinically that dramatic changes may occur after th e correction of a vertebral subluxation and other dysfunctional articulations and structures. Most chiropractors have observed changes after spinal adjustments that affect major body sys tems and the patient's complex metabolic system. The clinical explanation for these changes is associated with improved natural functions. When interference to the nervous system is reduced, the body's capacity to heal and thrive is rekindled. Vertebral subluxations and ot her dysfunctional articulations and structures may occur during the birth process, therefore, it i s imperative that chiropractic care should begin as soon as possible. Chiropractic care should cont inue, in accordance with the patient's needs and the chiropractor's clinical opinion, for the li fe of the patient. CONTRAINDICATION & COMPLICATIONS While chiropractic procedures have consistently b een demonstrated to be comparatively safe, special caution is warranted wi th certain conditions. Prevention of complications from chiropractic care is facilitated when good professional judgment is exercised and quality care is provided. Elements common to a ll primary care practitioners include sufficient history taking and record keeping, thoro ugh examination, timely re-evaluation procedures throughout the course of case management , good communication with the patient and appropriate response in the event that an unexp ected incident does occur. If a significant adverse result from a procedure is apparent, it is of critical importance that the intervention or procedure associated with the onset of the complica tion not be repeated. The evidence shows that the low incidence of injury or complications from adjustments is promoted by quality care which follo ws professional judgment consistent with the objectives of chiropractic care. Chiropractic prof essional judgment includes, without limitation, appropriate response to unexpected findings and ree valuation of the suitability of a particular technique or procedure associated with the discover y of a complication. The doctor of196chiropractic should be alert to the possibility of encountering unusual findings in any phase of care. Patient safety can be further enhanced by the chiro practic profession's commitment to quality assurance. When assessing the safety and efficacy of chiroprac tic care, two factors should always be considered: the type of technique being utilized and the integrity of the area of the spinal column/or articulation being addressed. The se two factors assist in evaluating any risk that may be associated with the application of chir opractic care. The primary focus of the chiropractic management of complications is the recognition of unusual findings that may require mo dification of the plan of care when the unusual finding is observed.. It is important to note that the literature clearly illustrates that most serious adverse effects with spinal manual procedures, or s pinal manipulative therapy as it is described in medical literature (in reference to pr ocedures applied by professions other that the chiropractic profession), have not been t he result of procedures performed by doctors of chiropractic. It is important, therefore , that throughout all the professions a standard minimum training greater than or equal to that of a DC in adjustive/manual procedures be required prior to performance of SMT.

OVERVIEW The practice of chiropractic includes chiropractic examination and analysis to provide for prevention, acute chiropractic intervention, chroni c case management, and long-term care plans. This chapter focuses on wellness and preventive care (de signed to reduce the future incidence of illness or impairment) and health promotion (based upon opt imal function). Some confusion arises from the use of various terms to describe such care-including supportive care, maintenance care and preventive ca re. In this chapter, it is called \"Routine Check- ups/Prevention. Long-term ongoing health management has been a sign ificant component of the chiropractic model of health care. Surrounding this is a wellne ss paradigm that recognizes related influences on health, emphasizes drugless, non-surgical managemen t, and takes a positive dynamic view of health. In addition to periodic routine checkups, the mode l looks to the whole individual and requires active patient participation. Prevention efforts emphasize patient responsibility and may include exercise programs, weight loss, dietary counseling, life style modifications, education on body postures and mechanics, mental attitude, coordination training, safety habits, erg onomics, spinal hygiene, modification of life stres sors, etc. Routine check-ups provide an ongoing basis for such patient education efforts as well as early detection of subluxation. This type of management program, which combines hea lth promotion, routine checkups/ prevention services, and patient participation, is gaining much more widespread understanding and acceptance in today's more health conscious society . In recent years, cost containment of health care ha s become a regional and national priority. It is certainly a concern of responsible health ca re providers and consumers, as well as health care insurers. The spiraling costs are driven up by the unique char acter of the health care marketplace. It does not respond to the usual supply and demand dyn amics. This results in the following anomaly: 1. A purchaser (3rd party payer) that pays for servi ce(s) but does not order or receive them. 2. A consumer that receives the service(s) but does not order or purchase them. 3. A provider that orders service(s) but does not re ceive or pay for them. This process potentially negates the visible accoun tability that normally exists between a patient and a doctor. \"Despite the overall health improvements achieved a s a result of preventive interventions, the Nation continues to be burdened by preventable illn ess, injury, and disability. In 1960 the share of the Gross National Product (GNP) going to medical servi ces was 5 percent. It is estimated to reach nearly 12 percent in 1990. Lost economic productivity att endant to illness and early death compounds the impact of this problem, so that in 1980 the total c osts of illness equaled nearly 18 percent of GNP. Injury alone now costs the Nation well over $100 bi llion annually, cancer over $70 billion, and cardiovascular disease $135 billion.160Sophisticated technology for the diagnosis and care of disease conditions has outstripped society's ability to pay for it.\" Annual spending on health care is doubling every fi ve years and could hit $1.4 trillion by 1999, \"Which is impossible to tolerate economically,\" sai d Dr. George Lundberg, editor of The Journal of the American Medical Association. In spite of the stag gering expenditure on the nations health care, the health of the people continues to decline. In the late 1990s the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, published a statement of health policy goals entitl ed Healthy People 2000. It is the product of a National effort of 22 expert groups, almost 300 nat ional organizations and every state health department. More than 10,000 people were involved in public review and comment pertaining to Healthy People 2000. Several statements, germane to this chapter, have b een extracted from that document. \"The nation has within its power the ability to sav e many lives lost prematurely and needlessly. Implementation of what is already known about prom oting health and preventing disease is the central challenge of Healthy People 2000.\" \"But Healthy People 2000 also challenges the Nation to move beyond merely saving lives. The health of a people is measured by more than death r ates. Good health comes from reducing unnecessary suffering, illness, and disability. It comes as well from an improved quality of life...T he purpose of Healthy People 2000 is to commit the Nat ion to the attainment of three broad goals that wil l help bring us to our full potential, namely to: - increase the span of healthy life for Americans - reduce health disparities among Americans - achieve access to preventive services for all Amer icans The challenge of Healthy People 2000 is to use the combined strength of scientific knowledge, professional skill, individual commitment, communit y support, and political will to enable people to achieve their potential to live full, active lives. It means preventing premature death and preventin g disability, preserving a physical environment that supports human life, cultivating family and communi ty support, enhancing each individual's inherent abili ties to respond and to act, and assuring that all Americans achieve and maintain a maximum level of f unctioning.\" The chiropractic community agrees emphatically with these goals. What the chiropractic profession has to contribute is a new dimension to the understanding of what is already known about promoting health. Federal officials have, however , been frank in acknowledging that the goals set in the Healthy People 2000 program have not been re alized and many of the objectives outlined in that program have re-surfaced as still-to-be-attained in the newer version of that effort. This focus on health and prevention is, still, a welcome signal t hat the public health system is recognizing the importance of health and wellness instead of only a ddressing public resources on illness at the crisis stage. The International Chiropractors Association strongly encourages the extension and expansion of these concepts into all health and health care p rograms, both public and private, throughout The chiropractic profession offers the fresh perspe ctive of a vitalistic paradigm, emphasizing the expression of human potential. Furthermore, th e chiropractic profession provides the service of detection, control and correction of vertebral subl uxations and other malpositioned articulations and structures, thereby enhancing the optimum expressio n of function and health from within. The focus of chiropractic is to empower the individ ual with the understanding that true health161comes from within. It is important to preserve the individual's right to make an informed choice abou t options regarding health care services. As chiropr actors we embrace the challenge and welcome the opportunity to participate. Healthy People 2000 wa s a start, acknowledging the role personal choice plays in health promotion strategies. The chiropra ctic profession holds that the freedom of choice of each individual in selecting a health care provider is a vital consumer freedom and that such freedoms should be an integral part of all health care progr ams both public and private. \"Healthy People 2000 used the three approaches; of health promotion, health protection, and preventive services as organizing categories,.....I t calls on medical and health professionals to prev ent, not just to treat, the diseases and conditions that result in premature death and chronic disability. All are necessary. None is sufficient alone to achieve Healthy People 2000's goals and objectives.\" The chiropractic profession has a vital role to play in meeting these objectives. In his letter in the foreward of Healthy People 200 0, James O. Mason, M.D., Dr. P.H., Assistant Secretary for Health stated \"I commend Healthy Peop le 2000 to you and through you to the American people. This set of objectives for the year 2000 m akes an important, compelling point to us and to al l health policy makers: we can no longer afford not t o invest in prevention. From the perspective of avoiding human suffering as well as saving wasteful costs for treating diseases and injuries that coul d have been prevented, the 1990's should be the decad e of prevention in the United States.\" Crisis care has formed the backbone of health care throughout the world. Waiting until a person develops an illness is clearly not cost effi cient and is partly responsible for the fact that h ealth care costs have become a worldwide crisis. It is obvious that a person who is not \"sick\" and k nows how to stay healthy will not increase health care costs and will in fact decrease costs. The chiropractic profession is acutely aware of thi s situation and doctors of chiropractic are dedicated to the concept of assisting people to not only avoid crises care but, also to stay healthy b y removing barriers which interfere with the body and erode the bodies ability to heal and maintain itse lf in a state of optimum health. In the event that a person has experienced a health crisis, chiropractic care is highly cost effective in providing a unique service that will h elp an individual with his/her present crisis and l ead him/her toward a healthier state.

LITERATURE REVIEW162From the very beginning, the chiropractic model of health has had as its foundation the maxim that a human being is an ecologically and biologica lly unified organism. The relationship between a patient's internal and external environment must be understood. A major chiropractic premise is that the inherent recuperative power of the body aids re storation and maintenance of health. These principles comprise a wellness paradigm embraced by the chiropractic profession. The vertebral subluxation, along with other factors such as poor nutrition, trauma, heredity, congenital weaknesses, fatigue, mental and environmental stressors and sed entary lifestyles, are viewed as lowering resistance and creating physical disharmony. The c hiropractic model requires active patient participation. Patients initially presenting with a neuro-musculos keletal problem often obtain a swift and favorable result. Then they may look to the practi tioner for other health care needs. Some patients require ongoing long-term care, other s choose it. Insurance constraints, however, mandate that the practitioner indicate whe n maximum corrective benefit has been achieved. The effectiveness of chiropractic preventive/maint enance care has not been subjected to study by randomized trial, a process that presents major met hodological and financial challenges, but is supported by evidence from case studies. Third party payers have typically resisted reimburs ements for long-term preventive/ maintenance care. Nonetheless, there is growing co nsumer demand for this and chiropractic care generally, despite increases in out-of-pocket expen ses. It is helpful to the patient to understand their st atus to the level of care they are experiencing and when routine checkups/prevention services begin s. The unique nature of each case makes it difficult to develop any standard schedule accordin g to which patients should be examined and checked for subluxation indicators. The Internatio nal Chiropractors Association conducted a detailed survey of 145 members inquiring as to the members' understanding of appropriate intervals for routine check-ups, based on their clinical experience. Res ponses varied somewhat but interval recommendations clustered between the two-week and three-week intervals as appropriate for chiropractic check-ups. Extensive lifestyle and personal activity data exis ts that point to an increasingly sedentary population, increasing employment, social and envir onmental stress and other factors that are recognized as contributors to subluxation causation . While no definitive consensus exists regarding the optimal routine chiropractic check-up interval is likely to emerge in the immediate future, prelim inary indicators show that a period of two to three weeks is reasonable for the patient with no immediate complaint or with no history that would indicate th e need to specifically pre-schedule examinations and/or adjustive care. The chiropractic profession has a specific role in the prevention of complaints of spinal origin, and in the development of strategies to avoid the n eed for more radical interventions. Enhanced public awareness of environmental, psycho- social, and physiological issues through education and community action has forced preventiv e care into the public health agenda as the number one priority. Smoking cessation, weight con trol, nutritional considerations, stress reductions , advice about exposure to environmental pollutants a nd education in respect to the potential dangers of over-the-counter drugs are examples of initiativ es affecting the chiropractic patient population worldwide. IV. RECOMMENDATIONS163It is essential for all health professions to have a clearly defined mission statement. The doctor of chiropractic's primary mission is to locate, ana lyze, control, reduce and correct vertebral subluxations to allow the patient to exhibit his/he r optimum healing potential. 1. A doctor of chiropractic should adhere to the par adigm statement on chiropractic as developed by the Association of Chiropractic Colleg es and formally adopted by the International Chiropractors Association, America Ch iropractic Association, the Foundation for the Advancement of Chiropractic Tene ts and Science, and a host of other chiropractic associations and specialty group s. 5.1.1 Rating : Strong Positive Recommendation Evidence: E, L A Non-Duplication of Services Doctors of chiropractic provide a unique body servi ces. They do not duplicate the services of other health care providers. Recommendation: 1. Doctors of chiropractic may restrict themselves t o procedures necessary for the detection, analysis, control, reduction and correct ion of vertebral subluxations so as to non-duplicate services available from other heal th care providers. 2. Wherever possible, a doctor of chiropractic shoul d avoid duplication of services by using the results of tests which may have already b een performed by other providers. It is self evident that unreasonable and unnecessar y analytical procedures drive up health care costs. Therefore, the doctor of chiropractic shoul d utilize the optimal number and types of analytica l procedures, specific to the individual patient, nec essary to obtain the pertinent data for the detecti on, analysis, control, reduction and correction of ver tebral subluxations. 5.2.1 Rating: Strong Positive Recommendation Evidence: E, L B. Overutilization Recommendation: Reassessments should be performed to adequately assess frequency of visits therefore providing the highest quality care in the most cost effective manner. 5.2.2 Rating : Strong Positive Recommendation Evidence: E, L C. Patient Education Once educated about the benefits of chiropractic ca re, the patient should assume the role of becoming responsible for his/her own health as it r elates to chiropractic care. A patient that understands the benefits of chiropractic care will utilize these services as a preventative type measu re, thus assisting in the cost containment of the overa ll health care system. Recommendation: The doctor of chiropractic should a ssume the responsibility of educating the patient as to the benefits of vertebral subluxation correction and prevention and how it relates164to their overall health and the health of everyone in the community. 5.3.1 Rating : Strong Positive Recommendation Evidence: E, L D. Patient Responsibility In the interest of reducing health care costs, the doctors of chiropractic should always try to instill in the patient the following concepts of pa tient responsibility: 1. The patient should assume responsibility for thei r own health and that of their family where applicable and take appropriate care of thems elves. 2. Compliance with the chiropractors recommendations , leading to reduction of visit frequency as soon as possible. 3. The more responsible each patient is for their ow n fees the less burden they will be on the nation's health system. 4. The patient, as well as the chiropractor, should accept the responsibility to avoid overutilization. 5.4.1 Rating : Strong Positive Recommendation Evidence: E E. Professional Regulation Recommendation: All regulations should be develope d to insure consumer safety and in light of the cost/benefit ratio when it impacts on consum er cost. 5.5.1 Rating : Strong Positive Recommendation Evidence: E, L F. Shared Resources Shared resources may have a cost-effective value as in the following examples: Multiple providers sharing/using facilities or equi pment. Centralized facilities housing cost-intensive equip ment in lieu of duplication, e.g., video fluoroscopy, and MRI. Shared staff Recommendation: When practical, multiple providers sharing resources is cost effective. 5.6.1 Rating : Discretion ary Evidence: E, L G. Unlimited Chiropractic Care at a Fixed Fee Doctors of chiropractic may use a fixed charge for a specified period of time for unlimited services. This is found to be an effective method of reducing costs to the purchaser, through reducin g clerical and other overhead costs. Such programs m ust however be in compliance with applicable165state and federal laws and regulations. 5.7.1 Rating : Discretionary Evidence: E H. Routine Check-ups/Prevention Services 1. Disclosure: Routine check-ups and prevention services are an in tegral part of the patient's overall health care. It is necessary for the practitioner to clearly understand the type and nature of this care they are being given and to giv e proper patient disclosure by the D.C. 5.8.1 Rating : Established Evidence: Class III 2. Use of Chiropractic Adjustments The clinical experience of the profession developed over a period of more than 100 years suggests that the use of chiropractic adjustm ents in a regimen of routine check- ups/prevention services has merit. 5.8.2 Rating : Established Evidence: Class II, III 3. Health Screening The importance of health preventive strategies is w idely recognized. These services may have value in identifying early or potential ma nifestations of a health problem. 5.8.3 Rating : Established Evidence: Class II, III 4. Health Promotion: Preventive orientation to health through health pro motion is well established. Health promotion provides the opportunity for chiropractic practitioners to promote health through assessment, education, and counseling on to pics such as nutrition, exercise, stress reduction, life style patterns, mental attit ude, spinal hygiene, weight reduction, smoking cessation, and ergonomics, among others. 5.8.4 Rating : Established Evidence: Class I, II, III 5. Wellness Care: Chiropractic is the largest, most established and w idely licensed of the wellness oriented health professions. Wellness and the cons cientious management of lifestyle strategies have gained popularity and acceptance. Chiropractic practitioners may choose to expand their practices to include those s ervices that may influence a person's attainment of optimum performance and beha vior, and in so doing, improve166health status. This kind of care is performance sp ecific (i.e., quality of life) rather than condition (e.g., symptom) specific and is not inten ded to duplicate or invade the realms of other health care disciplines. 5.8.5 Rating : Established Evidence: Class III I. Public Health Considerations 6. Community Screening: Community-based screening programs are commonly use d by all disciplines to promote public health. Spinal screening by appropriate dis ciplines should be encouraged to promote public health. 5.9.1 Rating : Established Evidence: Class II, III 7. Public Health Considerations: The chiropractic profession has recognized the need to engage in the local, state, national and international agendas of public health . Such programs provide opportunities for education and understanding progr ams regarding spinal health, nutrition, exercise and life styles, drugs, alcohol , tobacco, and infectious disease, as well as environmental and other social issues. 5.9.2 Rating : Established Evidence: II, III V. COMMENTS In this chapter a distinction has been drawn betwee n two kinds of long-term chiropractic care: corrective/supportive care which has immediate cli nical necessity; and routine check-ups/prevention services which is elective and focuses upon patient participation and wellness. The chiropractic profession, which has always had a wellness paradigm and has stood at the forefront of the health promotion and wellness move ments, must participate in research and that will better evaluate the basis and implementation of wor ldwide routine check-ups/prevention services.

References-168--169-I. OVERVIEW All patients of all health care providers have the right to expect health care services at the highest level of quality. The preservation of pati ent trust and confidence depends on this. When the needs of the patient demand the inclusion of other providers or institutions in the program of care, extra caution and extra effort are required to ensu re that no gaps in service or conflicts will be all owed to jeopardize the quality of care. The chiropracti c practitioner should be aware of programs of cooperation and/or collaboration which can assist t he patient. Relationships between health care professionals can only become more complex, and possibly more contentious as we presently enter an era of gr eat change and instability in health care. Concepts such as \"managed care,\" \"preferred provide r\" and \"gatekeeper physician\" are becoming the new currency of health care policy. As efforts to control health care costs center more and more on the managed care theory of cost and utilization con tainment, a credible protocol for interaction becomes an urgent necessity. To ensure that all requirements for patient care ca n truly be addressed, this new model must consider cooperative relationships in all settings, including institutional settings such as the hospi tal, nursing home, and hospice, and among all health car e professionals. The model to be devised must be comprehensive, clear to all parties involved, an d flexible and dynamic enough to adapt to the daily realities of practice. In an era in which greater scrutiny is being given to all health care procedures and pathways, it is particularly important that the chiropractic profession take steps to ensure that relationships with other providers are based on the best interests of the patient at all times. Likewise, we must carefu lly safeguard the rights of chiropractic patients and e nsure that other providers are conscious of the nee d to conduct patient care in a totally objective and professional manner. When professions interact in the delivery of health care services, economic and social factors as well as professional competition or misunderstanding should never be allowed to over ride the fundamental obligation to the patient. There is no place for such distractions in the del ivery of quality health care, nor should the chiropractic profession or the public tolerate prej udice or discrimination in the conduct of health ca re policy at any level.

Economic Considerations III. LITERATURE REVIEW Collaboration can be defined as the reciprocal inte r-professional interaction of two or more health care providers. Collaborative care involves this interaction in the management of the patient' s-170-current health status. Collaborative care, therefo re, includes care in a private practitioner's offic e, where interaction exists on a daily basis between t he practitioner and his/her assistants, as well as care within a complex institutional setting such as a me dical specialty ward in a hospital and care within a managed care setting. Various specialty fields exi st within chiropractic and are available as a resource. Hospitals and other institutional inpatient setting s represent to some degree a new frontier for chiropractic. Chiropractic has an enormous impact to make in this context. As well, hospitals are of great social, political and economic importance in North America. It is here that the largest publicl y- supported concentration of leading-edge diagnostic equipment is to be found. Hospitals are also the scene of the vast majority of clinical information gathering and research. Collaborative care is neither new nor unique to thi s generation of providers, though cooperative relationships between the medical and c hiropractic professions have been less frequent in the past. The federal court judgment in 1987 in Wilk et al. vs. AMA et al., which effectively elim inated formal barriers previously established to the colla boration of the chiropractic and medical profession s, has been a key factor in increasing cooperation. H owever, as greater emphasis is now being placed on the concept of nominating one primary care docto r as a \"gatekeeper\" whose function is to ensure appropriate care yet contain specialist and other c osts, new effort is required to understand the appropriate role of different health disciplines. This is a difficult task for a number of reasons. Firstly, from an organizational viewpoint, much of modern medicine is based on a \"problem- oriented model\" rather than one based either on the management of chronic illness or disease prevention. The problem-oriented model is less con ducive to an interdisciplinary team approach than a \"goal-oriented model\" where the patient's achieve ment of highest possible level of health is the goa l of all concerned. When incorporating chiropractic care into patient c are guidelines, it is always understood that the role of the doctor of chiropractic is separate from other health disciplines and should be present ed as such. Whatever the unique needs of the individu al patient, the objective of chiropractic remains the same. The correction of vertebral subluxations is the goal of chiropractic regardless of whether any other disease or condition is presented. As the doctor of chiropractic participates more and more in other patient care settings, the importance of keeping the body free from subluxatio n is paramount to promoting a return to the patient's full health potential. Through greater u nderstanding of the chiropractic objective by both the patient and collaborating professional, the pursuit of cooperation and quality patient care can be enhanced. Clarity of roles is vital. This clarity is depende nt to some extent on the probability of a successful care outcome and to some extent upon the provider chosen. This should be understood when clinical policies and guidelines are made on d ecision-making in patient management. Dixon has noted that while policies can be helpful in simplif ying complex clinical dilemmas, they have at times been adopted without evidence of benefit and that r esearch studies using appropriate clinical methodology should be encouraged in order to preven t useless or even dangerous algorithms of care. The development of wise patient care guidelines, in corporating the many approaches available in health care today, should provide for the most e ffective balance of resources for the patient's nee ds. Determining the role of each profession in the var ious algorithms for patient management should reflect the varying and unique needs of each indivi dual patient. Developing such algorithms, which are currently not in place nationwide, may reasonab ly be expected to have a significant impact on health outcomes in general, as well as on the diffi cult inter-professional issue of cost-containment. To that end, for example, Wenneberg has stated that pa tients' understanding of their care options is-171-anticipated to be a major contributing factor in th eir care selection. He noted that health care allocation by patient preference is likely to be co st-effective because patients prefer and select les s invasive, less expensive treatments. It is in the best interest, therefore, of all concerned that the health care system have all its professional resources, and ready information on them, available to all patients. Initially, as the chiropractic profession explores the arena of collaborative care more fully, documents generated by practitioners engaging in th is work and setting out inter-professional referral protocols can serve as guidelines. As part of the health care system at large, however, the chiropractic profession must now begin to focus mor e of its resources in researching and developing clinical standards relevant to collaborative care. As noted earlier, such efforts are needed to meet the many and varied needs of all patients. IV. RECOMMENDATIONS A. The Patient and the Primary Care Provider 1.

COMMENTS Professional behavior should be governed by the pri nciples of the philosophy, art and science of chiropractic, and a strict set of ethical canons which go beyond the legal obligations of licensure . Ethical requirements are as compelling and imperat ive to the delivery of quality care as any clinical indications. Interaction between professions in a hospital or ot her institutional setting will be governed by the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction within which the facility operates and the rules and byla ws of the hospital or facility. Recognition of the de gree to which professional roles are specified by s uch regulations should eliminate much of the confusion and concern surrounding the participation of chiropractic practitioners in the hospital setting. In situations where patients need or request diagno stic outpatient services or inpatient care, the practitioner should provide a full and accurate explanation of his/her professional access to such facilities. It is important that degrees of instit utional access be understood by all parties in a collaborative care situation. Under no circumstanc es should any chiropractic practitioner overlook or minimize the need to employ outside services becaus e he/she does not have access, referral or staff privileges at a specific facility. It is incumbent upon the practitioner to find a means to meet pati ent needs on a timely basis, all such considerations no twithstanding. VI.

OVERVIEW The primary objective of a chiropractic practice is to detect, analyze, control, reduce and correct a patient's vertebral subluxation(s) and ot her malpositioned articulations and structures in t he safest and most efficient manner possible. The chi ropractic profession recognizes patient safety as being paramount. The purpose of this chapter is to act as a guide to the practitioner of Chiropractic. It is understood that the taking of a case history and th e performing of an examination is a component part of the chiropractic practice The chiropractic case history and examination are c oncerned with the accumulation of information pertinent to the location and analysis of vertebral subluxation(s) and other malpositioned articulations and structures, in the context of the patient's general health status. Doctors of chirop ractic accept the responsibility to recognize and deal wit h emergencies as defined by the International Red Cross. They also accept the responsibility to info rm the patient of any significant clinical findings . In order for the doctor of chiropractic to initiall y determine the presence, duration, location and type of subluxations present, and to determine whet her the patient is suited for certain types of chiropractic techniques, it is necessary to gather data relative to the patient's health history and s tated concerns. This information will also serve as a b asis for wellness counseling and lifestyle advice. This data is collected during the patient's initial cons ultation and examination. The doctor of chiropractic can begin to interpret t he chiropractic needs of the patient following the initial examination and case history which migh t produce salient points relative to the patient's spinal and general health that may lead the doctor of chiropractic to alter the evaluation of the pati ent. The doctor's findings during the initial case hist ory and examination will establish an initial cours e of care which will be recommended to the patient. The doctor of chiropractic should inform the patien t during the consultation as to the objective of chiropractic care and of the doctor's responsibi lity. II. LIST OF SUBTOPICS A. History 1.

LITERATURE REVIEW/DOCUMENTATION History taking and patient examination are based on principles of elucidating information relative to the patient's health status. Specific literature on the appropriate history and examination techniques for the chiropractic practitioner can be found in numerous texts. The r eader is directed to those texts listed in the bibliography for detailed description of such techn iques. The intent of this chapter is not to serve as a teaching tool. Rather, the purpose is to assist in establishing guidelines related to acceptable hi story techniques to be used by the practitioner. Many journals published for the chiropractic profes sion, including the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics, Chiropractic Technique, Chiropractic Research Journal, Journal of Vertebra l Subluxation Research and Chiropractic Sports Medicine , provide articles on the appropriateness of variou s examination procedures, but there is little informa tion in history taking procedures. The articles rang e from describing the measurement of lumbar range of motion to objectively measuring the strength of the biceps muscle. These articles often reflect on ly one individual's perspective. These considerations increase our need for objective info rmation gained from well-designed research projects. The history-taking procedure has been considered th e most clinically sophisticated and complex task used by health care providers. Its pu rpose is to provide the clinician with one or more diagnostic impressions. These are then confirmed o r altered following the judicious selection of additional tests -- and it can be noted in the lite rature that this process does indeed occur. One st udy determined that a sample group of practitioners det ermined their first hypothesis regarding the diagnosis of a random sample of patients an average of 28 seconds after hearing the chief complaint.-179- The correct hypothesis (which was identified in 75 % of these cases) was found on average within the first six minutes of a half-hour workup. Much of t he information that will lead a clinician to a management plan, then, is gained very early in the doctor/patient interaction. Sandler also emphasized the importance of the histo ry. He found that the percentage of diagnostic completion was as high as 73% after the history and physical examination alone. He suggested that further tests were often unnecessary and costly. Cutler stated that 70%-90% of diagnoses are derived from the history alone. The art and skill of the doctor in the history taking process includes the ability 1) to obtain an approp riate description of the patient's complaints; 2) to elicit data vital of the case that may not have bee n volunteered, and 3) to know that the patient does not have clinically relevant factors that are left unmentioned. These skills can be diminished in a number of ways. Previous experience, while of great value, may result in the clinician prejudging a patient's condition, coming to a conclusion too quickly. Thi s may result in unnecessary testing procedures in ord er to determine that the hypothesis made during the history is incorrect, or may result in an appro priate confirmatory test not being used and the pat ient being treated inappropriately. Further the meaning of words used by the patient may not be the same as that of the practitioner. \"Night pain,\" for exa mple, may signify a pain when resting in bed which has high sensitivity (greater than 0.90) for the detect ion of malignancy; or it might mean that the patie nt wakes up whenever he/she rolls over and that the mo vement irritates an inflamed facet. A practitioner's arbitrary use of professional jargon , and the assumption that the patient understands i t, can lead to further confusion. All of the above are further complicated when the first language of the clinician is not the same as that of the patient. It is perhaps for these reasons that the accuracy o f patient histories has been questioned, and signific ant variability noted. Mishler et. al. state that there are three parameters involved in the interview process: attentiveness, facilitation and collaboration. Att entiveness is defined as the degree to which the practitioner takes the patient's concerns seriously . Facilitation is the encouragement given by the clinician to allow patients to tell their own stori es in their own words, and collaboration is the deg ree to which patients are considered partners in the pr ocess by which they receive care. The literature is sorely lacking with respect to co ntrolled randomized clinical trials directed at measuring reliability and validity of specific hist ory taking procedures. A thorough review of practi tioner reliability studies performed by Koran did not incl ude any studies relating to history taking. Earlie r studies, in which practitioners interviewed differe nt samples of patients drawn from one population, found considerable disagreement in symptom prevalen ce rates. While the chiropractor's history taking is broad an d general, the examination is quite specific and relates to procedures which give information, e ither directly or indirectly, relative to the locat ion and classification of vertebral subluxation(s) and other malpositioned articulations and structures. While vertebral subluxations and other malpositione d articulations and structures may be asymptomatic it is known that they commonly have pe ripheral physiological effects. Therefore, the examination, although heavily concentrated on the s pine may include procedures remote from the spine including ,but not limited to other physical e xamination procedures, clinical laboratory and imaging procedures. Palpation is an intrinsic part of chiropractic. Ut ilization of this procedure should help the examiner to detect abnormalities and therefore deve lop a more thorough assessment of spinal function. Chiropractic colleges place palpation te chniques high on their curricular agendas. Standardized training and protocol for palpation is necessary and should be promoted by the colleges to help improve inter-examiner reliability.-180-The biological/diagnostic sciences, are aids to the decision-making process. This process, however, must take place within the social context of our society. As a result a social interactive component must be recognized and taken into account in order to make appropriate choices during the physical examination and any additional testing procedures. There are several examination styles that are curre ntly recognized. Not all of them are practical in a clinical setting. One is the exhaus tive approach, with the completion of a comprehensi ve series of all tests that may significantly contribu te to determining the diagnosis. A study by Durbri dge, performed in a hospital setting, showed that exhaus tive testing produced no improvement in mortality rate, morbidity, duration of monitoring, disability , medical opinions of the patient's progress or len gth of stay. Another style, the one generally used to obtain the history and perform the physical examination, is the hypothetic-deductive approach. This consists of generating one hypothesis after hearing the patient's chief complaint(s), or severa l possible working hypotheses. The practitioner th en attempts to gather historical and physical informat ion to either support or refute the potential worki ng hypotheses. The goal is to narrow the number of wo rking hypotheses to one. The physical examination, while apparently objectiv e, is no less riddled with social issues than the history. It has been noted that the assessment of the observer, instructions given to the patient , and sincerity of response are important. When, for example, an almost 30% difference is found in the sensitivity of a test such as sensory loss used to help diagnose a herniated lumbar nucleus pulposis for two different samples, it is difficult to know if the difference lies in the test itself or in the doctor-patient relationship. The more motivated pa tients are, the more likely they are to fairly represent their maximum capacity on a physical perf ormance test. The less anxious patients are, the more likely they are to reach forward despite their pain. Cooperman et al attempted to assess inter-tester an d intra-tester reliability and validity of Lachman's test in determining the integrity of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). They found the t est judgments had limited reliability. They were more reliable for predicting absence of ACL injury than the presence of ACL injury. Another study analyzing a sample of patients with o bjectively determined anterior cruciate ligament test or chondral damage found patients wer e not correctly diagnosed using a battery of usual orthopedic tests. Under anesthesia, however, Lachm an's test proved to be highly sensitive and specific. This suggests that even in the face of w ell-performed maneuvers, compensatory defense reactions from soft tissue may prevent stressing th e targeted tissues in the manner necessary for adequate diagnosis. Mieraue et. al. determined that the correlation betwe en straight leg raising (SLR) and low back pain may be poor when evaluating children and adole scents with the exception of male adolescents with a history of low back pain. When evaluating v arious populations it has been observed that ipsilateral SLR is a highly sensitive indicator (72 %-97%) of lumbar disc herniation, and contralateral SLR is highly specific for the same condition (88%- 100%). Brunarski evaluated two physical measurements, plum bline analysis and lateral bending dynamic roentgenograms. These two measures demonstr ated greater predictive value and accuracy in differentiating patients with myofascial pain fr om asymptomatic patients than sacroiliac motion palpation and straight leg raising. LeBoeuf evaluated eight different orthopedic tests and found that only one (heel to buttock-181-test) had predictive value for low-back pain. Orth opedic tests that appeared to strain several adjace nt anatomical structures were commonly positive. This may indicate that these tests have poor discriminative ability. Three common cervical orthopedic tests used to dete rmine the presence of cervical disc disease were evaluated as they related to radicular , neurologic and radiologic signs. Neck compression, axial manual traction and shoulder abd uction tests were found to be highly specific for radicular pain, neurologic and radiologic signs. D espite their low sensitivity, these tests were deem ed valuable in the clinical examination of a patient w ith neck and arm pain. In the presence of a negati ve finding from an accepted test, a practitioner needs to recognize that many tests have low sensitivity. In conclusion, much of the basis of history taking and performing a physical examination stems from clinical experience rather than scientific dat a. This experience first starts at the college level w ith a good understanding of the basic sciences and later through clinical experience under the tut elage of experienced practitioners in the college clinic. After graduation the practitioner will con tinue to gain experience through practice, continui ng education programs, and consulting with other pract itioners. As clinicians we must remain flexible in our approa ch to the patient, and recognize consultative procedures that may assist in establishing an effec tive working diagnosis. IV. RECOMMENDATIONS A.

References-188--189-I. OVERVIEW The health care record serves many important functi ons and is one of the critical components of the health care delivery system. The most impor tant function is in the immediate care and care of the patient. The record also permits different mem bers of a health care team, or successive health care providers, to have access to relevant data con cerning the patient to see what procedures have been performed and with what results. The health c are record is important for documenting the specific services received by the patient so that t he provider can be reimbursed for them. Records should be maintained in a manner that makes them su itable for utilization review. The health record is helpful in the evaluation of practitioners, prov ides data for public health purposes, and may be us ed for the purpose of teaching and research. It is cr itical in a variety of legal contexts, including li tigation by patients and malpractice claims. Construction of an adequate patient chart involves the accumulation of essential information from the patient by interview, use of questionnaire s, examination and special studies. There should also be transfer of pertinent information where ava ilable from previous or other care given to the patient. This chapter describes the documents, int ernal and external, that are used to arrive at a diagnosis, to determine and document necessity of c are, and to provide a foundation for the chiropractic care plan. The chapter also discusses appropriate patient consents and other legal disclosures. Once the initial patient work-up has been completed , all record/chart entries should be made in a systematic, organized and contemporaneous mann er. Recommendations on what constitutes necessary information to be contained in the day-to -day patient record are offered. The information contained in such records provides a foundation for writing accurate reports to other health care providers, insurance companies, attorneys and other interested parties. The practitioner is encouraged to use a charting system that is effecti ve and complete, yet practical and efficient. The organization of the patient chart may be enhanc ed by using pre-printed forms and by having proper identifying information on each page. Minimum recommendations for legibility and clarit y of chart entries are offered. The importance of co nfidentiality and professional courtesy with respec t to patient records is emphasized and guidelines are offered. Patient consent may be implied or expressed, depend ing upon the circumstances. Where it is expressed, it may be obtained either verbally or in writing. Often the process is facilitated by t he use of pre-printed forms completed and signed by involv ed parties then kept as part of the health record as evidence of the consent process. The practition er is encouraged to consult with legal counsel for proper document design and application. Less commo n forms of consent are various forms of diagnosis waivers and consent to participate in res earch. In recent years, some public reimbursement programs , notably Medicare, are requiring that patients be informed before care is administered th at the federal program may determine that they will not pay for a service, regardless of clinical neces sary. Doctors of chiropractic may seek the patient 's acknowledgement of this possibility on a waiver for m before a Medicare patient receives chiropractic services. At the discretion of the practitioner chiropractic records might include specific notations concerning the exact mode or modes of adjustive pro cedures used on each visit to help determine the outcome assessment of adjustive correction relative to the techniques applied. Such information may be helpful in the context of continued wellness car e.-190-II. LIST OF SUBTOPICS A.

LITERATURE REVIEW The literature search for this topic was accomplish ed through the use of CLIBCON indexing, referencing subject headings pertinent to the scope of the chapter. Other information was obtained through retrieval from personal libraries of committee members and advisors, especially with respect to recently published papers and monog raphs. Much of the published literature on health record d ocumentation and patient consents is either found in guidebooks, usually with significan t contribution from the legal profession, or in popular publications containing sections dedicated to legal advice. Since 1979 there has been little information published on these topics in the chiropractic peer reviewed journals. A notable exception is the Journal of the Canadian Chiropract ic Association which is refereed but also serves-191-as an important conduit of such information to asso ciation members. Probably the richest technical source of informatio n relative to documentation and patient consents is found in legal publications. The legal standard found in these publications is supported with citation of case law. Publications su ch as this are not easily accessed by the average practitioner in the field, nor are they ava ilable in all chiropractic college libraries. The profession must rely on its legal consultants to as sist in review of such literature. IV. RECOMMENDATIONS Disclaimer -- These guidelines may necessarily be superseded by s tatutory law in respective state or provincial jurisdictions. They do not purport to convey legal advice. It is recommended that each practitioner should obtain hi s/her own independent legal advice. A. Internal Documentation (Records generated within the chiropractor's office .) 1. The Patient File When a new patient enters the office, a file is cre ated which becomes the foundation of the patient's permanent record. Adequate systems may include personal patient data (e.g., name, address, phone numbers, age, sex, occupation); insurance and billing information; appropriate assignments and co nsent forms; case history; examination findings; imaging and laboratory findin gs; diagnosis; work chart for recording ongoing patient data obtained on each vis it; the service rendered; health care plan; copies of insurance billings; reports; c orrespondence; case identification (e.g., by number) for easy storage and retrieval of patient's documents, etc. 8.1.1 Rating: Necessary Evidence: Class I, II, III A folder is used to house most of the patient's rec ords. This may also be part of the record, if the practitioner writes patient data on the folder, such as patient personal information or x-ray/examination care plan data. T he practitioner may attach a patient work chart to the inside of the folder alon g with the other items in the patient's file. On periodic file review, outdated portions may be removed and stored in an archive file. A permanent note should be kep t in the active file indicating that the patient has additional records. 8.1.2 Rating: Recommended Evidence: Class II, III Doctor/Clinic Identification Basic information identifying the practitioner or f acility should appear on documents used to establish the doctor-patient relationship. This can be pre-printed on forms, affixed by rubber stamp or adhesive labels or typed or handwritten in ink.

Man y of these instruments are used in a repeated or serial fashion, which makes i t essential for the record to identify the date(s) of completion and name(s) of s coring practitioner/technician. Measurement instruments currently in use include: visual analog scale pain diagrams pain questionnaires (e.g., McGill) pain disability instruments (e.g., Oswestry, Neck D isability Index) health status indices (e.g., SF-36, Sickness Impact Profile) patient satisfaction indices other outcome measures 8.1.12 Rating: Recommended Evidence: Class I, II, III Clinical Impression Upon completion of the subjective and objective dat a base, the practitioner formulates a clinical impression. This may be prel iminary only, and may comprise more than one clinical finding. This clinical impr ession should be recorded within the file or in the contemporaneous visit record. T he doctor of chiropractic should seek to relate any abnormal findings to the presenc e of vertebral subluxation(s). As the clinical impression may change with new clinica l information or in response to care, it is important that each clinical impression be dated. The record may include: primary, secondary and/or tertiary elements of diag nosis/analysis appropriate diagnostic coding 8.1.13 Rating: Recommended Evidence: Class I, II, III Care Plan This arises from the accumulation of clinical data and the formulation of the initial clinical impression. The plan may include further diagnostic work to monitor progress, or an intervention trial to test clinical impressions and assess appropriateness of adjustive procedures selected. The care plan documents the approach to management by the practitioner and staf f (e.g., spinal adjusting, recommended exercise regime, lifestyle and dietary modifications). Any plan for referral to or consultation with other health care providers is appropriately listed in the record. The written care plan may appear on a form dedicated to the clinical work-up, or in the contemporaneous visit record, an d may include: subluxation findings analysis/reassessment plan practitioner's care plan (modes and frequency of ca re) patient's education and self-care plan intra- or interdisciplinary referral or consultatio n Recommended Evidence: Class I, II, III Chart/Progress Notes-195-Once the initial patient work-up has been completed , all record entries should be made in a systematic organized manner. 8.1.15 Rating: Necessary Clinical Information. The patient's records must b e sufficiently complete to provide reasonable information requested by a subsequent he alth care provider, insurance company, and/or attorney (e.g., progress notes, SOA P notes, SORE notes when/where applicable). A dated record of what occ urred on each visit, and any significant changes in the clinical picture or asse ssment or care plan need to be noted. The method in which chart notes are recorde d is a matter of preference for each practitioner. 8.1.16 Rating: Recommended Evidence: Class I, II, III There are many different chiropractic adjusting/man ual techniques. It is important to record what area was adjusted. The doctor may a lso find it helpful to note the type of adjustive procedures utilized. 8.1.17 Rating: Recommended Evidence: Class II, III Anyone other than the attending practitioner who en ters data into the contemporaneous chart must initial the entry. 8.1.18 Rating: Recommended Evidence: Class I, II, III Re-examination/Reassessment: (See Chapter 10) Relevant information from every reassessment and re -examination should be recorded in the patient file. 8.1.19 Rating: Necessary Evidence: Class I, II, III Financial Records The precise information obtained and the means of s torage and retrieval are at the discretion of the chiropractor. 8.1.20 Rating: Discretionary Evidence: Class III External Documentation External documentation includes all records arising from outside the practitioner's office, but also includes any communication with th ird parties. Direct Correspondence-196-Correspondence in the form of letters or memoranda that leave the office should have information identifying the practitioner and/o r clinic, address, and telephone number and be contemporaneously dated. A copy must always be kept on file. introductory letter(s) to or from referring practit ioner (DC, MD, etc.) general correspondence to or from other practitione rs general correspondence to or from attorney(s) general correspondence to or from patient general correspondence to or from various payer gro ups 8.2.1 Rating: Recommended Evidence: Class II, III Health Records pertinent copies of health records from previous or concurrent health care providers special consultative reports reports of special diagnostic studies 8.2.2 Rating: Recommended Evidence: Class II, III Diagnostic Imaging (See Chapter 13) When indicated and appropriate to chiropractic case management, a reasonable attempt should be made to obtain recent x-rays (or copies) relevant to the presenting problem of the patient, and summarize an d record pertinent information. Copies of external radiology reports. 8.2.3 Rating: Recommended Evidence: Class II, III External Reports Frequently a practitioner will be requested to writ e various reports. The information for these reports comes from patient records. Adeq uate reporting usually requires the practitioner to review the patient's history, e xamination findings, care procedures, progress notes/work chart and other rep orts that may have been written together with records from other health car e providers that have treated or evaluated the patient. There are many types of rep orts that serve various needs. There are many acceptable styles and formats. 8.2.4 Rating: Recommended Evidence: Class II, III Chart/File Organization General Considerations Records should be kept in chronological order and e ntered as contemporaneously as possible. They should not be backdated or alter ed. Corrections or additions should be dated and initialed. The chart or file s hould be fully documented and contain all relevant, objective information; extran eous information should not be-197-included. The record must be complete enough to pr ovide the practitioner with information required for subsequent patient care or reporting to outside parties. 8.3.1 Rating: Necessary Evidence: Class I, II, III Use of Pre-Printed Forms The use of forms can assist in tasks such as obtain ing case history, noting examination findings and charting case progress. U se of forms is at the discretion of the individual practitioner but should favor com prehensiveness and completeness rather than brevity. 8.3.2 Rating: Discretionary Evidence: Class II, III Legibility and Clarity Health records should be neat, organized and comple te. Entries in charts should be written in ink. Entries must not be erased or a ltered with correction fluid (whiteout) or tape or adhesive labels, etc. If the contents of any document are changed, the practitioner should initial and date s uch changes in the corresponding margin. 8.3.3 Rating: Necessary Evidence: Class I, II Use of Abbreviations/Symbols Use of abbreviations or coding can save record spac e and time. A legend of the codes or abbreviations should appear on the form or be available in the office in order that another practitioner or interested perso n can interpret and use the information. The legend can also be used for intra -office communications and as a dictation aid. 8.3.4 Rating: Recommended Evidence: Class II, III Maintenance of Records Confidentiality The rule of confidentiality requires that all infor mation about a patient gathered by a practitioner as any part of the doctor-patient rela tionship be kept confidential unless its release is authorized by the patient or is comp elled by law. The rule is an ethical responsibility as well as a legal one. Assurance o f confidentiality is necessary if individuals are to be open and forthright with the practitioner. Patients rightly expect that such information as their health will r emain private and secure from public scrutiny. Thus the principle that all docto r-patient communications are privileged and confidential. 8.4.1 Rating: Necessary Evidence: Class I, II Records Retention and Retrieval-198-Health records should be retained, and in a way tha t facilitates retrieval. To the extent possible, they should be kept in a centraliz ed location. In most circumstances, recent records are maintained on pre mises either as hard copy or electronically, and after a period of time can be a rchived, microfilmed or stored on CD-rom, etc, and placed in storage. The length of time that records, in whatever form, must be kept varies. Many states/provinces h ave legislated minimum periods of time for retention of health records, usually be tween 4 to 15 years. When the decision is made to dispose of health records, the manner of disposal must protect patient confidentiality. If a chiropractic office closes or changes ownership, secure retention of the health record must be ensured. 8.4.2 Rating: Necessary Evidence: Class I, II Legibility and Clarity Health records should be neat, organized and comple te. Entries in charts should be written in ink. Entries must not be erased or a ltered with correction fluid (whiteout) or tape or adhesive labels, etc. If the contents of any document are changed, the practitioner should initial and date s uch changes in the corresponding margin. 8.4.3 Rating: Necessary Evidence: Class I, II Use of Abbreviations/Symbols Use of abbreviations or coding can save record spac e and time. A legend of the codes or abbreviations should appear on the form or be available in the office in order that another practitioner or interested perso n can interpret and use the information. The legend can also be used for intra -office communications and as a dictation aid. 8.4.4 Rating: Recommended Evidence: Class II, III Even when legal time limits have elapsed, it is adv isable to continue to retain records because of the valuable information they contain. 8.4.5 Rating: Discretionary Evidence: Class III Administrative Records Administrative records are primarily those relating to the non-clinical side of practice, but there is some overlap into the doctor /patient relationship. Examples of administrative records may include: telephone logs , schedule and record of appointments, patient personal data information, in surance forms and billing, collection and patient billing, routine corresponde nce, a record filing system that makes for accurate retrieval of patient data. Thes e records must be maintained in a legible and retrievable format.-199-8.4.6 Rating: Necessary Evidence: Class I, II, III Records Transfer It is mandatory that health care data (excluding da ta and reports from outside sources) requested by another provider currently tr eating a present or former patient be forwarded upon receipt of an appropriate request and patient consent. In some jurisdictions, this duty to forward informa tion to another treating health professional is imposed by statute also. However, even in the absence of a statutory requirement a practitioner has a responsi bility to comply with such a request, and as expeditiously as possible. 8.4.7 Rating: Necessary Evidence: Class I, II, III Clinic Staff Responsibilities The practitioner is responsible for staff actions re garding record keeping and consent forms, and for assuring that administrative tasks are handled correctly and promptly. Any employee involved in the preparation , organization, or filing of records should fully understand professional and le gal requirements, including the rules of confidentiality. 8.4.8 Rating: Necessary Evidence: Class I, II, III Patient Consents Informed Consent/Consent to Administer Care - Gener ally Patient consent to the provision of care is always necessary. It is often implied rather than expressed. However, where there is ris k of significant harm from the care proposed, this risk must be disclosed, understo od, and accepted by the patient. Such informed consent is required for eth ical and legal reasons. The best record of consent is one that is objectively docume nted. 8.5.1 Rating: Necessary Evidence: Class I, II, III Consent to Administer Care - Competence A patient must be competent to give consent to care . The care of minors (age of majority varies from 14 to 21 according to jurisdic tion) and mentally incompetent adults requires the prior consent of a guardian in most circumstances. This should not be interpreted to prevent a doctor of chiroprac tic from rendering emergency care. 8.5.2 Rating: Necessary Evidence: I, II, III Authorization to Release Patient Information With the consent of a competent patient or guardian , records may, and in most-200-situations must, be provided to third parties with a legitimate need for access. The patient consent should not be more than 90 days old , or as provided by law. Whenever health care information is released pursua nt to authorization from a patient, documentation of the authorization should be requested and retained (except in some emergencies). If the request is fo r all or part of the health care record, the original record should never be release d, unless compelled by law, only copies. Before the copy chart or other records are sent out, they should be reviewed to make certain they are complete. 8.5.3 Rating: Necessary Evidence: Class I, II, III Financial Assignments While financial data is important for the business function of a health care facility, and such records are indeed part of the health care record, the information obtained and the method of acquiring such informati on is at the discretion of the practitioner. Any alteration of standard fees char ged necessitates documentation (e.g., in cases of financial hardship). 8.5.4 Rating: Discretionary Evidence Class III Consent to Participate in Research When a practitioner engages in research, the ethica l basis of the doctor-patient relationship changes to an investigator-subject int eraction. The new relationship must meet a new set of criteria different from clin ical practice. If a patient is requested to participate in a research study or pro ject, the request must be accompanied by informed consent that meets the mini mum request for the protection of human subjects as established by comp etent authorities (e.g., NIH/NSF or state/provincial law). 8.5.5 Rating: Necessary Evidence: Class I, II, III Publication/Photo/Video Consent All records from which a patient may be identified (e.g., photographs, videotapes, audio-tapes) should only be created once consent ha s been obtained. Such consents should identify the purposes of the record and the circumstances under which it will be released. Records for clinical management 8.5.6 Rating: Recommended Evidence: Class I, II, III VI. COMMENTS This chapter presents guidelines for the chiropract ic profession in with regard to creation and maintenance of a patient chart/file. Fundament al training of the practitioner in charting skills exists in the education process, but reinforcement of the need for quality records must come through published literature, postgraduate seminars and risk management efforts. Unreasonably burdensome, record keeping in contemporary health c are can take time away from the important doctor/patient relationship.-201-Today there is a heightened awareness of the need f or good records because of accountability of all practitioners in managed care , intra-professional peer review, interactive claim s management and an increasingly litigious society. This rapid expansion of clinician accountability underscores the need for mature systems, and dissem ination of information on record-keeping throughout the chiropractic profession. It will be important for the sponsoring organizations of this consensus meeting on standards of practice to take the lead in the dissemination process. VII.

OVERVIEW This chapter will consider the use of the concepts of a \"clinical impression,\" \"chiropractic diagnosis,\" and \"analysis\" in the practice of practic. The application of diagnosis in chiropractic prac tice, the perspective of the practitioner relative to chiropractic diagnosis, and the diagnos tic responsibility of the practitioner vary with r espect to state laws, board regulations, and court rulings . While the exact language may vary, it is clear, how ever, that the practitioner is dealing with the process of conveying the salient findings of his or her examination relative to the patient in questio n. The consequence of the chiropractic diagnosis, cli nical impression, or analysis impacts directly on t he management of the patient. Protocols and guidelines for quality assurance and standards of practice are expressed and understood within historical, legal and professiona l perspectives of the profession. In addition, standards must be developed to reflect the advancem ent in the quality of chiropractic care, the protection of the patient and the continuing proces s of assessment of effectiveness. Appropriate interpretation of a patient's case hist ory and examination must be made to determine if the patient has a chiropractic problem and if so, to formulate an appropriate protocol fo r corrective care developing a clinical impression do ne by integrating and analyzing the patient's histo ry and examination findings. Guidelines for clinical impressions need to be esta blished to distinguish chiropractic evaluation and care from that employed in other health care di sciplines. II. LIST OF SUBTOPICS 1. Necessity 2.

LITERATURE REVIEW Information regarding the evolution of concepts of diagnosis, clinical impressions, or analysis has been available from the writings of early chiro practic pioneers [Palmer, D.D.; Palmer, B.J., Firth ] through to current chiropractic experts. It has al so been described in a legislative framework. Chiropractic Analysis The concept of chiropractic analysis as something u nique and distinct from a medical diagnosis was expressed as early as 1910 by Palmer and 1916 b y Firth. The term has continued to be used in- 2 0 5 -this way by the profession. The commonality in its use is based on the concept that structure, primar ily the spine, affects function. Chiropractic analysis includes evaluation of the structural and function al components of the subluxation and their relation to the clinical status of the patient. Chiropractic analysis can also be viewed in more ge neral terms as the process of reaching a clinical impression or chiropractic diagnosis. Thi s incorporates the complete art of clinical decisio n- making. Chiropractic Diagnosis Chiropractic practice is universally recognized as a portal of entry into the health care system which individual patients may access without referr al from any other professional. In light of this f act, the chiropractic practitioner is charged with certa in responsibilities, legal and professional, and possess certain rights and privileges shared by all doctors. The courts have not concerned themselves with which words a practitioner elects t o use to describe a diagnostic situation but to ins ure that the provider strives to protect the public. T herefore the issue of diagnosis, clinical impressio n, or analysis is paramount for the reason that it is nec essary prior to the implementation of an appropriat e plan of care. The purpose of a chiropractic diagnosis as describe d in legislative acts, government commission hearings and the literature is twofold: 1) to identify the problem to determine if it is amenable to chiropractic care; and 2) to determine if the patient should be referred. Application of Chiropractic Diagnostic and Analytic al Concepts Williams, Slosberg, Winterstein, and Masarsky and Web er have all attempted to address the question of the role of diagnosis from the point of view of the practicing chiropractor. Harrison and Sportelli, et. al., have addressed the issue from the perspective of legal necessity as a component of legal defense. Herfert has addressed the question fr om the perspective of the relationship with third party payers. It is clear that all of these authors advocate acce ptance of the diagnostic responsibility of the chiropractic profession. The concern remains for t he appropriate use of language and the context of a diagnostic statement. Choice of language -- diag nosis, clinical impression, analysis or assessment -- reflects the clinician's philosophical construct s. There is however, uniformity regarding the need for appropriate, responsible steps to be taken on the p atients' behalf, regardless of the paradigm, to establish the clinical findings of each individual practitioner. It is the right of the patient to re ceive an appropriate evaluation and statement of their probl em as a prerequisite for delivery of care. The ethical, moral, legal and professional responsi bility of a chiropractic practitioner does not change with the terminology used to express his or her clinical findings. The practitioner is require d to assess the patient on presentation and respond t o the clinical situation in a manner consistent wit h the best interests of the patient and the practitio ner's clinical judgment. IV. RECOMMENDATIONS The analytic procedures employed in the chiropracti c assessment may include, but are not limited to, the following: Physical Exams:- 2 0 6 -Palpation (Static osseous, Static muscle, Motion) Range of motion Postural Comparative leg length (Static, Flexed, Cervical sy ndrome) Manual muscle test Nerve function tests Vital signs Instrumentation Exam: Range of motion (see Chapter 14) Thermography (see Chapter 14) Temperature-reading instrument (see Chapter 14) Muscle testing (see Chapter 14) Electromyography (see Chapter 14) Pressure algometry (see Chapter 14) Nerve-function tests (see Chapter 14) Imaging Exam: Spinography (see Chapter 13) Videoflouroscopy (see Chapter 13) Computerized Tomography (see Chapter 13) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (see Chapter 13) Clinical Laboratory Urinalysis Blood tests (serum, whole blood, components, etc.) A. Necessity Arrival at a clinical impression or diagnosis, or d iagnostic conclusion or analysis, is a necessary outcome of the patient encounter. Comment: The responsibility of a chiropractic prac titioner does not change with the terminology used to describe clinical findings. Th e practitioner is required to assess the patient upon the presentation and respond to th e clinical situation in a manner consistent with the best interests of the patient, the practitioner's clinical judgment, and the law of the jurisdiction in question. 9.1.1. Rating : Necessary Evidence: Class I, II, III Consensus Level: 1 B. Initial Responsibility Determining Appropriateness of Care: The doctor of chiropractic is responsible for determining the presence of vertebral subluxation a nd other malpositioned articulations and structures and to recommend a plan of care to r educe vertebral subluxation and other malpositioned articulations and structures. T he chiropractor should make an assessment of the patient's initial clinical situat ion consistent with the patient's best interest and the attending doctor's clinical judgme nt. The doctor of chiropractic should be expected to re cognize and respond to emergency- 2 0 7 -situations, as defined by the International Red Cro ss, and inform the patient of any unusual findings during examination/evaluation. 9.2.1 Rating : Strong positive recommendation Evidence: E, L Consensus Level: 1 C. Subsequent Responsibility After the initial evaluation has been completed the practitioner begins a series of differentiations that result in many clinical decis ions being implemented. This process is not an end in itself, but merely designates susp ected conditions that become the focus for prognostic judgements, further assessment and patient management. Initiation of chiropractic care, additional studies , referral with or without continuing chiropractic care and cessation of chiropractic car e are possible. 9.3.1 Rating : Necessary Evidence: Class I, II, III Consensus Level: 1 D. Terminology The terminology utilized to describe a clinical imp ression, chiropractic diagnosis, clinical finding, conclusion, or analysis should be consiste nt with appropriate usage in chiropractic. If a practitioner is required to use specific terminology, or is prohibited from the use of such terminology by law, then that legal requirement is the guiding factor. 9.4.1. Rating : Recommended Evidence: Class II, III Consensus Level: 1 E. Content Patients may have various conditions/symptoms/findi ngs that result in a number of unrelated clinical impressions. Secondary diagnosis should be prioritized and addressed as needed and may be of greater clinical consequence to the patient. 9.5.1 Rating : Recommended Evidence: Class II, III Consensus Level: 1 The clinical impression, chiropractic diagnosis, cl inical finding or analysis should reflect a classification scheme that consists of statements reflective of severity, region, and organ/tissue involvement. 9.5.2 Rating : Recommended Evidence: Class II, III Consensus Level: 1 Once a clinical assessment has been completed the d octor of chiropractic may elect to evaluate the patient on each visit. This evaluatio n is to determine the specific care for that visit and then to render care as appropriate. The doctor of chiropractic should employ a minimum of one analytical procedure on each visit.- 2 0 8 -Modification in technique or evaluation procedures should be undertaken as necessary. Reassessment and reevaluations should be performed as the clinical need dictates and should be compared to the initial assessment. 9.5.3 Rating : Strong positive recommendation Evidence: E, L Consensus Level: 1 F. Process When additional confirmatory tests are required to establish the clinical impression, diagnosis, diagnostic conclusion, or analysis, these studies s hould completed in as timely and efficient a manner as possible. Practitioners may perform su ch procedures consistent with their qualifications and the law, or they may seek to hav e such procedures performed by other qualified parties. 9.6.1 Rating : Recommended Evidence: Class I, II, III Consensus Level: 1 Where procedures relevant to a diagnosis, clinical impression, diagnostic conclusion, or analysis are not within the qualifications or compe tence of a practitioner, the practitioner should make appropriate consultations with others. 9.6.2 Rating : Recommended Evidence: Class I, II, III Consensus Level: 1 It is the responsibility of the attending doctor of chiropractic to be knowledgeable of and consistent with the methodology of his/her chosen a nalytic/technical approaches, to maintain a system to execute the effectiveness of his/her pr ocedures and to maintain a high degree of technical excellence. 9.6.3 Rating : Strong positive recommendation Evidence: E, L Consensus Level: 1 The clinical impression, diagnosis, diagnostic conc lusion, or analysis should be recorded in the patient's record and qualified as to its certainty. 9.6.4 Rating : Necessary Evidence: Class I, II, III Consensus Level: 1 G. Dynamics The clinical impression, diagnosis, diagnostic conc lusion, or analysis should be a working hypothesis that may change over time, given additio nal information and/or changes in condition of the patient. 9.7.1. Rating : Necessary Evidence: Class I, II, III- 2 0 9 -Consensus Level: 1 H. Communication The practitioner should communicate the diagnosis o r clinical impression or diagnostic conclusion or analysis, and its significance, to th e patient in understandable terms, and convey such findings to other providers or agencies as the patient requests and consents to, or as the law requires. 9.8.1. Rating : Necessary Evidence: Class I, II, III Consensus Level: 1 It is the responsibility of the doctor of chiroprac tic to educate patients as to the significance and consequence of vertebral subluxation. The chiropra ctor may communicate the causes, if possible, and the rationale for the detection and r eduction of vertebral subluxation. 9.8.2. Rating : Strong Positive recommendation Evidence: E, L Consensus Level: 1 I. Patient Representation The reason the patient initially consults a doctor of chiropractic should be recorded in the patient record. The reason or patient symptomatolo gy may direct the doctor of chiropractic to select or modify his/her adjusting procedures du ring the gathering of information process. 9.9.1.

References-212--213-I. OVERVIEW This chapter provides a topical summary of typical chiropractic procedures in current use. Most chiropractic named technique procedures consis t of a combination of various analytic and care components. This chapter does not serve to review and pass judgement on any particular named technique system as a whole. Indeed, the Board of Directors of the International Chiropractors Association has stated, as a matter of official ICA policy, that: \"Doctors of chiropractic should be f ree to apply any chiropractic technique in which they are appropriately trained, to meet the needs of the patient.\" The choice of technique is an integral p art of the discretion reserved to the judgement of the attending doctor. Procedures are presented and ratings are made bas ed on current available information and expert opinion. Clinical practice and scientific i nvestigation are ongoing processes and it is unders tood that this document is a dynamic entity that will re quire modifications as new knowledge becomes available. There are three basic types of techniqu es, segmental, postural and tonal. Many of the techniques fall within more than one of these categ ories Although this chapter does not include every possib le chiropractic technique or procedure, an overall categorization of chiropractic approaches i s presented. In addition, a more elaborate classification system is presented here for the non -manual chiropractic procedures. II. LIST OF SUBTOPICS A. Use of ineffective or unsafe mode of care B.

LITERATURE The literature reveals that there are many articles on adjusting modes, largely written by-214-technical researchers and chiropractic college facu lty. The majority of articles are, therefore, expository and educational and show a wide ranging interest in and discussion of the modes of care in chiropractic. Specific literature on named chiropractic technique s has traditionally been proprietary and procedurally oriented. In addition, it has rarely been peer reviewed or indexed, which makes access difficult. This problem has been addressed in rece nt years by the chiropractic profession primarily through three vehicles. Firstly, the Journal of Chiropractic Technique was established to provide a forum for articles relevant to chiropractic procedures. Secondly, a n umber of discussions, position papers and round tables have been sponsored by professional associat ions. The Consortium for Chiropractic Research, in collaboration with the Council on Technique and others, held a series of consensus conferences attended by technique teachers, academicians, chiro practic researchers, and private practitioners. See, for example, the proceedings of the 1990 Seat tle Consensus Conference (Bergman 1990). Thirdly, a sophisticated standards of care project has been undertaken jointly by the RAND Corporation, the Consortium for Chiropractic Resear ch, and the Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research (Shekelle, et al., 1991a, Shekelle, et al., 1991b). Kent and Vernon have developed perhaps the best sum mary of the matter of categorizing technique procedures as tonal, postural or segmenta l. In their text, Case Studies in Chiropractic MRI , they write: Cooperstein described two broad approaches to chiro practic technique, the segmental approach and the postural approach. Murphy2added a third, the tonal approach. These conceptual models determine the nature of the analy tical procedures employed, the type of adjustments applied, and the criteria for determini ng the success or failure of a given intervention. A summary of each follows: 1. The segmental model . Subluxation is described in terms of alterations in specific intervertebral motion segments. I n segmen tal approaches, the involved motion segments may be identified by radiographic procedur es which assess intesegmental dis- relationships, or by clinical examination procedure s such as motion palpation. Examples of segmental approaches are the Gonstead and Diversifi ed techniques. 2. Postural approaches. In postural approaches, subluxation is seen as a po stural distortion. Practitioners of postural approaches e valuated \"global\" subluxations using postural analysis and radiographic techniques which evaluate d spinal curves and their relationship to the spine as a whole. Examples of techniques empha sizing a postural approach are Pettibon Spinal Biomechanics and Applied Spinal Bio-engineer ing. 3. Tonal approaches. In 1910, D.D. Palmer wrote: Life is an expression o f tone. Tone is the normal degree of nerve tension. Tone i s expressed in function by normal elasticity, strength, and excitability...the cause of disease i s any variation in tone. Tonal approaches tend to view the spine and nervous system as a func tional unit. Tonal approaches emphasize the importance of functional outcomes, and acknowle dge that clinical objectives may be achieved using a variety of adjusting methods. Exa mples of tonal approaches include Network Spinal Analysis and Torque-release Technique. In reviewing the preceding basic science and clinic al models of the subluxation, it may be seen that the wide diversity of techniques in ch iropractic may use different methods, but generally share the common objective of correcting spinal nerve interference caused by vertebral subluxation. Commonality and accountabil ity may be achieved through the-215-development of models which emphasize clinical outc omes yet afford the practitioner flexibility in determining how those objectives are achieved. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to, evidence of functional integrity of the nervous system, and improvement in general health and quality of life indicators. Research resources should be directed toward the development of models and clinical strategies which result in m ore predictable and more efficient practice procedures. IV. RECOMMENDATIONS 1.

Manual Reflex and Muscle Relaxation Procedures 1. Muscle Energy Techniques: A variety of procedure s fall under this classification including post-facilitation stretch, post-isometric relaxation, and reciprocal inhibition, among others. In addition, there are several chiro practic techniques that use procedures mechanically and physiologically similar to these as part of their therapeutic armamentarium. The rationale for such procedures is based on the concept of reciprocal innervation and inhibition be tween agonist and antagonist muscles. Care is directed at finding such sites an d having the patient do movements and muscle contractions, typically against some kin d of active resistance in order to cause a relaxation of a hypertonic muscle. These t echniques are commonly in use and are the subject of much investigation. 10.3.1 Rating : Established Evidence: Class II, III 2. Myofascial Ischemic Compression Procedures: Isch emic compression involves placing a sustained compressive force on a tight or contrac ted muscle. This is thought to relax the muscle and thereby reduce stress to any joints to which the muscle is attached. The chiropractic profession has employed myofascia l ischemic compression procedures and other soft tissue procedures as part of a care regimen for a long time (e.g., Receptor-tonus Technique, myofascial trigger point therapy). 10.3.2 Rating : Established Evidence: Class II, III 3. Miscellaneous Soft Tissue Techniques: There are many different kinds of muscle work in widespread use. They involve applying manual pr essure in order to relieve muscle spasm. Some common techniques of muscle work inclu de: massage (superficial, effleurage, petrissage, percussion), pressure point work (accupressure and shiatsu),-217-and deep tissue techniques (Rolfing). There is lit tle controversy regarding the clinical utility of such procedures for relaxation and uncom plicated musculoskeletal dysfunction. However, comparative clinical investi gations are sparse. Light massage has occasionally been used as a placebo control in manipulation studies. 10.3.3 Rating : Established Evidence: Class II, III 4. Non-Manual Procedures a. Exercise and Rehabilitation (1) Mobility and Stretching Exercise : Activity mobility maintenance and stretching by the patient are traditionally encoura ged in chiropractic practice. Training, counseling and advice in stret ching and mobility exercises are common, and various descriptions of c hiropractic programs exist in the literature. Trials on exerci se in chiropractic settings have not been published, but there is func tion and performance information available in exercise physi ology and sports medicine literature. 10.4.1 Rating : Established Evidence: Class I, II, III (2) Strengthening, Conditioning and Rehabilitation: Active conditioning exercise is thought to be helpful for both healing and prevention of many mechanical back and neck problems. Conditioni ng and spinal stabilization programs are becoming more common for chiropractic management of low-back conditions. In addition, nu merous programs are in place that involve job stimulation and work hardening protocols that are directed at chiropractic management and co nditioning for specific tasks. 10.4.2 Rating : Established Evidence: Class I, II, III (3) Passive Stretch: Passive stretch is gentle sustained muscle lengthening applied by the practitioner or therapis t. Its use is common within the chiropractic profession. Practitioners , especially within the field of sports chiropractic, teach and use these p rocedures frequently. 10.4.3 Rating : Established Evidence: Class I, II, III 5. Educational Programs 1. Back School/Spinal Hygiene Courses: Knowledge ab out how to take care of one's health problems and how to modify behavior or lifestyle is likely to be beneficial for most patients. Back school programs and patient education have traditionally been an integral part of chiropractic case management. It is supportable when used as an appropriate teaching ai d. 10.5.1 Rating : Established Evidence: Class I, II, III-218-D. Prevention and Wellness Services 1. Wellness Care/Disease Prevention/Health Promotion : A relatively new area of interest in chiropractic as a distant service, prev ention has long been a primary consideration of the chiropractic profession's appr oach to health care. Typical disease prevention programs, smoking cessation, wei ght reduction efforts and the like fit well within chiropractic practice scop es. Organizations such as the American Chiropractic Association, International Ch iropractors' Association and the Chiropractic Forum of the American Public Healt h Association have adopted policies or expressed support for such prog rams and practitioners with a particular expertise and interest in this area ar e increasing in number. 10.5.2 Rating : Established Evidence: Class II, III 2. Nutritional Counseling: Nutritional training is included in the chiropractic curriculum. As a general issue concerning scope of practice, t here is little disagreement regarding the capability or qualifications of practitioners t o counsel patients concerning nutritional matters. 10.5.3 Rating : Established Evidence: Class I, II, III Comment : Specific nutritional therapy is an extensive fiel d that requires a great deal of delineation. This should be addressed in the fu ture. 10.5.4 Rating : Established Evidence: Class II, III D. Ancillary Procedures 6. Electrical Modalities: Electrical modalities have been a part of chiroprac tic education in some colleges and they are included in scope of practice regulations in many jurisdictions. 10.5.5 Rating : Established Evidence: Class I, II, III 7. Thermal Modalities These include cryotherapy, infrared, hydrotherapy, hydrocollator and others. These procedures are recognized within the chiropractic s cope of practice in most jurisdictions. Protocols are documented and standa rdized. 10.5.6 Rating : Established Evidence: Class I, II, III 8. Ultrasound Ultrasound is a conservative procedure. It is incl uded as a physiotheraputic modality in some chiropractic statutes. 10.5.8 Rating : Established Evidence: Class I, II, III-219-9. Bracing and Supports Supports, braces, orthotics and the like may be use ful components of chiropractic care. 10.5.9 Rating : Established Evidence: Class I, II, III 10. Traction Traction may be employed to stretch muscles, joints , and intervertebral discs. Its use is typically included in chiropractic education.. 10.5.10 Rating : Established Evidence: Class I, II, III VI. COMMENTS Chiropractic modes of care encompass a wide variety of approaches. As chiropractic addresses health care from a perspective involving the role that body structure plays in overall physiologic function, many procedures emphasize man ual care procedures such as adjusting and soft tissue work. However, the profession has tradition ally maintained a strong interest in wellness care and disease prevention, as well as lifestyle and er gonomic issues. Therefore education, conditioning, nutrition, counseling and other approaches are ofte n used by many practitioners.. It should be emphasized that chiropractic practitio ners are typically well trained in a variety of standard assessment procedures, as well as speciali zed neurological and structural evaluation protocols. There has traditionally been an emphasi s in chiropractic practice on lifestyle, wellness, prevention, and other natural approaches to health care. It is not the intent of this document to exclude an y particular technique or procedure, but rather to provide general guidelines for the assessment of the safety and effectiveness of generic methodologies utilized by the chiropractic professi on. As a living document, this chapter will be sub ject to periodic review as new and innovative methodolog ies are developed and submitted for evaluation. VII.

OVERVIEW Specific parameters of care appropriate for each in dividual case are impossible to define. Each case must be evaluated with complicating facto rs, concomitant conditions and all other extenuating circumstances taken into consideration in order to assure the patient maximum benefit through chiropractic care. The following guidelines should serve only as a gen eral guide for parameters of care. Furthermore, these guidelines are not meant to provide cut-off points for care, but rath er to assist the analyst in understanding the widely varying patient needs and circumstances requiring varying courses of adjustive care. The clinical necessity of care is based, as had been extensively discussed in previous chapters, in objective findings indicating the presence of subluxation. Patients may progress at a rate not anticipated in these guidelines. Exacerbation may prolong normal rate of recovery, such as extreme physical a ctivity on the job or injuries like falls, slips or lifting injuries. On the other hand, patients sometimes re spond more quickly than expected. The need for documentation is paramount to good communication be tween the doctor and the insurance company. An admitting analysis and finding(s) may be given initially until patient response to care confirms o r alters the initial clinical finding, category of co ndition and/or its degree of severity. The respons ibility of upgrading or downgrading a patient's clinical st atus rests with the attending doctor. Principles of Case Management The primary missions of health care delivery are to provide sufficient care to restore health, maintain it, and prevent the occurrence or recurren ce of injury and illness. To meet these objectives , the practitioner uses a myriad of procedures and sk ills that collectively can be grouped into three categories -- passive intervention, active interven tion, and patient education. The practical boundar ies on what will constitute necessary and sufficient ca re are situational. However, guidelines framing expectations of care outcome can be drawn from the literature and adapted by practical experience on a case-by-case basis. Chiropractic shows the unique ability to determine sub-clinical spinal disorders such as any of the components of the vertebral subluxation complex , known to precede symptoms/end stage conditions eliminating the need for the most part o f crisis intervention. A key principle is that chr onicity should be prevented wherever possible. Patients wh o are at risk for becoming chronic show characteristic patterns involving their illness and life situations. II. LIST OF SUBTOPICS A. Over Utilization B. Under Utilization C. Pediatrics D. Geriatrics III. RECOMMENDATIONS The frequency of how many times a particular patien t needs to see their chiropractor is based on the subjective findings, if applicable and the o bjective clinical findings and the opinion of the d octor.- 2 2 7 -There is no set template on the number of visits ne eded to obtain maximum chiropractic improvement for the population as a whole. Each patient who pre sents themselves at the chiropractic clinic is uniq ue and different and must be treated as such. Some of the factors which need to be taken into con sideration is the age of the patient, type of work or daily activities, trauma or aggravation, st ability and function ability of supporting structur es (muscles and ligaments) the structural integrity of the spine and its articulations (degeneration, demineralization, biomechanical loss or failure). T hese and other factors are the considerations which go into making a plan of care/number of visit s for each patient. After the patient is examined using the applicable procedures of x-ray, instrumentation and examination the doctor will correlate the objective information. Based on the findings and the doctors clinical expertise a frequency of care will be set for that particular patient. After a patient starts an initial frequency of care they will be re-examined/reassessed at proper intervals. This is done to determine the patients response to care and if the frequency can be reduce d or increased and or if a referral is necessary. The re-exam/re-assessment may be performed several times during the course of care until the patient r eaches maximum chiropractic improvement(MCI). Maximum improvement varies with each patient and w ill depend on those factors noted above. Once a patient reaches MCI they are released from care a nd recommended to a PRN basis or other type program upon which they and the attending doctor of chiropractic agree. The following shall serve as a guideline. It is im portant to note that with proper documentation additional care or alteration of care schedule may be warranted for the categories of conditions and levels of care listed herein.

Pediatrics Vertebral subluxations and other malpositioned arti culations and structures have many possible causes, one of which can often be the birt h process. According to Towbin, \"The birth process, even under optimal controlled conditions, is potentially a traumatic, crippling event for the fetus. Mechanical stress imposed by obstetr ical manipulation -- even the application of standard orthodox procedures -- may prove intolerab le to the fetus. The view has been expressed clinically that most neonatal injuries ob served in the delivery room are neurological.\" Towbin has also related the birth process to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome caused by spine damage to the nervous system. Gutmann found that 80% of the children he examined shortly after birth, or as infants, were suffering from \"su bluxation\" of C1, causing all manner of conditions. Suh and others note that chiropractic care should begin at birth, when subluxation is likely to occur. Ressel advises that early chirop ractic care is essential, as abnormal spine and nerve system habits (vertebral subluxation) are caused very early in life. Janse proposes that proper spinal health in the children of today will insure a better next generation. Given the chiropractor's objective and the overwhelming suppo rtive evidence mentioned above, chiropractic care can begin shortly after birth and be followed by a lifetime of continuing care. 11.4.1 Rating : Strong Positive Recommendation Strength: Class E, L D. Geriatrics The care of elderly patients is a special responsib ility of the doctor of chiropractic and requires appropriate additional attention to age-r elated factors and possible complications. Chiropractic care is a strongly indi cated element in maintaining mobility in elderly patients and thus fostering a healthier physical profile as well as a more positive mental attitude. Furthermore, the drugles s nature of chiropractic care assist senior citizens in avoiding the otherwise widespre ad drug-related complications of other forms of care related to the spine and nervou s system- 2 2 9 -11.4.2 Rating: Strong Positive Recommendation Strength: Class E, L, IV. CHRONIC CARE The chronic pain/dysfunction patient suffering from spinal or structural injury or disease is frequently the most challenging and difficult respo nsibility confronted within the health care industr y. Care of the chronic pain dysfunction patient must b e balanced between the extremes of reducing patient dependency on the chiropractor and providing maximum relief or reduction in symptoms whereby the patient will approach pre-inju ry productivity and self-worth. The rationale for chiropractic management in chronic pain dysfunction syndromes of articular origin is well established in the scientific literature. Chronic musculoskeletal conditions are frequently pr ogressive and degenerative if inappropriately managed. A current search of the literature has no t substantiated the scientific efficacy of the long term use of specific pharmaceuticals in chronic pai n syndromes. Additionally, commonly used pharmacological agents may hasten the deterioration process if used inappropriately for prolonged periods. The doctor of chiropractic works to manage the patient's subjective complaints, and maintain or increase the patient's ability to be pr oductive in his or her work environment and activities of daily living, through a conservative approach that does not rely on invasive surgical procedures or prolonged pharmaceutical usage, and t hus avoids the adverse effects which may result from their use. The doctor of chiropractic is uniquely suited to ca re for and rehabilitate the chronic pain patient without the use of drugs or surgery. Long term chi ropractic management, when appropriately delivered, based on a case by case evaluation, prov ides benefits to the patient which are not addressed by any other health care discipline. The following neurophysiological and biomechanical principles support the rational for long term chiropractic management of the biomechanically compromised patient suffering from a chronic pain syndrome. 1. Prevention of joint adhesions and subsequent prot eoglycan degradation in the hyaline cartilage and intrinsic spinal ligaments. Multiple research universities have demonstrated th at immobilized joints rapidly undergo cartilaginous degradation with deterioratio n of the hyaline cartilage surface, producing additional degenerative change and increa sed pathology. 2. Facilitation of normal articular neuroreceptive f ields. The neuroreceptive field is described as all the rec eptors which supply sensory input to the spinal cord and brain, from the skin, ligame nts, muscles, and intrinsic joint structures in a given spinal segment level. Loss o f normal function in a given spinal joint produces alteration of the receptive field wi th a loss of neural network connections, producing a deafferentation state and loss of central sensory integration, at the thalamocortical level. Appropriate chiropra ctic care provides neural input for the receptive fields and inhibits further loss due to d eafferentation. 3. Prevention and inhibition of sensory-motor pain e ngrams.- 2 3 0 -Chronic pain produces reflexive spasms through poly synaptic internuncial stimulation of the alpha motor neurons to surrounding intrinsic musculature. When this nocifensive spasm is left unaddressed, metabolic de pletion occurs producing an alteration of the muscle and ligament cytoarchitect ure with infiltration of fibrotic tissue. Prolongation of the chronic pain stimulus produces nociceptive pools within the spinal cord which are easily recruited through seemingly i nsignificant exacerbations. Long term chiropractic management inhibits and frequentl y prevents excessive nociceptor pool facilitation in all but the most severely inju red. 4. Insuring proper articular coupled biomechanics in functional rehabilitation programs. Management of the patient in chronic pain may inclu de chiropractic supervision of rehabilitation programs. Failure to recognize path omechanical dysfunction within spinal articulations increases likelihood of exacerbation and progression of degenerative effects seen in the chronic pain patient. Biomecha nical integrity of the spine and extremity articulations is essential to produce opt imum rehabilitation success in these patients. The doctor of chiropractic must be acutely aware of the psychosocial motivation of the patient in chronic pain. The chiropractor must guide the pati ent away from hostility and pain nurturing by increasing the patient's activity level and by fost ering a need for his or her own active participatio n in the rehabilitative process. A care regime which allows the patient to become excessively dependent on the doctor for psychosocial support, b eyond the requirements of his or her impairment, is unacceptable. Care utilization para meters must be determined on a case by case basis. The need for long term care should be based on the presence of a condition/injury or illness which has been documented by peer acceptable criter ia and has been determined to be permanent and/or progressive. The necessity of long term palliative or supportive care should accomplish one or more of the following goals in order to be considered necessary and appropriate: 1. Care of an exacerbation to return the patient to pre-exacerbation status. 2. Improvement or maintenance of activities of daily living. 3. Improvement or maintenance of work status. 4. Increase of functional strength. 5. Increase stamina, endurance and activity toleranc e. 6. Increase functional range of motion. 7. Improve mental attitude. 8. Decrease need for, or amount of, medication. 9. Prevention of surgical intervention when appropri ate. 10. To attain optimal expression of life.- 2 3 1 -V. COMMENTS In the course of the management of a chiropractic c ase the objective indicators of vertebral subluxation(s) and other malpositioned articulation s and structures demonstrated during Level I (see glossary for definition of levels of care) care may decrease. As the patient's clinical indicators ar e minimized and spinal function improves and stabiliz es, the frequency of care is reduced and the patien t is advanced to Level II care. Some of the variables considered during the evaluation of the patient's status include, but are not limited to age, occupat ion/lifestyle, past metabolic history, past history of injuries/fractures/surgeries, genetic predispositio n, amorphic spinal structure, cortical and medullar y bone irregularities, bone density irregularities, a rticular irregularities, joint irregularities, chro nic adaptive postural and structural changes, chronicit y, the number of spinal subluxations present, patie nt tolerance to active care, and the degree of patient cooperation. When a patient has demonstrated sufficient reductio n of clinical indicators of vertebral subluxation and other malpositioned articulations a nd structures, they should be advanced from Level II care. The chiropractor should then recommend Le vel III care. Chiropractic clinical experience, since 1895, has d emonstrated that periodic chiropractic assessment in a Level III regimen does have merit. The current body of research in this area supports the observation that initial degenerative changes a re measurable within one week of the occurrence of vertebral subluxation and other malpositioned ar ticulations and structures. Vertebral subluxations and other malpositioned articulations and structure s, regardless of their origin, will initiate negati ve physiological changes. Weekly or semi-monthly offi ce visits are appropriate. A chiropractor views th e detection, location, control, reduction and correct ion of vertebral subluxations and other malposition ed articulations and structures during all levels of c are to be vital toward the optimum expression of he alth. At some point during a patient's care, the practiti oner may note that those clinical indications of vertebral subluxation and other malpositioned ar ticulations and structures (including, but not limi ted to those found by motion and static palpation, inst rumentation, radiography, etc.) are becoming either more or less noticeable. In order to ascertain the optimal elapsed time period between chiropractic office visits, the practitioner would then begin th e process of decreasing or increasing visit frequen cy. Should the indicators for the presence of a verteb ral subluxation and other malpositioned articulatio ns and structures be imperceptible or absent, in the c linical opinion of the practitioner, office visit frequency would be decreased. At some point in this process, however, the indica tors for the presence of a vertebral subluxation and other malpositioned articulations a nd structures may again be manifested, necessitating a chiropractic adjustment and a reass essment of visit frequency. As a result, the patie nt may be reclassified from Level III care to Level II care, Level II care to Level I care, or Level III care to Level I care. Visit frequency, duration, and level of considerations may also be influenced by a numb er of factors in addition to clinical indicators. The se include, but are not limited to: age, occupatio n, lifestyle, past history, genetic predisposition, sp inal structure, number of subluxations present, chronicity, compromise of bony integrity and degree of patient compliance. The concerns of the public regarding health care ha ve shifted to an active responsibility for their physical well-being. Patients who understand the major objective of chiropractic knowingly choose this approach to help them maximize their he alth potential. Scientific evidence identifies components of the vertebral subluxation and other m alpositioned articulations and structures and may reveal physiologic changes that occur after the cor rection of the vertebral subluxation and other malpositioned articulations and structures. Moreov er, it is observed clinically that dramatic changes may occur after the correction of a vertebral sublu xation and other malpositioned articulations and structures. Most chiropractors have observed chang es after spinal adjustments that affect major body systems and the patient's complex metabolic system. The clinical explanation for these changes is asso ciated with improved natural functions. - 2 3 2 -When interference to the nervous system is reduced, the body's capacity to heal and thrive is rekindled. Vertebral subluxations and other malpos itioned articulations and structures may occur during the birth process, therefore, it is imperati ve that chiropractic care should begin as soon as possible. Chiropractic care should continue, in ac cordance with the patient's needs and the chiropractor's clinical opinion, for the life of th e patient. VI.

Overview II. List of Subtopics III. Literature Review IV. Recommendations V. References-238--239-I. OVERVIEW Reassessment refers to patient evaluations performe d after the initiation of patient care. Reassessment is essential for monitoring the patien t's progress and is also termed \"outcomes assessment.\" Clinical research addresses the devel opment and application of reassessment instruments and procedures. Appropriate applicatio n of these to clinical practice is of great importance. The primary reason for reassessment is to evaluate the patient's clinical state. From this and a knowledge of prior condition, rate of progress an d specific procedures utilized to manage the patient's condition, more informed decisions can be made regarding the appropriateness of care, efficiency of care rendered, need for continued car e, and the need to modify care. A number of questions have been raised with regard to reassessm ent such as: Why should patients be reassessed, what specifically should be reassessed, when should reassessment be performed, and how should reassessment be conducted? In consideri ng these topics, it is important to keep in mind the distinctive qualities of chiropractic as a manu al healing art. Examinations that are conducted during the entrance evaluation of the patient for chiropractic care give the chiropractor a starting point from wh ich to monitor the patient's progress. There are many different kinds of examination procedures used to give indications of the presence of vertebral subluxation and other malpositioned articulations a nd structures. With information supplied in the ca se history and patient observation processes, the chir opractor will decide which examinations will furnis h the best data. Different patterns and types of reassessments can b e done during care. It is inherent in chiropractic care that the patient be regularly rea ssessed as to their need for chiropractic adjustmen t. The dynamic nature of the recuperative process requ ires that periodic reassessment be performed to track the patient's progress and deter mine the need for continued care or the need to modify the management program. Follow-up reassessm ent is performed at the end of the management program or when the patient has attained maximal improvement. Such an assessment is often performed to ascertain the degree of resid ual deficit, such as disability ratings, impairment ratings or the degree of recovery. II. LIST OF SUBTOPICS A.

LITERATURE REVIEW In the absence of definitive data based on large-sc ale, longitudinal studies, the frequency of reassessment is left implicitly to the judgement of the attending doctor. Currently, justification fo r any particular pattern of reassessment must be culled f rom the clinical research literature and expert opinion. A representative selection of the literat ure is referenced at the end of this chapter. In clinical practice there is typically a single as sessment in the initial patient evaluation, but it is not uncommon for several consecutive assessments to be conducted to create a baseline for the patient's progress. The approach taken may depend upon the patient's condition. For example, a patient with severe, acute pain due to an apparent lumbar disc herniation will have little tolerance f or multiple session evaluations to establish a baselin e for management. By contrast, the establishment of a baseline for juvenile scoliosis patients typic ally requires evaluations over a period of several-240-months. Patients are reassessed for a number of reasons. P rimary among them is the ongoing need for the practitioner to determine the necessity and appropriateness of further care. Reassessment gives the practitioner an opportunity to assess the effectiveness or success of the chosen care plan by providing a monitor of patient progress, either improvement or deterioration. It is important to determine whether improvement is occurring at an ap propriate rate. If not, appropriate changes in the care plan can be made, including possible referral. A reassessment is often performed to satisfy the re quirements of third-party payers. Their concerns are often the justification for continued care, determination of patient progress, and determination of disability rating. As a general rule, reassessment will focus on those areas in which positive findings were obtained during the initial clinical evaluations. Exceptions to this occur when additional signs or symptoms develop during the course of care which ma ndate re-evaluation of previously negative tests or the use of procedures not previously employed. When the natural history of a condition is known, reassessment can provide valuable insight into the effectiveness of the care program in altering its course. It is unreasonable to adopt the approach that every known test is performed on the initial examination and subsequently repeated with each rea ssessment. Good clinical judgement combined with careful observation will direct the practition er to those areas and procedures which will provide the most valuable information. The clinical tests used during reassessment will depend on the nature of the condition being evaluated. \"Interactive assessment\" includes procedures which direct care for that patient visit. These typically include procedures which provide indicati ons for chiropractic care, such as palpation, instrumentation, leg check and other methods of spi nal motion assessment. Periodic reassessment includes: 1) repetition of a ctions or clinical procedures which upon prior examination provided information about the ch ief complaint and which led to the clinical impression. Examples include range of motion, tender ness and positive pain provocation signs; 2) repetition of tests wherein abnormalities were dete cted on initial examination (e.g., deep tendon reflexes); 3) new procedures not previously perform ed but indicated by the patient's clinical conditio n; 4) special studies (e.g., C.T. scan) which may impa ct the course of care when there has been a failure to improve or deterioration in the patient's condit ion. Spinal radiography is used widely as a chiropractic diagnostic and clinical reassessment tool. Existing criteria and practice have evolved empiri cally from clinical experience and convention. However, such procedures are widely used. As in al l health care, if we depend entirely upon scientifi c method to determine the inclusion or exclusion of e valuation procedures, we would be left with a paucity of procedures with which to arrive at a wor king clinical impression. The way in which reassessments are made needs consi derable clarification. Interactive procedures should be simple and allow for assessmen t in an ongoing practice. Analog pain scales provide a tool for regular pain assessment, whereas pain questionnaires are more cumbersome and difficult to administer on an ongoing basis. Perio dic evaluations may have more formal structure and detail. They may include more extensive questionna ires regarding pain, patient satisfaction and activities of daily living, functional disability a ssessment, and more extensive physical examination procedures. The evaluative procedures selected wil l depend upon the nature and role of reassessment. Frequency of periodic reassessment is determined by several factors such as the severity or-241-urgency of the condition or the likelihood of progr ession and degeneration. Scoliosis is an excellent example of a condition in which the frequency of re assessment varies with the severity and location of the condition, the age of the patient and histor y of prior progression. Truly life-threatening conditions requiring continuous monitoring, or even daily monitoring, are at times found in chiropract ic practice. Severe acute conditions should be assess ed frequently. A patient's need for reassessment may also change during the course of care, dependin g upon progress. If the patient's condition demonstrates marked improvement, then reassessment should become less frequent. Conversely, if the patient deteriorates, reassessment should be performed as soon as possible to determine an appropriate course of action. The practitioner's role in integrating information from diverse sources and prescribing or administering care can be assisted by reassessment information contributed by a variety of individuals . Some aspects of reassessment may involve appropria tely trained and qualified employees of the attending practitioner. Others may require the ass istance of specialized facilities, such as advanced imaging centers. The chiropractic practitioner ass umes the role of team captain, coordinating the efforts of a health care team in the evaluation, di agnosis and management of the patient. IV. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Reassessment In a chiropractic practice, the initial assessment is documented and recorded. The purpose of these findings is to give the chiropractor infor mation concerning the presence and location of vertebral subluxation and other malpositioned ar ticulations and structures, in the context of the patient's general health status. The chiropractor must determine on a per/visit and periodic basis, how the patient's care is progressing, therefore, reassessment examinations a re performed. This process provides quantitative and qualitative information about the patient's progress which is utilized to determine the frequency and duration of chiropracti c care. 12.1.1 Rating : Positive recommendation Strength: E, L B. Performing the Reassessment As a general rule, reassessment examinations are ma de by performing those procedures appropriate to the current status of the patient re lative to vertebral subluxation(s) and other malpositioned articulations and structures. The re assessment findings are then compared to the previous findings to determine the patient's pr ogress. 12.2.1 Rating : Strong positive recommendation Strength: E, L Reassessments are an integral component of case man agement and should be made following an appropriate period of care. 12.2.2 Rating : Strong positive recommendation Evidence: E, L C. The necessity for and the content of reassessment s are determined by the patient's response. Patients responding as expected might be reassesse d later and with fewer tests; those not-242-responding or responding more slowly should be re-e valuated sooner and possible more thoroughly. A knowledge of the natural history of th e condition greatly facilitates decisions concerning the timing of reassessment. 12.3.1 Rating : Strong positive recommendation Evidence: E, L Appropriate reassessments shall be made as soon as possible if the patient demonstrates a marked worsening of clinical status. 12.3.2 Rating : Strong positive recommendation Evidence: E, L Appropriate reassessment should be made if the pati ent begins to manifest clinical signs or symptoms in areas not previously evaluated. 12.3.3 Rating : Strong positive recommendation Evidence: E, L Reassessment should be performed by persons appropr iately trained and qualified in the specific procedures. 12.3.4 Rating : Strong positive recommendation Evidence: E, L Reassessment should be performed, as closely as pos sible, in the same manner as the initial assessment. 12.3.5 Rating : Recommended Evidence: Class I, II, III Reassessments performed solely to satisfy third par ty interests should be performed with due regard for all the recommendations presented in thi s chapter. 12.3.6 Rating : Recommended Evidence: Class I, II, III Interactive reassessment should be performed during each patient encounter for the purpose of confirming or modifying a clinical impre ssion. D. Interactive Reassessment 12.4.1 Rating : Strong positive recommendation Evidence: E, L E. Frequency of Reassessment 1. Per-visit reassessment should include at least on e analytical procedure previously used. A chosen testing procedure is per formed each time the patient is in the chiropractor's office for chiropr actic care. The reassessment provides information necessary to perform an adjust ment on a per-visit basis. 12.5.1 Rating : Strong Positive Recommendation Strength: E, L-243-2. Partial reassessment involves duplication of two or more preceding positive analytical procedures. Partial reassessment may be done periodically. 12.5.2 Rating : Positive Recommendation Strength: E 3. Full reassessment involves duplication of three o r more preceding positive analytical procedures. Any additional or complimen tary analytical procedures can be performed based on the current clinical stat us. Full reassessment may be done every 6 to 12 weeks during Phase I care. S ubsequent levels of care may allow longer periods between full reassessments . (Refer to Chapter 8). 12.5.3 Rating : Strong positive recommendation Strength: E, L Comment: If a patient's presentation indicates very frequent chiropractic adjustments or chiropractic manipulations, he or she may requir e more frequent reassessment. As indications require less frequent adjustments/chiro practic manipulations, reassessments will be performed less frequently. 4. Discussion of Outside Review by Other Professio nals It is widely accepted that abuses are occurring in the review process involving paper reviews and independent chiropractic evaluations. The solution, however, must be a legislative endeavor. 12.6.1 Rating : Strong positive recommendation Strength: E V.

OVERVIEW Health care should be characterized by quality, eff ectiveness, and cost efficiency Health care should also be based on the fundamental values and wishes of the patient, provided those wishes do not conflict with basic legal, ethical or professio nal obligations and standards of the provider. T he future focus of health care services will be on nor malizing biologic function and postponing the inevitable physical decline of the patient, maximiz ing the body's inherent recuperative and regenerati ve powers. To ensure effectiveness and efficiency, multileve l outcome assessments of health care services are being regularly be instituted. Patien ts, practitioners, payers, state boards, health car e institutions, government agencies, etc. are increas ingly involved in gathering and evaluating assessment data, as well as recommending and implem enting changes in health care delivery based on those and related findings. Outcomes management h as evolved into a technology of patient experience designed to provide all interested parti es with better insight into the consequences of health care choices on a patient's life. Chiropractic emerged over one hundred years ago as a vitalistic and natural approach to health care. Throughout much chiropractic's histor y, doctors of chiropractic based their approach almost exclusively on rationalism and uncontrolled empiricism. As evidenced by the recent explosion in the number of controlled studies and publication s, the chiropractic profession has recognized the need and importance of outcomes assessments to enha nce the quality and effectiveness of chiropractic care as well as to evolve chiropractic standards of care. The objective of chiropractic care is the detection , analysis, control, reduction and correction of the vertebral subluxation complex. The vertebra l subluxation not only compromises the function of the spine but also interferes with the function of the nervous system and all related systems. Correction of vertebral subluxations contributes to health by restoring spinal function and eliminatin g interference to body physiology. Through vertebral subluxation correction, the body, therefore, has greater adaptive ability. The intent of this chapter is to present those outc ome measures which serve to assess the patient-chiropractor health care process. The pati ent-chiropractor relationship represents one segment of the entire framework of chiropractic out comes assessment. Outcomes assessment is a data-driven process which quantifies the quality and effectiveness of fulfilling the objective of the Chiropractor's p ractice. Those objectives include measuring the quantifiable changes resulting from vertebral sublu xation and other malpositioned articulations and structures reduction. Outcome objectives also incl ude data on the implications of vertebral subluxati on and other malpositioned articulations and structure s reduction on patient health status, i.e., change in regimen. Donabedian (1982) discussed health care quality in terms of structure (organization), process (procedures) and outcomes (benefits and harms). He defined outcomes to mean a change in a patient's current or future health status that can be attributed to antecedent health care. By using a broad operational definition of health, such things as improvement in social and psychological functio n can be added to the more traditional measures of ph ysical and physiological function. Coile (1990) writes that while the history of quality care in th e U.S. may have focused on the first two concepts, the current trend is swinging to assessment of outcomes as a way to hold health care practitioners accountable for their work. Ellwood (1988) agrees th at outcomes are integral to definitions of quality health care.-250-Chiropractic clinicians and researchers have also r ecognized and stressed the importance of emphasizing outcome assessments. (McLachlan, 1991; H ansen, 1991; Adams, 1991; Jose, 1991). This trend is consistent with chiropractic practic e because the chiropractic profession has always philosophically emphasized health in its broader de finitions and championed the positive potential of human beings in optimally comprehending their envir onment. The broad perspective on health outcomes leads to c ontemplation of a very large number of assessment or measurement procedures ranging from t he social to the physical and physiological sciences. Discussion of all possible outcome asses sments is beyond the scope of this chapter. General health assessment measures are very importa nt and will be discussed. In general, a parsimonious view of outcomes is taken, still with the idea that the needs of the patient, the practit ioner and society are all important in assuring the overa ll quality of chiropractic care. Outcome assessments vary considerably depending on the scope of clinical phenomena one might want to measure and the target patient popula tion. General health outcome assessments, which have received considerable attention in recent year s, attempt to measure a number of attributes deemed important to the overall concept of health. Health outcomes are important to patients, whereas physicians traditionally use more specific outcomes such as laboratory test results to assess the effects of care. At first glance, it would seem that the results of clinical and laboratory tests and the analytical findings themselves would make ideal outcome measur es. But this point of view is too narrow, emphasizing mostly physiological mechanisms more im portant to the practitioner's decision-making process than to the broader needs of patients and s ociety. There is a distinction between procedures used for analyzing a patient's condition and those used for assessing the outcome of care. The purpos e of a chiropractic diagnosis is to categorize a patient's condition so that the doctor can formulat e an appropriate chiropractic care plan. Different findings usually imply different programs of care. In contrast, the purpose of an outcome assessment is to measure a change in patient status as a resul t of care. The same outcome assessment may be used to measure the effect of different care approaches for any number of findings (for example, a general health questionnaire). Also, a clinical impression or description may not change even thoug h the health status of the patient may improve under care. On the other hand, if the goal of care is to eliminate the identified disorder (i.e., \"cu re\" the patient), then the appropriate analytical and outco me procedures may be one and the same. The discussion and recommendations in the chapters on imaging, instrumentation, clinical laboratory, clinical impression, and reassessment a lso have a bearing on the general topic of outcome assessment. Because those chapters deal in some de tails with evaluative procedures potentially useful as outcome procedures, and with other case m anagement considerations, some procedures may be only briefly mentioned here. Appropriate standardized outcome assessments are us eful in normal clinical practice for they can: $ Consistently evaluate the effect of care over time $ Help indicate the point of maximum improvement $ Uncover problems related to care such as noncomplia nce $ Document improvement to the patient, doctor, and th ird parties $ Suggest modifications of the goals of care if neces sary $ Quantify the clinical experience of the doctor $ Justify the type, dose, and duration of care-251-$ Help provide a data-base for clinical research $ Assist in establishing standards of care for specif ic conditions. This chapter will recommend methods of assessing ou tcomes of chiropractic care based upon defined criteria, scientific evidence, and expert o pinion that are valid, reliable, clinically useful in chiropractic practice, and able to be interpreted b y those interested in the role of chiropractic heal th care in society.

LITERATURE REVIEW Studies of patients seeking chiropractic care sugge st that painful conditions of the spine and extremities are the leading symptoms presented ( Nyi endo, 1989, Phillips, in press). However, chiropractic adjustive care have been shown to have value for patients with a variety of ailments. Spinal adjustment results in mechanical, neurologic al, trophic and psychosocial effects (Mootz, 1992, Stonebrink, 1990). There are over 30 randomized trials in the literatu re comparing manipulation and mobilization to other forms of care for low-back pain (Shekelle et al., 1991a; Anderson et al., 1992). The majorit y show manipulation to be more effective than the man y interventions to which it has been compared. The peer-reviewed literature in recent years has at tracted papers dealing with case reports, theoretical models, and controlled studies related to non-musculoskeletal disorders.-252-Gillman and Bergstrand published a case report invo lving an elderly male with traumatic vision loss. Optometric and ophthalmologic examination reve aled that no conventional treatment was appropriate. The lost vision returned following ch iropractic care. The authors stated, Behaviorial optometrists have often been interested in the work of chiropractors and the resulting vision changes. Schutte, Tesse and Jamison did a retrospective revie w of 12 children with ecophoria, and concluded that such patients may respond to cervical spine ad justments. Changjiang et al reported on 114 cases of patients with cervical spondylosis who had an associated visual disorders. Visual improvement wa s not noted following manipulative treatment in 83% of these cases. Furthermore, of the 54 cases f ollowed up for a minimum of six months, 95% showed a stable therapeutic effect. Cases of blind eyes regaining vision were included in the report. Gorman published a case report where a 62 year old male with a 1 week history of monocular visual defect experienced dramatic visual improvement afte r a week of spinal manipulation Gorman stated, Spinal manipulation can affect the function of the optic nerve in some patients presumably by increasing vascular perfusion. Pikalov and Kharin compared the results of spinal m anipulative therapy with traditional medical care in patients with endoscopically confirmed ulcer disease. Both groups received the same dietary regimen. Weekly endoscopic exams were performed. The group receiving spine care experienced pain relief earlier than the medical group. Clinic al remission was observed an average of 10 days earlier in the SMT group than the medical group. Kokjohn et al studied the effect of spinal manipula tionon pain and prostoglandin levels in women with primary dysmenorrhea. 45 subjects were included in the study. 24 were assigned to the experimental group, and 21 to the control group. T he controls received a sham manipulation. The authors found that immediately after treatment, the perception of pain and the level of menstrual distress were significantly reduced. It was sugges ted that further studies be performed over a longer time frame. A prospective, uncontrolled study of 316 infants wi th infantile colic showed a satisfactory result in 94% of cases receiving chiropractic care. The r esults occurred within 2 weeks. Other authors have offered case reports of results obtained in patient s with colic. In 1997 landmark research was published validating the role of the chiropractic adjustment in the care of children with otitis media. This histo ric study of chiropractic adjustive care on childre n with this condition employed tympanography as an objecti fying measure and studied 332 subjects. The results of this study indicate a strong correlation between the chiropractic adjustment and the resolution of this very common condition (Fallon, 1 997). There is evidence that adjustment stimulates certai n metabolic activity within some types of white blood cells (Brennan, 1990). There is also p reliminary evidence suggesting a relationship between adjustment and serum beta-endorphin levels and other circulating pituitary hormones (Vernon, 1989). A randomized controlled study on a small number of patients with elevated blood pressure demonstrated a significant reduction in po st-treatment blood pressure for subjects adjusted in the thoracic spine employing an Activator adjust ing instrument (Yates, 1988).} The exact number of named chiropractic techniques i s thought to be about 200. However, there is a great deal of overlap, and a number of t echniques involve only minor modifications of other s. Additionally, many named techniques have both anal ytical and therapeutic components. Only the care portions of technique procedures are presented here. Analysis and other diagnostic considerations are discussed in other chapters (see History and Physical Examination, Diagnostic-253-Imaging, Clinical Laboratory, Clinical Impression, Frequency of Care, and Outcomes Assessment.) Exercise has been the subject of a number of clinic al trials and was recently the subject of meta-analysis which showed most exercise regimens t o be far less consistent in beneficial effects than studies on manipulation (Koes, et al., 1991; Anders on, 1992). However, many exercise and education protocols are in widespread use and considered stan dard approaches within the medical community (White and Anderson, 1991, Mayer and Gatchell, 1987 ). Physiotherapeutic modalities are relatively standardized (Schaefer, 1984, Stonebrink, 1990) and are generally used as ancillary procedures in chiropractic practice. Functional Outcome Assessments Assessing a patient's function is a logical way to assess the behavioral effects of a disease and the outcome of care. Usually, patient functioning is verbally discussed between the patient and practitioner, but new questionnaire techniques may make such information more objective. For this chapter, functional outcome assessments refer to qu estionnaires designed to measure a patient's limitations in performing the usual human tasks of living. Functional questionnaires seek to quantify symptoms, function and behavior directly, rather th an to infer them from less relevant physiological tests. There are a large number of functional scales descr ibed in the scientific literature. Deyo (1990) presented an excellent review and summary of many functional assessments used in back pain research. Of particular note are the Pain Disabili ty Index (Tait, 1987), the Million Disability Questionnaire (Million, 1982), the Oswestry Disabil ity Questionnaire (Fairbank, 1980), the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (Roland, 1983), the Waddell Disability Index (Waddell, 1982), and the Dallas Pain Questionnaire (Lawlis, 1989). A modifica tion of the Oswestry Questionnaire to make it useful for neck function was recently published by Vernon (1991). A very detailed discussion of the validity, reliabi lity, responsiveness, relevance, feasibility, and safety of the many functional scales is beyond the scope of this chapter. For further information the book Measuring Health: A Guide to Rating Scales and Questionnaires (McDowell and Newell, 1987) is very useful. In general, while there may be som e gaps in the research base for many individual functional questionnaires, the usefulness of these types of instruments is apparent. In terms of responsiveness, which is the ability of an instrument to document changes in health status, it is instructive to examine the clinical t rials with respect to manipulative/adjustive care m ethods. There are at least 28 randomized clinical trials of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) for painful complaints in the scientific literature (Shekelle, 1991; Haldeman, 1991; Ottenbacher, 1985; Anderson, 1992). In one meta-analysis (Anderson, 1992), the authors categorized the outcome assessments in 23 randomized trials into eight categories. The outcomes of health care may be characterized as falling into one of the following categories: death, disease, disability, discomfort, dissatisfaction, and destitution (Lohr, 1988). A more positive taxonomy would simply use the opposites of these words, e.g., survival rates, lack of disease , ability, comfort, satisfaction, and thrift. While easily understood in general, operational definitio ns and assessment procedures for outcomes of care that mat ch the attributes mentioned above are more difficult to obtain. For this review, a citation search was derived from original research, review papers and books from the chiropractic, medical and scientific liter ature. The topic and its research base is large. A great deal of material was referenced from Interstu dy, an organization devoted to the scientific-254-development of outcome assessments. Personal exper ience and opinions of those conducting clinical trials in the chiropractic community were also cons idered. The literature on outcome assessments can be divide d into studies that have concentrated on the development of procedures, those that have test ed procedures for validity and reliability, and tho se that have used the procedures in assessing the effe cts of care in randomized clinical trials. The lat ter studies provide the best information on responsiven ess. The literature review will be divided into five maj or subtopics, reflecting the nature of the outcome assessment procedures under discussion; (1) functional outcome assessments; (2) patient perception outcome assessments; (3) general health outcome assessments; (4) physiological outcome assessments; and (5) the subluxation syndrome as an outcome assessment. Disease-specific physiological measurements related to intervention outcomes number in the hundreds if not thousands, so only a small number o f most relevant procedures deemed important to chiropractic practice are described here. Others a re described in other chapters. The subluxation syndrome as an outcome assessment has elements of f unction, perception and physiology, but requires special consideration because of its impor tance to chiropractic clinical theory and practice. It is difficult to conceptually separate some of th e physiological outcomes from those related more specifically to the subluxation syndrome. Som e readers may therefore disagree with the committee's categorization and feel that some proce dures under physiological outcomes should be relegated to the subluxation syndrome category. Th e argument exists because there are different opinions about just how comprehensive the definitio n of the subluxation syndrome should be in terms of encompassing different types of spinal and locom otor patho-physiology or dysfunction. Economic outcomes (assessing the costs and cost-eff ectiveness of care) are becoming increasingly important. Indeed, some have argued t hat cost accountability is more important to port of pain, overall clinical improvement assessed by t he patient, overall clinical improvement assessed by the practitioner, range of trunk flexion, range of trunk extension, straight leg raising, work acti vities, and activities of daily living. In general, the outcomes showing the greatest impro vement with care by spinal adjustment or manipulation were the functional measures (activiti es of daily living) and patients' report of pain. Outcome assessments in the form of ranges of trunk motion did not indicate as much improvement on the average, although improvement was certainly dem onstrated in a proportion of studies. Clinical trials using the straight leg raising test as an in dicator of improvement demonstrated mixed results, which is not surprising given the very mixed nature of the patients' complaints. Most clinical trial investigators created their own functional scales and so did not use standardized outcome assessments of known validity and reliability. Berquist-Ullman (1977) used patients' reports of pain and dysfunctions. Rasmusse n (1979) used a measure of pain, spinal mobility, function and \"fitness for work.\" Coxhead et al. (198 1) reported measures of patient report of pain and return to work. Ongley et al. (1987) reported disabi lity scores, and visual analog scales. MacDonald et al. (1990) used a disability scale and a linear analog pain scale. Nevertheless, most trials demonstrated a responsiveness to care. Hadler et al. (1987) used the standard Roland Morri s Disability scale while Meade et al. (1990) used the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire. Hsieh (1991) concluded that the Roland Morris Questionnaire and the Oswesyry Questionnaire gave c onsistent but slightly different results in a chiropractic clinical trial.-255-Clinicians contemplating the use of functional inst ruments should be aware of differences between them and be able to choose the most appropr iate assessment for their specific situation. Patient Perceptions Outcome Assessments Patient perceptions of pain and satisfaction have n ot traditionally been considered very important as outcomes in any quantitative fashion. This is probably because it was felt that patient perceptions were too subjective and variable to be of much use. This is despite the fact that clinica l impressions of the value of treatments are most lik ely based on favorable comments by patients to their practitioners. Currently, however, health se rvices researchers have discovered that patient perceptions, measured with appropriate procedures, may be an excellent way to measure many aspects of the quality of care (Donabedian, 1980; C herkin, 1990). Pain: Pain is a perception. Pain upon palpation and moti on tests directed by the doctor of chiropractic are important indicators of joint malf unction and malposition. Such tests are unique to chiropractic practice and are used not only to dete rmine the articular misalignment but to determine techniques and need for adjustive procedures. In t he assessment of a chiropractic case these assume an important analytical role. Low-back and neck pain probably represent about two thirds of all chiropractic patient concerns (Nyiendo 1989). There is a great deal of research in the scientific literature on pain measurement (McDowell, 1987; Melzack, 1983; Vernon, 1990). Indeed, many or thopedic and neurologic examination procedures rely upon patients' report of pain provo cation. To discuss the entire range of potential assessment methods is again beyond the scope of thi s chapter, but details may be found in the references noted above and in other chapters. Pain has a number of dimensions including severity (intensity), duration, and frequency. The dimension that is most commonly assessed is severit y (Jensen, 1986). Methods run the gamut from single questions to complex surveys. In most cases , the patients report their own perception of pain. Visual Analog Scales (VAS) consist of a 10cm line a nchored by two pain descriptors at either end of the line. Patients are asked to mark on the line a point that represents their perceived pain intensity. The properties of VAS have been extensiv ely studied (Huskisson, 1982). Numerical Rating Scales ask the patient to choose a number between 0-100 that represents their pain intensity. Another pain scale uses 11 r anked levels numbered 0-11 graphically depicted in boxes. The so-called \"Behavioral Rating Scale\" has six lev els, each with a description such as for the third level, \"pain present, cannot be ignored, but does not interfere with everyday activities.\" Verb al rating scales use single word descriptors in three, four, five or more ranks. One commonly used scale from the McGill/Melzack Pai n Questionnaire called the Present Pain Intensity scale uses the words, \"none, mild, discom forting, horrible, and excruciating.\" An interesting comparison among the scales mentione d above indicated there were few differences between them, except that the \"Visual A nalog Scale\" and the \"Numerical Rating Scale\" were more practical (Jensen, 1986). Pain diaries can be useful to measure other dimensi ons of pain. Patients are instructed to daily indicate on a form the intensity, duration an d frequency of their pain complaints. Parker (1978 ) used a patient report headache diary of severity, d uration and frequency and a disability score calculated from it. Plain diaries may also be very useful for single-case time-series research design s (Keating, 1985).-256-A famous pain measurement instrument is the McGill/ Melzack Pain Questionnaire (Melzack, 1975). It has been used in back pain treatment res earch and to describe chiropractic patients (Nyiendo, 1990). The McGill Questionnaire consists of twenty categories of words that describe qualities of pain. Patients indicate which words a pply in their case. At least six different pain va riables can be calculated from the instrument. While relat ively well-studied in terms of validity and reliabi lity (McDowell, 1987), it may present some practical dif ficulties in clinical practice because it should be administered by an interviewer. Most, if not all, clinical trials of SMT have utili zed some way of measuring pain. For example, Coyer and Curwen (1955) used an outcome of \"well\" d efined by lack of signs and symptoms of low- back pain presumably judged by the practitioner in consultation with the patient. Edwards (1969) assessed care on a five point scale of signs and sy mptoms judged by the doctor. Glover et al. (1974) used a scale of pain relief from 1-100%. Doran and N ewell (1975) used a patient-reported six level pain relief scale. Koes et al. (1991) reported a ran domized clinical trial for back and neck pain using severity of complaints and \"global perceived effect ,\" a subjective assessment of overall improvement. Lopes et al. (1991) in another clinical trial for cervical pain assessed pain and range of motion comparing a single manipulation to a mobilization. Both favorably affect range of motion, but pain measures favored manipulation. Patient Satisfaction: Patient satisfaction is an important perception ha ving not only to do with the actual effectiveness of care, but also the sett ing and the process of receiving care (Donabedian, 1980). Patient satisfaction may be an important ma rker of quality of care (Cleary, 1988), and it is increasingly evident that patient satisfaction is a consumer marketing target for managed care organizations. Patient satisfaction outcomes have been studied by Ware and others (Ware, 1978; Lochman, 1983). Clearly, there are a number of dimensions t hat can be measured. They include: interpersonal manner, technical quality, efficacy/outcomes, acces sibility/convenience, finances, continuity, physica l environment, and availability. The Patient Satisfa ction Questionnaire measures all eight dimensions (Ware, 1983). Ware also developed four questions t hat measure general satisfaction with care. According to Cherkin (1990), the Visit-Specific Sat isfaction Questionnaire (Ware, 1988) is probably very appropriate for chiropractic outcomes. Deyo (1986) developed a patient satisfaction scale specifically for patients with low-back pain. Recently, Cherkin (in press) developed and validat ed a back pain patient questionnaire that addressed three key dimensions of satisfaction: car ing, information, and effectiveness. One of the valuable aspects of assessing patient sa tisfaction is its global nature. For the great majority of ambulatory patients, certain dimensions of satisfaction may be assessed regardless of the nature of the health complaint or the doctor's clin ical finding. Works by Sawyer (1991), Cherkin (1989), and Kane (1974) have suggested high levels of satisfaction with chiropractic care. General Health Outcome Assessments Assessment of general health status is philosophica lly congruent with the chiropractic viewpoint; that is, an emphasis on health as oppose d to disease. General health has been notoriously difficult to define in operational terms, but progr ess in recent years has led to the development of a number of useful instruments that are increasingly being used as assessments of the outcome of health care (Nelson, 1989; Bronfort, 1991). A full d etailed discussion of health status measurement is beyond the present scope, but an excellent revie w of the difficult conceptual issues and examples of various scales may be found in the book edited b y Spilker entitled, Quality of Life Assessments in Clinical Trials (1990), and in other references (Ki rschner, 1987).-257-The Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) (Bergner, 1981) i s an extensively studied patient survey of a number of behavioral and psychosocial dimensions thought to reflect general health status; sleep and rest, eating, work, home management, recreation and pastimes, ambulation, mobility, body care and movement, social interaction, alertness behavio r, emotional behavior, and communication. It has been used in back pain research (Deyo, 1986) as wel l as in other areas. Another measure of general health was developed dur ing the Medical Outcomes Study (Stewart, 1988) and has now been modified by Inters tudy (1990). The SF36 questionnaire measures three major health attributes (functional status, w ell-being, and overall evaluation of health) and ei ght health concepts which yield eight indices: physical functioning, social functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, role limitations due to emoti onal problems, mental health, energy/fatigue, pain, and general health perception (Interstudy, 1990). The SF36 appears to be a useful way to standardize assessments across many types of clinical settings and for a variety of types of patients. The SF36 has been and is being used in several chiropractic outcome studies (Nyiendo, 1991; Kassak, 1991; Jose, 1991). Another useful general health measure is the set of COOP Charts (Nelson, 1987). These utilize simple representative pictures as choices t o answers that yield nine indices of general health . Three focus on specific dimensions of function, tw o are related to symptoms or feelings, three are concerned with perceptions, and one is a health cov ariate. They appear to be very practical, easy to administer and score and correlate well with other less practical measures. Physiological Outcome Assessments Range of Motion (regional): A standard examination of spinal and other joint ph ysiology may include the measurement of the range of motion (ROM ) that can be obtained by the patient. ROM is used to assess disability and impairment because of the assumed relationship to spinal function (AMA, 1988). Lack of motion is also considered a dysfunc tion that can be effectively addressed by a variety of manual and rehabilitative procedures. Commonly, these include chiropractic adjustments. I n this section, regional trunk and neck mobility alon g with peripheral joint mobility will be considered . Segmental spinal joint mobility is addressed in the section on subluxation syndrome. Devices and methods of measuring ROM range from the simple to the sublime. Standard joint goniometers are common, but now there are more soph isticated tools, many with electronic data recording capabilities. Mobility can be assessed w ith the patient actively involved, or as the passiv e object being mobilized. One or all planes of motio n may be assessed. The reliability of a number of common methods of me asuring trunk mobility of the lumbar spine was reviewed by Liebenson (1989). He concluded tha t the modified Schober technique, inclinometers, flexible rulers, and spondylometers had received th e most scientific support. The fingertip-to-floor method was not considered valid because of errors i ntroduced by hip motion, hamstring flexibility and arm length. Zachman (1989) compared a simple goniome ter and the \"rangiometer\" and assessed examiner reliability for cervical ROMs. The \"rangi ometer\" was considered moderately reliable. Nansel (1989) concluded that taking the mean of five repea ted measures of cervical lateral flexion with an inclinometer was also a reliable method. The responsiveness of kinematic measurements of the range of regional spine motion (neck or trunk mobility) has been repeatedly demonstrated in clinical trials (Anderson, in press; Ottenbache r, 1985), and under laboratory conditions. Nansel et al . (1989) measured cervical lateral bending asymmetries with a simple goniometer and found they could be reduced by lower cervical adjustments. In additional study, rotational asymmetries in the transverse plane were reduced by upper cervical-258-adjustments (Nansel, 1991). Evans (1978) reported outcomes of spinal flexion, w hile Sims-Williams (1978,1979) used spinal mobility and straight leg raising. Zylbergold (1981) made use of assessments of spinal mobility, and Nwuga (1982) used measures of spinal mobility and s traight leg raising. Farrell (1982) used a functional rating questionnaire and lumbar motions as outcomes. Godfrey et al. (1984) utilized spinal mobility, while Gibson (1985) measured spinal flexi on. Arkuszewski (1986) used six signs and symptoms on a three point scale: posture, gait, pain, active spinal mobility, manual examination of spine , and a neurological evaluation. Waagen (1986) used a global index of spinal mobility created by s umming the results of all planes of motion. Mathews (1987) also measure spinal mobility. Hoehler (1981) used measures of spinal mobility, straight leg raising, activities of daily living, and patient re port of effectiveness. While most studies of SMT have concentrated on lumb ar spinal mobility, a number of trials assessed motion in the cervical spine. Brodin (1982) measured neck pain and cervical mobility as outcomes. Nordemar (1981) and Meal (1986) used neck pain and cervical mobility. Howe (1983) assessed measures of cervical mobility and improvem ent in pain and stiffness. Lopex (1991) also assessed range of motion and pain immediately after manipulation. Training and practice are required to conduct a val id and reliable assessment of ROM. Clinicians should be aware of the range of errors i nherent in a chosen method. Also, such issues as patient positioning, patient motivation and proper interpretation of the instrument must be addressed. The cost of measuring devices can range from $15.0 0 to many thousands of dollars depending on the sophistication. Done skillfully, measuring ROM is generally safe. Muscle Function: The evaluation of muscle function encompasses a num ber of parameters: strength, work and power, and endurance (Sapega, 19 90). Several modes of muscle contraction can be tested separately. These are termed isotonic, i sokinetic, and isometric. The distinctions center upon the nature of the applied load or by the veloc ity and direction of change in the length of the muscle. Concentric contractions indicate a shorten ing of the muscle whereas eccentric contractions occur as the muscle is lengthening. Various sophis ticated machines can now measure various combinations of these muscle function parameters in the extremities and the spine. Quite a number of factors can affect the validity a nd reliability of muscle function testing. These include but are not limited to: stabilization and positioning of the body, velocity of test movements, gravitational influences, familiarity wi th testing procedures, inertial forces, calibration , time of day, and patient motivation (Sapega, 1990). Most manual muscle testing procedures which are com monly used in the chiropractic profession combine elements of isometric testing wi th eccentric dynamic variable resistance. Manual methods are qualitative. It has been shown that ex aminers interpret muscular strength or weakness more on the basis of total effort they exert while overcoming a patient's resistance than on either th e peak or average force (Sapega, 1990). This lessens the validity of manual tests as true tests of muscular strength (Nicholas, 1978). In one study, patients with as much as a 50% decrease in strength were rated as normal by manual methods (Wa tkins, 1984). Trained examiners found it difficult to detect differences of less than 25% between pair ed limbs (Beasley, 1956). The reliability of manual muscle testing was assess ed with a dynamometer in a chiropractic setting (Hsieh, 1990). The authors concluded that the \"patient initiated\" method yielded satisfactory scores for tests of the iliopsoas, the clavicular p ortion of the pectoralis major, and the external ro tators of the hip. Dynamometers have also shown fair to g ood reliability in other studies (Sapega, 1990). There are no clinical reliability studies of manua l muscle testing as used in some chiropractic-259-techniques where a dichotomous decision (\"strong\" v s \"weak\") is required. There are no clinical trial s of a retrospective or prospective nature demonstrat ing the responsiveness of manual muscle testing to chiropractic care. Instrumental measures of muscle function are furthe r described in the chapter on instrumentation. Each method has advantages and di sadvantages, but most have demonstrated adequate reliability when strict protocols are foll owed, and the ability to demonstrate changes in patients undergoing exercise or musculoskeletal reh abilitation. Manual muscle tests are practical and generally saf e. The instrumented methods can be inexpensive in the case of handheld dynamometers to many thousands of dollars for the more sophisticated computerized measurement systems. If risks are minimized by following proper testing protocols the instrumented methods are also safe. Posture: Postural measures are defined here to include measu rements of humans of generally topographical nature. Anatomical relations include apparent limb length inequality, the shape of the spine (degree of lordosis, scoliosis, kyphosis) etc . Apparent leg length inequality (specifically, lower limb length inequality) is often used as an indication for chiropractic care. There are many a ssessment methods; some are discussed in the chapter on instrumentation. The topic has been exten sively reviewed by Mannello (1991). A range of clinical reliability has been established for so me methods. Two studies indicate that adjustments/manual proced ures may increase cervical lordosis (measured 199 0). Subluxation Assessment: The \"vertebral subluxation\" has been referred to as an event in which a vertebra has moved outside of its normal ju xtaposition with the vertebra above or below. The normal architecture of the intervertebral foramina, which are formed by two interlocking arches above and below, is altered by this aberrant position and could cause impingement on the spinal nerve. If impingement occurred, this would interfere with the conduction of impulses innately generated within the brain and subsequently passing through neural t issue with the result that tissues supplied by the affected nerves could suffer some form of functiona l insult. The term chiropractic was named by a minister, Dr. Samuel Weed and means \"done by hand.\" Interpretations of this definition vary with the s tate laws governing chiropractic and correlates wit h the chiropractic scope of practice and school of though t. The chiropractic paradigm statement referenced in the Forward represents the clearest, most concis e consensus statement regarding chiropractic's self-definition and has relevance in the discussion of every aspect of the guidelines process includin g outcomes assessment. The effects and importance of the vertebral subluxa tion can be divided into three major categories: A. Immediate local effects which may include irritat ion, inflammation, and degeneration at the vertebral level. B. Mechanical effects which include aberrations in m otion, posture and overall mechanical function of the spine. C. Physiologic effects which especially include dist urbances in the nervous and circulatory systems. As a result of the numerous structural and function al studies, these general effects of the vertebral subluxation have been focused into five c ategories:-260-1. Spinal Kinesiopathology which generally refers to the abnormal position and motion of the vertebra involved in the subluxation. Outcomes assessment parameters would include palpat ion analyses, X-ray analyses, computed tomography and MRI imaging, postural aberr ations, goniometric assessment, videofluroscopic analyses, range of motion assessme nt, leg length check analyses. 2. Neuropathophysiology refers to abnormal nervous s ystem function which is the most significant component of the vertebral subluxation. Assessment criteria would include somatic pain, par esthesia, hyperesthesia, hypesthesia through case history and questionnaire determination, somatic motor assessment through muscle analyses and complete neu rologic assessment of the neuraxis as well as complete afferent and efferent assessment. In addition, MRI and CT Scans provide evidence of nerve structural damag e which correlates with the neuropathophysiologic component. Visceromotor determ inations via heat sensitive devices, thermography and thermometry. Additional research and quality assurance studies are needed in this area. Further research on the piezoelectric and pyroelectric effects of bone and corresponding effects on nerve function also need further study. 3. Myopathology refers to the abnormal changes in mu scle function due to the vertebral subluxation. Outcomes assessment criteria (electro-myograph) determinations, neuropressure and sensitivity, range motion determination, paraspinal tissue co mpliance, gain symmetry, Cybex testing. 4. Histopathology represents the abnormal changes to soft tissues involved in the vertebral subluxation. Assessment protocols primarily include the determin ation of disc and ligament-integrity by means of X-ray and other imaging methods. 5. Pathophysiology refers to the generalized abnorma l changes generated in the spine and body as a consequence of the vertebral subluxat ion. Spinal pathophysiology is assessed primarily throug h radiographic, and other imaging determinations of bone degeneration. Pathophysiolo gy peripheral to the spine remains the subject of scientific investigation. Continued research into the involvement of the nervous system in modulating immune function will r epresent significant outcome measure in the future. Succinctly, the foundation of chiropractic rests on the premise that structural distortion causes interference to normal nerve transmission and resul ts in the symptoms and tissue changes of disease. The basic chiropractic analysis consists of manual palpation of the bony elements of the spine, manual assessment of the motion of the spine and in dividual vertebra, and palpation of the numerous muscles which attach and control spine and vertebra l motion. Additional analytic tools for the field chiropractor would include X-ray, devices to assess spinal and vertebral motion and posture, as well as instruments used to assess muscle function and s kin temperature. Additional research will generate techniques and devices which can effectively assess physiologic dysfunction resulting from the vertebral subluxation. Assessment of vertebral from this anal ysis, necessitates a choice of adjusting-261-techniques by the chiropractor to safely and effect ively eliminate the vertebral subluxation. A discussion of the various chiropractic adjusting te chniques and their effectiveness is outside the sco pe of this document. However, outcomes assessment for the chiropractor will depend on the specific analysis used to determine the presence of the vert ebral subluxation as well as the exact adjustment methodology utilized in correcting the subluxation. Exactness in chiropractic analysis, vertebral sublu xation determination, and chiropractic adjustment protocol are essential components to pra ctitioner based outcomes assessment. Schafer (1984) has noted that \"it is this exactness of diff erentiation and specificity of correction that has been stressed by the chiropractic profession and has dis tinguished it from other health sciences that also use manipulation, mechanical therapy, physical ther apy, or similar procedures.\" The most exact criteria, indicative of vertebral su bluxations, utilized by the field chiropractor focus on structural alterations in the spine. Ther efore, the most measurable and exact data for outcomes assessment of chiropractic adjustments ste ms from structural criteria. However, such structural or mechanical faults are not the major c riteria constituting the vertebral subluxation. Aberrant physiology, most notably neurophysiology, signifies a critical negative effect of the vertebr al subluxation on homeostasis. This altered physiolog y for which there is no underlying structural pathology has been termed by Whatmore and Kohi (197 4) physiopathology. Functional disorders and functional illness have th eir origin in such physiopathology \"Signal transmission in a complex system of neurons and end ocrine fluids and signaling factors within this physiologic system are considered basic factors in the etiology of functional disorders.\" Fries and Crapo (1981) emphasize that the similarity among ch ronic diseases is that they all represent gradual long term breakdown of the body's physiologic funct ions; a process that begins imperceptibly, long before the first symptoms arise. Outcomes of chiro practic care based on data collected from functiona l analyses represent less exact means of assessment f or the field chiropractor. Improved function, elimination of functional disord ers, quality of life, etc., represent outcomes of chiropractic care best assessed by process exter nal to the chiropractic care best assessed by process external to the chiropractor-patient relati onship, e.g. government agencies, insurance companies, hospital studies, etc. An extensive colle ction of scientific studies supporting the function al disorders resulting from the vertebral subluxation have been reviewed elsewhere. Least exact methods of outcome assessment of the ch iropractor-patient relationship stem from pain and symptom determinations. Pain and symptoms are not necessary correlates to the vertebral subluxation. However, elimination of the vertebral subluxation and the improved spinal and general physiologic function that results, can generally re duce and eliminate patient pain and symptoms. Although pain and symptom relief represent the majo r patient rationale for seeking chiropractic care, an outcome objective of the chiropractor is patient compliance with a cooperative chiropractic health care program which is not necessarily pain and symp tom related. Patient based assessment of chiropractic care utilizes questionnaires, satisfac tion, pain ratings such as the Oswestry Pain Questionnaire, Dallas and McGill Questionnaires, vi sual-analog scales, and general health and performance status assessments by the COOP and SF-3 6 systems and traditional methods of measuring physical and physiological function. A philosophical premise within chiropractic is the vitalistic principle which recognizes that an \"innate intelligence\" actively organizes and mainta ins all living things. Vitalism permeated ancient medical writings and was apparent in the works of H ippocrates who believed that a \"vital spirit\" was responsible for \"life\" and the \"natural self-healin g tendency of the body.\" The vitalistic principle was essentially replaced in the Twentieth Century by a chemical-mechanistic concept of life in which livin g things were viewed as machines whose capabilities w ere constrained to those functions permitted by this model. Vitalistic attributes such as autonomy and self-healing do not exist in this model. Beck er (1990) believes that this paradigm has ruled the al lopathic model, \"limiting both the methods that cou ld be used to bring about a cure and our perceptions o f the ability of the human body to heal itself.\" T he-262-mechanistic paradigm has failed in many ways to pre vent disease as well as to cure patients. Dissatisfaction with the mechanistic concept has re sulted in a vitalistic resurgence emphasizing prope r nutrition, exercises, meditation as well as a \"reaf firmation of the innate healing ability of living t hings.\" The chiropractic profession has recognized the impo rtance of a proper functioning spine to insure homeostasis within the nervous system, since it is through the nervous system that the innate self-healing capacity can be expressed. Proper fun ction, rather than simply symptomatic relief, is th e paradigm objective of the chiropractic standard of care. Questionnaires and surveys of patient function and quality of life, similar to SF-36 and COOP charts, represent the best means, currently available, for outcome assessment of the vitalistic component of chiropractic care. Both the COOP charts and the SF-36 address health concepts such a s functional status, overall health and well-being, and quality of life. Health attributes relating to function include: physical, emotional, role and so cial functioning. Pain, overall physical and mental hea lth, health changes, vitality and energy, etc., mak e up the overall health and well-being component. Qu ality of life perceptions, social support and healt h changes provide measures for a quality of life asse ssment. These documents can be tailored to individual practices but should have a standardized component for external agency data assessment and evaluation. IV. RECOMMENDATIONS A. Functional Outcome Assessments (By Questionnair e) As a category, functional outcome assessments of ev eryday tasks are very suitable for evaluating care of dysfunctions of the spine, s pinal nerves and related structures and tissues. Many questionnaires could be used; choice should depend upon the validity, reliability, responsiveness, and practicality demon strated in the scientific literature. 13.1.1 Rating : Established Evidence: Class I, II, III B. Patient Perception Outcome Assessments Pain: Pain measurement is generally a relevant, valid, reliable, responsive, and safe outcome assessment. Practicality may vary dependin g on the specific procedure used. 13.2.1 Rating : Established Evidence: Class I, II, III Patient Satisfaction Measures : Patient satisfaction measures are an important ma rker of quality and are useful in clinical practice. Sa tisfaction is best assessed using standard questionnaires measuring a number of dimensions. S cales may be found in the scientific literature. Although additional research as satisf action relates to chiropractic practice is required, validity, reliability, responsiveness, re levance, safety and practicality are scientifically supported. 13.2.2 Rating : Established Evidence: Class I, II, III C. Vitalistic Assessment General Health/Quality of Life Assessment: Due to a lack of measures capable of assessing innate self-healing capacities, surveys a nd questionnaires, such as the SF-36 and-263-COOP charts, which do not focus on pain and symptom atology, may be used as acceptable, safe and valid measures of outcome of chiropractic care. 13.3.1 Rating : Strong Positive Recommendation Evidence: Class: E, L D. Patient Compliance Assessment Chiropractic Health Care Assessment: Practitioner based assessment forms and surveys should be utilized which measure patient co mpliance with chiropractic designed programs for Level III care and which measure patie nt growth in understanding of the components of health and chiropractic. 13.4.1 Rating : Strong Positive Recommendation Evidence: Class: E, L E. General Health Outcome Assessments As a category of outcomes, general health is possib le and desirable to assess. Depending on the particular scale chosen, validity, reliability, and responsiveness have been demonstrated. The measures are safe; some are more practical than others. General health assessments should be used along with condition spe cific assessments. 13.5.1 Rating : Established Evidence: Class I, II, III F. Physiological Outcomes Range of Motion: Depending upon the method applied, assessment of range of motion is a valid, reliable, responsive, safe outcome asse ssment. Depending on the level of automation, practical considerations may vary. 13.6.1. Rating : Established Evidence: Class I, II, III Thermography: Thermographic exams of the trunk and extremities wi th infrared or liquid crystal may be valid as a chiropractic asses sment tool. The procedures are generally safe. Thermograms should be interpreted by those t rained in the procedure. 13.6.2 Rating : Established Evidence: Class III Muscle Function: There are many methods of assessing the parameter s of muscle function. Manual methods have not been explored ad equately enough to assure validity, reliability, relevance and responsiveness to care. Manual methods, however, are practical and generally safe and tend to be popular. Studies wit h automated methods (e.g. Cybex, etc.) have suggested a greater level of confidence, but r equire expert training, and are time- consuming. 13.6.3 Rating : Established Evidence: Class I, II, III Postural Evaluations: Certain postural parameters may be responsive to care, but validity, reliability and relevance issues still ne ed to be addressed scientifically. Depending on the method, postural observations are practical and safe.-264-13.6.4 Rating : Established Evidence: Class II, III G. Subluxation Assessment The subluxation assessment provides decision-making information for application of chiropractic care methods, primarily adjustments. Regarding outcome assessments, the various components must be considered separately. These are discussed below. Vertebral Position Assessed Radiographically : The clinical relevance of small changes in vertebral position are of importance chiropracti cally. Responsiveness of vertebral position to adjustive care has been established in many case s. Observational studies have not ruled it out. Many practitioners accept measurement of v ertebral position as routine and customary. This risk/benefit ratio of using radiographs for m easuring vertebral position as an outcome assessment should be carefully considered. 13.7.1 Rating : Established Evidence: Class II, III Abnormal Segmental Motion/Lack of Joint End-play As sessed by Palpation: There are a few validity studies of joint palpation. There a re studies suggesting that palpatory signs diminish with care, but the degree of responsivenes s has been difficult to quantify. In skilled hands, palpation is safe and yields valuable inform ation to the doctor of chiropractic. 13.7.2 Rating : Established Evidence: Class II, III Soft-Tissue Compliance and Tenderness: Clinical studies indicate a relationship between tenderness and painful neuromusculoskeletal conditions. Clinical reliability has been established. Compliance and t enderness appear to be responsive to care. Algometers, tissue compliance me ters, and palpatory methods are practical and safe. 13.7.4 Rating : Established Evidence: Class II, III Asymmetric or Hypertonic Muscle Contraction: There is no question that surface EMG procedures measure some aspects of muscle activity. Surface methods are safe. 13.7.5 Rating : Established Evidence: Class II, III H. Principles of Application Outcome assessments should only be performed and in terpreted by appropriately trained and qualified individuals. 13.8.1 Rating : Necessary Evidence: Class II, III When outcome assessments are used, consideration mu st be made for their established test properties, for patient compliance , and for the nature of the condition(s) being assessed.-265-13.8.2 Rating : Necessary Evidence: Class II, III Patient outcomes should be assessed at appropriate intervals during case management depending upon the nature of the conditi on and the patient's progress. 13.8.3 Rating : Discretionary Evidence: Class II, III Generic functional and health status outcome measur ements are helpful for comparing outcomes across different patient populations and m ethods of care intervention. Outcome information is very valuable to doctors of chiropractic, and to the chiropractic profession. Therefore, whenever feasible, a genera l health outcome of chiropractic care should be assessed by a standardized, commonly accepted method; and whenever feasible, a condition specific outcome of chiropractic care should be assessed by a standardized, commonly accepted metho d. 13.8.4 Rating : Recommended Evidence: Class II, III V. COMMENTS Many of the rated measures used to assess the outco me of chiropractic patient care concentrate on the structural components of the ver tebral subluxation and other malpositioned articulations and structures. However, chiropracto rs recognize the vital importance of a properly functioning spine and nervous system to promote the expression of an individual's self-healing capabilities. Scientific literature has illuminated the significa nt relationship between spinal function and neurophysiology. Nerve interference impacts on tot al body function. The next century promises to provide valid and reliable measures for chiropracto rs to assess aberrations in nerve function resultin g from the vertebral subluxation and other malpositio ned articulations and structures. Vitalistic force s, which are best expressed through a nervous system f ree of interference, represent the most exciting future possibilities for outcome assessment. The continued validation and evaluation of the effic acy of these techniques should be endorsed by the profession in order to provide the best possible methodologies for patient care. Multilevel outcomes assessment methods will be neces sary to insure quality control and effectiveness in future health care delivery system s, especially chiropractic care. The significant values derived from any outcomes as sessment lie within the processes for data evaluation and implementation of appropriate change s. An ever evolving increase in the quality, effectiveness, and cost efficiency of Chiropractic care must be realized from the outcomes assessment process. VI.

OVERVIEW The chiropractic profession has evolved and continu es to develop within a similar dynamic process as have other professions. Research in the areas of professional education and continuing education has delineated characteristics of profess ionalism. These characteristics focus upon the central themes of education, credentialing, profess ional organizations, ethical considerations and leg al reinforcement. Each characteristic speaks to the d ynamic development of a profession as it moves toward greater organization, influence, and respons ibility to the public that it serves. This chapter will relate these common characteristi cs of professionalism to the chiropractic profession and will present models to be used for f uture development. II. LIST OF SUBTOPICS A. Continuing Education III. LITERATURE REVIEW The literature search was conducted through primary sources, printed indexes, computerized bibliographic databases and in a library card catal og. Printed indexes searched included the Index to Chiropractic Literature 1980-1990, the Chiropractic Literature Index 1970-1979, and the Chiropractic Research Archives Collection (Vols 1-3). The compu terized database searched was Medline, the National Library of Medicine's current medical lite rature database. Finally, searches for relevant materials were conducted in the card catalog of the David D. Palmer Health Sciences Library. Both specific thesaurus terms and \"keyword\" terms w ere searches in these resources. A sampling of thesaurus, keyword terms and concepts s earched included: professional responsibility; prof essional responsibility; peer review; information literacy. A. Chiropractic Education The doctor of chiropractic is educated in the basic and clinical sciences as well as in related health subjects. Chiropractic science concerns its elf with the relationship between structure (primar ily the spine) and function (primarily the nervous syst em) as that relationship may affect the restoration and preservation of health. The purpose of chiropr actic professional education is to prepare the doctor of chiropractic to serve as a primary care, portal of entry practitioner into the health care delivery system. He/she must be well educated to e valuate the patient, to provide care, and to consul t with or refer to other health care providers. All applicants to chiropractic colleges must have s uccessfully completed a minimum of 60 semester hours, or equivalent, of college credits f rom a nationally recognized accrediting body. The Council of Chiropractic Education, the national accrediting agency for chiropractic colleges recognized by the U.S. Department of Education for this purpose, produces a standards document specifying requirements for chiropractic educationa l institutions and programs. However, there is no CCE standard regarding residency or specialty progr ams. At present, criteria governing postgraduate educational programs are at the discretion of the r espective colleges. Numerous national-279-organizations have established chiropractic specialt y councils with specific guidelines and requirements determination by those organizations. The needs of society require that chiropractic prac titioners be able to carry out their duties according to the highest possible standards of char acter, competence and practice. Chiropractic is a philosophy, science, and art based on the applica tion of a complex body of scientific knowledge. Competence in solving problems, capacity to use com plex knowledge and a sensitive awareness of ethical problems are related to the entire lifelong learning process of the individual practitioner. B. Credentialing Credentialing is a formal means by which the capabi lities of the individual practitioner to perform duties at an acceptable level are recognize d. The major instrument for licensure within the chiropractic profession is the state government whi ch fulfills this function with guidance from the profession in setting examination policies and test ing the applicants. In all states an applicant for license to practice must supply evidence of successful completion of an approved program of chiropractic education le ading to the doctor of chiropractic degree, and proficiency by passing required examinations to dem onstrate mastery of basic and practical elements of chiropractic as defined in that state. National testing for the profession is conducted by the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners. The National Board examinations address basic and clinical sciences. The examination scores are recognized by all states in partial fulf illment of licensure requirements. A subsequent component of licensure is continuing education. Th e purpose of continuing professional education is to update theoretical knowledge, technique skill s and clinical applications. To be effective conti nuing education should enhance successful clinical perfor mance of practitioners. In addition, continuing education must be truly \"continuing,\" not sporadic or opportunistic, and must be self-directed, with each professional being the ultimate monitor of his or her own learning. The ultimate test of a continuing education program is in the improvement of clinical outcomes and thus the quality of service. Currently many states require evidence of board-app roved continuing education for license renewal. This requirement may range from 24 to 40 hours every two years with some states requiring specific areas of focus for credit hours. While it is recognized that mandatory continuing education requirement for license renewal does not equate wit h continuing competency, it is the consensus of licensing boards that practitioners need to remain knowledgeable and maintain skills current with standards within the profession. Postgraduate continuing education is offered in man y fields including, including but not limited to, chiropractic neurology, adjustive techniques, p ediatrics, fitness and sports injuries, nutrition, and occupational health. These courses are taught and monitored by chiropractic educational institutions and have specific requirements for practitioners to meet board certification status. However, postgraduate specialty programs and credentialing r equires individual evaluation with respect to reliability, standardization of education, and its implication regarding quality of care. C. Ethical Considerations Ethical principles in chiropractic care focus on pa tient rights. A code of ethics addresses the professional principles each practitioner should ad opt in all interactions with patients, the public, and other practitioners. The International Chiropracto rs Association has adopted a code of professional ethics that is made available to every member and m ay be easily referenced by non-members and the general public. ICA holds that ethical profess ional conduct is an essential component of quality-280-health care in all health professions. Fundamental values and ethical principles in health care focus around three main principles: beneficence, justice and respect for persons. Res pect for persons encompasses a central theme of treating patients as individuals with rights. Pati ents have the right to know, the right to privacy, and the right to acknowledge and make choices about car e. Central to this concept is informed consent, confidentiality and presenting patients with inform ation regarding conditions and remedial care. This concept also speaks to the practitioner's nee d to maintain the patient's autonomy by sharing knowledge, providing self-help measures, an d avoiding physician dependency. Justice demands universal fairness. Health care resources and opportunities for care should be available regardless of race, creed, and/or economic status. Inherent in this concept is the practitioner's responsibility to maintain standards of quality car e, including the consistency of care. Beneficence focuses on the doctor's duty to care. Inherent in this responsibility is the duty \"to do good and avo id doing harm.\" Both national chiropractic associations and all sta te chiropractic associations have codified ethics for their members. State licensing boards h ave laws and administrative rules that include ethi cal considerations which the practitioner must adhere t o for continued licensure. The practitioner's demeanor and behavior impact gre atly on the patient. There is a moral, ethical and professional obligation to treat each p atient with skill, dedication and respect. Health care professionals should remain aware of those issues i f they are to establish appropriate patient-provide r relationships. An optimal supportive doctor/patien t relationship is generated by an honest, caring an d concerned attitude. Advertising and marketing are common within all hea lth care professions. Promotion of chiropractic should be in a responsible, informativ e, and professional manner. State law dictates tha t advertising should not be false, misleading or dece ptive. In addition, promises of cure or statements that would create unjustified expectations of benef icial care should be avoided. D. Research Chiropractic researchers, clinicians, and administr ators have emphasized the paucity of well- designed research studies in the field of chiroprac tic practice, and the importance of clinical resear ch to the profession. Individual practitioners have i mportant roles to play in research. Practice experience provides the opportunity to report on cl inical phenomena and observations and propose diagnostic and care outcomes in the literature. Cl inicians, professional organizations, and chiroprac tic academic personnel should continue to be involved i n and supportive of research activities conjoint with other health care professionals.

OVERVIEW The purpose of all imaging technologies utilized by the chiropractic profession is primarily to gain analytical information concerning the vertebra l subluxation and other malpositioned articulations and structures. Historically, basic radiography ha s been the sole imaging modality used. Although basic radiography continues to be the primary imagi ng technology for chiropractic analysis, recent developments in imaging technology have provided ad ditional methods for gaining visual information about the vertebral subluxation and other malpositi oned articulations and structures. This document presents the current knowledge concer ning the proper utilization of imaging technology with particular emphasis on the clinical rationale, necessity, and significance of these technologies. It is not intended for this document to be a definitive work, but rather a basic framew ork which will be expanded as new information is gained through ongoing research in this subject area. Analysis of the vertebral subluxation complex often depends upon examination procedures requiring interpretation by the chiropractor. Traditionally Chiropractic has defined the vertebra l subluxation in terms of four criteria: 1. Loss of juxtaposition of a vertebra with the one above, the one below, or both. 2. Occlusion of an opening. 3. Nerve impingement. 4. Interference with the transmission of mental impu lses. A contemporary definition of the vertebral subluxat ion complex proposes a minimum five components: 1. Spinal kinesiopathology consisting of abnormal ve rtebral position, motion, or lack of motion. 2. Neuropathology due to compression, stretching, or irritation of neural tissue. 3. Myopathology characterized by hyperactivity, spas m, weakness, atrophy, or fibrosis. 4. Histopathology including swelling, inflammation, degeneration, and other abnormalities occurring at the cellular and tissue level. 5. Bio-chemical changes/pathology consisting of loca l damage to the spine and contiguous soft tissues, and pathology in periphera l structures such as viscera, muscles, and glands. (Lantz) Both models incorporate biomechanical, bio-chemical and pathophysiological components. In clinical practice, documenting and quantifying these changes poses a formidable challenge. A number of procedures have been employed in chiropra ctic practice to detect and characterize vertebral subluxations including but not limited to :-286-1. Detection of biomechanical and structural abnorma lities A. Postural analysis B. Static palpation C. Motion palpation D. Static radiography E. Functional radiology, including videofluoroscopy F. Computed tomography G. Magnetic resonance imaging 2. Detection of neurophysiological changes A. Orthopedic examination B. Neurological examination 1. Reflexes 2. Muscle tests 3. Dermatome examination 4. Functional leg checks 5. Nerve tracing C. Thermography D. Electrodiagnostic studies II. RATIONALE FOR UTILIZATION OF IMAGING TECHNOLOGIE S A. Prime Directive Imaging methods shall be utilized for the purpose o f obtaining information concerning the vertebral subluxation and other malpositioned artic ulations and structures, primarily the misalignment component, although advanced imaging can also provi de important information regarding foraminal alteration, nerve impingement, and aberrant motion. The use of such procedures shall be based on gather ing clinical evidence that vertebral subluxation and other malpositioned articulations a nd structures is present in the patient. The dange r of ionizing radiation, present in most imaging, con traindicates the use of these procedures without clinical justification. The use of non-ionizing pr ocedures should be governed by accepted clinical protocol with the primary concern being for the pat ient's safety. B. Secondary Directives 1. Selection of Adjusting Technique Imaging procedures may be utilized to provide infor mation concerning the physical structure of the patient's spinal column, skull, and pelvis a nd/or other articulations of the skeleton, for the purpose of selecting or modifying an adjusting tech nique appropriate to the unique anatomic structure of that patient. 2. Contraindication Disclosure Imaging procedures may be utilized to disclose poss ible contraindications to the application of adjustic forces to the spine. C. Tertiary Directive To protect the patient's overall welfare, the docto r shall inform the patient of all findings-287-disclosed by an imaging procedure. The doctor shall inform the patient of those findin gs which are normally found in such an examination, and distinguish those normal findings from any which are unusual. III. RISK/BENEFIT ANALYSIS The risk/benefit analysis is a theoretical model th at governs the practice of health care. It provides a paradigm within which the merits of a he alth care procedure can be discussed. Simply put, only those procedures which are predicted to have a greater likelihood of providing a benefit to the patient than they have of causing the patient harm are justified. It is theoretical since the risk/be nefit odds associated with a procedure and any one indivi dual patient cannot be specifically quantified. A. Adult patients The risk associated with obtaining a radiographic i mage utilizing maximum safety procedures, of the adult patient, is minimal. With demonstrati on of clinical necessity, the benefit of such a procedure to the analysis of the vertebral subluxat ion and other malpositioned articulations and structures, and thereby to the patient, is high. T he risk/benefit analysis favors the use of radiogra phic producers in the adult patient. 14 x 36 FULL SPINE RADIOGRAPHY Full spine radiography has always been an integral part of the science of chiropractic. Studies preclude common misconception about full spine radi ography. Advances in technology continue to reduce radiation exposure in these procedures. Plaug her/Lopes states, \"With the advances in taking full spine radiographs, the patient is exposed to l ess radiation than standard sectional views when th e entire spine must be visualized.\" In certain circumstances, the doctor of chiropracti c has employed so-called \"split screen\" techniques. Split screens compensate for differenc es in body part thickness by using intensifying speeds of different speeds in the same cassette. F or example, lower speed screens may be used in the cervical region, and faster screens in the lumb ar-pelvic region. Today, such techniques are obsolete. Instead, supplemental filtration is used to compensate for differences in body part thickne ss, and single-speed screens are used. Dosimetry studies using supplemental filtration and single-speed screens revealed that the 14 x 36 AP spinograph act ually resulted in lower radiation levels than sectional AP films of like sized subjects. As Hildebrandt observed, \"It has been shown that it is possible to produce reasonably good diagnostic quality full-spine roentgenographs with l ess radiation exposure to the patient than when the same full spine areas are exposed by smaller sectio nal views.\" Phillips states, \"Anteroposterior vie ws of the spine on a 14 x 36 inch exposure can be prod uced with acceptable quality.\" Hildebrandt cites a comparative study conducted by the Bureau of Radi ological Health stating, \"In this study, it was shown that it was in fact possible to obtain diagno stic full-spine films with a skin dose exposure as low as 128.8 mR, while separate lumbar and thoracic fil ms taken according to standard exposure practices delivered 166.1 and 184.5 mR respectively. Buehler a nd Hrejsa evaluated lead-acrylic compensating filters in chiropractic full spine radiography. Th ey concluded that this system \"is capable of produc ing full spine radiographs with good to above average i maging quality.\" It was further noted that this filtration system was generally equivalent in radia tion dose reduction to other systems. The criticism that the distortion inherent in 14 x 36 radiographs precludes accurate biomechanical assessment also seems unfounded. Plaug her and Hendricks evaluated the inter-examiner reliability of the Gonstead pelvic m arking system. Concordance on exact numerical-288-values was poor. However, from a clinical standpoi nt, agreement for categorizing listings was impressive. Inter-examiner concordance for listing s of the ilia, sacrum, symphysis pubis, and femur head height was evaluated by calculating the kappa values for each. The resulting kappa values ranged from .4849 (moderate) to .8161 (excellent). In addition to Gonstead pelvic analysis, proponents of 14 x 36 full spine radiography also use the procedure to evaluate vertebral body rotation a nd lateral flexion malposition. Zengel and Davis investigated how projectional distortion affects su ch determinations. They concluded, \"as long as a given osseous segment is compared to its adjacent s egment (as in analysis for subluxation), the apparent vertebral rotation may be regarded as a su fficiently accurate representation of the actual rotation of the vertebra.\" In reference to vertebr al endplate lines used to assess lateral flexion malpositions, these authors stated, \"In every inst ance, off centering produced no measurable effect on the position of the constructed Gonstead lines. We therefore conclude that these lines may be confidently used. No correction for projectional d istortion seems necessary.\" Logan and Barge analytical methods have been used in chiropractic t o determine vertebral rotation. The Bunnell method is a recognized medical procedure employed b y that profession to determine rotational deviations. CERVICAL SPINE RADIOGRAPHY Sigler and Howe conducted an inter- and intra- exam iner reliability study of a method for measuring atlas laterality. Twenty x -rays were marke d by three different doctors. This study concluded that because of the ranges of error, diff erences produced using this system will be just as likely due to marking error as from actual atlas po sition change. Although frequently cited by those opposing upper cervical spinographic analysis, this study has several significant shortcomings. These include small sample size and a conclusion which ca nnot properly be drawn from the data presented. Other studies have yielded results supporting the r eliability of cervical spinographic techniques. Grostic and DeBoer did a retrospective study of 523 patients evaluating roentgenographic measurements of atlas laterality and rotation pre a nd post adjustment. Statistically significant chan ges in the postulated direction of atlas positioning we re reported. Jackson et al studied the inter- and intra-examiner reliability of upper cervical x-ray marking. Six practitioners evaluated thirty radiog raphs. The study revealed very good intra- and inter- exa miner reliability for the procedure employed. Leac h investigated the effect of chiropractic care on hyp olordosis of the cervical spine. A significant improvement in the cervical curve was noted in pati ents receiving chiropractic care. Barge's observations in Cobb angle reductions in scoliosis also reported reduced cervical angulation through chiropractic adjustive care. Before and after x-ra ys in torticollis often indicate improved cervical alignment following a course of chiropractic adjust ive care. The radiation burden for upper cervical spinography is minimal, particularly when compared to radiation intensive imaging techniques such as C T scanning. Although it is sometimes argued that post adjustment studies double the radiation dose t o the patient, this is generally untrue. Post adjustment studies typically involve fewer exposure s than the initial series. Although cervical spine radiography does expose radiosensitive tissues (suc h as the thyroid gland) to the useful beam, the information gained generally justifies the study. This is particularly true when rare earth screens a nd fast films are employed, and when the presentation of future chronic spinal distortions are anticipate d. B. Pediatric patients The risk associated with obtaining a radiographic i mage of the pediatric patient, those under 16, is higher than that of the adult patient due to the fact that ionizing radiation is more-289-damaging to rapidly dividing cells. The benefits o f such procedures are the same as they are for the adult patient. The risk/benefit analysis f avors discretion in the use of radiographic procedures in the pediatric patient. The doctor of chiropractic is responsible for deter mining the safety and appropriateness of chiropractic care. This responsibility includes th e detection and characterization of vertebral subluxations and other malpositioned articulations and structures as well as examining for conditions where chiropractic care is contraindicat ed or referral to another health care provider is indicated. In children, the accurate evaluation and early intervention in certain spinal cases provides a defensible rationale for employing x-ray analysis as some structural distortions, such as scoliosis, can most effectively be addresse d in the childhood years RADIATION SAFETY Plain film radiography has been the mainstay of ima ging in most chiropractic practices. Growing concern for the hazards of ionizing radiati on and the availability of alternative imaging techniques may cause this to change. According to a recent National Research Council report, low doses of x-radiation pose a human cancer risk three to four times higher than previously reported. The report also noted that some fetuses exposed to radiation face a higher than expected risk of mental retardation. This does not mean that the chiropractor should aba ndon plain film radiography. It does mean developing increased awareness of the judicious use of ionizing radiation, and implementing radiographic procedures which minimize risk and max imize the amount of information obtained from the study. Radiation protection is particularly im portant when x-raying infants, children, adolescent s, and adults in their reproductive years. It has bee n stated that \"For examination of the skeleton, the re is no modality to match the time and cost effective ness of the plain film radiograph.\" The Bureau of Radiological Health emphasizes the im portance of clinical judgment in selecting radiographic procedures. The Bureau also recognize s the right of the attending doctor to make benefits vs. risks determinations in selecting radi ographic procedures. A Bureau publication states, in part: In almost every medical situation, when the physici an feels there is reasonable expectation of obtaining useful information from roentgenological examination that would affect the care of the individual, potential radiation hazard is not a pri mary consideration. . .The physician should retain complete freedom of judgment in the selection of ro entgenologic procedures, and (the physician) should conform with good technical practices. In selecting any examination, it has been suggested that a given procedure be considered \"necessary\" under the following circumstances: 1. The outcome of the test will be used in determini ng the nature of the care administered. 2. The test itself is reliable. 3. More cost effective procedures that are equally re liable or more reliable are not available. The following are indications for pediatric radiolo gic examination: 1. History of trauma with clinical signs suggestive of fracture or dislocation.-290-2. Clinical suspicion of infection or neoplasm. 3. Clinical evidence of a congenital or developmenta l anomaly which could alter the nature of the chiropractic care rendered, or which may itself require care. 4. When clinical findings are equivocal, and the sus pected condition can be detected or ruled out by plain film radiography. 5. When other examination procedures fail to disclos e the nature of the condition, and the patient is not responding favorably to care. 6. To characterize the biomechanical component of th e vertebral subluxation and other malpositioned articulations and structures complex when such characterization is necessary to render chiropractic care, and less haz ardous alternative examinations are not available. 7. To evaluate patient response to chiropractic care when such evaluation may alter the nature of the care being rendered, and less hazardo us alternative examinations are not available. PEDIATRIC RADIOLOGY OF THE SKELETON Trauma is the most frequent indication for skeletal radiographic evaluation. In addition, congenital, neoplastic, and infectious conditions ma y warrant x-ray studies. Accurate interpretation of pediatric radiographs is dependent upon an under standing of the appearance of ossification centers at various stages of development, and an appreciati on of normal radiographic anatomy. A history of spinal curvatures, such as scoliosis, also indicate s the possible need for x-ray evaluation of the pediatric spine. Evaluation of pediatric spine films also requires t hat the doctor interpreting the films understand the pitfalls involved in imaging pediatr ic spines. Patient motion is an ever-present probl em. Even when short exposure times are used to limit t he effects of motion on the finished radiograph, a true postural study may be difficult to obtain. Im mobilization of an uncooperative patient may yield a film that is useful diagnostically, but may not acc urately depict subluxation related pathomechanics. VARIATIONS IN DEVELOPMENT A lack of segmentation of the primitive sclerotome results in a \"block vertebra.\" In this condition, two vertebrae appear structurally as one , and function as one. The failure of the non-segmented vertebra to contribute to the composi te motion of the region affected may lead to hypermobility and degenerative changes at other seg mental levels. When non-segmentation occurs at the occipito-atlanto articulation, the term \"occ ipitalization\" is applied. While non-segmentation b y itself rarely produces neurological compromise, bra instem or cord compression have been reported in cases of upper cervical fusion. Other variations may also occur in the upper cervic al spine. In children, the atlanto-dental interspace should not exceed 5 mm. An increase may be due to congenital absence of the transverse ligament as seen in Down's syndrome. Although prev iously considered of little clinical significance, increased participation by such children in athleti c activity requires careful assessment of the upper cervical spine. Flexion-extension studies are advo cated for such children to assess possible atlantoaxial subluxation. Juvenile rheumatoid arth ritis or traumatic rupture of transverse ligament m ay also result in an increased atlanto-dental interspac e. Variations also occur in the development of the odo ntoid process. The tip of the dens-291-develops from an ossification center which appears at age 2 and unites at 10 to 12 years. If such union does not occur, a terminal ossicle remains. If the dens remains ununited at its base, the condition is termed os odontoideum. Instability and cord compression may result. Hypoplasia or congenital absence of the dens may also occur, resu lting in an unstable articulation. A number of additional variations have been reporte d which may be encountered by the chiropractor: 1. Klippel-Feil Syndrome. This condition is character ized by multiple block vertebrae of the cervical spine. The patient may present with a short neck, low hairline, and genitourinary anomalies. The condition predisposes the spine to injury and possible cord damage. 2. Sprengel's deformity. Congenital non-descent of the scapula can often be detected clinically. Radiographs will demonstrate an omover tebral bone in 30-40% of cases. 3. Cervical ribs. Ribs may arise from a lower cervi cal segment. These ribs may cause neurovascular compression (scalenus anticus syndrom e) later in life. In children they are usually asymptomatic. 4. Butterfly vertebra. A sagittal cleft in a verteb ral body may occur, usually in the thoracic or lumbar spine. Most are asymptomatic and clinica lly insignificant. 5. Hemivertebra. Failure of the lateral half of a v ertebral body to develop produces a lateral hemivertebra. The inevitable consequence is a scoliosis. Rarely, a dorsal or ventral hemivertebra occurs, which may cause an alte ration of lordotic and kyphotic curves. 6. Spina bifida. Spina bifida occulta is a failure of fusion of the posterior elements of a spinal segment without meningeal protrusion. It is often seen at the L-5 level, and is usually of minimal to no clinical significance. It does not generally perceived to increase susceptibility to athletic injury. As wit h any other abnormal structural variation the presence of spina bifida occulta may warrant ex amination in greater detail than would a normal spine. Spina bifida manifesta or ve ra, however, leaves the cord unprotected and is a serious condition. 7. Facet tropism. Asymmetry of the facets at the L5 /SI level may produce asymmetrical biomechanics and joint dysfunction. 8. Knife clasp deformity. Spina bifida occulta in a ssociation with an elongated LS spinous process may result in painful and limited extension . 9. Transitional vertebrae. Lumbarization of SI or sac ralization of L5 may occur. Wieser, and Zinn examined radiographs and conc luded that persons with transitional vertebra did not exhibit any more back aches than controls. Abnormal mechanics produced by the condition, however, may l ead to premature disc degeneration at other levels. 10. Defects in the pars interarticulars that may lea d to spondylolisthesis may also indicate need for restrictive exercise activities and compet itive sports due to susceptibility to injuries. In addition to structural variation, functional var iation in the pediatric spine warrants careful-292-consideration by the chiropractor. Sullivan et al examined lateral cervical radiographs on 100 normal children, and discovered that in 20% of cases C2 ap peared subluxated anteriorly on C3. This phenomenon is usually observed in children under 9 years of age, and is due to the more horizontal facet orientation in the younger child. It is part icularly pronounced in flexion. Cattell reported that 15% of normal pediatric spine s demonstrate absence of the cervical lordotic curve or a single level kyphosis. Whether these \"normal\" findings represent early changes predisposing to subluxation degeneration has not be en explored. Following subjects with these purportedly \"normal\" \"pseudosubluxations\" throughou t life, and comparing the incidence of degenerative changes in the spine with controls is suggested as an area for additional research. PEDIATRIC SPINE FRACTURES Children under 16 account for 7% or less of injurie s to the spine. Although pediatric spine injuries are relatively uncommon, their prompt reco gnition and proper management are essential in chiropractic practice. Motor vehicle (including motorcycle) accidents acco unt for over 50% of the injuries, with team sports, diving injuries, and gunshot wounds account ing for most of the rest. The most common areas of injury are the cervical spine and the thoracolum bar junction. It is suggested that in cases of spi nal trauma, plain AP and lateral radiographs be taken o f the entire cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. This is due to the high occurrence of contiguous a nd non-contiguous injuries. If an abnormality is detected on plain film, computed tomography (CT) ma y be useful in characterizing bony abnormalities. In cases of neurological involvement, magnetic res onance (MR) imaging is the technique of choice. Denis et al reported that 50% of deaths due to pedi atric spine injuries were associated with injuries to the occipito-atlanto complex. Accordin g to Henrys et al upper cervical injuries are more common in children and adolescents. The Powers rat io can be used to assess such injuries on plain radiographs. Jefferson fractures are rare in child ren. Two cases, aged 7 and 12 years, have been reported in the literature. The most frequently en countered fracture of the axis is the dens fracture although five cases of bilateral pedicle (hangman) fractures in children were reported by Pizzutillo e t al. Lower cervical spine fractures are seen more f requently in adolescents than young children. Most are associated with flexion-compression injuries in collision sports. A variety of fractures may present in the pediatric thoracic and lumbar spine. The most common vertebral fracture seen in children under 10 years of age is the compression fracture. The cause is a compressive flexion force. Seatbelt inj uries result in a compressive distractive force. Fracture through the bone as well as soft tissue da mage may result. Unlike the compression fracture, which usually does not result in significant morbid ity, the seat belt fracture may require bracing, casting, or surgery. Spondylolysis has been related to extension-flexion injuries, and its early detect ion can help prevent a lifetime of chronic problems. Gunshot injuries and child abuse are other causes of spine fractures. Avulsion fractures of the spin ous processes in the cervical spine and compression fractures in the thoracic and lumbar region may occ ur as a consequence of violent shaking. PEDIATRIC SPINE NEOPLASMS Spine tumors in children are uncommon. While it is estimated that 80% of adults will seek professional care at some time for back pain, only 2% of children and adolescents presenting at an orthopedic clinic complained of back pain. Spine t umors in children may be primary benign tumors, primary malignant tumors, or metastatic tumors. Primary Benign Tumors-293-a. Osteochondroma. This tumor is simply an exostosi s. It is the most common benign tumor of bone, although only 2% occur in the spine. They ra rely cause symptoms. Osteoid osteoma. About 1% of spine tumors are osteoi d osteomas, seen more frequently in males than females, and usually appearing between t he ages of 10 and 25 years. The posterior elements are involved more frequently tha n the vertebral body. The lumbar spine is affected more frequently than t he cervical or thoracic region. Localized pain, worse at night, and relieved by aspirin is ch aracteristic. Osteoid osteoma is the most frequent cause of a painful scoliosis. Osteoblastoma. Approximately 40% of these lesions occur in the spine. Most patients are under 30 years of age, and the posterior elements a re involved more frequently than the vertebral bodies. Like osteoid osteoma, pain is fre quently the presenting symptom. Unlike osteoid osteoma, however, the pain is not worse at n ight. Neurological deficit is present in over 50% of cases. b. Aneurysmal bone cyst. Although these tumors acco unt for only 1% of primary bone tumors, 11 to 22% occur in the spine. These lesions are us ually painful. Neurological deficit may result from the expansile nature of the lesion. c. Eosinophilic qranuloma . This lesion occurs in the second or third decade of life, and may not be a true neoplasm. The clinical presentation is o ften that of an adolescent with back pain. Vertebra plana often occurs, but neurological defi cit is rare. In the absence of neurological deficit, the condition is self limited, and reconst itution of height is the rule. This condition was previously reported as Calve's disease, incorrectly believed to be a form of juvenile ischemic necrosis. Primary and Metastatic Malignant Tumors Multiple myeloma. This tumor usually occurs in pat ients over 50 years of age, but rarely is seen in young patients. Multiple lytic lesions and altered serum proteins are characteristic. Ewings sarcoma. This tumor rarely involves the spi ne, but when it does, localized painis usually present. The 5-20 year old age group is mo st affected. Metastasis may occur. This is an aggressive and potentially fatal tumor. Lymphoma. This rare condition may be seen in young adults. An \"ivory vertebral' appearance is characteristic. Metastasis may occur. This is another potentially fatal tumor. Osteosarcoma. Primary involvement of the spine is rare, and spinal osteosarcoma is usually due to metastasis. Less than 2% originate in the s pine. The condition is most commonly seen in the second decade of life. Spinal involvement may be d ifficult to treat. The condition is potentially fa tal. Chondrosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and chordoma rarely oc cur in children or adolescents. Metastasis to the spine in children is most frequen tly from neuroblastoma and leukemia. PEDIATRIC SPINE INFECTIONS Infections in the pediatric and adolescent spine ar e uncommon in the United States. When infections do occur, the route is usually hematogen ous. There are four main categories of pediatric spinal infections. Discitis. This condition usually follows a benign course. Low grade fever, irritability, back-294-rigidity, muscle spasm, and tenderness may present clinically. Care consists primarily of immobilizat ion and rest. Antibiotics are sometimes employed. . Non-tuberculous vertebral osteomyelitis. This rar e condition is far more serious than disc space infection. Toxemia may be evident. High fev er may occur, and the child appears very ill. Back pain may or may not be present. Staphylococcus aur eus is the most common bacteria isolated. Tuberculosis of the pediatric spine. The age of on set of this condition is usually between 2 and 5 years of age. The usual site is the thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies. A reversal of the height:width ratio of the vertebral bodies may occu r. The condition may lead to neurological involvement and skeletal deformity. Spinal epidural abscess. These are among the most s erious infections of the spine, and may lead to paraplegia and death. The patients often p resent with pain, high fevers, and appear very ill. Unlike osteomyelitis, however, plain film radiogra phs often appear normal. Magnetic resonance imaging is the technique of choice in such cases. ADOLESCENT IDIOPATHIC SCOLIOSIS Scoliosis may be due to muscular imbalance, structu ral asymmetry such as congenital malformations, decompensation of adaptational curves , or may be idiopathic. At one time adolescent idiopathic scoliosis was now considered a purely he reditary condition. Recent investigators have reported abnormal proprioceptive function believed due to a posterior column abnormality. Abnormal writing reflex functions may be related to balance mechanisms located in the brain stem or in the spin e. Abnormal vibratory sensation in both upper and low er extremities suggests that the lesion is located in the cervical spinal cord. The role of the verte bral subluxation and other malpositioned articulati ons and structures complex in this process deserves fur ther study as evidence is accumulating to indicate positive outcomes achieved through chiropractic car e. SCHEURMANN'S SYNDROME This condition is sometimes known as juvenile kypho sis. The etiology is controversial, but is generally believed due to an abnormality of the car tilagineous end plate. This results in anterior Schmorl's node formation. The 13-17 age group is m ost frequently affected. LEGG-CALVE-PERTHES DISEASE Legg-Calve-Perthes disease is an avascular necrosis affecting the capital femoral epiphysis. Males are affected more than females. The conditi on is usually unilateral. Weight bearing may lead to deformity. The disease is self-limited. OTHER EPIPHYSEAL DISORDERS Numerous eponymic disorders of developing epiphyseal centers have been described. Some are believed due to trauma or overuse (e.g. Sever's disease of the Os calcis and Osgood-Schlatter's disease of the tibial tubercle). Others are believ ed due to osteonecrosis. SPONDYLOLYSIS AND SPONDYLOLISTHESIS The incidence of spondylolysis is 4 to 6%. It is s everal seen before the age of 5, and most cases occur during the adolescent growth spurt. Mo st authors now view spondylolysis as a stress fracture. Anterior displacement of the involved ve rtebral body may lead to spondylolisthesis and pathomechanical changes. The association of the co ndition with back pain is highly variable.-295-Plain film radiography is the mainstay of imaging i n most chiropractic practices. The use of ionizing radiation in examining any patient, includ ing children and adolescents, should be based on clinical need. The primary responsibilities of the doctor of chiropractic include determining the saf ety and appropriateness of chiropractic care, locating and correcting vertebral subluxations and other malpositioned articulations and structures, and the correction of aberrations from normal that may lea d to future spinal curvatures. The judicious use of various imaging techniques may be invaluable in achieving these objectives. A. Pregnant women The risk/benefit analysis favors avoidance of radio graphic procedures in the pregnant woman, especially in the 1st trimester. A Bureau of Radiological Health publication states: In almost every medical situation, when the physician feels there is reasonable expectation of obtaining useful information from roentgenological examination that would affect the care of the individual, potential radiation hazard is not a primary consideration...the physici an should retain complete freedom of judgment in the selection of roentgenologic procedu res, and (the physician) should conform with good technical practices. B. Radiation therapy patients The risk/benefit analysis favors discretion in use of radiographic procedures in the radiation therapy patient. C. Rebalancing of the risk/benefit analysis equation The risk/benefit analysis is a dynamic thought proc ess, and as such, is subject to a rebalancing that may countermand the general guidel ines as in the following situations: 1. Trauma: The presence of trauma may increase the benefit portion to an extent which supercedes the risk portion and provide, for the us e of radiographic procedures in a patient for whom such procedures were previously co ntraindicated. 2. Negative changes in the patient's general health: The presence of negative changes in the patient's general health may increase the be nefit portion to an extent which supersedes the risk portion and provide for the use of radiographic procedure in a patient for whom such procedures were previously co ntraindicated. 3. Surgery: Surgical procedures may increase the be nefit portion to an extent which supersedes the risk portion and provide for the use of radiographic procedures in a patient for whom such procedures were previously co ntraindicated. 4. Unusual or unexpected reaction to an adjustive pr ocedure: A severe reaction to an adjustive procedure may increase the benefit portio n to an extent which supersedes the risk portion and provide for the use of radiogr aphic procedures in a patient for whom such procedures were previously contraindicate d. 5. Patient history: A family history of back pain, s pondylolythesis, congenital abnormalities, scoliosis and other curvatures may a lso increase the benefit portion. IV. LIST OF SUBTOPICS-296-A. Plain film radiography B. Video fluoroscopy C. Magnetic resonance imaging D. Computed tomography E. Ultrasonography F. Contrast studies G. Radioisotopic scanning H. Services/billing V. RECOMMENDATIONS A. Plain film radiography Purpose: 1. To provide information concerning the hard tissue components of the spine, skull and pelvis, or other skeletal structure. 2. To provide information concerning the misalignmen t component of the vertebral subluxation, or other articulation. 3. To provide information concerning the foraminal a lteration component of the vertebral subluxation. 4. To provide information concerning the dynamics of spinal motion. 6. To provide information concerning abnormal spinal contours. 7. To detect anomalous structures that may contribut e to spinal distortions, sacral plateau abnormalities, etc. Clinical Necessity Plain film radiography may be employed when clinica l data indicates the likely presence of a condition which may affect patient care. This inclu des biomechanical assessment as well as determining the presence of spinal and/or extraspin al pathology, injury, or developmental variation. Technical consideration 1. Machine selection: General guidelines (ALARA & A HARA) provide for the use of machine that will produce the best image possible w ith the lowest patient dosage. a. Single phase units: These units are acceptable b ut provide for greater patient exposure than other types of equipment. b. Three phase units: These units provide superior image quality with patient dosages which are lower than single phase. c. Medium or high frequency units: These units prov ide image quality that is superior to single phase, with patient dosages comp arable to three phase, and the advantage of easier installation. 2. Film/screen combinations: General guidelines pro vide for the use for a film/screen combination that will provide for acceptable image quality with the maximum reduction-297-in patient dose. 3. KVP/MAS Selection: General guidelines provide fo r the use of a fixed KVP/variable MAS technique to provide maximum image quality with optimum patient safety. a KVP: An optimum kilovoltage should be utilized fo r the region of interest. This selection should be based on the machine and film/s creen manufacturer's specifications. 1. MAS: Milliampere seconds should be governed by t he measured thickness of the region of interest or by an automatic exposure control (ARC) system. This selection should be based on the machine and film/s creen manufacturer's specifications. 4. FFD/SID Selection: General guidelines provide fo r the use of a distance appropriate to the OFD/PFD. a. A shorter distance (40\") is appropriate when the OFD/PFD is zero. b. A longer distance is appropriate when the OFD/PFD is anything other than zero. 5. Filtration: General guidelines provide for the u se of filtration to reduce patient dose. a. Inherent filtration: This is primarily a manufac turer's specification in accordance with the WCRP recommendation #33. b. Added filtration: This should be utilized to red uce the patient dose over region of interest where the use of a shield would limit a nalytical value, and for visually equalizing areas of the patient's body which are of unequal radiographic density. 6. Grids: General guidelines provide for the use of grids to prevent secondary radiation from reaching the film. The use of grids improves radiographic quality and should be employed as per manufacturer's specification. 7. Shielding: General guidelines provide for the us e of shielding to eliminate patient dose over radiosensitive areas. a. Collimation: Maximum collimation to limit the pr imary beam to the area of interest is the primary method of eliminating unnec essary radiation exposure. b. Gonadal shielding: This is most appropriate for the male patient, since the gonads are not in the region of interest of a spino graph. It may also be used on the female patient if the doctor is not seeking to obtain analytical information from an area which would be obscured by the shield. c. Lead apron shielding: A lead apron may be employ ed to eliminate possible primary beam exposure of the patient in areas other than the region of interest. This type of shielding is of little practical valu e however, if close collimation is-298-employed. 8. Processing: General guidelines provide for the u se of optimum darkroom technique to obtain the maximum image quality. Manual or aut omatic processing techniques are acceptable. Analysis 1. Minimum initial study: Regional studies generally include a minimum of two views taken at opposition of 90 degrees. Exceptions, however, are not uncommon, such as examination of the pelvis and some post-adjustment films which need only be a single view. The clinical judgement of the attending doct or shall determine the needs of each patient, with due regard to minimizing radiation ex posure. 2. Extra views: Additional views shall be added as clinically indicated to provide full analysis. 3. Regional studies: Views may be obtained either b y region of interest or in full spine as required by the technique selected. Due to the dan gers inherent in the radiographic process, only those areas of clinical interest shal l be x-rayed. 4. Postural studies: Views may be obtained in vario us postural positions as clinically required. It is acknowledged and accepted that thi s may result in more than one view per projection with posture being the variable. 7. Repeat studies: Due to the dangers inherent in r adiation exposure, repeat studies should only be used as clinically required. 15.1.1. Rating : Strong Positive Recommendation Strength: I, L B. Videofluoroscopy The first known fluoroscopic image was produced by Roentgen in 1895. Roentgen placed his hand between an x-ray source and a fluorescent scre en, and was astonished to see an image of the bones of his hand on the screen. One year later fluo roscopic screens became available, and the technique was employed for 'real time', observation of human structures. In the 1950's, electronic image intensification systems became readily availa ble. Using electronic image intensification, the fluoroscopic image is amplified, resulting in an im provement in image quality and a reduction in radiation levels. When the image is recorded on mo tion picture film, the procedure is termed cineradiography. If a video recording is made, the term videofluoroscopy is employed. In chiropractic, a leading pioneer in spinal fluoro scopy was Earl Rich. Fred Illi employed the technique in studying spinal biomechanics. Joseph Howe conducted fluoroscopic studies of the spine, and reported instances where the technique revealed abnormalities not demonstrated on plain films. Current chiropractic interest in fluoroscopy is ev idenced by the formation of the Joint Motion Study Research Society, and the offering of certificate c ourses in videofluoroscopy by CCE accredited chiropractic colleges. TECHNIQUE A videofluoroscopic system consists of an x-ray gene rator capable of operating at low (1/4 to 5) milliamperage settings, an x-ray tube assembly, a n image intensifier tube, a television camera, a-299-VCR, and a monitor. The heart of the system is the image intensifier tube. This tube permits imaging at very low radiation levels. It is used instead o f intensifying screens and film as an image recepto r. An image intensifier tube consists of four key comp onents in an evacuated glass envelope: 1. Input phosphor and photocathode. The input phosp hor is similar to the intensifying screen used in conventional radiography. It emits light when energized by x-rays. When light from this screen strikes the photocathod e, electrons are emitted. 2. Electrostatic focusing lens. A series of electri cally charged plates focus the electron beam as it flows toward the output phosphor. 3. Accelerating anode. This positively charged elec trode is located in the neck of the tube. It accelerates the electrons toward the outp ut screen. 4. Output phosphor. The output phosphor produces li ght when energized by electrons. It is coupled to a television camera. The signal from the video camera is fed to a monito r and VCR, where it can be observed and recorded. CLINICAL APPLICATIONS In considering the use of any examination employing ionizing radiation, the clinician should ask: 1. Does the potential yield of information justify t he exposure? 2. Will the outcome of the study affect the care or management of the case? 3. Are less hazardous, equally reliable techniques a vailable? Several authors have addressed these issues. Obser vational and case studies have appeared in the literature comparing the diagnostic yield of fluoroscopic studies vs. plain films. In addition, studies have been published reporting abn ormalities detected by fluoroscopy which could not be appreciated on plain films. Bland states, \"Clearly, cineradiography is the best method for the study of biomechanics and dynamics of motion in the cervical spine. . .The de termination of normal motion, sites of greatest and least motion, contribution by joints, discs, ligame nts, tendons, and muscles to motion (and their limitations), and the biomechanics of normal motion of the occiput-atlas-axis complex all have been studied very successfully through cineradiography.\" According to Ochs, \"Cineradiography, using film or videotape, is shown in a study of 34 painful or injured necks to be a valuable clinical tool. It i s useful in fracture management, analysis of instability and demonstration of solid healing. A video tape syst em featuring instant replay, clear image and low radia tion exposure was found to be ideal for routine use .\" Buonocare, Hartman, and Nelson examined the cervica l spines of 107 patients using cineradiography, including 57 who sustained flexion -extension injuries. They concluded, \"The ability to demonstrate localized abnormal motion in the cer vical spine allows one to predict soft-tissue injur ies and the quality of spinal fusions, spinal stability , and early subluxation of the cervical spine-condi tions that may not be identified on static roentgenograms nor at physical examination.\" Jones studied abnormalities of the upper cervical s pine using cineradiography, and concluded, \"Cineradiography has been used to detect instabilit y not ascertainable by routine roentgenograms obtained in flexion and extension....\" In a case s tudy of abnormal atlanto-axial motion, Tasharski-300-noted, \"Interpretation by means of standard static radiographs failed to disclose the nature of the functional post-traumatic disorder. Cinefluorographi c visualization of the articulation in motion demonstrated abnormal mobility.\" Woesner and Mitts a lso concluded that fluoroscopic studies often revealed abnormalities undetected on plain films. They stated, \"There were, however, a significant nu mber of instances in which cineroentgenography demonstrated abnormal motion no t detected on conventional roentgenograms. Cineroentgenography is, therefore, a valuable adjun ctive technique and its continued utilization in th e analysis of cervical spine motion is justified.\" Numerous applications for spinal fluoroscopy have b een reported in the medical literature. These include recording the effects of cervical spi ne traction, evaluating cervical spine stenosis, laminectomies, examining athletes presenting with p ain, to assist in surgical planning, evaluating atlanto-axial rotatory fixation, examining the effe cts of cervical collars, characterizing joint disor ders in the cervical spine, studying degenerative disease o f the cervical spine, and determining the effects of occipitalization and odontoid hypoplasia on spina l motion. In addition to the studies cited, applications for fluoroscopy in chiropractic have been reported in chiropractic trade publications, indexed peer re viewed literature, and presented at chiropractic symposia. Gillet, Henderson, Dorman and Howe used fluoroscopy to study cervical spine kinetics. Shippel and Robinson described a case where fluoros copy and magnetic resonance imaging were used to evaluate cervical spine instability. Leung u sed fluoroscopy to evaluate the cervical spine and concluded, \"Cineradiography has been found to be th e method of examination that conveys most functional abnormalities. The diagnostic value of cineradiography is substantiated. The effect of chiropractic adjustment in removal of cervical fixa tions was proven with cineradiography.\" Chiropractors Foreman and Croft in their textbook W hiplash Injuries state, \"This motion study of the spine may be quite useful in detecting abnor mal biomechanics secondary to ligamentous damage that may be unappreciated with plain film ra diography.\" Cineradiography or fluorovideoradiography plays an important role in t he diagnosis of aberrant spinal biomechanics that may be secondary to chronic muscle contracture, sca r tissue formation, or ligamentous instability.\" Antos, Robinson, Keating and Jacobs presented the r esults of an interexaminer reliability study of cinefluoroscopic detection of fixation in the mid -cervical spine. Two examiners reviewed fifty videotapes of fluoroscopic examinations of the cerv ical spine. The examiners achieved 84% agreement for the presence of fixation, 96% agreeme nt for the absence of fixation, and 93% total agreement. The Kappa value was .80 (p<.0001). Onl y the C4/C5 level was examined. The authors concluded, \"The current data indicate that VF deter mination of fixation in the cervical spine is a rel iable procedure.\" Other chiropractic authors have described applicati ons for fluoroscopy. Taylor and Skippings used the procedure to study paradoxical motion of t he atlas in flexion. Betge described applications for fluoroscopy in the analysis of dysfunctions of the cervical spine. Masters and Mertz both used fluoroscopy to evaluate spinal motion. Robinson an d Sweat have also published articles concerning chiropractic applications for fluoroscopy. In addition to patient evaluation studies, fluorosc opy has also been used to study normal motion in the spine. Bronfort and Jochumsen used cin eradiography to evaluate intermediate stages and extremes of intervertebral motion in the lumbar spine. Fielding and Howe described normal motion of the cervical spine based on cineradiographic exa minations. Persons critical of the use of videofluoroscopy to evaluate joint motion, particularly in the cervical spine, appear to be applying a more burden some standard than that required of other imaging techniques. It is suggested that such critics cons ider the following:-301-1. Videofluoroscopy is not a new procedure. Fluoros copic studies of the spine have been reported in the medical literature for several deca des. Numerous observational and case studies have been p ublished in indexed peer reviewed journals. 1. At least one chiropractic study concluded that fl uoroscopy was a reliable technique for evaluating fixation in the mid-cervical spine. Many investigators have reported that fluoroscopic studies revealed abnormalities (some potentially lethal) that could not be appreciated o n plain films. An evaluation of diagnostic procedures for spinal d isorders published in Spine concluded that cineradiology's usefulness - in conditions where ra dicular compression was presumed, spinal stenosis was confirmed, and in symptomatic post-sur gical patients, has been demonstrated in non-randomized controlled trials. The same report noted that it was common practice to use the technique in cases of localized spinal pain and pain radiating to an extremity. Diagnostic imaging is by its very nature an \"observ ational\" procedure requiring a skilled examiner to interpret the findings. Imaging studies are one part of the data set used b y a clinician to make a diagnosis and formulate a care plan. The findings of any imaging study must be integrated with the history, physical, and laboratory findings in a given case. Thus the claim that fluoroscopy is not \"...a diagnostic entity unto itself\" could be applied to any imaging technique. THE ISSUE OF RADIATION EXPOSURE Critics of videofluoroscopy frequently express conc ern for the radiation exposure produced by the procedure. According to Robinson, 60 seconds o f videofluoroscopy is equivalent to 2 to 7 plain films. Pierce states that videofluoroscopy of the cervical spine can be performed at 1/4 MA. This would result in radiation levels even lower th an those reported by Robinson. Howe states that \"The radiation dose to the patient is not significa ntly higher than that incurred in plain film studie s.\" The issue of radiation exposure is clouded by autho rs claiming that fluoroscopy is \"...a functional study only...\" and that \"...it is quite possible to miss subtle pathology.\" The assumption is made that a full complement of plain films will be taken in addition to the fluoroscopic study. If, however, up to 60 seconds of low milliamperage fluor oscopy is substituted for the static flexion/extension views normally taken in a Davis s eries, the radiation burden to the patient will be roughly equivalent, and the potential diagnostic yi eld far greater. Even if fluoroscopy is used in addition to a full Davis series, the diagnostic yie ld may justify the exposure in cases where the plai n films fail to demonstrate an abnormality which is s uspected clinically. INDICATIONS FOR VIDEOFLUOROSCOPY Any technique involving exposure to ionizing radiat ion should be used judiciously. Several authors have suggested indications for videofluoros copic studies. They include: 1. Flexion-extension injuries 2. Direct injury 3. Postoperative evaluation-302-4. Assessment of hypermobility associated with sublu xation when such information cannot be obtained by other more cost-effective means 5. Suspected ligamentous instability 6. Presumed radicular compression 7. Spinal stenosis 8. Scoliosis, structural and functional curvature ev aluation. TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS For chiropractors employing videofluoroscopy: 1. Fluoroscopic studies should not be routinely empl oyed. The decision to order a fluoroscopic study should be based on demonstrated clinical need . 2. All fluoroscopy should be performed with electron ic image intensification. 3. The beam should be collimated to the smallest pos sible size which will demonstrate the area of clinical interest. 4. Gonad shielding should be employed when it will n ot obliterate the structures under examination. 5. The fluoroscopic image should be recorded on vide otape or other appropriate medium to enable the chiropractor to review the study without requiring excessive repetition of a given movement. 6. \"Beam on\" time should be kept to the minimum nece ssary to characterize the abnormality. Chiropractors performing videofluoroscopic studies should have training in fluoroscopic technique and interpretation. Technical Considerations 1. Machine selection: General guidelines provide fo r the use of recently manufactured equipment which is capable of low dose image acquisition. 2. Factor selection: Optimum factors should be sele cted as per manufacturer's specifications. 3. Shielding: General guidelines provide for the us e of shielding to eliminate patient dose over radiosensitive areas outside of the area in interes t. Analysis Stress study similarity: Although similar to the a nalysis of plain film stress studies, which are generally taught in the chiropractic curriculum, th e interpretation of videofluoroscopy should be done by a doctor trained in the specific analysi s of this type of study. Series-303-1. Adjunctive procedure: Videofluoroscopy should be used as an adjunctive procedure to plain film studies, and not as a replacement for those st udies. 2. Repeat studies: Due to the dangers inherent in r adiation exposure, repeat studies should only be used as clinically required. 15.2.1. Rating : Positive recommendation Strengths: E, L C. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Provides information concerning both hard and soft tissue spinal structure in a single imaging format. Clinical Necessity MR imaging may be employed to visualize soft tissue structures (e.g., nerve roots) and hard tissue structures (e.g., bone) in a single imaging format. Technical Consideration 1. Machine selection: Due to the great expense asso ciated with MR imaging units, it is unlikely that they will be purchased by private practitioner s. 2. Factor selection: Optimum factors should be sele cted as per manufacturer's specifications. 3. Safety: At this time there are no known detrimen tal effects associated with this procedure, taking into account manufacturer's published contra indications. Analysis MR image interpretation has only recently been intr oduced in the chiropractic college curriculum; for this reason, interpretation should be done by a doctor trained in the specific analysis of this type of study. Series Due primarily to the high cost per image, MR image studies should be limited to those cases in which standard analytical measures are inadequat e. 15.3.1. Rating : Discretionary Strength: E, L D. Computerized Tomography (CT) Clinical Necessity 1. CT imaging may be employed to visualize spinal st ructures in planes other than those available through plain film radiography.-304-2. Current usage provides information concerning pat hological states. However, it is possible to obtain information concerning the misalignment, for aminal alteration and nerve impingement, components of the classically defined vertebral sub luxation and other malpositioned articulations and structures, through the use of CT images. Technical Consideration Machine selection: Due to the expense associated w ith CT imaging units, it is unlikely that they will be purchased by private practitioners. 2. Factor selection: Optimum factors should be sele cted as per manufacturer's specifications. Safety: Since CT is an x-ray imaging modality, pat ient protection protocols associated with all ionizing radiation imaging equipment apply. Analysis CT image interpretation is taught to a small degree in the chiropractic college curriculum; for this reason, primary interpretation of these images should be done by a doctor specifically trained in the analysis of this type of study. Series Due to the concern for radiation safety, CT image s tudies should be limited to those cases in which standard analytical measures are inadequate. 15.4.1. Rating : Discretionary Strength: E E. Ultrasonography Ultrasonography may be used to visualize soft tissu e structures of the musculoskeletal system. It is an established procedure for the evaluation o f extraspinal soft tissues structures, such as the thyroid gland and the abdominal aorta. In spin e imaging, it has been used to measure the central canal to determine stenosis. Other spinal applications are under investigation. Clinical Necessity Investigational, ultrasonography has been used for v isualizing soft tissue structures of the musculoskeletal system. This use may ultimately pr ovide information which would be germane to chiropractic practice. 15.5.1. Rating : Investigational Strength: E F. Contrast studies A doctor of chiropractic may refer a patient for co ntrast studies when clinically indicated. 15.6.1. Rating : Discretionary G. Radioisotope scanning (Nuclear medicine)-305-A doctor of chiropractic may refer a patient for nu clear medicine studies when clinically indicated. 15.7.1. Rating : Discretionary H. Services/Billing 1. Technical Component The technical component is that part of the radiogr aphic service that includes: providing the facilities, equipment, personnel, and supplies necessary to obtain a satisfactory image. 2. Professional Component The professional component is that part of the radi ographic service that includes the analysis and documentation of the findings evident on the radiographic image. 1. Medical radiologist use: As some chiropractors u se the services of a medical radiologist in obtaining radiographs, it is conceiv able that two professional charges may exist for the same study. This does no t represent an unethical practice as each provider is producing a unique non -duplicative impression of the radiograph. The medical radiologist is comment ing on the medical/pathological significance germane to his/he r specialty, and the chiropractor on the vertebral subluxation and other malpositioned articulations and structures analysis germane to his/her specialt y. 2. Specialist in Chiropractic Imaging use: Some chi ropractors may choose to consult with a chiropractic radiologist for further clarification. As the chiropractic radiologist is a doctor who has comple ted post graduate studies to obtain a level of interpretive proficiency great er than that taught on the basic chiropractic college level, the use of such a profe ssional is acceptable and may ethically result in two professional charges per st udy. 3. Standards for Billing a. Codes: The standard current procedural terminolo gy (CPT) codes used in general radiology are used for third party reimburs ement of chiropractic radiographic procedures. 1. The use of these codes may be broken into: techn ical component only, professional component only, or global (combined te chnical and professional components). 15.8.1. Rating : Strong positive recommendation Strength: E VI. SUMMARY A. Discussion Diagnostic imaging is an important part of the chir opractic examination. Imaging studies may-306-be used to assess the biomechanical component of th e vertebral subluxation and other malpositioned articulations and structures complex, as well as determine the presence of traumatic injuries, pathology, and developmental va riants which may affect patient care. This includes spinal and extraspinal structures. Procedur es which involve the use of ionizing radiation should be employed only when clinical nee d is established by the history and clinical assessment. The potential benefits of a proposed i maging procedure should be carefully weighed against the risks and cost. The most cost effective procedure which will provide the information needed should be employed whenever poss ible. VII. REFERENCES ACR Board of Directors.

TABLES TABLE 1 Technical Factors for the Production of Quality Rad iographs Collimation. Maximum collimation of the primary be am is used to expose only necessary areas and to exclude the eyes, breasts, and gonads whenev er possible. Filtration. Density equalizing filtration is used to minimize excess exposure to thinner body parts. c) Lead Shielding. The breasts and gonads (male and female) are adequately protected with lead shields whenever possible. d) P-A Projection. The posterior-to-anterior projec tion is employed whenever possible to further reduce radiation exposure to the breast, eye, and t hyroid. e) Rare-earth Screens. Rare-earth screens with matchi ng film of the same spectral sensitivity and in the 800-1200 speed category is used. f) Focal-Film Distance. FFDs of less than or equal to 72 are commonly used. g) High kV. Exposures frequently greater than 90kV are used to reduce radiation exposure. h) Adequate Grid. Use of a 12:1 grid allows higher kV values to be employed and is optimal for scatter absorption in the 90-100 kV range. However , a 10:1 grid is acceptable. i) Technical Details. Careful attention to radiogra phic and darkroom procedures is employed to minimize retake examinations.-312--313-CHAPTER 16 Instrumentation Chapter Outline I. Overview II. List of Subtopics III.

OVERVIEW In coming to an analytical conclusion about the nat ure of a patient's possible subluxations, the chiropractor uses many methods, including those of history-taking, inspection, palpation and instrumentation. Through information gained from r esearch and personal experience, the chiropractor generally assigns a personal value to each procedur e in any particular circumstance. The intent of thi s chapter is to describe and evaluate the various in struments that are presently used by chiropractors in the examination of their patients. Appropriate Use of Instruments Instruments are all designed with various leve ls of sophistication and make use of underlying assumptions. Sapega has observed that man y clinical tools available today are capable of generating more measurements than can be meaning fully understood. The technological explosion in health care delivery has advanced far beyond val id clinical utility. The meaningful interpretation of changes in a subject's test results requires the reliability and validity of the procedures. The most effective means to ensure reliability is through test standardization and close attention to the correspo ndence of test conditions to those of the actual demands that the patient's lifestyle makes on his p erformance. The test clearly must be relevant to the individual's activities that have been impaired or to normative data and should be able to discriminate healthy from unhealthy people. Evaluating Instruments Several qualities are found in common for inst ruments that ultimately prove to be clinically useful. Focusing on these qualities rather than on specific named instruments simplifies the task of evaluating instruments individually. They include the following: 1. Validity is the most clinically important quality . A test is valid when it accurately measures the desired function, and when that functi on is pertinent to the patient's condition. 2. Discriminability is determined by the ability to di stinguish healthy from unhealthy individuals. In order to accomplish this, a normat ive date base consisting of studies of people from both groups is required. The relati ve frequency of false-positive (i.e., healthy persons who test positive) and fals e-negative tests (i.e., unhealthy persons who test negative) occurring for each group also helps to define a test's discriminability . 3. Accuracy of a measure is determined by comparison to a known value. Repeated use of some devices and the simple effects of passi ng time may cause loss of calibration which will alter accuracy. 4. Precision describes the variation of a measure ac ross the range over which it is intended to be used. Both accuracy and precision c an change over the possible ranges of test applications. 5. Reliability of a measure depends both on the accu racy of the instrument and the characteristics of the variable being measured. For each category of instrument discussed below, kn owledge of how each performs with-316-respect to the above test qualities is presumed. Patient Motivation Test results should be interpreted in conjunction w ith observations of the quality of patient performance and cooperation made while the test is being performed. As a result, only adequately trained ersonnel who can integrate clinically meanin gful observations should perform most tests. Quality of patient performance, repeated measures t esting and correlation of findings with other clini cal information permit an accurate evaluation of patien t motivations. Specific reasons for poor test performance include legitimate reduced capability, misunderstood instructions, apprehension of the test setting, fear of pain arising from the test an d questions of secondary gain.

Questionnaires as Instruments:-317-Physical signs can be rather insensitive measure of a patient's disability. Standardized rating scales and questionnaires afford a simple means of appraising many aspects of patient life and health. Instruments commonly used in the chiropractic comm unity assess any of the components of the vertebral subluxation and other malpositioned artic ulations and structures complex, pain, activities o f daily living (ADL), somatization, depression and an xiety. Generally, questionnaires may be divided in to two categories, self-reporting and practitioner-adm inistered. Self-reporting questionnaires are often self-normalizing but suffer from reactivity which m ay result in an unintentional change in the patient 's response when exposed to the same questions repeate dly. Practitioner-administered questionnaires benefit from the involvement of a trained observer whose skill can help in interpreting the patient's response. In administering either format, several error sources should be considered including 1) patient motivation; 2) acquiescence to positively w orded items; and 3) patient's seeking social approval. Overall, functional questionnaires offer standardization of measurement, comprehensiveness, and generally good reproducibili ty and validity. There is no consensus on the use of a particular qu estionnaire for a specific clinical problem. For the measurement of the same clinical problem, different questionnaires may not yield interchangeable findings. Screening questionnaires may be used to obtain a broad patient overview in a comprehensive and timely manner. With the rec ent intensive development in the outcome measurement field, future field standardization on use of questionnaires is to be expected. Pressure Algometry Pressure algometry is a comparatively new procedure which uses a pressure manometer to estimate pain threshold from applied pressures to t he myofascial structures. Normative data shows that pressure pain thresholds are highly symmetrica l and are generally lower in females than in males. Reeves et al. have reported reliability coefficien ts ranging from 0.71 to 0.97. Pressure pain thresh old levels are sensitive to a variety of care intervent ions. Good inter-rater and test-retest reliability has been shown. Functional Measurements 1. Measurement of Position/Clinical Anthropometry 1. Posture Studies in ergonomics have shown that trunk, head a nd joint positions adopted during work can be used as an objective index for evaluati ng the intensity of physical work stress, mental concentration of manual dexterity. The choice of a particular position may be the most important factor contributing to wh ether an attempted physical activity is risky or safe. Individual instruments and autom ated measures are available to quantify posture or body segment position. 2. Plumbline analysis The plumbline was one of the first tools to be used in chiropractic to analyze posture. The plumbline provides a visual frame of reference for the influence of the center of gravity from each body segment, enabling the clinic ian to detect postural deviation, asymmetry and suspect areas of postural stress. Pa tients are observed in the anterior, posterior and lateral stances. 4. Bilateral weight scales used to determine spinal balance and disturbed proproceptive reflex balance mechanisms. Measurement of Movement-318-In the general course of patient care, range of mot ion is examined using goniometers, inclinometers and optical based systems. Most devi ces quantify the regional movement of a part and express it as an angular displacement about som e center of rotation. 1. Goniometers The degree of peripheral joint movement can be meas ured throughout active or passive ranges. Its usefulness is greatest in the extremities, particularly the small joint of the hands and feet. The reference point for mea surement is the long axis of the part being measured and is determined by judgment. Accu racy is limited to a range of 10 to 15 degrees. Usage for spinal measurements is no longer considered acceptable practice because of the advent of better methods. 2. Inclinometers Inclinometers use the constant vertical direction o f gravity as a reference and require only that a side rests against the body segment sur face. Digital or analog, and mechanical or electronic versions are available. G reater accuracy of measurement is available to ranges of 3 to 5 degree being possible under typical clinical conditions. Inclinometers are the more suitable instrument for assessing spinal function and are capable of separating components of motion, e.g., p elvic versus lumbar. 3. Optically based systems Aside from research applications, the most prevalen t clinical use of opto-electronic systems is in conjunction with the use of force pla tes for assessing gait abnormalities. Video-monitoring is often used in industrial practi ce to capture the salient features and at least semi-quantify motions and postures at the work station. Work related spine injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome and other cu mulative trauma disorders are frequent areas of concern where these methods are u sed. The primary parameters of importance are joint angle, angular velocity and angular acceleration. Coupled with appropriate software and external load measurements , joint loads and patterns of behavior can provide information on relative risk o f work related tasks. 2. Measurement of Strength The term strength denotes the capacity for active d evelopment of muscle tension and through the resulting muscle force generates joint torque. Computerized muscle dynamometer systems quantify more variables than the average physician can properly interpret. In the case of employment-related tests, the evaluation must close ly simulate critical job tasks. The emphasis on computerized muscle-dynamometry sys tems (isometric, isokinetic, isotonic and isoinertial) has overshadowed earlier isometric and psychophysical testing methods. No single method of strength evaluation is decidedly superior or more valid for measuring muscular strength. Each method also has a number of advantages and di sadvantages. For valid interpretation of test results, the unique characteristics of each must be kept in mind. It has yet to be shown conclusively that testing can clearly predict that a patient can return to a certain activity level and will have l ess risk of re-injury under actual functional conditions. O nly continued research and development of broader normative data bases than are now available will fi nally test the underlying assumptions currently use d in these clinical applications.-319-1. Manual hand-held strength testing Manual muscle strength testing provides only a roug h approximation of capability and its use is limited. Accuracy in manual assessment requires differences in strength of 35% or more. Hand-held dynamometers, while not eli minating all the problems of manual testing, provide greater degrees of accuracy and reliability. 3. Instrumented strength measurement testing Patient assessment naturally falls into three categ ories: 1) preventive evaluation (as in employee job-matching); 2) post-injury evaluatio n; and 3) outcome monitoring following care. Significant clinical information ca n be obtained toward these objectives, but careless interpretation of test data can result in inappropriate clinical decisions. Acute disorders are a contraindication to strength test protocols. The average discrepancy between symmetrical muscle groups for h ealthy populations has been reported as much as 12%. When evaluating an indivi dual's performance, differences of 20% or more may be needed to discriminate abnorm alities. a. Isometric testing There are several technical concerns in the perform ance of isometric tests: 1) the inertial effects at the onset of the test; 2) patie nt fatigue; 3) patient posture; and 4) patient motivation. The objective of the test is t o identify and record the maximum voluntary contraction force that can be sustained. At this time, the tasks that can be adequately represented with isometric tests are sag ittally symmetric. Up to 70% of work postures can be approximated symmetrically. N ormative data for occupational classifications of lifting activities as well as fo r reciprocal trunk strength ratios are available. Normative data is used to evaluate extr emity strength for post-injury assessment or seasonal sports fitness. Bilateral d ifferences greater than 15-20% indicate abnormality. The patient's motivation to supply a maximum effort can be assessed by repeated measurement and acceptable maximum effort protocols . Quantitative knowledge of the patient's posture during the performance of the str ength task is critical to any effort to relate the test result to joint loads or NIOSH stan dards. b. Isokinetic testing The primary measurement obtained is the torque gene rated which is only valid during the controlled part of the motion. The maximum vol untary effort will coincide with the greatest mechanical advantage of the joint for the motion that is being attempted. There are two technical concerns with isokinetic me asurements. They are: 1) gravitational effects; and 2) torque overshoot. Bo th may be corrected through computerized correction routines and damper setting . Standard isokinetic measurements are commonly taken at increments of 30 degrees per second using 2-6 repetitions with the maximum single torque value us ed as the measure of performance. As with isometric evaluation, the normal extensor/ flexer trunk ratio falls when impairment is present. Kannus, Nuan and Mayhew feel t he side-to-side comparison of extremity testing has some importance. c. Isoinertial testing While no testing method yet devised allows an asses sment of free dynamic motion-320-such as would occur at a work site or in sports, is oinertial equipment may come closer than others. Several authors have examined the abil ity to predict performance by controlling torque during movement. Isoinertial syst ems can be made capable of monitoring position, velocity and torque simultaneo usly. Measures of regional coupled motions appear to hold promise in discriminating fat igue effects from healthy movement. Likewise, velocity measurements appear t o be sensitive to lumbar spine disorders. Normative data is available for a numbe r of occupational subgroups, including sedentary workers. THERMOGRAPHY Since the introduction of the neurocalometer by Zvi ns in 1924, skin temperature measurements have played a significant role in the clinical prac tice of chiropractic. In the 1960s, thermographic imaging was being used by investigators to evaluate spinal lesions. Sensory nerve irritation is belie ved to produce reflex vasoconstriction of the arteriole s, of the skin, altering thermographic patterns. Urrichio described thermography as a physiological test that aids primarily in the diagnosis of sensor y nerve irritation. He stated that when a sensory ne rve is irritated, the sympathetic nerve associated with it causes vasoconstriction of the capillaries under the skin. Early thermographic research in spinal disorders re sulted in equivocal findings. Karpmen et al noted that \"Traumatic back injuries were readily evaluated thermographically,\" and reported that \"N o patient ... had a normal thermogram in association with an abnormal x-ray film.\" Standardized protocols and computer assisted analys is have dramatically improved the diagnostic sensitivity of thermography in neuromusc ular disorders. Uematsu et al developed a computer-calculated method of collecting thermograp hic data. They compiled normative data on 90 asymptomatic patients. Readings were obtained from 40 matched regions of the body surface. They then examined thermal asymmetries in 144 patients w ith low back pain. When asymmetries exceeded more than one standard deviation from the mean temp erature of homologous regions in control subjects, the positive predictive value in detectin g nerve root impingement was 94.7%. The specificity , or proportion of persons without the condition who have a negative test result, was 87.5%. Chafetz et al compared thermographic examination with CT of the lumbar spine. Fifteen asymptomatic subjects and 19 patients with CT scans demonstrating thecal sac contour distortion or nerve root displacement were examined. All 19 patients with positive CT sc ans had abnormal thermograms, a sensitivity of 100%. The specificity, however, was 60%. Several other investigators have compared thermogra phic finding with those of other diagnostic modalities. Weinstein and Weinstein compa red cervical thermography with EMG, CT, myelography, and surgical exploration. 500 patient s with neck or upper extremity complaints were studied. 197 (39.4%) were found to be positive for root pathology. Of these, 190 (96.4%) were ultimately confirmed by EMO, CT, myelography, and/o r surgery. Hubbard conducted a study of 85 thermographic exami nations. A high correlation was reported (94%) between pain distribution patterns a nd cervical and lumbar thermograms. The thermographic results were well correlated with EMO , myelography and CT studies. 52 control thermographic studies were performed on young asymp tomatic patients, and 90% were reported as \"normal.\" At least two state Appellate Court decisions have f ound that evidence relating to liquid crystal thermography results are admissible as evidence to demonstrate injury resulting from automobile accidents. See Fay v. Mincey, 454 So.2d 587 (Fla. So.2d value of thermography as a diagno stic tool in the evaluation of soft tissue lesions, there are procedural elements that must be effectively addressed: 1. Strict protocols must be followed to minimize art ifacts. 2. Interpretation requires a high level of training an d experience. 3. The examination is relatively time consuming. 4. The use of thermographic imaging to evaluate moto r nerve involvement is not supported in the literature. The principal application for thermography in the e valuation of soft tissue lesions appears to be in demonstrating and characterizing sensory nerv e involvement. Body heat loss to the environment takes place passi vely by convection, conduction and radiation. Regional body temperature is governed b y the interaction of central autonomic control mechanisms and multi-segmental spinal vasomotor ref lexes. Regional variations of sympathetic thermoregulation produce a complex pattern of tempe rature distribution including cephalocaudal, diurnal and circadian patterns. Accurate measure r equires accommodation of the skin to room temperature, which should be kept at between 33.5 t o 34 C. For reproducible measures, the patient needs to establish constant patterns of work and re st and follow-up testing should be performed at the same time of day. Measurements of skin temperature and the amount of heat radiated from anatomically symmetrical regions yields useful info rmation about the relative circulatory volume to ea ch part. Areas of increased cutaneous temperature hav e been ascribed to vasodilation occurring during a migraine headache, inflammation or muscle spasm. Decreased cutaneous temperature may reflect vasoconstriction, vascular obstruction, fibrous and fatty replacement. An abundance of literature is available documenting employment of thermography as a screening tool; e.g., detection of deep vein thrombosis, identification of allergic reaction, qu alification of vascular phenomena, and the identification of pain. 1. Thermocouple devices Several thermocouple devices have been marketed to be used for the determination of local paraspinal temperature variations. Patter ns of heat along the spinal column and their changes following spinal adjustments, prov ide useful data in some chiropractic techniques. 2. Telethermography Measurement of skin temperature differences across the torso, head and extremities as a means of evaluating functional changes from so matic lesions. Various forms of \"gold standard\" comparison have been used including surgical confirmation of disc herniation and percentage agreement of statistical correlation with other more widely accepted diagnostic procedures. Normative data are available; for example, see Chang et al., 1985, Feldman and Nickolff 1984, Good man et al., 1986, and Uematsu et al., 1988. A number of efforts to evaluate diagn ostic truth from telethermographic measures have been made. The results of comparative studies of thermography and other diagnostic procedures for nerve root entrapme nts are quite varied. Where some studies claim that thermography has little diagnost ic and uncertain prognostic value in the evaluation of low back pain and radiculopathy, others praise its sensitivity and positive predictive value. Thermographic images ha ve been used in the diagnosis of myofascial pain syndromes and their respective pain referral zones. Perhaps the strongest evidence for use of telethermography is f or cases of suspected neurodystrophy. There has been a high correlation between the thermographically defined referral zones and those as described in th e literature. Additional zones, not previously identified, have also been recognized.-322-GALVANIC SKIN RESPONSE (GSR) Devices to detect differences in paraspinal regiona l electrical skin resistance have been employed by the chiropractic profession for many de cades. Loci of lowered skin resistance were thought to be related to areas of cutaneous hyper o f hyposympathetic activity. ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIC RECORDINGS Numerous variables affect all electrophysiologic re cordings: 1) the size and location of the recording electrode; 2) the configuration of the el ectrode position relative to the structure being recorded; 3) characteristic resistance of the tissu es; 4) the pathophysiology of the patient's problem and 5) artifacts. 1. Electrodiagnosis Several specialized procedures are available to eva luate select neuromuscular functions. These include measures of myoelectric activity duri ng muscular loading, fatigue studies, conduction velocity tests, H-wave and F-wave respon ses, and evoked potentials. Generally these studies can be simply grouped as either 1) st imulation studies; or 2) electromyography (EMG). The clinical procedures are sometimes divid ed according to whether needle or surface electrodes are used. The International Chiropracto rs Association does not support the use of needle electrodes in chiropractic practice becau se of the invasive nature of the procedure. Surface electrode studies may be used in many cases , but are traditionally applied to the examination of nerve conduction velocities, reflex studies and kinesiological evaluations. In kinesiological applications, up to 16% of the surfa ce recordings from the upper leg muscles, for example, is from co-contraction activity. Surf ace electrodes may be used with repetitive stimulation to examine suspected myoneural junction disorders. Somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) are performed with surface electrod es. SEP serve to discern between peripheral and cord (dorsal column) lesion sites. Needle electrode studies are classically termed electromyography. This technique may be use d in all varieties of electrodiagnostic studies, but it is required to detect denervation, myoneural junction disorders, cerebellar and brainstem tremors, anterior cord disease and motor unit potentials. 2. Nerve stimulation studies Nerve stimulation studies can be performed using ei ther surface or needle electrodes. Basic information may be gained about the neuromus cular peripheral sensory and motor components using conduction velocity and refl ex responses of the nerve (i.e., H-reflex and F-waves). Practically, this informati on may be used to evaluate the nerve trunk integrity as well as significant compression, or temporal dispersion from entrapment of utabolic neuropathy. Both sensory an d motor studies permit analysis of wave form, amplitude and duration of the impulse. Nerve compression from lumbar root lesions can be quantified. While nerve conduc tion velocity is a poor index for radicular syndromes, F-waves and H-reflexes are mor e useful. Similar use can be made for study of complaints from the upper extremi ty. Sensitivity and specificity for each of the following electrodiagnostic procedures are well studied. Sequencing of tests often increases the diagnostic yield. Timing of tests performed with respect to the onset of symptoms is important since their appearan ce and disappearance can be temporally dependent.-323-Evoked, transforaminal responses (surface or needle) : Peripheral motor nerve fibers of major nerve trunks from the extremities may be e valuated by use of the F-wave of Maglodery. Adequate assessment requires a sequence of supramaximal stimuli with measure of several response latencies. These signa ls may be absent in diseases of compression affecting the anterior horn or peripher al nerve. For lesions involving the peripheral motor or senso ry fibers from L5/S1 or SI/S2, the Hoffman reflex may be used. A series of progressively incr easing sub-threshold to supra-threshold stimuli are used to evaluate sensory and motor fiber responses. Nerve conduction studies (surface or needle NCV): M otor nerves can be evaluated for site and severity of lesions from mechanical or pathological causes. Stimulation of major nerve trunks at a series of sites along their path can locate the reg ion affected. Characteristic wave form and relativ e conduction velocity changes may also be important t o differentiate between causes of nerve damage. Sensory nerve conduction is studied in a similar f ashion. Somatosensory evoked potentials (Surface or Needle SSEP): Similar to conduction velocities, these procedures stimulate the peripheral nerve eit her at accessible nerve trunks or by dermatomal sensory nerve endings. Responses may be monitored along the nerve pathway traversing the IVF, spinal cord, brainstem and cortex. 3. Electromyography surface measurement that m onitors myoelectric volitional responses can be used to examine superficial layer muscle recruitment and fatigue. When calibrated against known exertional efforts, b iomechanical estimates of muscle tensions for simple isometric tasks can be made. C linical applications to the evaluation of spine related disorders has been proposed under the heading of surface paraspinal scanning EMG using either poststyle or adhesive tap e-on electrodes. SURFACE VS. NEEDLE TECHNIQUES Electromyography is the technique of recording elec trical potentials associated with muscular activity. Electrodes may be inserted in the muscle being monitored, or surface electrodes may be placed on the skin overlying the muscles being stud ied. Both techniques have been used in the examination of paraspinal and peripheral muscles. Needle techniques are frequently used to evaluate abnormalities in peripheral muscle activity. Such abnormalities may be due to spinal disease, nerve root involvement, peripheral nerve entrapment, or d isease of the muscle itself. In contrast, surface techniques are most commonly employed in kinesiolog ical studies, biofeedback applications, and chiropractic analysis. The following table summar izes the features of each technique: SURFACE ELECTRODES Record composite potentials of muscles working toge ther. Non-invasive; painless. Easy to duplicate protocols for longitudinal studie s. Some high frequency loss. No insertion potentials.-324-Very good test-retest reliability. In summary, needle techniques are appropriate for t he evaluation of specific muscles, while surface electrodes are appropriate for kinesiologic al studies of the \"global\" function of groups of muscles. Cobb et al reported that pain was more likely to de monstrate change in surface electrode EMG activity than needle EMG potentials. They conclude d that \"...muscle spasm (even when mild) is accompanied by muscular hyperactivity which can be evaluated by suitable electromyographic techniques. Our data suggest that surface electrod es allow better sampling than Teflon coated needles...\" and that \"...integration procedures all ow better quantification than does the visual evaluation of an EMG...\" Komi and Buskirk compared t he test-retest reliability of needle vs. surface electrode electromyographic measurements. The aver age test-retest reliability for surface electrodes was 0.88, compared to 0.62 for inserted electrodes. Spector conducted a study of the reliability of surface electrode paraspinal electromyography. Res ults of the study yielded correlation coefficients ranging between 0.73 and 0.97. Thompson et al of t he Mayo Clinic found EMG scanning correlates highly with attached electrode technique. Surface techniques, therefore, appear superior to inserted electrode methods for longitudinal studies where ca se progress and care response are being evaluated. NORMATIVE DATA Cram has published normative data for paraspinal EM G potentials in pain and non-pain populations. His protocol was limited to scanning five sites. These sites were the cervical paraspin als, T-1, T-6, T-10, and L-3. In addition to calculatin g the mean, criteria for mild, moderate, and radica l elevations are offered. The cutoff for mild elevat ion is the first standard deviation. For a moderat e elevation, it is the second standard deviation. Fo r a radical elevation, it is the third standard dev iation. Test-retest reliability was also reported by Cram. The median for the correlation coefficients of EMG scans was .83. In an effort to more specifically characterize para spinal activity (Kent) developed a protocol for scanning 15 paraspinal sites. These include othe r segmental level, plus the transitional areas of t he spine. Kent collected normative data using this protocol. A ProScan 2000 two channel EMO scanner was employed. This equipment has an input impedenc e of 1,000,000 megohms, and noise rejection exceeding 180 db. A bandwidth of 100-200 HZ. was empl oyed. The preamplifier is mounted in the electrode assembly, eliminating the noise which may be induced in cables when the preamplifier is separate from the electrode assembly. The two chan nel system permits simultaneous recording of potentials on both sides of the spine. Each electrode/preamplifier assembly has three silv er/silver chloride electrodes in a triangular configuration. Two are active electrodes, and one is a ground reference electrode. By maintaining a constant distance between active and ground refer ence electrodes, artifacts caused by inconsistent electrode placement are minimized. During data col lection, an electrode assembly applied to each side of the spine, approximately 1 cm lateral to levels scanned except C-1. At the C-l level, an electrod e assembly is placed over each atlas transverse proce ss, inferior to the mastoid process. 52 student volunteers at Palmer College of Chiropra ctic-West met the criteria for participation and were scanned. Prospective subjects were requir ed to complete a questionnaire concerning back or neck pain which they had experienced. The prosp ective subjects were not advised of the criteria for selection when presented with the questionnaire . To be included in the normative population, a-325-subject had to be free of any back or neck pain of greater than 48 hours duration for a period of at least one year. The subjects selected ranged from 2 1-42 years of age. The mean age was 26.6 years. 33 subjects were males and 19 subjects were females. The mean and standard deviation of the potentials a t each site were calculated. Proprietary software incorporated into the ProScan 2000 EMG sca nner compares the readings of a patient being examined with the normative data. This information can be incorporated into a printed report, and/or stored on a hard disk. In the analysis of paraspin al EMG potentials, two parameters are considered: amplitude (signal intensity) and symmetry (compari son of the left side to the right). PAIN AND PARASPINAL EMG ACTIVITY The relationship between altered paraspinal EMG pot entials and pain has been explored by several investigators. Price et al reported that a bnormal patterns of EMG activity were associated wi th areas of pain and tenderness in the back. It was s uggested that these changes may have resulted from attempts by the patient to relieve pain by alt ering position. Muscle tension backache is thought to be due to a \" vicious cycle\" of pain producing spasm, and spasm producing pain. Calliet states that increa sed involuntary muscle activity is an etiologic factor in chronic pain. Price et al suggested that splinting and tensing of muscles causes diminished blood flow resulting in ischemic pain. Muscle spas m appears to be a \"common denominator\" in a variety of myogenic pain syndromes including fibros itis, myalgis, and myofascial pain syndrome. Muscle spasm is accompanied by elevated EMG levels. Although elevated potentials associated with spasm may be seen in patients with back pain, other investigators have found that symmetry of EMG potentials may also be clinically significant. Wo lf et al reported that low back pain may result in low or asymmetrical EMG potentials, as well as elevate d readings. Triano and Luttges described four types of EMG patterns considering both amplitude and symmetry. Kent and Hyde described low amplitude sy mmetrical readings and high amplitude asymmetrical readings in patients presenting for ch iropractic care. EMG CHANGES FOLLOWING ADJUSTMENT OR MANIPULATION Ellestad et al studied the effect of manipulation on surface electrode electromyographic potentials in patients with low back pain and pain free controls. 20 subjects with low back pain of a t least 2 weeks but no longer than six months duratio n were examined. The pain was localized in the erector spinae musculature between L-2 and S-1. 20 controls who denied any low back symptoms within the six months preceding the study were also examined. Active EMG electrodes were placed 2 cm lateral to t he spinous processes of L-3 and L-5. One electrode was placed on side of the spinous process of each level. A ground electrode was also applied to each patient. EMG recordings were made with each subject standing, prone, and in active lumbar extension. High velocity low amplitude techniques were applied to 10 pain patients and 10 pain free subjects. The remaining 20 patients and controls r eceived no care. The paraspinal EMG activity of those individuals receiving manipulation was signif icantly reduced. Further, the reduction in EMG potentials were noted as well in the pain free grou p, albeit to a lesser degree. No significant chang es in paraspinal EMG activity were observed in the non -treatment groups. Shambaugh conducted a pilot study where surface ele ctrodes were used to measure paraspinal EMG activity before and after chiropract ic adjustment. Shambaugh concluded, \"Results of this study show that significant changes in muscle electrical activity occur as a consequence of adjusting.\"-326-PARASPINAL EMG SCANNING AND VERTEBRAL SUBLUXATION Paraspinal EMG scanning may be useful in documentin g the muscular dysfunction of the vertebral subluxation complex and monitoring the mu scular responses of a patient to a course of chiropractic care. Traditional chiropractic philos ophy defines the vertebral subluxation in terms of four criteria: 1. Loss of juxtaposition of a vertebra with the one above, the one below, or both 2. Occlusion of an opening 3. Impingement of nerve 4. Interference with the transmission of mental impu lses. A contemporary definition of the vertebral subluxat ion complex proposes at least five components: 1. Spinal Kinesiopathology 2. Neuropathology 3. Myopathology 4. Histopathology Bio-chemical Changes/Pathology definitions incorporate biomechanical and path ophysiological manifestations. A number of procedures have been utilized in chirop ractic practice to detect and evaluate vertebral subluxations: A. To detect biomechanical changes 1. Postural analysis 2. Static palpation 3. Motion palpation 4. Static radiograph 5. Functional radiograph 6. Computed tomography 7. Magnetic resonance imaging B. To detect neurophysiological changes 1. Orthopedic examination 2. Neurological examination a. Reflexes b. Muscle strength tests c. Dermatome examination d. Functional leg checks 3. Thermography 4. Electromyography. The reliability of these procedures vary greatly. Some techniques, while potentially valuable to individual practitioners do not exhibit acceptab le levels of test-retest reliability. The reliabil ity of others may depend on the skill of the examiner and the protocols employed. For decades, chiropractors were taught to explore t he paravertebral muscles for \"taut and tender\" fibres surrounding areas of vertebral sublux ation. Useful as such techniques may be in clinica l-327-practice, they are subject to charges of subjectivi ty. It has been proposed that surface electrode EM G scanning may be used to monitor patient progress un der chiropractic care, to determine the severity of myospasm, and to quantify muscular activity. INDICATIONS Gentempo and Kent published specific indications fo r paraspinal EMG scanning in chiropractic practice. The test is indicated if any three of th e following are present: 1. Palpable paraspinal muscle spasm. 2. Palpable asymmetry of the paraspinal muscles. 3. Asymmetrical range(s) of motion. 4. Paraspinal muscle tenderness (pain on pressure). 5. Paraspinal pain reported by patient. 6. History of trauma to the spine. 7. Diagnosis of nerve root irritation evidenced by a bnormal neurological examination findings. 8. Clinical presentation of an antalgic gait or lean . 9. Diminished or asymmetrical paraspinal muscle stre ngth demonstrated by manual or electronic muscle testing. 10. Thermographic evidence of paraspinal muscle dysf unction. CONCLUSION Surface electrode paraspinal EMG scanning is an acc epted clinical tool to evaluate the changes in paraspinal muscle activity frequently en countered in chiropractic. It is a means of quantifying palpation findings, and as a tool in si ngle patient time series case studies. Longitudina l studies to determine patient response to chiropract ic care represent another potential area for clinic al research. Further, paraspinal EMG scanning appears u seful in detecting areas of muscle spasm. Like any diagnostic tool, paraspinal EMG scan data must be correlated with other clinical findings, and cannot be relied upon as the sole basis for a chiro practic diagnosis. OTHER INSTRUMENT MEASURES Several other types of examining instruments are in use within the chiropractic profession. As none of these are widespread, only the fundamentals of their use will be described. 1. Non-invasive vascular measures Both plethysmography and doppler ultrasonic measures allow objective evaluation of vascular disorders by quantifying segmental limb bl ood pressures, velocities or pulse wave forms. Doppler ultrasound:-328-Doppler ultrasound is the most simple and versatile method available for screening examinations of suspected vascular disease of the p eripheral vessels; however, doppler spectral analysis (Duplex scanning) is more accurate for cer ebrovascular and visceral arterial disease. For lower extremity claudication, doppler will ident ify significant occlusive arterial disease with a high degree of reproducibility. Special procedur es of value include the ankle/arm index and lower extremity, multi-segmental pressure analysis. The latter examines for a pressure gradient greater tha n 3 mm Hg across appropriate intervals (200). Hemodyna mic deficit may be further evaluated using hyperemia procedures. IV. RECOMMENDATIONS All recommendations are made based upon the assumpt ion that the operator/examiner is appropriately trained, versed in the technical issu es affecting the qualities of safety, validity, discriminability, accuracy, precision and reliabili ty of the measures. Standardized test protocols an d periodic instrument calibration is important to ens ure clinical utility of the information. Interpret ation should be made by the attending clinician in all ca ses. Perceptual Measurements A. Questionnaires as Instruments Questionnaire instruments are safe and effective. Several instruments have been fully validated, are widely used and well established. T heir use is supported by both Class I (modified to the discipline of measurement) and Cla ss II evidence. 16.1.1 Rating : Established Strength Level Type A. B. Screening Questionnaire Their use is safe and effective, supported by Class II and III evidence. 16.2.1 Rating : Established Strength Type C. C. Algometer (pain pressure threshold) Manually applying pressure into the spinal and para spinal tissues to produce tenderness in support of vertebral subluxation and other malposit ioned articulations and structures analysis has been used nearly since the chiropractic profess ion began. A Pressure Pain Threshold meter yields a measurement when the recipient feels a change from pressure to tenderness as it produces mechanical irritation of the deep so matic structures. Fisher has shown that pressure pain thresholds are highly symmetrical. R eliability coefficients were shown to be 0.71 to 0.97 by Reeves et al. It has been shown to be v ery useful in measuring change in paraspinal tissue tenderness following spinal adjus tments. 16.3.1. Rating : Established Evidence: E, L, C KINESIOPATHOLOGY The electrogoniometer (EGM) EGM is a computerinter faced, electromechanical device which quantifies the location of points in th ree dimensional space and then calculates various numerical descriptors of postura l alignment. The EGM has been found to be reliable and valid in measuring lines i n inanimate objects and found to be more reliable than the manual goniometer for measur ing joint range-of-motion. The EGM has been found to be accurate and reliable in d etermining leg lengths. Adams et al found that the intra and inter-examiner relia bility of the EGM for plumb line postural analysis was very high for specific and ge neral postural measurements. Wagnon reports that the instrument is reliable for measuring skeletal-muscular parameters, subject only to the skill of the operat or in locating anatomical landmarks. 16.4.1 Rating : Established Evidence: E, L, C 2. Inclinometry An inclinometer is a hand-held device that uses the constant vertical component of gravity as a reference and yields a measure of moti on when held against the area being motion tested. Accuracy has been shown to be within 3 to 5 degrees. 16.4.2. Rating : Established Evidence: E, L, C 3. Goniometry A goniometer is a large protractor that may be held in the proximity of the area being motion tested to provide a means by which to determ ine degrees of motion. A 10-15 degree of accuracy is common. Due to its lack of a ccuracy and reliability, the Goniometer has been largely replaced by the Inclino meter. 16.4.3. Rating : Established Evidence: E, L, C 4. Optically Based Systems Optically based systems are established for evaluat ing specific gait abnormalities or risky positions related to work tasks. They are safe and effective when evaluated by specially trained personnel and are supported by Class II evi dence. 16.4.4. Rating : Established Strength Type B B. Muscle strength testing Many chiropractic techniques utilize manual muscle testing for evaluation of vertebral subluxation. These techniques typically use manual muscle testing for the purpose of vertebral subluxation and other malpositioned articulations a nd structures analysis and are typically limited to gross bilateral differences in patient r esistance or a virtually total lack of resistance that is easily detectable by the experienced practi tioner. Manual and mechanized muscle testing may also be used to demonstrate subtle chan ges in muscle strength as a result of-330-nerve function. 1. Manual - Manual evaluation of muscle strength give s only an approximation of capability. One reference indicates that a differe nce of 35% in muscle strength must exist to be detected by manual testing. 16.5.1. Rating : Estabished Evidence: E, L 2. Hand-held (Dynamometer) - The dynamometer is a ha nd-held device which produces greater reliability and accuracy than manual testin g. 6.5.2. Rating : Estabished Evidence: E, L 3. (e.g., Dynatron myo-logi c), Isokinetic, Isoinertial. Established Evidence: E, L Physiologic and Electrophysiologic Measurements A Temperature reading devices Highly significant temperature changes have been no ted in spinal and paraspinal tissues following a chiropractic adjustment. Hand-held the rmographic devices \"have been evaluated and shown to have moderate to excellent inter-examiner reliability over short time durations.\" Early chiropractic investigators recognized three b asic physiological concepts that underlie the value of cutaneous thermography: /square4the body is segmented into \"dermatomes\"; /square4side-to-side skin are generally symmet rical unless dysfunction exists; and /square4any anomalous deviation from a gradually increasing paraspinal skin temperature from S-2 to C-1 may be indicative of the vertebral subluxation and other malpositioned articulations and structures or other dysfunction. 1. Thermocouple: The use of thermocouple instrument ation in chiropractic practice is well established. 2. a. Single-channel (e.g., chirometer) b. Dual-channel (e.g., Neurocalograph (NCGH), Thermo scribe, Analograph) The dual probe devices give a bilateral comparative temperature reading of the paraspinal tissues. However, the instrument requir es skin contact. 16.6.1. Rating : Established Evidence: E, L 2. Infrared Thermography-331-Infrared instruments detect and record changes in t emperature rapidly and require no skin contact, and are relevant to chiropractic pra ctice. 1.

Current Perception Threshold Devices (e.g., neuro meter) The current perception threshold device is a variab le constant current sine wave stimulator proposed as a simple non-invasive and quantitative measure of peripheral nerve function. The neurometer has been shown to be appropriate for rap id screening for neural dysfunction. 16.9.1 Rating : Established Evidence: E, L E. Electroencephalography (EEG) Standard EEG and computerized EEG, also known as br ain mapping, have been shown to be useful in chiropractic patient management and docum ent the effectiveness of chiropractic care.. 16.10.1. Rating : Established Evidence: E, L F. Tissue compliance measurements The tissue compliance instruments measure soft tiss ue consistency or compliance. Caution should be used in interpreting pre- and post-adjust ment readings based on information which has shown that 26% of readings taken ten minutes follow ing initial testing were significantly different wi thout any intervention. A bilateral difference of greate r than 2mm at 2 kg is significant and suggests pathological asymmetry. 16.11.1. Rating : Established Evidence: E, L 2. Surface electromyography (EMG) is the technique o f collecting and recording the electrical activity of the muscles.-332-Surface EMG, also known as self-contained, hand-held electrode assembly connec ted to a computerized system that measures electrical potentials associated with the muscle in question. Electrodes are placed over the muscle in question. It enables sca nning of paraspinal muscles over several vertebral levels. Very good test-retest re liability has been shown due to ease of duplicating protocols for longitudinal studies. P rotocols and normative data for paraspinal EMG scanning in the chiropractic practic e have been suggested by Kent & Gentempo. The same authors have found that Surfac e EMG potentials are substantially higher in children than in adults. G entempo reported that \"electromyographic findings were consistent with th e clinical and radiographic manifestations of subluxation and myospasm.\" Signi ficant changes in surface EMG potentials have been shown after a chiropractic adj ustment. 16.11.2 Rating : Established Evidence: E, H- reflex, SSEP) are established procedures effective for examination of peripheral nerve disorders and are supported by Class I and Class II evidence. Somatosensory evoked potentials are established for limited applications to peripheral nerve disorders and lesions affecting th e long sensory tracks of the spinal cord. 16.12.1. Rating : Established Strength Type A I. Other Instrument Measures 1. Spirometry Pulmonary function testing is established as a meth od to assess effect of severe scoliosis and the differential diagnosis of lung di sease. These uses are backed by Class I and Class II evidence. The procedures are safe and effective when performed by appropriately trained personnel. 16.13.1. Rating : Established Strength Type A V. COMMENTS Instrumentation has been used in chiropractic nearl y since its inception in 1895. Many advances in the accuracy and usefulness of the inst ruments have taken place. The use of instrumentation provides a scientific basis for ana lysis and outcome assessment in chiropractic practice. Due to advances that have been made in i nstrumentation germane to the analysis of vertebral subluxation the past decade, it is antici pated that the contents of this chapter will requir e periodic updating.

Prevention of complications from chiropractic c are is facilitated when good professional judgment is e xercised and quality care is provided. Elements common to all primary care practitioners include su fficient history taking and record keeping, thoroug h examination, timely re-evaluation procedures throug hout the course of case management, good communication with the patient and appropriate resp onse in the event that an unexpected incident does occur. If a significant adverse result from a procedure is apparent, it is of critical importanc e that the intervention or procedure associated with the o nset of the complication not be repeated. The evidence of low incidence of injury or complica tions from adjustments is promoted by quality care which follows professional judgment consistent with the objectives of chiropractic car e. Chiropractic professional judgment includes, witho ut limitation, appropriate response to unexpected findings and reevaluation of the suitability of a p articular technique or procedure associated with th e discovery of a complication. The chiropractor shou ld be alert to the possibility of encountering unus ual findings in any phase of care. Patient safety can be further enhanced by the chiro practic profession's commitment to quality assurance. When assessing the safety and efficacy of chiroprac tic care, two factors should always be considered: the type of technique being utilize d and the integrity of the area of the spinal colum n/or articulation being addressed. These two factors as sist in evaluating any risk that may be associated with the application of chiropractic care. The primary focus of the chiropractic management of complications is the recognition of unusual findings that may require modification o f the plan of care when the unusual finding is observed. II. LIST OF SUBTOPICS To assist in understanding the patient evaluation p rocess in the context of possible complications or special circumstances where proced ures may need to be modified to meet the needs of a particular patient, the following list of con ditions is provided. This list is not a list of co nditions for which chiropractic procedures are contraindicated.

Since i ts inception as a separate and distinct health care profession, chiropractic has establishe d itself as the safest primary care profession by far. Despite the high volume of pati ents and the great diversity of conditions with which they present, chiropractic can claim the lowest complication rate, the lowest malpractice insurance rates and the highest rates o f patient satisfaction of any doctor level provider. The Government of New Zealand, while studying the p ossibility of inclusion of chiropractic services in that nation's public health care progra ms, conducted one of the most exhaustive studies of chiropractic safety ever cond ucted. Their findings were emphatic: The conspicuous lack of evidence that chiropra ctors cause harm or allow harm to occur through neglect of medical referral can be taken t o mean only one thing: that chiropractors have on the whole an impressive s afety record. Over the past two decades there has been an interes ting growth of literature on general manipulation-induced accidents or injuries. This bo dy of information clearly distinguishes the safety record of chiropractic because the vast majority of recorded injuries are found to be at the hands of non-chiropractic providers attempting to apply chir opractic like procedures, without the highly developed skill and experience of the doctor of chi 1971). There can be little doubt that the elevated level of reporting arises from a general increase in awareness of complications by all professionals interested in spinal manipulative therapy, and an increased incidence of the use of manual procedures by professionals not thoroughly trained in the arts of manipulation or adjustment. As well, since many alleged \"consequences\" are consistent with the natural history of a condition, anecdotal or po lemic reports must be distinguished from those that-346-provide objective evidence of true manipulation-ind uced injuries. Many case reports of injury have proven to be unfounded upon further unbiased inquir y. With respect to the frequency of possibly genuine c omplications, Ladermann (1980) identified 135 case reports of serious complications over a 30 year period from 1950-1980, a time period during which tens of millions of adjustments were administ ered by a variety of practitioners. Kleynhans (1980), analyzing some of these case studies, outli ned a number of likely practitioner-related causes of adverse reactions and suggested three main facto rs: lack of knowledge or diagnostic error; lack of technique skill; and lack of rational clinical a ttitude in case management. These causes could wel l account for a number of iatrogenic injuries reporte d in the literature, e.g., pathological fractures (Austin, 1985; Holta, 1942), ruptured abdominal ane urysms (Kornberge, 1988), electrotherapy burns and injuries, etc. Jasoviak (1981) and Terrett (1987) specifically dea lt with case reviews on the adverse effect of cervical adjustment where vertebrobasilar insuff iciency was evident. Gutmann (1984), Terrett (1987), Theil (1991) and Schmitt (1991) have recentl y described or studied the biomechanical effects of head and neck movement and cervical adjustment i n association with vertebral artery injury. Adjustment has been identified as only one of many activities or health care procedures that may resul t in damage to the vertebral artery. However, it has been the one most extensively reviewed and discussed. (Pratt-Thomas and Berger, 1947; Gutmann 1957, 1987; Hulse, Martienssen and Nilsoon, 1989; Raskind and North, 1 990). Rare case reports of adverse events following spina l adjustment exist in the literature. In the case of strokes purportedly associated with adjustm ent, significant shortcomings in the literature wer e noted. In a letter to the editor of JMPT , Myler wrote: \"I was curious how the risk of fatal stroke after cervical adjustment, placed at 0.00025% compared wi th the risk of (fatal) stroke in the general population of the United States. According to data obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics, the mortality rate from stroke was calc ulated to be 0.00057%. If this data was accurate, the risk of death from stroke after cervical adjustment is less than half the risk of fatal stroke in the general population!\" Jaskoviak reported that not a single case of verteb ral artery stroke occurred in approximately 5 million cervical adjustments at The National Coll ege of Chiropractic Clinic from 1965 to 1980. LeBoeuf-Yde et al suggested that there may be an ov er-reporting of spinal adjustive related injuries. The authors reported cases involving two fatal strokes, a heart attack, a bleeding basilar aneurysm, paresis of an arm and a leg, and cauda eq uina syndrome which occurred in individuals who were considering chiropractic care, yet because of chance, did not receive it. Had these events been temporally related to a chiropractic office visit, it is likely that they would have been inappropriat ely attributed to the chiropractic care. In many cases of strokes attributed to chiropractic care where the operator was not a chiropractor at all. Terrett observed that manipulat ions administered by a Kung Fu practitioner, GPs, osteopaths, physiotherapists, a wife, a blind masse ur, and an Indian barber were incorrectly attribute d to chiropractors. As Terrett wrote, \"The words chi ropractic and chiropractor have been incorrectly used in numerous publications dealing with SMT inju ry by medical authors, respected medical journals and medical organizations. In many cases, this is not accidental; the authors had access to original reports that identified the practitioner involved a s a non-chiropractor. The true incidence of such reporting cannot be determined. Such reporting adv ersely affects the reader's opinion of chiropractic-347-and chiropractors.\" No reliable screening tests were identified which e nable a chiropractor to predict patients at risk for stroke. After examining twelve patients w ith dizziness reproduced by extension-rotation and twenty healthy controls with Doppler ultrasound of the vertebral arteries, Cote et al concluded,\" We were unable to demonstrate that the extension-rotat ion test is a valid clinical screening procedure to detect decreased blood flow in the vertebral artery . The value of this test for screening patients at risk of stroke after cervical adjustment is questionable .\" Terrett noted, There is also no evidence which suggests that positive tests have any correlation t o future VBS (vertebrobasilar stroke) and SMT (spinal manipulative therapy). It is thought that cervical rotation combined with extension and traction may have some obstructive effect on perfusion of the vertebral ar tery on the contralateral side of rotation. If the ipsilateral artery is diseased or hypoplastic, symp toms of hind brain ischemia may occur because the dominant healthy artery is under partial physiologi cal compression, resulting in a loss of sufficient or compensatory blood flow. If trauma to the arterial wall does occur, thrombus formation may be the result. Further, this may lead to stroke or stroke -like complications in susceptible patients. While incidence figures vary, it is generally agreed that the risk of serious neurological complications is extremely low, and is approximately one or two per million cervical adjustments. Structural abnormalities, particularly where mechanical instab ility pathological bone disorders, dislocations and fractures of the cervical spine are present may als o lead to mechanical strain of the vertebral arteri es (Terrett, 1987; Jaskoviak, 1981; Ladermann, 1981). Other cervical complications, which are rare but ha ve either been reported or described in the literature, include Horner's syndrome, diaphragmati c paralysis, cervical myelopathy secondary pathological Gatterman, 1991). Dislocation in the upper cervica l spine due to inflammatory or traumatic rupture of the transverse atlantal or alar ligaments warrants particular caution 1980, 1987; Jeffreys, 1980; Sandman, 1981; Redlund-Johnell, 198 4). Though rarely reported in literature, empirically t he most common complaint of adjustment of the thoracic region occurs when forceful or poorly applied manipulations cause costovertebral strains, rib fractures and costochondral separations (Grieve , 1986). Excessive thoracolumbar torque in the side posture position as well as inappropriately ap plied posterior to anterior techniques may cause thoracic cage injuries particularly in the elderly. Lower back injury alleged to have occurred followin g spinal adjustment therapy has been reported in patients with pre-existing disc herniat ion or prolapse (CCPA Claim Review, 1990; Bromley, and Cartesgna, 1983). While it is sug gested that the forces required to cause a disruption of the annular fibers of the healthy int ervertebral disc well exceed that of a rotational adjustive thrust (Adams and Hutton, 1981, 1983; Far fan, 1983; Gilmore, 1986; Triano, 1991), some disc herniation/protrusion may certainly be aggrava ted by an inappropriately applied adjustive maneuver, as it may be by the other simple activiti es of daily living such as bending, sneezing, lifti ng. The most frequently described severe complication is compression of the cauda equina by massive midline nuclear herniation at the level of third, f ourth or fifth intervertebral disc oper, 1973). Of the thirty cauda equina complications associated with adjustment reported in the French, German and English literature over an 80 year perio d, only eight were allegedly related to chiropracti c care (Ladermann, 1980). Had these patients not be en manipulated, the outcome may have been the same with menial effort or impulsive strain replaci ng the rupturing effect alleged to arise from the adjustment. However, this clinical outcome does st ress the need for particular care in this susceptib le-348-subgroup of patients. However, given the frequency of lumbar adjustment and the few reported complications over a long period of time, it does n ot appear that there is any risk associated with appropriately applied adjustment techniques includi ng those utilizing high velocity thrust. To sum it up, it appears that lumbar roll type techniques, whethe r done safe compared to the lumbar hyperextension (Durchang of the German authors) und er narcosis. Psychological factors including pain intolerance, h ysteria conversion reactions, hypochondriasis, malingering, etc., require special consideration, since the presence of spine related symptoms may be of secondary importance. Aside from the risk of creating a dependency for care that may or may not be indicated, chiropractic care itse lf may aggravate or contribute to real or imagined harm. It is important to note that the scientific literat ure as well as the judicial record clearly illustrates that most serious adverse effects with manual or \"spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) have not been the result of procedures performed by doct ors of chiropractic. It is important, therefore, to protect the public and insure quality and safety of care, that throughout all the professions a stand ard minimum training greater than or equal to that of a doctor of chiropractic in adjustive/manual procedures be required prior to performance of manu al procedures to the human spine. IV. ASSESSMENT CRITERIA The main focus for the prevention of complication s is the recognition of well known and established indicators or \"red flag\" signs and symp toms, which may require careful assessment and reassessment, changes in chiropractic care plan, or other appropriate action such as emergency care or referral to another health care specialist. Ign oring these \"red flag\" indicators increases the likelihood of patient harm. The literature and clinical experience show that th e most common therapeutic procedure in chiropractic practice, and the one most likely to r esult in complications, is the adjustment or high- velocity manipulative thrust. The following assess ment criteria and recommendations relate to this procedure applied to, or adjacent to, the anatomica l site of pathology. Assessment criteria developed and used in this chap ter relate to: A) Rating of conditions B) Severity of complication C) Quality of evidence D) Level of identifiable contraindication: based on the above factors and the probability of complication A. Rating of Conditions: Type I: A condition for which high-velocity thrust procedur es have been shown to be comparatively safe and effective so long as an adeq uate patient assessment has been made and an intervention trial is rationally applie d (e.g., upper cervical dysfunction/subluxation associated with tension hea daches). Type II: A Type I condition is present but may be coincident with another related or unrelated condition requiring modification of procedures and/ or further diagnostic assessment-349-(e.g., upper cervical joint dysfunction/subluxation accompanied by widening of the atlantodental interval or inflammatory causes affec ting the area). Careful clinical judgment is required as high-velocity thrust proced ures may require modification or be inappropriate. Type III: Type I or II conditions are present but considered negligible compared with clinical evidence of another pathological problem requiring further patient assessment and referral to another health care professional. B. Severity of Complications: Minimal Level: Any complications of high-velocity thrust procedure s may be considered minimal, with slight objective evidence of worsened signs usually lastin g a maximum of several days. (Reactions such as short term pain and stiffness or, infrequently, a m ild chronic pain disorder alleged to arise from aggravation of a pre-existing problem). These reac tions are rarely reported in the literature/claim reviews, given the brief duration of mild symptoms experienced by patients and the superimposed natural history of the presenting complaint. High- velocity thrust procedures are not generally contraindicated. Chiropractic care modifications m ay have to be anticipated in exceptional cases. Moderate Level: Level of harm is generally moderate, characterized by more-or-less serious but usually reversible harm lasting weeks to months. Effects a re temporary and/or residual in nature (e.g., broke n rib, uncomplicated disc herniation, radiculopathy, foot drop). Depending on all factors (e.g., freque ncy of complications, benefits) high-velocity thrust pr ocedures may require modification or be inappropriate. High Level: Evidence suggests possible risk and the need for a high level of clinical caution. The complication or accident may be serious and/or perm anent, particularly in susceptible patients (e.g., stroke, cauda equina syndrome). High-velocity thru st procedures may require careful modification or be inappropriate, or be identifiably inappropriate, given patient history, diagnostic tests and/or oth er information obtained during a trial of therapy. C. Quality of Evidence: Evidence on the risk of complication arising from c hiropractic chiropractic care and particularly high-velocity thrust procedures comes from case rep orts, surveys, literature reviews, and insurance and legal claims records. There needs to be furthe r systematic study of the incidence, severity and management of complications. Present classificatio n of quality of evidence is: Class I: Evidence provided by surveys, systematic studies, l iterature reviews, and detailed clinical case reports published in refereed journals. Class II: Evidence provided by other case studies or reviews, or consensus expert opinion from legitimate consensus-building efforts.-350-Class III: Evidence provided by expert opinion and one or more case reports. D. Level of Contraindication: Having regard to all the individual assessment crit eria already discussed, the following overall ratings are used: No Identifiable Contraindication: No known clinical rational can be identified which would preclude the application of chiropracti c adjustments or require the adaptation or modification of adjusting techniques Special Circumstances : Situations in which clinical findings indicate th e need for additional examination procedures to determine the best course of care and/or in which high-velocity thrust procedures may be used but with appropriate care and/or modification. Special Circumstances to Identifiable Contraindicat ion: Careful clinical judgment dictates whether any identifiable contraindication is presen t or special care is needed with each specific patient. Identifiable Contraindication : Situations in which clinical indicators identify anatomical sites where certain adjusting procedures should be restri cted or modified. The diversity and sophistication of chiropractic ad justing techniques provides the doctor of chiropractic with an impressive array of approaches to patient care. This body of techniques means that no absolute contraindication exists to t he adjustment process. Example: As an example of the complete rating syst em: Non-complicated Low-Back Risk-of-Complication Rating: Severity (if harm did occur): Minimal Rating of Condition: Type I Quality of Evidence: Class I This rating system assumes no negligence or error o n the part of the practitioner. Tolerance to chiropractic care may sometimes, but not always, be estimated by provocative or pre- adjustment testing. RATING SYSTEM A. Types: 1. Strong positive recommendation. The chiropractor under most circumstances would employ the procedure. 2. Positive recommendation. The chiropractor under many circumstances would employ the procedure.-351-3. Discretionary.

The modified plan of care should be reassessed wh en the unusual finding is no longer observed. 17.1.2 Rating : Strong Positive Recommendation Evidence: E, L Note: General health problems which have been described in the literature as either contraindications to or complications of high-veloc ity thrust procedures include the following conditi ons. It should be understood that the listed conditions are not necessarily those for which high-velocity thrust procedures are intended. Rather they may be coincidentally present in a patient undergoing chiropractic care. The fundamental object of chiro practic care is a subluxation (joint Derangements: nonspecific arthropathies including acute ankylosing spondylitis characterized of acute inflammation, demineralization, ligamentous laxity with anatomic subluxation or dislocation, represent aspecial circumstances situation in which additional examination procedures (such a s videofleuroscopy or computerized x-ray digital anal ysis) may be necessary to determine the best course of care and/or modificati ons may be required to high- velocity thrust procedures in anatomical regions of involvement. 17.2.1 Risk-of-Complication Rating : Severity: Moderate to High Condition Rating: Type III Quality of Evidence: Class II, III-352-2.

Levels of severity and probability have been assigned on the basis that th e condition displays usual and classical signs and symptoms. The difficulty in precisely detailing th e degree or severity and probability of an individu al patient's overall physical and psychological respon se both to the condition and any specific manual procedure (subtleties of force, amplitude, directio n, patient positioning, etc.) is acknowledged. Nevertheless, ratings have been assigned based on t he literature and the current state of clinical experience. These provide a starting point which w ill require ongoing review and refinement. 2.

COMMENTS This chapter provides a general framework and inte rim guideline recommendations with respect to complications of and contraindications t o chiropractic thrust procedures. At present, detailed systematic studies on this subject are lac king and the recommendations made are based on information from clinical reviews and case reports, as well as from expert opinion and consensus methods. The recommendations made must be continuously re-ev aluated in light of ongoing research and clinical experience. Cooperative intradiscipli nary and interdisciplinary research will be necessa ry-356-to determine the true extent of the nature and occu rrence of iatrogenic complications in chiropractic practice. The development of a central registry sy stem capable of generating comprehensive research data would be valuable, and would facilitate the es tablishment of more detailed and refined guideline recommendations in the future. As well, the establis hment of bodies of data that would allow consumers, policy-makers and other professionals to compare the relative safety of the various approaches to patient care, such as the chiropracti c versus the standard medical management of a range of conditions, would be an invaluable asset i n the pursuit of optimal health care strategies on all levels.

Yochum TR, Rowe LJ: Essentials of skeletal radiology , Baltimore: Williams & Wilkins, 1987.359GLOSSARY Accuracy: The property of a measurement which determines ho w closely the result will approximate the true value. Active Care: Modes of treatment/care requiring \"active\" involv ement, participation, and responsibility on the par t of the patient. Active Rest: The resting of a tissue or body part only to the point of restriction of deforming and pathological forces during the healing period, while at the same time a llowing normal physiological stresses. Also called relative rest. Adjustment: A specific directional thrust maneuver or applicati on of forces applied to a subluxated vertebra that sets the vertebra into motion with the intent to re duce and/or correct the vertebral misalignment, thu s improving the neurological component of the vertebral subluxation complex along with vivification of the affected ti ssues and body functions. AHARA: As high as reasonably achievable. The current doct rine that recognizes the risk of ionizing radiation exposure, and therefore requires that all imaging y ield the maximum analytical benefit to justify the risk. ALARA : As low as reasonably attainable. The current do ctrine that recognizes that there is no safe level of exposure to ionizing radiation, and therefore requi res that all exposures are made at minimum levels. Amplitude: Amplitude refers to the depth of, or distance trave led by, the practitioner's thrust. Most adjustment is of low amplitude, minimizing total force applied to th e patient. When placing a joint in position prior to treatment/care the practitioner pre-stresses the joint in the appr opriate direction to take up soft-tissue slack (joi nt play). When joints are less accessible and/or involve a longer level contact, or when inadequate pre-stress is obt ained, amplitude will necessarily increase. Analysis: The act of separating into component parts the cl inical evaluation of a condition in order to identi fy the clinical impression or determine the chiropractic d iagnosis. Anthropometry : The study of proportional relationship between t he shape, weight and size of body segments. Applicability/clinical relevance: This term refers to the relevance of an outcome pro cedure, in other words, how it may impact upon case-management decisions. It answ ers the question: Is this outcome important to meas ure in clinical practice? Relevance also varies with healt h condition. Different types of patients require d ifferent types of outcome assessments. Scientific experimentation is important in determining this characteristic. Assessment: An examination performed with the intent of arriv ing at a qualitative or quantitative description of a patient's condition. The term suggests any evaluat ion procedure performed for the purpose of obtainin g information regarding the patient's state or condit ion. Assessment Outcomes: Assessment of the impact of a continuing educatio n or postgraduate program on a practitioner's knowledge, attributes, practice perf ormance and patient care. Baseline: The temporal course of a patient's condition prior to the initiation of care, determined by a series o f clinical evaluations performed during separate sess ions over a period of time. Blocking Technique: The use of a static device to position the spine or related structures in such a manner as to facilitate the correction of subluxation through me chanical leverage. Calibration: Periodic adjustment/maintenance of instrument com ponents to yield minimum variation of measurements in contrast to a \"Gold Standard\" over a specified range of measurement. Case Management: The process of evaluating patient needs or indicate d care so as to provide service at the360optimum level. All providers make case management decisions for each patient using a variety of varia bles and indicators. Chart Notes: General term indicating notes made on the patient 's work chart. Chiropractic: A science and form of health care practice which d eals with the relationship between the articulations of the skeleton and the nervous system, and the rol e of this relationship in the restoration and maint enance of health. Of primary concern to chiropractic are abn ormalities of structure or function of the vertebra l column known clinically as the vertebral subluxation complex. T he subluxation complex includes any alteration of t he biomechanical and physiological dynamics of contigu ous spinal structures which can cause neuronal disturbances. Chiropractic Adjustment: This term refers to a wide variety of manual and mechanical interventions that may be high or low velocity; short or long lever; high or low amplitude; with or without recoil. Procedures are usually directed at specific joints or anatomic regions. A n adjustment may or may not involve the cavitation or gapping of a joint (opening of a joint within its paraphysiologi c zone usually producing a characteristic audible \" click\" or \"pop\"). The common denominator for the various adjustive in terventions is the concept of removing structural d ysfunctions of joints and muscles that are associated with neur ologic alterations. The chiropractic profession re fers to this concept as a \"subluxation.\" This use of the word s ubluxation should not be confused with the term's p recise anatomic usage which considers only the anatomical r elationships. Chiropractic Analysis: A chiropractic analysis is performed on a routine b asis to determine the patient's need for spinal adjustments. A chiropractic analysis may in clude (but certainly is not limited to) two or more of the following procedures: instrumentation (skin temperature diffe rential analysis), chiropractic x-ray analysis, spi nal static and motion palpation, postural analysis, leg-length com parison tests, muscle strength measures, and other chiropractic analysis procedures. Chiropractic Assessment : The process of integrating the clinical analysis to determine the best mode to address and monitor the correction of vertebral subluxation and other malpositioned articulations and structur es. Specifically it is the integrating of history with physical, imaging and instrumentation examinations. Chiropractic Care: This term refers to the behaviors, methods, procedu res, etc., that chiropractic practitioners employ in the case-management of patients. Chiropractic Consultation: This process includes the initial interview. The initial consultation is done in an effort to determine if chiropractic care can benefit the p atient. Chiropractic Diagnosis : Such clinical processes as are necessary in the p rofessional judgment of the attending doctor to determine the need for care and, in parti cular, to detect the presence, location and nature of chiropractic lesions (subluxation and attendant biomechanical, b iochemical, structural and neurophysiological probl ems, etc.) and prepare and administer an appropriate course of care within the realm of chiropractic. Chiropractic Examination : Testing procedures ordered or performed by a doc tor of chiropractic to assess the condition of a patient leading to an analysis, impr ession or diagnosis. Chiropractic History : Patient information may include a family health history, previous and present social and occupational environment, and experiences, includin g any \"abnormal\" sensations, moods or acts observed by the patient or others, with the dates of their appearan ce and duration, as well as any results of non-chir opractic intervention or previous chiropractic care. Chiropractic Practice Objective: The primary professional practice objective of chir opractic is to reduce or correct vertebral subluxations and other malpositioned arti culations and structures in a safe and effective ma nner. Chronicity: Stages of progress of a disorder that are related both to severity and duration: acute, subacute, chronic, and recurrent.361Clinical Impression : A working hypothesis formulated from significant items in the history and the physical findings; a tentative diagnosis; or a working diagn osis. Clinical Necessity: The presence of a clinical condition requiring pr ofessional intervention to resolve, alleviate, stabilize or retard it. This term is preferable to \"medical necessity\" in chiropractic reportage, in t hat it does not imply a judgement that pertains to the practice of allopa thic medicine. Collaborative Care: The reciprocal interprofessional interaction of two or more health care providers in the management of the patient's current health status. Combination : The potentiation or competition of response by s imultaneous care applications. Complicated Case: A case where the patient, because of one or more identifiable factors, exhibits regression or retarded recovery in comparison with expectations f rom the natural history. Complication: The unexpected aggravation of an existing disorde r or the onset of an unexpected new disorder while under chiropractic care. Classification of Complications. a) Adverse Effect: Any detrimental result of an action. b) Reaction: A slight or benign adverse effect of short durati on usually lasting no more than a few days. c) Idiosyncractic Reaction: Resulting from an idiosyncracy, that is: a specia l characteristic(s) by which persons differ from each other. That which makes one react differently from others. A peculiar or individual re action to an idea, an action, a drug, a food, or some other substance through unusual susce ptibility. These reactions are not predictable. d) Indirect Complication: Delay of diagnosis and appropriate chiropractic c are as a consequence of using a procedure that, in retrospec t, has proven to be of no benefit for the condition. Computed tomography: A variation on traditional radiographic technology that provides for imaging in multiple planes. Condition Specific Assessments: Procedures designed to elicit information about th e specific signs and symptoms and other clinical characteristics of dise ases or conditions. Condition specific assessments are usually more limited in scope than general health a ssessments. These outcome procedures can run the g amut from physiological tests to questionnaires. Consent to Participate in Research: The subject has adequate information regarding the research and the power of free choice to participate in the research or de cline participation. Consent to Care: Permission from the patient or, where the patient is a minor or otherwise without legal capacity to consent, from the patient's guardian. Valid con sent must be voluntary. It may be oral or written i f expressly given, or may be implied. Consultation : Any combination of history taking, physical exam ination, and explanation and discussion of the clinical findings and prognosis. A consultation ca n also be the service provided by a practitioner wh ose opinion, or advice, regarding evaluation and/or management of a specific problem is requested by another practitio ner or other appropriate source. Continuing Education: Voluntary and/or mandatory ongoing instruction fo r facilitation of clinical performance.362Contract-Relax: Application of a combination of active and passive muscle tightening and stretching. Contraindication -- Absolute: Any circumstance which renders a form of care or clinical intervention inappropriate because it places the patient at undue risk. Contraindication -- Relative: Circumstance which may place the patient at undue r isk unless chiropractic care approach is modified. Contraindications : Historical and clinical findings and evaluation procedures which would lead the chiropractor to modify his/her usual clinical regime to ensure pati ent safety. Contrast studies: The injection or ingestion of radiopaque dyes to al low for the visualization of structures not normally seen on radiographic examination. Cost Effective: A result of managed expenditure in which a cost/v alue evaluation has been determined to be optimally efficient. Credentialing: A formal means by which the capabilities of the i ndividual practitioner to perform duties at an acceptable level are certified. Differential Diagnosis : The determination of which one of two or more co mplaints or conditions a patient is suffering from by systematically comparing and cont rasting their clinical findings. Discriminability : The property of information derived from a test or a measurement that allows the practitioner to discern between groups of subjects: for example, he althy from unhealthy. Dosage: The frequency of care including ancillary procedu res necessary and sufficient to maintain effects wh ile healing occurs. Duration : The time or interval needed to obtain a stable r esponse. Dynamic Thrust: The determined force or maneuver delivered by the p ractitioner during manual and most adjustment techniques. It is typically a high-velo city, low-amplitude movement applied to a joint whe n all joint play has been passively removed. It may be applied with follow through, which means that the end amplitude of the thrust is immediately withdrawn. There are low-vel ocity thrust techniques, but all thrusts involve so me element of rapid acceleration. Effectiveness: Effectiveness refers to the potential any given p rocedure or group of procedures has to produce a desired effect under actual conditions of use. Elective Care: Care requested by the patient in their desire to p romote optimum function to alleviate subjective symptomatology. Emergency: Onset of a condition manifesting itself by acute s ymptoms of sufficient severity that the absence of immediate attention could reasonably result in: 1. permanently placing the patient's health in jeopa rdy; 2. causing other serious health consequences; 3. causing serious impairment to bodily functions; o r 4. causing serious and permanent dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. Evaluation: Synonymous with assessment. Examination : Those varied procedures performed by the practit ioner necessary to determine a working diagnosis. False-Negative Rate (FNR): The likelihood of a negative test in a patient wit h a disorder. False-Negative rate = number of patients with a di sorder with negative test number of patients with a disorder363False-Negative Result: A negative result in a patient with a disorder. False-Positive Rate (FPR): The likelihood of a positive test in a patient with out a disorder. False-Positive rate = number of patients without a disorder with positive test number of patients without disorder False-Positive Result: A positive result in a person who does not have t he disorder. FFD/SID : Focal film distance/source image distance. The FFD/SID setting governs the distance that the sourc e of radiation is placed from the patient and the image recording device. Proper placement enhances image quality. Filtration: The placement of devices (usually aluminum) betwe en the source of radiation and the patient to eliminate radiation exposure to a particular area. Flexibility and Stability : The long term goal of care is to restore the pat ient to pre-injury function and reduce the chances of recurrent episodes. Repetitive microtra uma superimposed on previous injury can lead to adv anced degeneration. Spinal stabilization is designed to teach trunk muscle recruitment as an effort to cont rol and reduce flexion and torsional stresses on the joint segment s. Through the use of voluntary muscles, pain-free regional postures can be maintained while the patient carrie s out normal daily activities. The necessary postu re and combination of muscle actions determined experiment ally are specific for each case. Once the comforti ng position is found, the patient is assisted while re hearsing progressively more complex tasks, keeping the body part in its neutral, pain-free position. Follow-up Reassessment : Evaluation of a patient during or at the end of a course of care or management program for the purpose of assessing the status of the patient at maximal clinical improvement. Force: The product of the amplitude and velocity applied d uring a thrust. An adjustment or manual procedure may be very fast (high velocity) but of extremely low-a mplitude, and in these circumstances the force will be relatively low. Gatekeeper: Health care professional designated to exercise res ponsibility for, and control of, the utilization of health care services. General Health Assessments: These are usually questionnaires completed by patie nts and scored for a number of attributes deemed important to the overall conce pt of health. Gold Standard Test : An accepted reference test or procedure used to define the true state of the patient's health. Gold Standard : A known value or attribute used to test veracity of instrumented measures to define the true state of the patient. Grids: Devices placed between the patient and the image recording device to reduce the amount of non-informative secondary radiation reaching the im age recording device. The use of grids improves ima ge quality. Health Record: Documents and recorded information relating to the clinical management of a patient. Health: This is a state of optimal physical, mental and soc ial well-being, not merely the absence of disease o r infirmity. High Velocity Thrust with Recoil: A measured depth thrust delivered in such a way tha t at the time of contact with the vertebra the Chiropractor's thrusting motion re coils setting the segment being contacted in motion directionally. High Velocity Thrust without Recoil: A measured depth thrust delivered quickly with a su stained contact with the segment being adjusted directionally.364History: The patient's account of health information includi ng past and present clinical problem(s) given in response to questions from the practitioner, staff and or written forms. Homeostasis: This is the tendency to maintain, or the maintenanc e of, normal, internal stability in an organism by coordinated responses of the organ systems that aut omatically compensate for changes in the organism. Iatrogenesis: Disorders or complications caused by health care providers. Image recording device : Usually photographic film, but newer technologie s provide for the image to be recorded on video tape or directly digitized into computer m emory. Imaging analysis : Those procedures utilized to qualify and quantif y components of the vertebral subluxation and other malpositioned articulations and structures th at are visualized by an imaging modality. Imaging Modalities : Those technologies used to obtain a visual recor d of internal anatomical structure. Indications : Clinical findings which may indicate the presenc e of vertebral subluxation and other malpositioned articulations and structures. Initial intensive care: Initial care and/or ancillary intervention to assis t and promote anatomical rest, reduce muscle spasm and inflammatory reaction, and allevia te pain. Initial Intensive Care#2: is that care which is instituted to stabilize the c ondition. This care is clinically necessary. Initial Patient Evaluation: Represents the assessment procedures that are perfo rmed on a patient upon initial contact, and are used to arrive at a clinical impre ssion and a plan for patient management. (Also: pr eliminary assessment, preliminary evaluation, clinical workup .) Initial evaluation may include a series of diag nostic or evaluative sessions separated by days or weeks when the express purpose of these sessions is to evalua te the patient's state prior to the initiation of care (i. e., obtain a baseline). Instability: 1. Quality or condition of being unstable; not firm, fixed or constant. 2. In reference to ligamentous and articular structures, joint hypermobility due to co nnective tissue derangement. 3. In reference to the spine, joint hypermobility due to connective tissue derangement of such a degree that the spinal cord and/or nerve roots are endangered. Instrument: A specific tool or measuring device. Instrumentation : The use of any mechanical tool or device used to ascertain objective data, which can be recorded in a reproducible manner. In chiropractic, instrumentation provides information above the con dition of the patient relative to the vertebral subluxtion. Interactive Reassessment: Evaluation of a patient by procedures utilized on e ach visit to assess the immediate need for manual intervention. Intervention/Care Goals: Written short term and long range expectations of p atient response to the care plan. Intervention/Care Plan: A written description of intended clinical action s divided according to relevant care goals and prognosis. Ionizing radiation: A portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that ca n alter the electron component of atomic structure. Ischemic Compression: Application of a progressively increasing pressure on a pressure point, trigger point, or tight muscle. This typically reduces the point's t enderness and produces a flushing and a relaxation of tightness.365Joint Play (Accessory Movement): The small, precise joint movements, not under the c ontrol of the voluntary muscles or patient, that are necessary to permit no rmal voluntary joint movement. Joint play may incl ude spin, glide and roll of articulation. The full range of active movement of a joint without practitioner ass istance is a combination of voluntary movement (voluntary muscle s) and joint play. KVP: Kilovoltage potential. The KVP setting governs the quality of the x-ray beam produced. Levels of Care: Differentiations between indicated courses of care based on the nature of the presenting complaint, clinical findings and the attending doct or=s objectives. LEVEL I Care is characterized by a patient-specific program of care the goal of which is to begin the reduction of clinical indicators of subluxation . Level I care is sometimes referred to as acute , relief, urgent or intensive care. LEVEL II Care is characterized by a program of chir opractic intervention that has as its objective the reduction of subluxation indicators to a minima l or non-present level. This level of care is sometimes referred to as intermediate care and can include rehabilitative care. LEVEL III is characterized by episodic care of chro nic condition which helps to prevent the condition from further deterioration. The level of care is referre d to as supportive care. LEVEL IV Care consists of on-going adjustive care, which may extend to the lifetime of the patient, the objective of which is the sustaining o f the optimal state of the patient. This level of care is sometimes referred to as prevention or well ness. Determinations as to the appropriateness of any of these levels of care are based on objective indicat ions of the presence of subluxation and the clinical status of the patient. Duration of care should be determined b y the practitioner based on the individual needs of the p atient. Life Style Modification: Adaptations of life style necessary to modify socia l and recreational activity, diminish work environment risk factors, and adapt to psychologica l elements affecting, or altered by, the disorder. Likelihood Ratio: A measure of discrimination by a test result. A test result with a likelihood ration of greater tha n 1.0 raises the probability of a disorder and is oft en referred to as a \"positive\" test result. A test result with a likelihood ratio of less than 1.0 lowers the probab ility of a disorder and is often called a \"negative \" test result. Likelihood ratio = probability of result in person with disorder probability of result in person without disorder LIKELIHOOD RATIO FOR A POSITIVE TEST RESULT: Likelihood ratio (+)= sensitivity 1 - specificity LIKELIHOOD RATIO FOR A NEGATIVE TEST RESULT: Likelihood ratio (-)= 1-sensitivity specificity Line of Drive (Vector): The direction of thrust, usually described in ter ms of the three cardinal planes of skeletal motion: 1. Flexion/Extension, 2. Right/Left Rotati on, 3. Right/Left Lateral Flexion. Long-lever Contacts in which joints and structures are positi oned between the practitioner's contact point and the adjusted joint. For example, an adju stment of the right sacroiliac (SI) joint with a co ntact on the ischium is considered short-lever because there are no articulations between the contact point and the SI joint. However, an adjustment of the L5/SI facet using the same contact is long-lever because the SI joint is located between the contact and the L5/SI facet joint.366Low Velocity Thrust with Recoil: A controlled depth thrust delivered at low speed with a sudden pull-off by the chiropractor setting the segment in motion. Low Velocity Controlled Vectored Force without Reco il: A sustained contact, with force building until re sistance of the misalignment factors of subluxation are over come. Low Velocity Thrust without Recoil: A controlled depth thrust delivered at low speed using a sustained contact with the segment being adjusted. Magnetic resonance imaging: Imaging modality that uses magnetic fields and ra dio frequencies to produce an image of both hard and soft tissue structures. Management: A plan of action for chiropractic care of the pat ient in accordance with diagnosis, progress, and expectations of outcome. Manipulation: A manual procedure that involves a directed thrust to move a joint past the physiological range of motion, without exceeding the anatomical limit. Manipulations and Mobilization: During joint motion, three barriers or end ranges to movement can be identified. The first is the active end range which occurs when the patient has maximally contracted muscles contr olling a joint in a particular directional vector. At this point, the clinician can passively move the joint t oward a second barrier called the passive end range. Movement up to this barrier is termed physiologic joint space. Beyond this point, the practitioner can move the joint into its paraphysiologic space. The third barrier encounte red is the anatomic end range. Movement beyond this will resu lt in rupture of the joint's ligaments. Manual Procedures: Adjustive or manipulative procedures, and other ma nual techniques. Manual Therapy: Procedures by which the hands directly contact the body to treat the articulations and/or soft tissues. Manually Assisted Mechanical Thrusts: Specific directional thrusts delivered by a mecha nical device but manually set up and positioned. MAS: Milliampere (seconds). The MAS setting governs t he quantity of the x-ray beam produced. Maximum Clinical Benefit (Maximum Chiropractic Impr ovement): Return to pre-injury/illness status or point at which a patient=s progress plateaus. Mechanically Assisted Manual Thrust: Thrusts which are manually delivered but enhanced by moving mechanism built into the adjusting equipment, such as a drop table. Meta-analysis: This refers to a type of study that statistically pools the data from many relevant single studies i n order to make summary conclusions about a topic. MHCO (Managed Health Care Organization): An organized system for providing health care in a geographic area, accepting the responsibility to provide or otherwis e assure the delivery of set of services as deemed necessary by the organization. Mobilization: Movement applied singularly or repetitively within or at the physiological range of joint motion, without imparting a thrust or impulse, with the goa l of restoring joint mobility. Motion Segment: The smallest functional unit, made up of two adja cent articulating surfaces and contiguous and intervening soft tissues.367Motivation : Conscious or subliminal factors of attitude and belief which contribute to the rationale for a pers on to choose between self-reliance (coping), patient and claimant behaviors in contending with health relate d predicaments. Multiple Provider Facility: A facility in which two or more health care provi ders practice either in association or separately. Natural History: The anticipated clinical course of recovery for unc omplicated disorders without care. Negative Test Result: A test result that occurs more frequently in pati ents who do not have a disorder than in patients who do have the disorder. Negligence: Breach of the duty of care placed on all practiti oners to exercise reasonable care and skill in the circumstances. Neurologic Examination: Most commonly refers to evaluating deep tendon refl exes, sensation and muscle strength. Neurological Reflex Techniques: Techniques that attempt to stimulate propriocepti ve and other sensory nerve endings by application of light touch or sustained pressure on various soft tissue structures. OFD/PFD: Object film distance/part film distance. The OFD /PFD setting governs the distance that the anatomic part of interest is placed from the image recording device. Proper placement enhances image quality. Outcomes Assessment : This term refers to a procedure or method of obj ectively measuring a change in patient status over time, primarily to evaluate the effecti veness of fulfilling the objectives of the chiropra ctor's care. Passive Care : Application of clinical procedures by the care g iver to the patient who \"passively\" submits to and receives care. Passive Stretch (Spray and Stretch) : Application of a lengthening force along a muscl e by passive movement of the associated joint(s). Sometimes used with a dis tractor such as a coolant spray or ice prior to app lying the stretch. Patient Education : Sharing information with the patient individually or in a group concerning their continued or pending care in your office. The intent is to brin g the patient to a basic understanding of chiroprac tic care and how it relates to their particular condition. Educatin g the patient allows them to know what to expect wi th care and conversely what to expect if they choose not to sta rt/continue or discontinue care. Patient education allows the patient to make a decision in regards to their heal th based on facts and not misunderstanding. Patient Satisfaction: Degree of confidence and gratification accompanyi ng the delivery of health care services. Patient satisfaction relates to perceptions on the part of the patient that his/her wishes are being c arried out, that care is being delivered, and that patient sensitivi ties are being respected. These perceptions are ba sed on subjective patient feelings, and may or may not dea l with issues of technical appropriateness of care or outcomes. Peer Review : Evaluation by peers or colleagues of the quality , quantity, and efficiency of services ordered or performed by a practitioner. Periodic Reassessment: Evaluation of a patient at intervals of weeks or months for the purpose of assessing the need for continued care, modified care, cessation o f care or referral. Physician Dependence : Patient behavior which transfers responsibility for health status to the care-giver. Plain film radiography: That branch of radiography that produces a single 2D image of internal anatomic structure. It is the most common type of imaging m odality utilized. POMR: Problem Oriented Medical Records.368Positive Test Result: A test result that occurs more frequently in patie nts with a disorder than in patients without the disorder. Practicality : This refers to the feasibility issues related to an outcome procedure, in clinical practice. Pre-Stress: The process in which, prior to intervention, a jo int is moved passively to its end range, controllin g joint play. The joint is near the limit of its passive e nd range. Precision : The ability to obtain the same measurement of a function or structure repeatedly within a set margi n of error across the possible range of test application s. Predictive Value Negative: Probability of a disorder being absent if a test is negative. Pretest Probability: The probability of disorder before a test is done (also prior probability or pretest risk). Prevalence: The total number of cases of a disorder in existen ce at a certain time in a designated area. Preventive/Maintenance Care: Any management plan that seeks to prevent disease , prolong life, promote health and enhance the quality of life. A specific regime n is designed to provide for the patient's well-bei ng for maintaining the optimum state of health. Primary Health Care Profession: Primary providers which by law, expertise and pro fessional ethics, may accept patients without referral. Primary Care Provider: Any health care provider capable of providing first level contact and intake into the health delivery system, any health care provider licensed to receive patient contact in the absence of physic ian referral. Probability: An expression of opinion, on a scale of 0 to 1.0, about the likelihood that an event will occur. Processing: The technique of developing an image recorded on photographic film. Profession Classification: Professions are classified according to level of training, authority to accept patients with or without referral, and responsibility and au thority to care for the patient with regard to the domains of anatomy, conditions addressed and scope of practice . Professional Referral: Professional referral requires authority and comp etence to acquire accurate information concerning matters within the scope and practice of the profession for which a referral is made. Ther e are two types of professional referrals made by chiropracto rs: (A) Intraprofessional Referral: Chiropractors, by v irtue of their professional objective, education an d experience, have authority and competence to make d irect referral within the scope and practice of Chiropractic. Such a referral may be made when the attending chiropractor is not able to address the specific chiropractic needs of a partic ular patient. Under these circumstances, the chiropractor may refer the patient directly to or c onsult with another chiropractor better suited by skill, experience or training to address the patien t's chiropractic needs. (B) Interprofessional Referral: In the delivery of chiropractic care a practitioner may encounter conditions or findings that deviate from those norm ally encountered. The chiropractor has a responsibility to recognize such findings, report t heir existence to the patient and record their existence. Progress: Any change in the patient's condition. It does n ot necessarily mean improvement, or symptomatic relief.369Progress Notes: Generally brief notations recorded in the patient 's file for each office visit once management has commenced. Provocative Testing : Those tests or procedures that are performed to elicit physical or physiological expressions of a given disorder. Quality of Care: The degree to which effective, timely care is pro vided in an appropriate manner. Radiation/radioisotopic therapy: A medical treatment/care wherein the patient rece ives high dosages of ionizing radiation either by exposure (radiation therapy) or by ingestion (radioisotopic therapy). Radioisotopic scanning (nuclear medicine) : The injection or ingestion of radioactive organ specific chemicals to provide visualization of the functional aspects of that organ. Radiology/radiography/radiographic image: An imaging modality that employs x-radiation to p roduce a visual record of internal anatomic structures. Reactivity : A test interaction effect causing an unintention al change in a patient's response when exposed to t he repeated application of a test. Reassessment: Evaluation for the purpose of following the progr ess of a patient under clinical management. The term does not include multiple assessment sessions employed for baseline evaluation and carries the ex press connotation of assessment performed after the initi ation of patient care. Reconstructive: is that care that is provided to rehabilitate the c ondition to its maximum potential correction. (After meeting) Referral: The direction of a patient to another health care professional or institution for evaluation, consul tation or care. Referral may be made or received for purposes of consultation, concurrent care, post-chiropractic care, the administration of diagnostic procedures, the evalua tion of diagnostic findings, emergency care or beca use a clear determination has been made on the part of the prac titioner that a patient condition is outside his/he r scope of professional experience. Reliability: The ability of a clinical test or instrument to pro duce the same or similar result when examining a stable function or structure on several different o ccasions. This ability can be discussed in terms o f a single examiner (intraexaminer or intratester reliability) or in terms of more than one examiner using the sa me procedure (interexaminer or intertester reliability). Responsiveness: This term refers to the ability of an outcome ass essment to detect clinically important changes over time. Sometimes this is referred to as the se nsitivity of an outcome assessment to care. Respon siveness is a particularly important attribute of an outcome as sessment because subtle beneficial clinical effects of care should be able to be detected. Scientific experime ntation, especially randomized controlled clinical trials, provide the best evidence for the responsiveness of an outc ome assessment. Risk Factor: A behavior, environmental agent, inherited trait, o r any other factor which increases the probability of the development of a particular health problem. Risk Management: A systematic preventative strategy to minimize pa tient harm and practitioner liability through education and the development of guidelines for pra ctice. Rule of Confidentiality : A rule which requires that all information about a patient that is gathered by a practitioner as part of the provider/patient relationship be kep t confidential unless its release is authorized by the patient or, in exceptional circumstances, serves some other overri ding purpose. Safety: The degree of health risk clinical procedure may p resent; especially to patients, but also to doctors and their staff.370Screening: The application of a test to detect a potential ill ness or condition in a person who has no known sign s or symptoms of that illness or condition. Screenin g is performed on \"at risk\" populations in order to determine appropriate intervention(s). Sensitivity: In clinical testing, the ability to detect the pres ence of (that is, to not Amiss@) a relevant conditi on. Mathematically, this is expressed as the number of true positive test results divided by the sum of t rue positive plus false negative test results. Series: The number of images usually required to obtain a complete analysis of the area of interest. Shared Resources: Centralizing facilities and/or equipment and/or p ersonnel in a manner that diminishes duplication. Shielding: The placement of devices (usually lead) between the source of radiation and the patient to eliminate radiation exposure to a particular area. Short-lever Contacts: Those which involve contacts and stabilization on osseous structures directly involved in the joint being adjusted. SOAP: Acronym for Subjective symptoms, Objective signs, Assessment and Plan. Somatization: 1. Conversion of mental experiences into physical se nsations or symptoms. 2. Somatic symptoms without identifiable pathophysi ology or in excess of identified pathophysiology. The diagnosis is by exclusion of pathophysiology or the identification of psychological amplifiers or driv ers. Symptoms associated with subluxation in general and the ver tebral subluxation complex in particular often are erroneously relegated to this category. SORE: Acronym for Subjective, Objective, Rx (treatment/ care) and Exercise (ergonomics). Specialist: A health care provider who has obtained a professio nally accepted or recognized level of additional training and competence with respect to specific pr ocedures or disorders. Specificity: In clinical testing, the ability to detect the abse nce of a relevant condition. Mathematically, this is expressed as the number of true negatives divided b y the sum of the true negatives and false positives . Spinal Analysis: The comprehensive process of evaluating the spina l column and its immediate articulations for vertebral subluxations and contraindications to any or all chiropractic procedures. Spinograph : A general term for a spinal image produced by an imaging modality. Stress study : Any image taken when the anatomic part of intere st is in anything other than a neutral position. Subluxation: A complex of functional and/or structural and/or pa thological articular changes that compromise neutral integrity and may influence organ system fu nction and general health. A subluxation is evalua ted, diagnosed, and managed through the use of chiroprac tic procedures based on the best available rational and empirical evidence. Subluxation Complex: See subluxation. Subluxation Syndrome : See subluxation. Substantive: Pertaining to decisions based on mainly objective or \"hard\" information (such as x-ray, MRI, precise ROM, SEMG, motion studies, thermography, etc.). Supportive Care: Care for patients who have reached maximum clinical benefit, but who fail to sustain this benefit and progressively deteriorate when there are period ic trials of withdrawal of care. Supportive care f ollows appropriate application of active and passive care including rehabilitation and life style modificatio ns. It is371appropriate when alternative care options, includin g home-based self-care, have been considered and at tempted. Supported care may be inappropriate when it interf eres with other appropriate primary care, or when t he risk of supportive care outweighs its benefits, i.e., inter vention dependence, somatization, illness behavior, or secondary gain. Sustained Force: Holding a contact with a vertebral segment withou t a thrust. Terms of Acceptance: The acknowledgment between a health care provider and a patient which defines for the patient the objectives, responsibilities and limita tions of professional care and the terms within whi ch such care will be provided. The patient's acknowledgment of the terms allows the provider the ability to accept the patient for care and the patient the ability to make an informed choice to accept the care. Threshold : The minimum rate and magnitude of joint load nee ded to bring about a change. True-Negative Rate: See specificity. True Positive Rate: See sensitivity. True-Negative Result: A negative test result in a patient who does not ha ve a disease. Ultrasonography : An imaging modality that uses sound waves to pro duce images of internal anatomic structure. It is especially well suited to soft tissue fluid b ody imaging. Uncomplicated Case : A case where the patient exhibits progressive re covery from an illness or injury at a rate greater than, or equal to, the expectation from the natural history. Underutilization: The provision of less than an appropriate or adeq uate amount of care in a given case. Utility: Significant benefit to both the patient and clini cian resulting from a reduction in uncertainty pert aining to the case. Validity: The property of information derived from a test or a measurement that assures that it represents the function or structure that is intended. Velocity : The speed with which a thrust is delivered. Vertebral Subluxation Complex (VSC): See subluxation Videofluoroscopy : A radiographic technique that produces a motion picture image. It is usually recorded on video tape. Vitalism : The doctrine that the life in living organisms i s caused and sustained by a vital principle that is distinct from all physical and chemical forces and that life is, in part, self-determining and self-evolving. Work Chart: The form that the practitioner and/or staff uses to record a patient's data.371APPENDIX The following listing of abbreviations are some of the ones that are commonly used for chart notations .
