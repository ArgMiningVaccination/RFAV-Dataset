Published by NHS England, in electronic format only Summary The updated commissioning criteria for the use of therapeutic immunoglobulin (Ig) 2021 describes all conditions for which Ig is commissioned and provides the detail around the role, dose and place of Ig in the treatment pathway for individual indications alongside possible alternative treatment options for use of Ig in both adults and children. It has been built on a previous review of the literature updated with a further evidence review, expert opinion and multi -organisational input. The criteria have been developed by the Ig expert working group following wide consultation with specialty experts, relevant scientific societies and the respective Clinical Reference Groups (CRGs) for haematology, immunology, The CRG will review the document as per NHS England and NHS I mprovement policy review process or when there is a significant change in evidence. Recommendations on Ig dose and outcomes are based on a combination of available evidence and expert opinion. The colour coding scheme, which had been previously devised for demand management but was often utilised as a commissioning tool , has now been replaced by categorisation of Ig use; to routinely commissioned or not commissioned routinely (NRC) categories . This is now based on the strength of clinical evidence. Commissioning criteria These commissioning criteria are for all indications previously categorised as r ed (conditions for which Ig treatment is considered the highest priority because of a risk to life without treatment) and b lue (conditions for which there is a reasonable evidence base for the use of Ig but other treatment options are available) and those grey indications (immune- mediated disorders with limited or little/no evidence) that have moved into routine commissioning. This guideline supersedes previous clinical guidelines and NHS England and NHS Improvement g uidance with the exception of those indications within the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) 2011 clinical guidelines for immunoglobulin use1, which have not moved into routine commissioning. A completed referral form is still required for use of Ig in all indications. If the \"Prior panel approval required\" column states \"No\" - treatment can proceed without panel approval but a completed application form should be submitted and retrospectively r eviewed 2 by the Panel. If the column states \"Yes\", treatment should not proceed without prior panel approval ; if this is not possible , for example in an urgent case, retrospective approval must be sought . For urgent approvals in hours - a process will need to be in place on the agreed pathway for approval. For those cases that require out of hour s approval , panels will have local processes in place, to ensur e robust governance for retrospective panel approv al. Where local expertise is not available, panels will also be able to advise on dose optimisation and trials of treatment withdrawal. All referrals should be carried out via the Medicine Database Solutions and Services ( MDSAS) National Immunoglobulin D atabase e-referral platform. MDSAS data will be reviewed and findings reported to the Ig clinical expert working group and CRG with any recommendations on changes in policy will be updated in line with recommendations. MDSAS data will be analysed for ethnic groups to ensure any possible inequality in access is identified. Indications or clinical scenarios not listed in \"Commissioning Criteria Policy for the use of therapeutic immunoglobulin (Ig) England, 2021\" are not routinely commissioned and will still require an Individual Funding Request (IFR) application subject to support by the Sub Regional Immunoglobulin Assessment Panels (SRIAP s), to be submitted to the national IFR Panel . If the IFR is approved, the diagnosis and locally agreed efficacy criteria are recorded o n the immunoglobulin database. In keeping with the advice included in previous iterations of these guidelines and to ensure cost -effective use and minimise dose- dependent adverse effects, Ig prescribing will be based on dose- determining weight (DDW) , derived from ideal body weight (IBW)2,3 using the following formula (available at : https://ivig.transfusionontario.org/dose). In a small minority of patients where this approach may be sub- optimal, higher doses of Ig may be required. Vial Dosing Total treatment course should be calculated and then rounded down to the nearest dose which can be administered using whole vials. Note in an adult patient part vials should never be used. Where the dose is split over multiple days, daily dose may differ. For example: Male patient; Height 170cm; Weight 84kg Diagnosed with Guillain -Barre syndrome and meets criteria for IVIg, plan to receive 2g/kg based on DDW to be given over 5 days as per guidelines. IBW = 50 + (0.91 x [Height(cm) - 152.4]) = 50 + (0.91 x[170- 152.4]) = 66kg. 3 = IBW + (0.4 x [ABW(kg) - IBW (kg)]) = 66 + (0.4 x [84- 66]) = 73.2kg Total dose = 2 x 73.2kg = 146.4g rounded down to nearest 5g (vial size) vial = 145g. To be split over 5 days suggested dosing: Day 1: 30g Day 2: 30g Day 3: 30g Day 4: 30g Day 5: 25g Ig and the use of IBW for dosing in paediatric patients In all paediatric patients Ig dosing should be based on IBW. Actual body weight (ABW) should not be used. In patients whose A BW is < IBW, IBW should still be used to ensure appropriate dosing and preventing underdosing. The recommended methods suggested by the RCPCH and NPPG to calculate IBW, include the use of the table at the back of the BNFc4or methods suggested in the UKMI document5. In the future, the RCPCH and NPPG aim to work on a standardised approach in conjunction with the BNFc. Where possible doses should be rounded down to the nearest vial size to prevent wastage. 4 Commissioning Criteria Policy Immunoglobulin - Final 2021 Use of Immunoglobulin in I mmunology: Immunoglobulin is routinely commissioned in the following indications, under the circumstances described: Indications Selection criteria Exclusion criteria: Position of immunoglobulin, taking into account alternative therapies: Recommended dose Outcome measures to be recorded on the national database: Prior panel approval required HSCT in primary immunodeficiencies - long term use PID patients undergoing HSCT No Ig is the only definitive treatment for antibody deficiency Initiate at 0.4 -0.6 g/kg/month; dosing requirements may increase and should be based on clinical outcome. Because of the possibility of B -cell reconstitution, evaluation of immune function (off Ig) is required at 2 years Trough Ig G No Primary immunodeficiencies associated with significant antibody defects (excluding specific antibody deficiency) - long term use A specific PID diagnosis must be established by a clinical immunologist In newly diagnosed patients with PID with no significant burden of infection, the decision to start Ig replacement should be based on a MDT discussion No Ig is the only definitive treatment for antibody deficiency Initiate at 0.4 -0.6 g/kg/month; dose requirements may increase and should be based on clinical outcome Trough IgG Reduction in number of infections Treatment courses of antibiotics Days in hospital No 5 Commissioning Criteria Policy Immunoglobulin - Final 2021 Indication Eligibility criteria: Exclusion criteria: Position of immunoglobulin, taking into account alternative therapies: Recommended dose: Outcome measures to be recorded on the national database: Prior panel approval required Specific antibody deficiency - long term use Diagnosis by a clinical immunologist Severe, persistent, opportunistic or recurrent bacterial infections despite continuous oral antibiotic therapy for 6 months Documented failure of serum antibody response to unconjugated pneumococcal or other polysaccharide vaccine challenge No, but see comments in column of position of immunoglobulin Many patients with specific antibody deficiency will achieve protection from bacterial infections with prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis. Ig is reserved for those patients in whom antibiotic prophylaxis proves to be ineffective Initiate trial at 0. 4- 0.6 g/kg/month for a period of 6 to 12 months; Long- term maintenance treatment should be based on clear evidence of benefit from this trial and require panel approval. Dose requirements may increase and should be based on clinical outcome Trough IgG Reduction in number of infections Treatment courses of antibiotics Days in hospital Database parameters will include entry of number of infections and days in hospital pre-treatment and 6 monthly thereafter . Yes Secondary antibody deficiency - long term use Underlying cause of hypogammaglobinaemia cannot be reversed or reversal is contraindicated. OR: Hypogammaglobinaemia associated with drugs, therapeutic monoclonals targeted at B cells and plasma cells (rituximab and other anti -CD20, CD19 agents , daratumumab etc) HSCT*, NHL, CLL, or other relevant B -cell malignancy confirmed by haematologist AND Recurrent or severe bacterial infection despite continuous oral antibiotic therapy for 6 months IgG <4 g/L (excluding paraprotein) Documented failure of serum antibody response to unconjugated pneumococcal or other polysaccharide vaccine challenge It is recognised that vaccine challenge may be of limited value in patients with very low serum IgG (< 3g/L). In these circumstances vaccine challenge may No, but see comments in column of position of immunoglobulin Many patients with secondary antibody deficiency will achieve protection from bacterial infections with prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis. Ig is reserved for those patients in whom antibiotic prophylaxis proves to be ineffective Since infection susceptibility in patients with haematological malignancies is frequently multifactorial, the reduction in overall burden of infections with long term Ig replacement may be variable. For this reason, annual reviews of treatment are recommended. In pati ents with seasonal preponderance of infections, it may be appropriate to consider 0.4 - 0.6 g/kg/month modified to achieve an IgG trough level of at least the lower limit of the age- specific serum IgG reference range Trough IgG Reduction in number of infections Days in hospital Database parameters will include entry of number of infections and days in hospital pre-treatment and 6 monthly thereafter . Treatment courses of antibiotics Yes 6 Commissioning Criteria Policy Immunoglobulin - Final 2021 Indication Eligibility criteria: Exclusion criteria: Position of immunoglobulin, taking into account alternative therapies: Recommended dose: Outcome measures to be recorded on the national database: Prior panel approval required be omitted if it is considered inappropriate clinically It is acknowledged that not all of the above criter ia will need to be fulfilled for an individual patient In patients developing hypogammaglobinaemia associated with B -cell aplasia as a consequence of Chimeric Antigen Receptor - T cell therapy (CAR- T cells) targeted against B cell antigens, the prophylactic use of Ig in the absence of a burden of severe infections and vaccine challenge may be appropriate Use of Ig post- CAR -T therapy in B -cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B -ALL) Because of the severity of B -cell aplasia and the longer time required for reconstitution, it is anticipated that virtually all patients (children and adults) with B -ALL will initially require Ig replacement following CAR- T cell therapy. As with the use of Ig post -CAR- T therapy in B -cell lymphoma, continued use of IV Ig should be reviewed at regular intervals based on B -cell recovery, serum immunoglobulins and burden of infection Use of Ig post- CAR -T cell therapy in B - cell lymphoma The need for immunoglobulin replacement in patients receiving CAR- T cell therapy for B -cell lymphoma is variable ranging between 31% to 64% in published studies6 highlighting faster B - cell recovery in this group in contrast to patients with B -cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia temporary cessation of Ig in the summer 7 Commissioning Criteria Policy Immunoglobulin - Final 2021 Indication Eligibility criteria: Exclusion criteria: Position of immunoglobulin, taking into account alternative therapies: Recommended dose: Outcome measures to be recorded on the national database: Prior panel approval required Thymoma with immunodeficiency - long term use Profound B cell depletion AND/OR significant antibody deficiency No Ig is the only definitive treatment for antibody deficiency Initiate at 0.4 -0.6 g/kg/month; dose requirements may increase and should be based on clinical outcome Trough IgG Reduction in number of infections Treatment courses of antibiotics Days in hospital. No * There is variable practice regarding Ig replacement in adult patients with hypogammaglobinaemia post- HSCT for haematological malignancy. The American Society for Blood and Marrow transplantation and the Canadian Blood and Marrow Transplant group have recently stated, \"D on't routinely give Ig replacement to adult HSCT recipients in the absence of recurrent infections regardless of the IgG level \"7. It is possible that patients with recurrent sino- pulmonary infections on a background of chronic pulmonary GVHD and hypogammaglobi naemia may benefit if they fulfil the criteria for secondary antibody deficiency. 8 Commissioning Criteria Policy Immunoglobulin - Final 2021 Use of Immunoglobulin in Haematology: Immunoglobulin is routinely commissioned in the following indications, under the circumstances described: Indication Eligibility criteria: Exclusion criteria: Position of immunoglobulin, taking into account alternative therapies: Recommended dose: Outcome measures to be recorded on the national database: Prior panel approval required Acquired red cell aplasia associated with chronic parvovirus infection confirmed by PCR, AND Evidence of high viral load, usually above 109 IU/ml In cases of foetal hydrops: Likely to be associated with parvovirus B19 Infection other than parvovirus B19 Immunoglobulin is an adjunct to transfusion. Chronic parvovirus infection generally occurs on a background of immunosuppressive therapy, primary or HIV-related immunodeficiency and may resolve with a reduc tion in immunosuppression. Acute parvovirus infection associated with transient aplastic crisis requires urgent transfusion rather than Immunoglobulin 1.0 g/kg - 1.2g/ kg in divided doses. This may be repeated on relapse and for a 2nd relapse Rise in haemo globin or haemorrhage: Clinical suspicion of FMAIT in the antenatal setting based on clinical and laboratory features: Unexplained previous foetal death, haemorrhage, hydrocephalus or thrombocytopenia or known affected sibling, AND The presence of maternal platelet - specific alloantibodies directed against current paternal antigens (most commonly HPA -1a or HPA -5b). No Maternal: Immunoglobulin is the primary treatment and sometimes combined with steroids Neonatal: First line treatment is with HPA - 1a/5b - negative platelets which covers 95% of HPA incompatibilities Maternal: The dose of IVIG an d the gestation at which to start treatment should be tailored according to the history of NAIT in earlier pregnancies. A patient with a low -risk obstetric history (where the previous infant had thrombocytopenia but no intracranial haemorrhage) should be commenced on 0.5g- 1.0/kg/week from 20 weeks' gestation. In high -risk pregnancies, treatment should commence from as early as 12 weeks' gestation with a dose of 1g/kg/week (where the previous fetus or neonate had Successful outcome of pregnancy i.e. no severe haemorrhage such as intracranial haemorrhage Platelet count above 50x109 /L at time of delivery Increment in neonatal platelet count No - for NAIT Yes - for FMAIT 9 Commissioning Criteria Policy Immunoglobulin - Final 2021 Indication Eligibility criteria: Exclusion criteria: Position of immunoglobulin, taking into account alternative therapies: Recommended dose: Outcome measures to be recorded on the national database: Prior panel approval required Prevention or treatment of neonatal thrombocytopenia or haemorrhage: Clinical suspicion of NAIT in the neonatal setting based on clinical features suggestive of bleeding e.g. purpura and/or bruising and/or more serious bleeding and a low platelet count responsible for NAIT. Platelet transfusion is effective immediately. In contrast, immunoglobulin is a second line treatment and works in approximately 75% of cases. It has a delayed effect over 24 - 48 hours. Immunoglobulin may be of value if there is prolonged thrombocytopenia with the aim of minimising the need for platelet transfusions intracranial haemorrhage after 28 weeks' gestation), or 2g/kg/week (where the previous fetus or neonate had intracranial haemorrhage before 28 weeks)8-12 Neonatal: 1g/kg; a 2nd dose may be required if thrombocytopenia persists Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AHA, including Evans syndrome) - short term use AHA, including Evans syndrome: Symptomatic or severe anaemia, except in patients with co- morbidities), AND Refractory to conventional treatment with corticosteroids, OR Corticosteroids contra- indicated, OR As a temporising measure prior to splenectomy AHA in pregnancy: Pregnant women with warm AHA refractory to corticosteroids OR with evidence of fetal anaemia. Neonates of mothers with AHA who have evidence of haemolysis and rising bilirubin despite intensive phototherapy No Immunoglobulin is reserved for pati ents unresponsive to steroids or where steroids are contra- indicated 1-2g/kg in two to five divided doses.

It may need to be given every 2- 3 weeks during a period where other second line treatments are being tried 4) Moderate severity bleeding in patient at higher risk of subsequent severe bleed. Patients with mucosal bleeding or bleeding from multiple sites or a previous history of severe bleeding are at higher risk of a subsequent severe bleed Bleeding severity as defined by the \"Updated international consensus report on the investigation and management of primary immune thrombocytopenia 2019\"15 Target platelet counts for surgery* Procedure Platelet count Dentistry >20 Simple dental extraction >30 Complex dental extraction >50 Regional dental block >30 Minor surgery >50 Major surgery >80 Major neurosurgery >100 ITP in pregnancy: Maintenance treatment with Ig may be required antenatally to maintain platelets above 20x109/l and/or to increase platelets to over 50 x109/l for some patients (in situation 3) or as an adjunct in the other situations A 2nd dose may be required after 24 - 48 hours, if severe or life-threatening bleeding: e.g. Intracranial bleed or pulmonary haemorrhage Otherwise, if a haemostatically adequate platelet count is not achieved a 2nd dose (1g/kg) may be considered at day 5 to 7 Children: 0.8 - 1g/kg as a single infusion. A 2nd dose may be required after 24 - 48 hours, if severe or life-threatening bleeding, such as an intracranial bleed or pulmonary haemorrhage. Otherwise, if a haemostatically adequate platelet count is not achieved a 2nd dose (1g/kg) may be considered at day 5 to 7 Resolution of bleeding Number of bleeding complications should be discussed with the designated panel lead. Yes - for maintenance treatment 12 Commissioning Criteria Policy Immunoglobulin - Final 2021 Indication Eligibility criteria: Exclusion criteria: Position of immunoglobulin, taking into account alternative therapies: Recommended dose: Outcome measures to be recorded on the national database: Prior panel approval required Covid Vaccine - induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia (VITT) delivery in women with symptomatic persistent or chronic ITP where other treatments have failed *There is controversy regarding the target platelet count for epidural anaesthesia16. There are no data to support a minimum platelet count and each case must be carefully considered. In the absence of bruising, bleeding history, and anticoagulation and if the INR, APTT and fibrinogen levels are normal, a small consensus of obstetric anaesthetists agree no changes to normal practice are needed until the platelet count drops below 50. Confirmed/Probable diagnosis of VITT made by a haematologist conforming to up to date guidance from the Expert Haematology Panel - See British Society for Haematology website for details . Also see NICE NG200 guideline17. Isolated thrombocytopenia or thrombosis: Reduced platelet count without thrombosis with D dimer at or near normal and normal fibrinogen. Thrombosis with normal platelet count and D dimer Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin, irrespective of the degree of thrombocytopenia is urgent as this is the treatment most likely to influence the disease process.

IVIg can provide more r apid but temporary control and is likely to be the preferred option in emergency situations where an immediate res ponse is required, for example in dysphagia and/or difficulty in breathing in inflammatory myositis. 24 Commissioning Criteria Policy Immunoglobulin - Final 2021 Dosing optimisation for maintenance - general notes: An ongoing issue for diseases that require long- term immunoglobulin treatment is that once significant and functional responsiveness to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is demonstrated for a patient using standard immunomodulatory dosing, the 'maintenance' dosing required to maintain the therapeutic response is not well characterised. In this update, the dosing recommendations for some neurological indications include 'time to relapse' as the interval between doses. This approach is supported by recent evi dence from The Oxford Programme for Immunomodulatory Immunoglobulin Therapy, which was set up to review multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) treatment with immunoglobulin. In view of the unc ertainty of both remission and disease progression in CIDP and MMN, The Oxford Programme reviewed the dose and infusion frequency of patients on a regular basis and showed that increasing the infusion interval prov ed successful in some patients and resulted in treatment discontinuation29. An alternative approach based on establishing the 'time to relapse' following the first or second dose followed by dose reduc tion has also been proposed and is equally feasible20. This ensures patients who need no more than 1 or 2 doses are not exposed to unnecessary doses and those with ongoing needs are optimised to a minimal dose. Based on evidence from randomised trials, it is likely that up to 40% of patients with CIDP may be able to discontinue treatm ent30 after 6 -12 months, although a significant proportion may relapse and require retreatment. For this reason, periodic trials of cessation of treatment are recommended, especially in patients who appear to be stable even if optimally treated. The demonstration of conti nued IVIG requirement by forced suspension on more than 2 or 3 occasions over a 5- year period probably indicates ongoing long term dependence and further withdrawals are highly unlikely to be effective. Referral to a specialist neurology centre i s recommended as early as possible. In inflammatory myositis, maintenance treatment with IVIg for a prolonged period (usually less than 12 months) may be required in a small minority of patients. In these cases, every effort should be made to establish the minimum c linically effective dose by either reduction of dose or lengthening the intervals between infusions. Cessation trials should be attempted at least annual ly to establish on- going need for treatment31. Specific exclusion criteria against the use of immunoglobulin have not been listed, but it is important to carry out benefit - risk analyses in certain patient groups: patients at high risk of thromboembolism (hypertension, diabetes, smoking, hypercoagulable states) should be counselled regarding the prothrombotic risks of immunoglobulin. 25 Commissioning Criteria Policy Immunoglobulin - Final 2021 IgA deficiency is no longer considered a contra- indication to the use of immunoglobulin and should not be withheld because of theoretical concerns of adverse reactions. The role of anti -IgA antibodies in causing react ions is controversial and measurement of anti-IgA antibodies prior to undertaking treatment is not warranted. 26 Commissioning Criteria Policy Immunoglobulin - Final 2021 Use of Immunoglobulin in Infectious Diseases: Immunoglobulin is routinely commissioned in the following indications, under the circumstances described: Indication Eligibility criteria: Exclusion criteria: Position of immunoglobulin, taking into account alternative therapies: Recommended dose: Outcome measures to be recorded on the national database: Prior panel approval required Hepatitis A Immunoglobulin is recommended in addition to hepatitis A vaccine for contacts of hepatitis A who are less able to respond to vaccine (those aged 60 or over, OR those with immunosuppression and those with a CD4 count <200 cell per microlitre), OR those at risk of severe complications (those with chronic liver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C infection) See eligibility criteria Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended in addition to immunoglobulin Vaccine should be administered within 2 weeks of exposure Subgam: <10 years 500mg >10 years 1000 mg To be given by intramuscular injection*.

At a dose of 0.4 g/kg every 3 weeks administered from weeks 12 through to week 24 of gestation, IVIg was ineffective in preventing the development of CHB in neonates in two prospective open- label trials based on a case series a higher dose (1g/kg) alongside high dose oral prednisolone may possibly be effective . Transplantation (solid organ) - short term use Antibody Incompatible Transplant (AIT) : Patients in whom renal, heart, liver or lung transplant is prevented because of antibodies Antibody Mediated Rejection (AMR): Patients experiencing steroid resistant rejection or where other therapies are contraindicated after renal, heart, liver and/or lung transplant See comments under position of Ig While IVIg is included in many protocols, there is a paucity of high- quality evidence to support its use. A systematic review of AMR in kidney transplant recipients categorised the evidence supporting the use of IVIg as being 'very low'43. Where IVIg is used in combination with plasma exchange (PLEX), any beneficial effects of Ig are likely to be negated by subsequent PLEX. For this reason, the use of Ig immediately prior to PLEX is not supported. The addition of Rituximab to IVIg appears to be of benefit in lowering HLA antibody titres AIT: Up to 2 g/kg to be repeated as per DSA; in renal desensitisation at 0.1 g/kg for 8- 12 doses AMR: Treatment protocols vary in the UK ranging from low dose 100mg/kg after PLEX or high dose 2g/kg AIT and AMR: Renal: Type of renal transplant HLA class DSA (where available) Rejection episodes Patient survival Graft survival Renal function = eGFR (MDRD) Cardiothoracic: DSA Length of ITU and hospital stay Graft function (heart = rejection fraction; lung = spirometry; liver = liver function, clotting indices) No 37 Commissioning Criteria Policy Immunoglobulin - Final 2021 References 1.
