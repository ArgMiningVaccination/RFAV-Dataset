Ayurveda focuses on maintaining the health of all these three entities. But several people are prone to diseases when they break their dietary plan or due to climatic changes, while some are healthy in spite of changes in their dietary plan and climatic change. What causes such differences? This is because many microorganisms enter the human body via air, food, and water but fail to give rise to disease, due to the immune response of that individual. The immunity of the body is an important thing in relation to health and disease. In Ayurveda \"Vyadhikshamatva\" is the concept that correlates with immunity. The word Vyadhikshamatva is made up of two words: \"Vyadhi\" which means \"disease\" and \"Kshamatva\" which means \"to suppress\". Vyadhi occurs when there is a balance between Doshas, Dhatus, and Malas. While these factors are in a normal state, they are responsible for maintaining physical and psychological health. If the diet and daily routine of an individual is not adjusted as per change in season, the Amas or toxins are accumulated in the body and prevent the immune system from becoming stronger.
