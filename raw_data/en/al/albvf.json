Some types of cyanobacteria can release natural toxins or poisons (called cyanotoxins) into the water, especially when they die and break down. People and pets should stay away from cyanobacteria blooms.

Monitors submit weekly visual observations of water conditions from sites around Lake Champlain. If you are interested in becoming a volunteer monitor next year on Lake Champlain or in the Lake Champlain Basin, reach out to the Lake Champlain Committee at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#84e8e7e7c4e8e5efe1e7ece5e9f4e8e5edeae7ebe9e9edf0f0e1e1aaebf6e3).

Identifying Cyanobacteria It's important to know what cyanobacteria look like and to use your best judgment when thinking about swimming or doing other activities in the water. See photos of what [cyanobacteria look like](/media/av-library/image/blue-green-algae-cyanobacteria) and what are [not cyanobacteria](/media/av-library/image/not-blue-green-algae-cyanobacteria). [Watch a video to help you identify cyanobacteria](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea0EHw5suDs) Weekly Drinking Water Test Results All 22 public drinking water suppliers on Lake Champlain submit samples for cyanobacteria toxin analysis. Drinking water test results are updated weekly by the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation.

You can reach out to LCC if you are interested in becoming a volunteer monitor. - [Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation](https://dec.vermont.gov/watershed/lakes-ponds/learn-more/cyanobacteria)- monitors long-term water quality at dozens of off-shore stations on Lake Champlain and recruits and trains volunteers on many other Vermont lakes - [Vermont State Parks](https://vtstateparks.com/)- monitors conditions at park swim areas How to Report a Cyanobacteria Bloom Report a bloom to the Health Department by filling out an online form. Include several photos and note the location of the bloom. (Taking pictures of water is difficult with glare and reflections. Take more pictures than you think "}
