It is an expected that complementary therapies will become a larger part of the practice of some nurses. ALLOPATHIC MEDICINE: Allopathic medicine or biomedicine has been dominant for 100 years and has spearheaded remarkable advances in biotechnology, surgical interventions, pharmaceutical approaches and diagnostic tools. Now a day's many people are using complementary therapies to promote health and assist with healing from illness.

E.g.: Using laxative to relieve constipation.[4] BENEFITS OF ALLOPATHY: \u00b7 Allopathic medicine helps to treat acute and life threatening illness and injuries. \u00b7 Doctors are highly trained in this medical system. \u00b7 Patients have rights and protection under the law {right to refuse treatment, do not resuscitate}. \u00b7 Research is continually being conducted and technologies are being improved. \u00b7 Pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics have saved many lives and help to manage pain and illness in short and long term.[8] DRAW BACKS OF ALLOPATHIC MEDICINE: \u00b7 Doctors are often over-scheduled and get very little time with patients. \u00b7 Doctors refers patient for too many tests and procedure. E.g.: money minded \u00b7 Drugs and surgery are often the primary treatment for the health condition[6] FUNCTION OF ALLOPATHY: \u00b7 Any illness or disorders in the body generate distressing vibration at various levels in the body. This allopathy treatment functions by destroying the distressing vibration of the illness in the physical body at physical level. \u00b7 It is most inferior among other therapies. \u00b7 Allopathy services are provide in hospital set up as well as in community health set up \u00b7 In the hospital set up spiritual and specialized care provided to the patient. \u00b7 In community health set up basic, preventive, promotive care provided through the health centers. \u00b7 First aid services are given by allopathy treatment.[7] CONCLUSION: Nurses should be knowledgeable about complementary therapies primarily for three reasons, 1. Patients, families, physicians and institutions are expecting that the practicing nurses should be knowledgeable about complementary therapies. 2. Many nurses are expanding their practice by incorporating complementary therapies. 3. Although complementary therapies may seem totally safe, there are some potentially harmful situations.
