AAEP President Dr. Scott Hay The AAEP is pleased to introduce Dr. Scott Hay as its 2021 president. Dr. Hay is president and managing share-holder of Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based racetrack practice Teigland, Franklin and Brokken DVMs (TFB Equine). Born and raised in Ottawa, Kansas, Dr. Hay is a second-generation veterinarian and AAEP member. His father, Dr. William Hay, was a longtime member and mixed animal practice owner. His mother, Dorothy, was a stay-at-home mom to Scott and his older sister, Becky. While in high school, Dr. Hay participated in rodeo\u2014 specifically team and calf roping\u2014although basketball was his true passion. He attended Kansas State University intending to become a high school teacher and basketball coach, but after earning degrees in political science and history, he realized he wanted a career with horses. He spent the next two years fulfilling academic requirements before applying and being accepted to vet school at Kansas State University. Shortly after receiving his veterinary degree in 1988, Dr. Hay started at Teigland, Franklin and Brokken. For the past 32 years, he has focused his practice on the day-to-day care of racehorses in south Florida while travelling to Thoroughbred auctions in the eastern half of the United States to consult on purchases. He took on additional practice management duties in 2000.Dr. Hay has been an AAEP member his entire professional career, citing the value of the educational offerings, networking and camaraderie that have enhanced his practice and enjoyment of veterinary medicine. A desire to become more involved with AAEP led to his consistent and effective volunteer leadership within the association over the past 15 years, upholding a commitment to organized veterinary medicine, particularly AAEP, that has been a hallmark of Teigland, Franklin and Brokken for more than half a century. Dr. Hay serves on the AAEP's Educational Programs Committee, Finance & Audit Committee and as a veterinary spokesperson for the On Call program. He previously served on the board of directors from 2009-2011, as chair of the Racing Committee and as a member of the Professional Conduct & Ethics Committee. Beyond AAEP, Dr. Hay serves on the Grayson-Jockey Club Research Foundation Advisory Committee and is a member and former chair of the Racing Medication and Testing Consortium's Scientific Advisory Committee. Away from practice, Dr. Hay enjoys a relaxing round of golf and spending time with his three-year-old grand-daughter, Cara, and his three adult children: Lindsay, a sports psychologist; Baylee, who's pursuing a business degree; and Kylee, who's working toward an education degree. The challenges of 2020 have reinforced the importance of family, not just at home but also professionally among practice staff and the broader AAEP community. As Dr. Hay says of the AAEP, \"there are so many things an orga-nization of this magnitude helps with in your practice life.\" These words are as true today during a global pandemic as in 1961, when practice founder Dr. M.B. Teigland assumed the reigns as AAEP's 7th president. The legacy of industry leadership established by Dr. Teigland and perpetuated by Dr. Ben Franklin in 2000 and Dr. Tom Brokken in 2006, continues this year with Dr. Hay serving as the fourth from his practice to lead the AAEP. Dr. Scott Hay IV AAEP News January 2021 It may have looked different out of necessity, but AAEP's reimagined 2020 Annual Convention & Trade Show in December continued the longstanding tradition of delivering practical clinical knowledge to enhance patient health and practice success. At press time for this issue, nearly 2,600 veterinary professionals and students had taken advantage of the reduced registration rate to watch and claim CE at their own pace and on their own schedule. Registration closed Dec. 31, and all sessions remain available on-demand through June 30. While the virtual format may have been a wildcard for some at the time they registered, attendees quickly adapted and enjoyed the format. In fact, it wasn't uncommon to see more than 200 attendees in some of the live Table Topics on Zoom, generating valuable discussion. As a member from Texas commented at the conclusion of the live Prime Time sessions, \"I have partic-ipated now in six online conferences this year, and by far AAEP was the easiest to navigate, most streamlined, and most professional.\" After a year that tested everyone's resiliency, we hope to see you in-person at the 2021 convention at the Music City Center in Nashville\u2014although it's safe to say there will be a strong virtual component to the meeting. Access Kester and Milne articles online EVE and EVJ have released a virtual issue of the articles discussed during the Kester News Hour and referenced in the Milne Lecture. The articles are free access until Feb. 28 at https://tinyurl.com/kest20.Continue earning CE credits All educational sessions are available on-demand to attendees until June 30. For on-demand sessions, attendees answer a short quiz after watching the presen-tation video. Upon passing the quiz with a score of at least 70%, a CE certificate is automatically awarded and available to the attendee. Attendees can find copies of all CE certificates earned during convention by logging into the convention website, going to \"My Account\" and then selecting \"CE Certificates\" in the left-hand menu bar. My Vet Rocks grand prize to Dr. Alfredo Sanchez-Londo\u00f1o During Opening Session of Convention Prime Time, the AAEP recognized Dr. Alfredo Sanchez-Londo\u00f1o from Auburn University as recipient of the grand prize 2020 My Vet Rocks Award for the exception-al care he provides to clients' horses. Dr. Sanchez-Londo\u00f1o received complimen-tary registration to the virtual convention as well as a grand prize package provided by the AAEP and contest sponsor American Regent Animal Health.

The case series began in the November 2020 issue, and a different matter is being presented each month, with names omitted to protect the privacy of those involved. Case of the month - January \"Dr. T\" applied for AAEP membership. It was discovered that Dr. T had their license suspended by the state licensing board for animal cruelty for a period of one year and an additional probationary period of four years. The AAEP's Professional Conduct & Ethics Committee requested Dr. T provide an update as to the status of their license to practice veterinary medicine. No response was received. Outcome: Dr. T's application for membership was denied.Ethics in actionETHICS Taking steps toward a more diverse and inclusive profession Work of diversity task force to accelerate in 2021 Societal events in 2020 prompted organizations and associations throughout the U.S. and elsewhere to take a deep look in the mirror, and the AAEP was no exception. With the composition of equine veterinary medicine being approximately 95% Caucasian compared to about 90% for general veterinary practice\u2014both significantly higher than the overall U.S. population\u2014is there more the AAEP could or should be doing to foster inclusivity within the associa-tion and equine practice? To help answer that question, the board of directors at its summer meeting approved formation of a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Task Force to provide recommendations to address deficiencies within the association and equine practice, as well as strategies for long-term commitment to these ideals. The nine-person task force is chaired by Dr. Jean-Yin Tan and includes veterinary social worker Angie Arora along with the following AAEP members: Dr. Rachel Aja HarveyDr. Rustin MooreDr. Mitchell Rode - Board LiaisonAlthough the task force is in its early stages, Dr. Tan emphasized the systematic approach to its organiza-tional assessment, research and rec-ommendations, which she hopes to provide to the board of directors by late spring or early summer. \"Our group is talking about what barriers there are to entering and staying in the veterinary profession from a race and ethnicity standpoint; and we also want to focus on gender, on sexuality, on people with disabili-ties and what barriers different groups from all types of circum-stances face in the equine veterinary profession,\" said Dr. Tan. \"We're really trying to identify what the issues are here, what can we do about it, and how can we get more on par with the general veterinary population and maybe even more on par with the general U.S. population.\" AAEP President Dr. Scott Hay stressed the importance of the task force during the Closing Session of the virtual convention. \"Probably the most important issue we have facing us for our future is developing a successful approach to the diversity issues that affect many in equine practice,\" he said. \"It's very easy to say that we are being inclusive of everyone, but I think we have to look deeper. What are the real issues of diversity in an organi-zation such as ours? What can we do differently to make sure everyone has opportunity? How can we work to make our organization and our profession as diverse as the general population? What are the blind spots that we never saw before? \"To try to get all of these questions answered, the AAEP has an appointed task force to look at diversity, equity and inclusion\u2014or lack thereof\u2014and to make absolutely certain that the organiza-tion is doing everything in its power to be inclusive of everyone!\" Dr. Jean- Yin Tan Todd KorolAAEP News January 2021 VII ASSOCIA TION ASSOCIA TIONWELLNE SS Road warrior wellness Here are tips for living healthier if you're an ambulatory veterinarian By Amy L. Grice, VMD, MBA Ambulatory equine practitioners spend many hours of the day on the road, and many drive upwards of 35,000 miles each year. All this windshield time can pose a health risk due to the hours spent sitting, the difficulty in finding healthy food on the road, and the distraction while talking on the phone behind the wheel. Despite these challenges, veterinari- ans can choose to have a healthier mobile lifestyle. Here are some tips. Body and brain stiffness As the years in practice accumulate, so do the various injuries and the consequent aches and pains. Because sitting in one position for 30-45 minutes can cause joints to stiffen up, when getting out of the truck, you might find yourself Grade IV/V lame! Consider doing some gentle stretches when you arrive at your destination. If there are horses turned out in pastures that need simple procedures or examinations, consider walking out to where they are grazing to get a few limbering steps in. Obviously, if they are horses that are difficult for their owners to catch or patients that resist veterinary attention, this is inadvisable. But the mental break of slowing down the rush and enjoying your surroundings outside on a beautiful spring day might bring you more relief than just an easing of your hip and knee pain. Having an opportunity to enjoy the small moments of your day can be uplifting. Feeding the body Lunch for road warriors is often limited to gas station hot dogs, drive-through burgers and fries, or slices of pizza because most ambulatory doctors don't have time for a sit-down lunch unless it's behind the wheel. Consider packing a cooler or thermos with healthier food from home. Grazing all day on yogurt, fruit, crackers with peanut butter or cheese, and leftover vegetables and steak from last night's dinner is better than fast food for maintaining a stable blood sugar and energy level. Better eating can also help you keep a healthy weight. In the winter, a thermos full of chili or soup and a hunk of whole grain bread is a welcome midday meal. Just tuck in a blue surgery towel for a bib and spread one in your lap for the inevitable spills. Always keep healthy snacks like nuts, dried fruit and popcorn in your truck for those unexpected late days when you're hungry enough to eat a stethoscope. If you pass a roadside stand selling tomatoes, strawberries or other munchable produce, treat yourself! It helps to keep a salt and pepper shaker in your center console and a roll of paper towels in the cab. Feeding the joy When you have many miles between calls, taking a break from your work is pleasant. Instead of making callbacks about lab work or rechecks, consider calling a friend for a visit or listening to a podcast about a topic that interests you. Catch up on global topics on National Public Radio or listen to your favorite music or a new audio book. These mini-vacations can decrease your stress and increase your daily quotient of joy.Safety first Intense phone calls are a regular part of an equine veterinarian's life. When they occur, you should strongly consider pulling over to the side of the road, especially if you are in traffic. Distracted driving is very dangerous, and your life could change forever in a split second. Never text while driving. Reading texts and emails while operating a large vehicle at 60 mph is foolhardy. Your loved ones are depending on you to arrive alive at the end of your day. Make it a new habit to check your phone every time you arrive at a destination, but not with every \"ping.\" Set up a different ringtone for your emergency service so you know to answer. Safety on the road is essential for wellness. Take-home message Although ambulatory veterinarians have many challenges in living a healthy lifestyle, small changes can make a big difference in overall wellness.

The intent is not to provide specific case management advice. The exact nature of the relationship between mentors and mentees is up to the pair; however, most conversations consist of phone calls, emails and/or text messages at least on a monthly basis. Pairings have a one-year term; both parties need to opt back into the relationship for it to continue. If one or both parties elect not to renew the relationship, each can return to the pool and receive a new match. If you would prefer not to sign up for a full mentorship relationship but instead just need to seek advice on something, you can now submit a question in any of nine areas such as contract negotiation, handling difficult clients, financial management and more. Your question will be directed to a veteran practitioner experienced in that area for a reply. To submit a question, visit aaep.org/mentoring-program and click the \"Ask a Mentor a Question\" button. If you are in your first five years of practice and would like to find a mentor, register as a mentee at aaep.org/mentoring-program. After uploading your CV or work samples, you will be able to review a list of volunteer mentors and their background before requesting an engagement. You'll negotiate and set expectations for time commitment up front so you both get the most value from your interactions. If you are a veteran practitioner who would like to volunteer as a mentor to a new practitioner, register as a mentor at aaep.org/mentoring-program. You will then create your mentor profile by uploading your CV or work samples. If you have questions about this benefit, contact Megan Gray, AAEP member concierge, at mgray@aaep.org or (859) News 2021MEMBERSHIPINDUSTRY EquiManagement is a proud AAEP Media Partner.

Abnormal rhythms were found in 158 horses (64.5%); 110 (44.9%) of these had isolated premature depolarisations and 48 (19.6%) horses had complex tachydysrhythmias. Rhythm disturbances were most common during recovery from exercise (50% of horses). Horses being exercised on a treadmill were 2.6 times more likely to have rhythm disturbances than those exercisedoverground, and National Hunt racehorses were 2.7 times more likely to have complex arrhythmias than horses engaged in flat racing. Exercise-associated upper respiratory tract (URT) obstruction was associated with the presence ofrhythm disturbances. Horses with URT obstruction at exercise were twice as likely to have a rhythm disturbance than those with normal airway function. Overall, 82% of horses raced again. There were no signi cant differences in the number of horses that returned to racing in the normal rhythm, isolated prematuredepolarisations or complex rhythm groups. Genetic testing for PSSM2 P variant alleles (P2, P3 and P4) are currently incommercial myopathy (PSSM2) brillar myopathy (MFM). This study by Stephanie Valberg and colleagues in the USA aimed to compare frequencies of these alleles between 98 Warmblood and Arabian horses diagnosed with PSSM2/MFM by muscle histopathology, and 84 matched control horses. There was no signi cant association between any P locus and a histopathological diagnosis of PSSM2 or MFM. The sensitivity for the P variants for predicting PSSM2/MFM was poor ( <33%) for all P variants in both Warmbloods and Arabian horses. Frequencies of these P variants in modern,early domestic and Przewalski horses were determined from a public data repository. All P variants were present in early domestic horses and P2 was also present in the Przewalski horse, suggesting that they are unlikely to confer a disadvantage to health and tness. A careful history, physical examination, serum creatine kinase activity, PSSM1 genetic test, and, in the absence of PSSM1, muscle histopathology, represent more accurate and validated means to differentiate the many causes of exertional myopathies in horses. The P variants used in commercial genetic tests are not predictive of the presence or absence of PSSM2 or MFM. Insulin dysregulation and obesity This study by Justin Box and colleagues in Finland and the UK aimed to determine the insulin dysregulation (ID) status of a population of 128 purebred Finnhorses 3 years of age using an oral sugar test (OST) and compare phenotypes andmanagement factors between ID and non-ID Finnhorses.An online questionnaire regarding their horses 'signalment, history, feeding, and exercise was used to recruit owners.Selected contributing stables were visited. Phenotypic markers of obesity and the weight of each horse were recorded. After fasting overnight, horses received 0.45 mL/kg bwt corn syrup per os. Serum samples before and at 60 and 90 min after syrup administration were analysed for insulin by chemiluminescent assay. Horses met ID criteria if insulin concentrations were 33lIU/mL at T0, 66lIU/mL at T60 or T90 or some combination thereof. Associations betweenphenotypic markers, feeding and exercise variables, and ID were examined using mixed effects logistic regression modelling. Several phenotypic markers of obesity were signi cant on univariable analysis but in the nal multivariable model, only obesity (body condition score 8) was associated with ID. Over half of the horses (60%) were considered overweight or obese whereas 16% were classi ed as having ID. Because obesity is associated with ID in cold-blooded type horses,objective monitoring of phenotypic markers by owners may be bene cial for health outcomes. Intestinal helminth infections In this prospective case-control study Heidrun Gehlen and colleagues in Germany, USA, Italy and the UK investigated the association between colic and intestinal helminth infection. A total of 620 horses, of which 312 were colic patients, were studied. For each horse, a range of copromicroscopic, serological, and clinical data was obtained. A questionnaire which included details of previous anthelmintic treatment and husbandry was also used. The highest infection rates were seen for strongyles (41.8%), followed by Anoplocephala perfoliata and Parascaris spp. (both 0.8%), with no signi cant difference between the colic and non-colic groups. Real- time PCR showed a 1.1% S. vulgaris DNA prevalence. Higher seroprevalences were observed using S. vulgaris and A. perfoliata ELISAs, with 32.3% and 10.7%, respectively. No association concerning either serologic status wasencountered with colic status. The shedding of strongyle eggs was associated with a 1.8-times increased risk of S. vulgaris seropositivity. Recent anthelmintic treatment was associatedwith the onset of colic, as animals who had received an anthelmintic during the previous week had a 2.4-times higher risk of signs of colic compared to those treated at least 8 weeks prior. Ponies were signi cantly less often affected by colic than Warmbloods. The high S. vulgaris and considerable A. perfoliata seroprevalences encountered in this investigation should prompt veterinarians, farm managers, and horse owners to maintain consequent and effective worm control measures. Small intestinal mesenteric vessel occlusion In this study Gessica Giusto and Marco Gandini from theUniversity of Turin, Italy, compared the application of haemostatic clips and sliding knot ligatures to occlude of strangulated intestine is a commonly performed procedure. Ligatures, vessel sealing devices and the ligate- divide stapler are commonly used for this purpose. Portions of jejunum with 10 associated mesenteric vessels were collected from 12 horses at a local abattoir and divided into two groups. Portions of intestine were divided into two sections comprising ve vessels each and assigned to Group A or Group B. Each vessel was occluded with a triple ligature. InGroup A, vessels were ligated with three circumferential ligatures tied with a sliding knot with two overthrows. In Group B, three haemoclips were applied to occlude the vessels. The procedures were performed by the same experienced surgeon. Intestinal length, construction time and vessel leaking pressure were measured and compared between groups. No signi cant difference was found in intestinal length (Group A 3.78 /C60.43 m; Group B 3.04 /C60.83 m [mean /C6SD]). The difference in construction time was signi cant (Group A 7.03/C60.34 min; Group B 2.40 /C60.43 min [mean /C6SD]). No signi cant difference was found in the leaking pressure (Group A median 1000, IQ range 750 -1050 mmHg; Group B median 1050, IQ range 800 -1050 mmHg). The authors concluded that haemoclip application is comparable in terms of leaking pressure but quicker than sliding knots to apply. Sidewinder gait Sidewinder gait is characterised by walking with the trunk and pelvic limbs drifting to one side. This retrospective study by Monica Aleman and colleagues in the USA and UK reported causes, clinical and diagnostic features. Cases at two institutions with sidewinder gait, neurological and orthopaedic examination, and diagnostic work-up or post-mortem evaluation were included. Descriptive statistics were performed. Twenty-four horses (mean age 18.9 years) of various breeds and both sexes were included. Onset was acute (n =10), subacute (n =6), and insidious (n =8). Electromyography and muscle biopsy supported neurologic disease and further aided in localising site of lesion in all horses. Neurologic causes included dynamic thoracolumbar spinal cord compression (n=5), equine protozoal myeloencephalitis aetiology(n=4), gliosis (n =2), thoracic spinal cord segments (n =1). Non-neurologic causes included osteoarthritis of the coxofemoral joint (n =4), multiple displaced pelvic fractures (n =2), bilateral rupture of the ligamentum capitis ossis femoris (n =1), and severe myonecrosis of multiple pelvic limb muscles (n =1). Case fatality was 79%. Sidewinder gait is usually seen in older horses and can have neurologic or musculoskeletal aetiologies. Electromyography can be used as a diagnostic aid to determine neurologic versus non-neurologic disease and further localise those of neurologic origin. The condition often has a poor prognosis for function and life. Bacterial isolates in arytenoid chondropathy In this retrospective cohort study Georgina Johnston andJonathan Lumsden, based in Australia, describe the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates cultured from surgical specimens of infected arytenoid cartilage and granulomas.Thirty-three Thoroughbred horses were identi ed from a search of clinical records for horses admitted to a referralhospital for arytenoid chondropathy surgery that had samples submitted for culture and sensitivity over a 14-year period. Descriptive analyses were performed. In total, 56 bacterial isolates were obtained. Gram- positive bacteria (58%), Gram-negative bacteria (54%), and anaerobes (33%) were cultured from samples. Multiple bacteria were isolated in 58% of horses. Streptococcus spp. were the most common (32%), followed byEnterobacteriaceae present in44% of bacterial isolates. A wide variety of bacteria was cultured, providing evidence that secondary opportunistic infection by common respiratory bacteria is likely a factor in arytenoid chondropathy. Multidrug resistance was higher than previously reported in equine respiratory samples. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole had low effectiveness. Because culture and sensitivity testing is not available in the diagnosis of mild to moderate arytenoid chondropathy, the ndings of this study may allow for more targeted broad- spectrum antimicrobial treatment to limit disease progressionwhen the disease is rst identi ed. The antimicrobial susceptibilities and MDR emphasise the importance offollowing current antimicrobial guidelines and highlight therequirement for surgical intervention in cases that do not resolve with initial antimicrobial therapy.

At the time of writing this editorial (mid-October 2020), many countries are facing a second or third 'wave 'of infections, and worldwide there have been around 40 million con rmed COVID-19 infections (in accordance with the applied case de nitions and testing strategies in the affected countries), including over 1.1 milliondeaths. The pandemic has changed how individuals live their day-to-day lives due to the lockdown restrictions, requirements for quarantine and self-isolation, and socialdistancing measures implemented by most governments to minimise the spread of the virus (Pakpour and Grif ths 2020; Satici et al . 2020). The pandemic and its constant reporting in the media have increased distress-related psychological problems such as anxiety, depression and insomnia (Dong and Bouey 2020; Li et al . 2020). The pandemic also has an important economic aspect to it, with millions of people losingtheir employment, which is a source of great emotional distress (Kawohl and Nordt 2020; Nicola et al . 2020), not only to the people directly affected but also to numerousbusinesses (including veterinary businesses) that face potential downturns in their work as a result of the resultant nancial recession. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to dominatethe public health eld. Although the initial panic caused by the pandemic may have mitigated to some extent, its effects(such as anxiety, stress, fear and uncertainty) will continue to linger for months or years ahead (Kanekar and Sharma 2020). There is a growing global consensus that healthcare professionals, such as physicians and dentists, suffer high rates of anxiety, depression and psychological distress. In the current climate, mental distress, psychiatric illness and burnout inevitably worsen. Many will harbour fears over their own and their family 's health (Imo 2017). Similar conditions apply to veterinarians. Mental ill health has also been shownto be prevalent in the veterinary profession, with high risk of occupational stress, burnout, poor psychological wellbeing and an elevated rate of suicide (Gardener and Hini 2006; Bartram et al . 2009; Mastenbroek et al . 2013; Volk et al . 2018). The wellbeing of veterinary professionals is one of the most important issues facing our profession. In this issue of Equine Veterinary Education, we publish the results of a survey that the British Equine Veterinary Association (BEVA) undertook of its members in June 2020, at the time of the period of lockdown during the rst wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK (Mair et al . 2021). The results suggest signi cantly lower levels of mental wellbeing among equine veterinary surgeons and equine veterinary nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the situation prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, equine veterinary nurses appeared to be more likely to report lower mental wellbeing than veterinary surgeons, and furloughed veterinary surgeons reported lower levels of mental wellbeing than veterinary surgeons that continued working during thelockdown. The results are not surprising, but they highlight theimportance for us all to recognise the further pressures that this pandemic is adding to our profession that already has signi cant issues with mental wellbeing. Both local and national tools and resources to promote personal and professional wellbeing are vital to provide support for all members and of the profession. Practice teams, business owners, veterinary colleges, organisations and individuals all have important roles to play. There are a number of wellness and mindfulness programmes available to us, including the Mind Matters Initiative developed by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) (https://www.vetmindmatters.org) and wellness programmes run by the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) (https:// aaep.org/wellness) and the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) (https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/ wellbeing).These are important resources that are particularly valuable during the acute phase of the pandemic. The extent of the COVID-19 infections and the steps taken by national governments to control the pandemic have varied from country to country. Below is a brief summary of the impact of the pandemic on the equine veterinary sector in a number of different countries, as supplied by their national equine veterinary associations. Australia (Holly Lewis, EVA) Economic and government scenario Early on the Federal Agriculture Minister classi ed ALL veterinarians as essential service workers. This announcement was extremely powerful in allowing veterinarians to continue to do their work, albeit with a comprehensive range of infection prevention protocols at clinics and in the eld. These protocols meant a burden of extra work thatadded stress to the job. The Australian Veterinary Association, of which EVA ispart, created a COVID-19 Working Group that providedinformation and insights into managing the pandemic. Their work did not go as far advising vets what constituted 'essential work '; the de nition of that was left broadly for individual veterinarians to decide. Theindividual vet 's unique knowledge of the patient, animal ownership, diagnosis and location were thoughtto be the most important considerations. The racing industry was successful in lobbying that racingcontinued based on animal welfare. No spectators were allowed for many months. Sport horse activities were cancelled/postponed for manymonths, and major 3-day events cancelled completely. The Australian stud season commenced on 1 August, andthe season has continued as normal with COVID-19 protocols in place. The Australian Government Border Closure meant thatinternational vets from UK, IRE, EU and NZ could not enter Australia for their normal 6-month 10.1111/eve.13416EVA successfully lobbied hard with Federal Immigration Department to have VISAs and Border Force Permissions issued for these vets. A total of 29 vets were given entry permission. Regional mixed practice and clinic equine workcontinued as normal. Clinics with a small animal practice enjoyed a signi cant increase in canine and feline revenue. Pet owners who were in isolation and workingfrom home devoted attention to their pets and made more vet visits. University vets had more student extramural pressureplaced on their hospitals as many private clinics were unable to accept students under restricted COVID-19 protocols. The 2020 graduate cohort (graduating in November)were worried that their extramural experience would be 'underdone '. Some graduation dates have been postponed allowing catch-up. Equine Research has been postponed in many places. EVA Conferencing (Bain Fallon), workshops and meetingshave all been cancelled with extreme disappointment. In a Second Infection Wave, the State of Victoria(population 7 million) placed severe stage four lockdown restrictions including recreational horse movement. This created high anxiety among many horse ownerswho asked vets to write exemptions for them, creating more stress. Mental health There has been some regionalised stress in veterinariansdue to: Managing COVID-19 protocols has been aconsiderable burden. Managing anxious clients in Victoria. Sporting and social life being cancelled or curtailed. General community seeking reassurance from healthprofessionals including vets and nurses. Not being able to travel. Tragically, two mid thirty-year-old equine vets committed suicide during the COVID-19 period. The association 's mental health phone counselling service has experienced higher than average usage. Belgium (Emmanuelle van Erck Westergren, BEPS) These are the initial results of a survey of equine veterinarypractitioners in Belgium: Over 70% of our respondents are in 100% general equineambulatory practice. 84.6% said that the COVID crisis has had a mild to markedimpact on their practice with 38% having had to handle more cases than during the same period last year, and 34% fewer cases. They have felt clients required more communication time than before. 53% of practices have had to furlough employees, and40% have had to nd temporary or long-term replacements. While 28% have found it dif cult to manage from a professional perspective, only 16% have found the crisis tohave had an impact on their personal lives.Ireland (Thomas Austin, Vet Ireland) COVID hit Ireland in spring 2020, and we all did our best to make the best of a bad situation. As we were classi ed as essential workers, we did our best to provide a limited sociallydistanced service to our clients. Most of us were happy to scan mares with nobody near us, but none of us were happy or knew how to treat a sick foal without being on top of each other. Large animal vets are tough people who do not admit defeat or give in easily. They certainly will not say they have a mental health issue easily. But we all had. Since we were all in bad form, we were all under pressure and we were all trying to cope as best we could. We counted ourselves blessed having an outdoor occupation but that did not stop us worrying about our parents, our children, our practices or pregnant staff. Who knew what affect COVID had on pregnancy and yet many pregnant vets soldiered on. To my mind, they were among the heroes of the veterinary profession. Splitting into team A and team B sounds wonderful but the logistics were awful, pulling people out of their comfort zonesand getting them to do jobs that they do not normally do like a medic in a colic or a surgeon dripping a scouring foal. But we survived. And now with the second wave, we go again, through gritted teeth and worse weather, we go again. Cos it 's what we do, Cos we are equine vets, And we will attend. Norway (Jan Olav Berget, Norwegian Equine Veterinary Association) Most Norwegian equine veterinarians work in solitary ambulatory practices or in smaller equine veterinary clinics combined with ambulatory work. On 12 March, the Norwegian Government implemented several severe measures to combat the COVID-19 outbreak. These includedclosure of day care centres, schools and universities, recommendations to work from home, travel restrictions, travel quarantine and social distancing. During March, the Norwegian Veterinary Association published guidelines on how to best protect against COVID-19 directed at small animal clinics and farm animal veterinarians. They did not give guidelines speci cally aimed at equine veterinarians. Equine veterinarians were however, together with farmanimal veterinarians, categorised as having a 'critical function 'if they were in clinical work. This ensured that equine veterinarians could continue to work, with minor impact from various early local travel restrictions. Within the two weeks following 12 March, work could be performed mostly as normal, but routine calls were still not recommended. Advice on protection against COVID-19 was to maintain 2 m distance, proper hand hygiene before and after visits, and to use masks as deemed appropriate. We worked mostly alone and tried to keep the owners at some distance if possible. Veterinarians with small children had the opportunity to leave them in day care or at school if both parents had jobs de ned as 'critical function '. Some tried to work at home in combination with helping children withschoolwork. The outcome of that practice was variable. The negative economic impact on equine veterinarians has been quite small if we look at the whole period from \u00a92020 EVJ Ltd7 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2021March to September. It seems to have been a normal breeding season, but equestrian events were cancelled for a long time. The sports suffer, but the veterinarians have been spared so far. The owners and trainers have had the time to look at and care for their horses, and that is one good thing to come out of the pandemic situation. Overall, Norway has been lucky and had relatively few infected people (16,137) and deaths (278) from COVID-19 (mid October 2020) (Population 5.4 million). Portugal (Jo ~ao Crespo, APMVE) Portugal has four public Vet Schools and two private ones. This creates a huge input of young veterinarians every year to private practice, including equine practice. Portugal has roughly 100,000 registered equines with only 2800 competing under FEI regulations. Our market depends a lot on incoming horses for competitions, equine tourism and export of the Lusitano horse. With the con nement measures implemented because of COVID-19, competitions were suspended and people were not allowed to travel. The three major incomes to the industry were shut down. With 150 veterinarians working with horses, there are three major areas: reproduction, sports 'medicine and emergency care. The number of practices with morethan one veterinarian is very limited, with the large majority working solo. During the rst 4 weeks of con nement, the Veterinary Board was only allowing emergency care; thiscreated a major drop in all services. Riding schools were not allowed to operate, some riding centres only allowed lunge work, and the National Federation shut down all shows. A lot of horses were put out to pasture. Everyone that worked in sports 'medicine suffered major losses, on average over 70%. Only emergency work was being done. Because of the largenumber of practitioners, vets who do sports 'medicine or reproduction work do not do emergency work. When the restrictions on private practice were removed in May, reproduction work resumed with activity almost close tonormal. Emergencies dropped because horses were used to the new management and shows only started in July. With summer and the end of con nement, a lot of activity started, and work returned to almost normal levels, since tourism thisyear dropped signi cantly. Overall, COVID-19 created signi cant losses for the equine veterinary sector, more signi cant for vets undertaking more specialised work. Spain (Miguel LLorca, AVEE) Despite our efforts, we could not convince the Governmentand authorities to change clinical activity reduction from 'urgent treatment 'to 'compulsory or necessary attention '. Regarding the nancial impact, we cannot accurately evaluate it. It has been estimated that there was about 20% reduction, but this 'almost 'recovered during the summer. We are now very concerned about what will happen in 2021,with an inevitable deep depression predicted. Sweden (Lena Malgrem, SVF) There was a decrease in the number of patients in the beginning of the pandemic, but it returned to normal levelsafter a while. Since we did not have 'a lock down 'in Sweden, the horse owners could visit clinics and the vets were able to visit the stables, 'business as usual '. Only a few practices have been forced to close down. The bigger hospitals have had problems with the staff; that is, when people develop mild respiratory symptoms,the staff must stay at home. So, this has created much more work for the healthy staff. Some big hospitals have booked fewer patients to be able to deal with this problem, that is less pro t. It seems that the interest in horse sport has increased, that is something you can do at home, and you can be outdoors. The riding schools have been able to continue with their activities. I am working as a stud vet, and we were worried that horse owners would not cover their mares this year; however, the interest in breeding has been high. We have no 'special hygiene protocols 'for equine practice. We follow the guidelines from the authorities, that is social distancing, washing/disinfection of hands, stay at home if you have symptoms and no big crowds with people. So far, we have not seen an impact on equine health/ welfare. However, the future is uncertain. In the longer run, it might be a problem if unemployment increases, and then, it might be a problem for the horse owners to keep and pay for a horse. Switzerland (Simone Castella-Studer, SVPM) A survey was undertaken by the society of Swiss Veterinarians to understand the impact of COVID-19 in the months of March and April 2020. 63% of the practices reported a reduced turnover by 14%. This applied mostly to the small animal sector, while in the large animal sector no great difference was noticed, and in 9% there was an increase in turnover. No de nite information of the effect on mental wellbeing could be identi ed. From talks with associates and discussions with other veterinarians, we can say that vets in Switzerland have beenonly slightly affected by the coronavirus pandemic and could conduct their daily business in a relatively normal way. USA (David Frisbie, AAEP) While we did not do extensive surveying of the membership, our general sense from conversations with practitioners over the last few months was that business was impacted during the early phase of the pandemic when most of the country was on lockdown and only essential services were allowed. As we moved into summer and early fall, business seemed to somewhat rebound, and many members are reporting being as busy as they have ever been. From a mental wellness standpoint, equine practitioners have felt the impact like the rest of society, and there are challenges, particularly with parenting. The AAEP Wellness Committee has tried to bridge that gap by arranging a series of frequent 'Wellness Meet- ups 'as a forum for members to stay connected with one another and share strategies for coping with these challenges.

Hilbert School of Animal and Veterinary Sciences, Charles Sturt University, Wagga Wagga, New perforation; small intestine; wire; foreign body Summary This report describes the successful surgical management of two horses with ne wire penetration of the small intestine. The rst case was a 5-week-old Thoroughbred colt foal that was referred to the Charles Sturt University, Veterinary Clinical Centre (VCC), because it was dull and in-appetent. The colt had not recently passed faeces or responded to treatment with flunixin meglumine and a paraf n oil and electrolyte drench. On examination at the VCC, the foal was dull. Nasogastric intubation retrieved 4.5 L of re flux. Sonographic examination of the abdomen revealeddistended loops of small intestine. An abdominal radiograph revealed some metallic objects in the abdomen but interpretation of the images was challenging. An exploratory laparotomy revealed an adhesion between two adjacent loops of jejunum ( Fig 1 ). Dissection of the adhesion revealed a central focus of septic, necrotic tissueand a short length of ne wire which had perforated the jejunum. The affected area of jejunum was flushed with sterile saline and diluted 10% povidone iodine before being replaced into the abdomen and the peritoneal cavity was lavaged with warm sterile saline. The midline laparotomy incision was closed in a routine fashion. The foal made an uncomplicated recovery from the surgical procedure and as an adult horse has gone on to start in over 20 races. The second case was a 2-year-old Thoroughbred gelding that had been referred to the VCC after the referring veterinarian had detected distended loops of small intestine on examination of the abdomen per rectum. At the VCC thereferring veterinarian 'sndings were con rmed and, as the horse still had intermittent bouts of severe abdominal pain, it was decided to investigate further by exploratory laparotomy. On entering the abdomen a dense band of tissue was adhered to the cranial aspect of the midline incision ( Fig 2 ). This adhesion extended from the serosal edge of a loop of jejunum and was causing a small intestinalobstruction. A ne wire was embedded within the adhesion and this was removed. A small defect in the intestinal wallwas oversewn using 2/0 polydioxanone in a continuous Cushing pattern and the laparotomy incision was closed in routine fashion. The horse made an uncomplicated recovery and 8 months after surgery was back in race training for 8 weeks but was yet to start in a race. Key points Intestinal complications after ingestion of ne wire occur infrequently in horses and may only becomeobvious when an exploratory laparotomy is undertaken. Even in foals and small horses, current methods ofabdominal imaging are not reliable for detecting ne wire in and around the gastrointestinal tract. We report a successful outcome after ne wire penetration of the small intestine in two horses and thisis in contrast to other reported cases that have been associated with a poor prognosis.

A 1-year-old Quarter Horse gelding presented with an 8-week history of a draining sinus tract caudodorsal to the right eye. During the 8-week period prior to presentation, the wound was surgically debrided twice and the patient had beenadministered a variety of antimicrobials, NSAIDS and antifungal therapy. Given the history, physical examination and initial radiographic ndings with needle placement into the draining tract, the patient was diagnosed with achronically infected TMJ secondary to osteomyelitis. Diagnosis and surgical planning were facilitated through computed tomography (CT) ( Fig 1 ). Based on the results of the CT scan, a targeted approach via a small arthrotomy for surgicaldebridement was performed. The caudoventral aspect of the right zygomatic process of the temporal bone was debrided with a bone curette, removing multiple pieces of necrotic bone and soft tissue until healthy bone was encountered. Bacterial aerobic culture of excised bone from within the joint revealed growth of Staphylococcus aureus . Post-operatively, local and targeted debridement of the affected regions ofthe mandibular condyle and temporal bone was continued. At one-year follow-up, the patient was eating normally, pain free and back in training. This case reports the successfulmanagement of septic osteomyelitis and arthritis within a diarthrodial joint. Key points Septic osteomyelitis of the temporomandibular joint is a rare occurrence in horses. Computed tomography is a very useful diagnostictechnique in further evaluating the extent of the disease within the temporomandibular joint. This case reports the successful management of septicosteomyelitis and arthritis in the temporomandibular joint with a targeted, noninvasive arthrotomy andcurettage coupled with medical management. a) b) Fig 1: Transverse and reconstructed dorsal computed tomographic image of the skull at the level of the TMJ.

Diagnostic evaluation, including abdominal ultrasound, barium enema and proctoscopy, was suggestive of atresia coli. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a pedunculated mass in the wall of the diaphragmatic flexure of the ascending colon. The hamartoma was attached to asmaller hamartoma by a brous pedicle originating from the descending colon. The histologic features of both masseswere identical as densely packed papillary projections and cysts lined by well-differentiated colonic mucosal epithelium, supported by a layer of loose brous connective tissue and underlain by smooth muscle. These histologic features ful l all criteria of colonic hamartomas. The descending colon had intussuscepted retrograde into the ascending colon along the brous band. The lly was subjected to euthanasia due to poor prognosis ( Figs 1 and 2). Key points Congenital defects such as atresia coli/ani can mimicthe signs of impaction, but are far less common; however, congenital gastrointestinal lesions need to be considered a possible cause of colic signs in a newborn foal. Hamartomas are benign tumours originating frommature cells within the tissue of origin, which often have an abnormal distribution or overgrowth of additional cellular elements. Retrograde intussusception is the telescoping of thebowel inside itself, progressing from distal to proximal, rather than the commoner proximal to distal direction and is a rare occurrence in horses.

Educational Partners Media Partners Clinical Commentary Retrograde intussusception of the descending colon in a neonatal foal D. E. Freeman* College of Veterinary Medicine, Large Animal Clinical Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA *Corresponding author email: freemand@u fl.edu The report of a retrograde intussusception of the descending colon in a neonatal foal and the thorough review of related topics by Mejia et al . (2021) describes a highly unusual case. Small colon intussusceptions are rare in horses and are thenreported usually in post-partum broodmares, possibly related to stage 4 rectal or small colon prolapse (Ross et al . 1988). A hamartomatous polyp has been described as a cause ofsmall colon obstruction and tenesmus in a 2-day-oldStandardbred foal (Colbourne et al . 1996) but without causing an intussusception. In this report, a foal developed a reverse intussusception apparently induced by oral traction on the connecting stalkbetween two intraluminal hamartomas. Although intussusceptions are considered common in foals and can even be clinically silent (Abraham et al . 2014), young age pre-disposition for the clinical disease is far from rigid, and horses over a wide agerange can be affected ( Fig 1 ). Many intussusceptions in mature horses ( Fig 1 ) are caused by an obvious mucosal or intramural change that provides a lead point for the intussusceptum to enter the intussuscipiens in an aborad direction (Boulton and Williamson 1984). The mechanism by which the intussusception developed in this case can only be presumed, but I question whether abnormal motility was responsible (Mejia et al . 2021). The large colon of the adult horse is capable of propulsion andretropulsion, motility patterns designed to retain solid particles in the colon for microbial digestion (Sellers et al . 1979). Whether or not this mature motility pattern is established inneonatal foals is unknown, but foals can rapidly establish amicrobiome (Costa et al . 2016), which might require early development of a special motility pattern to support it.Possibly, this normal retropulsion or retrograde motility in the large colon (Sellers et al . 1979) drew on the connecting stalk orad so that the small colon was drawn into the unusualreverse intussusception. As the large colon was obstructed by the intussusception, the resulting distention could have stretched its wall and possibly applied even more oral traction on the small colon hamartoma. This process could create a vicious cycle of events, ending with an irreducible intussusception. A simpler explanation is that normal small colon peristalsis passed in an aboral direction over the tethered hamartoma in its lumen, progressively drawing more small colon in a telescoping manner into a reverse intussusception. The authors did not propose any surgical correction in this case, presumably because the intussusception was irreducible for reasons that could only be learned through hindsight (Mejia et al . 2021). Even with the bene t of hindsight, surgical options would seem limited, although somemight be worth consideration. Obviously, any such speculation about surgery cannot supersede the authors ' assessment of the prospects for a satisfactory outcome. From personal experience with obstruction of the transverse colon by brous foreign bodies in young horses (Boles and Kohn 1977), the author has treated one such case with similar challenges to the subject case (Mejia et al . 2021). In that case, a large mass of string and rubber from ingestedconveyor belt material used for paddock fencing obstructed the right dorsal colon (Boles and Kohn 1977). A segment had detached from that mass and migrated into the small colon, while retaining a string-like connection to the parent portion (Fig 2 ). The small colon was impacted by this floater fragment so that both ends of the transverse colon were rmly obstructed ( Fig 2 ). Neither the parent fragment in the right dorsal colon nor the small fragment in the small colon could be exteriorised for enterotomy. An enterotomy in the right dorsal colon oral to the large obstructing mass allowed access to the connecting cord between the impactions. Transecting that cord blindly in the lumen of the right dorsal colon with Mayo scissors released both masses so they could be removed through separate colotomies. The subject of this commentary differed from the above case by attachment of the hamartomas to the affected colon segments. One could speculate that simple transection of the connecting stalk through a small enterotomy in the wall of the large colon could be a critical step. This simple correction would allow reduction of the intussusception but would leave the two primary lesions intact in the small and large colons. In these locations, the lesions would be expected to develop concurrently with the affected organ and growth would cease when that organ had reached its adult size (Mejia et al . 2021). The risk of complications with Fig 1: An intraluminal poorly differentiated sarcoma, either transected end of ileum wasopened to display the lesions would exist as long as they were in place but only the authors were in a position to judge that risk based on their intraoperative and necropsy ndings. Resection of the hamartomas would depend on the extent of attachment of the lesions to the colon walls, and this information was not clear. Apparently, the same cord that connected the masses to each other also provided attachment to the intestinal segments (Mejia et al . 2021). In a previously reported hamartoma in the small colon of a foal,the mass was attached to the mucosa by a long slender cord (Colbourne et al . 1996) that would be amenable to transection with a haemostatic method. Such a point ofattachment in both sites would facilitate removal of the masses from the large and small colons, whereas a broader base of attachment might require a partial or complete resection and anastomosis in one or both segments. Some readers might not share the authors 'view that colic surgery in foals carries a relatively guarded prognosis (Mejia et al . 2021), based on a more recent study than those cited (MacKinnon et al . 2013). In that study, the outcome in those foals treated surgically was similar to those treated medically for different types of colic (MacKinnon et al . 2013). Colic surgery in foals can be complicated by certain comorbiditiesand such immature animals could be prone to perioperative sepsis and other diseases that could lead to a poor result, despite a successful surgery. However, the effect of these diseases on outcome might be less than expected(MacKinnon et al . 2013). Contamination is always a concern with enterotomy or enterectomy, as the authors mentioned (Mejia et al . 2021). The foal of this report was 8 hours old, which could besufcient time ex-utero to allow it to develop some microbial flora in its large intestine (Costa et al . 2016). However, this process does require time and some oral interaction with thedam and environment, which might have been limited in this case. Also, draping and packing methods can protect the adjacent serosal surfaces (Hubert et al . 2000). Possibly, other methods for surgical treatment could be effective, andconsidering these options is an exercise that could provide some direction for handling similar cases in the future.

These steps are likely to have had consequences for mentalhealth and wellbeing. Objectives :To assess the mental wellbeing of equine veterinary surgeons, equine veterinary nurses and veterinary students during the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated lockdown in the UK in June 2020. Study design :Electronic survey. Methods :The survey was run between 6 June 2020 and 14 June 2020, and consisted of 22 closed and open questions, including the 14-item scale Warwick -Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS). The questionnaire was distributedthrough email via the British Equine Veterinary Association (BEVA) membership database. Results :A total of 451 responses were received. The mean scores for the WEMWBS for veterinary surgeons, veterinary nurses and veterinary students were 47.17, 39.53 and 44.29 respectively. These compare to 48.08 and 46.38 for equine veterinary surgeons and nurses respectively in the 2019 RCVS survey of the profession. The WEMWBS results indicated lower levels of mental wellbeing in equine veterinary nurses/student veterinary nurses and veterinary students, compared to equine veterinary surgeons, as well as in furloughed equine veterinary surgeons compared to working equine veterinary surgeons. Main limitations :Risk of self-selection bias and reporting bias. Low numbers of veterinary nurse respondents. Conclusions :There were lower levels of mental wellbeing among equine veterinary surgeons and equine veterinary nursesduring the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the situation prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Equine veterinary nurses appeared to be more likely to report lower mental wellbeing than veterinary surgeons, and furloughed veterinary surgeons reported lower levels of mental wellbeing than veterinary surgeons that continued working during the lockdown.Clinical relevance Veterinary employers should be aware of the negative impact that pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have on the mental wellbeing of equine veterinary surgeons, nurses and students. Strategies to support the veterinary team, especiallyveterinary nurses, during pandemics may help to improve mental wellbeing. Restrictions to normal working practices, such as furloughing team members, can further affect their mental wellbeing, for which added support could be bene cial. Introduction COVID-19 spread rapidly around the world following its initialappearance in China in December 2019, and on 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the situation as a pandemic (World Health Organization 2020a). The rapid global spread of the disease necessitated signi cant changes to national behavioural patterns and working practices, includingself-isolating, maintenance of physical distancing ( 'social distancing ') and lockdowns (Galea et al. 2020). While these steps are critical to mitigate the spread of highly contagious diseases inimmunologically na \u20acve populations, they will likely have contributed to negative consequences for mental health andwellbeing in both the short and long term. Sudden outbreaks of disease have been associated with a higher prevalence of depression, lower mental wellbeing and other associated psychological problems (Ahmed et al . 2020; Xiang et al . 2020; Zhang et al . 2020), and the World Health Organization has also recognised that self-isolation/social distancing measures may result in people becoming more anxious, angry, stressed, agitated and withdrawn (World Health Organization (2020b)). A key risk factor for both anxiety and depression is perceived isolation (Santini et al. 2020), and social network structures, social support and participation in social activities are recognised asbeing associated with better mental wellbeing (Cornwell and Laumann 2015). It is therefore possib le that the recent restrictions placed on the UK population owing to the COVID-19 pandemicmay have had unintentional consequences on the state of mental wellbeing of the UK public (Smith et al., 2010). Mental ill-health has been shown to be prevalent in the veterinary profession, with high risk of occupational stress, burnout, poor psychological wellbeing and an elevated rate of suicide (Gardener and Hini 2006; Bartram et al . 2009; Mastenbroek et al . 2014; Volk et al . 2018). The added impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associatedstresses associated with strategies to reduce the spread of infection (including social distancing, lockdown, furloughing, etc) may have had further negative effects of the mental wellbeing of veterinary surgeons, veterinary nurses and veterinary students. The aims of this study were to assess the mental wellbeing of these \u00a92020 EVJ within the equine veterinary sector during the period of COVID-19 lockdown in the UK in June 2020. Materials and methods An online questionnaire was created using Dotdigital1 (Supplementary Item 1 ). It consisted of 22 closed and open questions, including the 14-item scale Warwick -Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS). A user licence was obtained for use of the WEMWBS (registration ID: 519329420). Participants could choose to not answer any questions, and no incentives were offered. The questions were designed to assess participants 'experiences over the previous 2 weeks; they were part of a larger survey of theimpact of COVID-19 on equine veterinary practices thatwas launched on 6 June 2020 and closed on 14 June 2020. The questionnaire was distributed through email via the British Equine Veterinary Association (BEVA) membership database and was open to veterinary surgeons, veterinary nurses, veterinary students and practice administrators/ managers. Data analysis This article focuses on a sub-selection of the respondents ' data.

For comparison of results within the current study and with those of the 2019 survey of the veterinary profession, the sum of the frequencies of 'none of the time 'and 'rarely 'responses and the sum of the frequencies of 'often' and 'all of the time' responses were calculated for equine veterinary surgeons and equine veterinary nurses. Comparisons of the results of the current survey between veterinary surgeons and veterinary nurses, and between veterinary surgeons who were still working (full-time or part-time) and veterinary surgeons who had been furloughed were also undertaken. Chi-squareor, where appropriate, Fisher Exact tests and two proportionstests were conducted using Minitab 18.1 2.

The overall mean score for the WEMWBS for the veterinary surgeons in the current survey was 47.17; thiscompares to 48.08 in the 2019 survey of the profession results for veterinary surgeons (RCVS 2019). The overall mean score for the WEMWBS for the equine veterinary nurses/student veterinary nurses in the current survey was 39.53; this compares to 46.38 in the 2019 survey of the profession results for equine veterinary nurses (RCVS 2019). The overall mean score for the WEMWBS for the veterinary students in the current survey was 44.29; there were no available data for veterinary students prior to COVID-19 to compare with. A comparison of the results of the WEMWBS for veterinary surgeons in the current survey with the results for equine veterinary surgeons from the 2019 survey of the profession (RCVS 2019) is summarised in Table 1 . The chi-square test showed signi cant differences between the sums of the numbers of responders answering 'none of the time 'or 'rarely' to those responding 'often 'or 'all of the time 'for the two surveys for 9 of the 14 WEMWBS items. The two proportions test showed signi cant differences in the proportions of respondents answering 'often' and 'all of the time 'between the two surveys for 8 items, and signi cant differences in the proportions of respondents answering'rarely' and 'none of the time 'for 8 WEMWBS items (6 items had signi cant differences in both of the two proportions test results). A comparison of the results of the WEMWBS for veterinary nurses/student veterinary nurses in the current survey with theresults for equine veterinary nurses from the 2019 survey of the profession (RCVS 2019) is summarised in Table 2 .

The Fisher exact test showed signi cant differences between the numbers of responders answering 'none of the time 'or 'rarely 'to those responding 'often 'or 'all of the time 'for the veterinary surgeons and veterinary nurses/student veterinary nurses for 7 of the items. A comparison of the results of the WEMWBS for veterinary surgeons working in the previous two weeks and veterinary surgeons who were furloughed in the previous two weeks is shown in Table 4 . The chi-square test showed signi cant differences between the numbers of responders answering'none of the time 'or 'rarely' to those responding 'often 'or 'all of the time 'for the veterinary surgeons and veterinary nurses/student veterinary nurses for 7 of the items. Discussion The results of this study indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdown and related strategies to reduce the spread of COVID-19 (such as social distancing and furloughing) have had negative effects on the mental wellbeing of equine veterinarians and equine veterinary nurses, as assessed by comparison of the WEMWBS scores of the current survey and those of the 2019 survey of the profession (RCVS 2019). This is perhaps not surprising since the UK population has not been exposed to this type of pandemic or required to undertake such drastic public health control measures in modern history. In addition, our results imply lower levels of mental wellbeing during the COVID-19 lockdown in equine veterinary nurses/student veterinary nurses and veterinary students, compared toTABLE 4: Results of the 14 items of the WEMWBS for veterinary surgeons who were working compared with veterinary surgeons who were furloughed WEMWBS ItemsWorking veterinary surgeons Furloughed veterinary surgeons Chi-square veterinarysurgeons versusfurloughedveterinary 'Number ofrespondentsanswering'often 'and 'all of the time ' I've been feeling optimistic about the future 56 124 15 7 0.001 I've been feeling useful 5 227 26 6 <0.001 I've been feeling relaxed 128 63 15 10 NS I've been feeling interested in other people 26 158 6 20 NS I've been dealing with problems well 15 172 7 15 0.003 I've had energy to spare 148 77 11 17 0.006 I've been thinking clearly 16 200 5 20 NS I've been feeling good about myself 49 113 12 10 0.02 I've been feeling close to other people 74 118 17 13 NS I've been feeling con dent 51 148 20 8 <0.001 I've been able to make up my mind about things18 200 13 14 <0.001 I've been feeling loved 33 186 4 29 NS I've been interested in new things 86 122 10 19 NS I've been feeling cheerful 50 122 7 15 NS NS, not signi cant. \u00a92020 EVJ Ltd21 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2021equine veterinary surgeons, as well as lower levels of mental wellbeing in furloughed equine veterinary surgeons compared to working equine veterinary surgeons. The World Health Organization describes positive mental health (which is frequently used interchangeably with the term mental wellbeing) as being 'the foundation for wellbeing and effective functioning for both the individualand the community 'and de ned it as a state 'which allows individuals to realise their abilities, cope with the normalstresses of life, work productively and fruitfully and make a contribution to their community '(World Health Organization 2004). The 14-item WEMWBS was developed to enable themonitoring of mental wellbeing at a population level (Tennant et al . 2007; Fat et al . 2017). The scale estimates mental wellbeing both in terms of feeling good andfunctioning well and has been validated for use in the veterinary profession (Bartram et al . 2011). Individual items are scored on a Likert scale from 1 (none of the time) to 5 (all ofthe time), and a total score is calculated by summing the 14 item scores (the minimum score is therefore 14 and the maximum is 70). The WEMWBS does not a have a precise 'cut off'level to divide the population into those who have 'good 'and those who have 'poor 'mental wellbeing. However, some studies have suggested that a mean scorebelow 41-44 corresponds to possible depression, and 60 and above can be used to identify the top 15% of scores, indicating high mental wellbeing (Bianco 2012). Scores between 43 and 59 have been used to denote averagemental wellbeing in other studies (Ahmed et al . 2020). In the present study, the mean total scores for equine veterinarysurgeons and veterinary students fell within this range for 'average 'mental wellbeing, whereas the scores for equine veterinary nurses fell into the 'possible depression 'group. However, these results must be interpreted with extreme caution because of the very low numbers of respondents, especially for equine veterinary nurses/student veterinary nurses, and the associated risk of signi cant bias in the results. Furthermore, detailed research into this area would berequired before any rm conclusions can be reached. There is a limited body of literature to which one can refer to inform effective policy and practice in order to support the emotional wellbeing alongside the reduction in risk of exposure to contagion (Smith et al., 2010). To the best of our knowledge, this is the rst study that has addressed the impact of COVID-19 on the mental wellbeing of veterinary surgeons. Several studies around the world have used the WEMWBS (in addition to other tools) to document negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and wellbeing of the general public (Smith et al . 2010; Rolland et al . 2020), and higher rates of anxiety, depression, alcohol use disorder, and lower mental wellbeing in the general population during the COVID-19 epidemic have been reported in several countries (Ahmed et al . 2020). Findings of the current study should be interpreted in light of its limitations. Firstly, there may have been self-selection bias in this online survey, with those people with poorer mental wellbeing more likely to complete the survey. Secondly, the participants were asked to self-report on their mental wellbeing, potentially introducing reporting bias. Furthermore, the current survey and the 2019 survey of the veterinary profession (RCVS 2019) were distributed in differentways, so they may not have targeted precisely the same population of veterinary surgeons and nurses. There were alsovery small numbers of veterinary nurses responding to the survey. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate lower levels of mental wellbeing among equine veterinary surgeons and equine veterinary nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the situation prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The reasons for this have not been elucidated but might include fear of getting ill or family and friends getting ill, feelings of social isolation due to lockdown measures, anxiety about the viability of veterinary businesses going forwards, and the potential effects of the pandemic on the economy in general. Equine veterinary nurses appeared to be more likely to report low mental wellbeing than veterinary surgeons. In addition, furloughed veterinary surgeons reported lower levels of mental wellbeing than veterinary surgeons that continued working during the lockdown. Interventions to improve mental wellbeing and ensure emotional safety should focus on these groups during the current COVID-19 pandemic and in similar scenarios in the future.

B. Martabano, M. de Linde Henriksen* and C. C. Powell Department of Clinical Sciences, Comparative Ophthalmology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA*Corresponding ulcerative keratomycosis is relatively commonly presented to teaching hospitals in North America, with a prevalence from 24 to 86%. Horses in Colorado may have lower risk due to the dry mountain climate, but data are lacking. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of ulcerative keratomycosis amongst horses with ulcerative keratitis presented to Colorado State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital (CSU-VTH) ophthalmology service and to evaluate environmental factors (season, temperature, humidity, wind speed and elevation) associated with ulcerative keratomycosis in Colorado. A database search identi ed horses with ulcerative keratitis presented to the ophthalmology service at CSU-VTH from January 2002 toAugust 2017. Sixty-one horses met the inclusion criteria of a corneal cytology and/or culture or histopathology at the time of diagnosis; cases lacking that were excluded. Environmental factors at the boarding sites, including season,temperature, humidity, wind speed and elevation and clinical outcomes for fungal cases, were recorded. Prevalence of fungal infection amongst equine ulcerative keratitis was CSU-VTH has considerably fewer ulcerative keratomycosis cases than other veterinary teaching hospitals in North America. Spring (50%, 5/10) and fall (40%, 4/10) had the highest prevalence of fungal ulcerative keratitis in Colorado. Only one case was reported in summer (10%, 1/10); no horses were positive (0%, 0/10) in winter. Only wind speed seemed to infl uence the development of ulcerative keratomycosis with higher windspeeds associated with greater rates of fungal involvement (P=0.047). Other environmental factors did not show a detectable association (all P-values >0.05). Outcomes were variable. It was concluded that horses from the area of CSU- VTH appear to be at lower risk for ulcerative keratomycosis than from the areas around other North American veterinary teaching hospitals that have reported data. Most horses with keratomycosis in this area present in the spring and fall. Introduction The published prevalence of fungal involvement in equine ulcerative keratitis in the United States varies by institution, with three veterinary schools reporting data to date (Moore et al. 1983; Moore et al. 1995; Andrew et al. 1998; Utter et al. 2009; Gilger 2013). Keratomycosis appears to be most common in the southeastern United States, with the highestpublished prevalence at the University of Florida at 84.6% (33/39) of equine ulcerative keratitis cases having evidence of fungal infection (Andrew et al. 1998). The lowest prevalence was previously reported by the University of Pennsylvania at24% (10/41) (Utter et al. 2009). University of Missouri indicated ulcerative keratomycosis in 38 -43% of their equine ulcerative keratitis cases (Moore et al. 1995). Keratomycosis (ulcerative and stromal abscess) generallypresents seasonally, dependent upon geographic location. In the northeastern United States, horses with ulcerative keratomycosis predominantly present during the summer and early fall (Gaarder et al. 1998; Utter et al. 2010; Ledbetter et al. 2013), while in southeastern regions, keratomycosis is more frequent in late fall to winter or without seasonal effects (Coad et al. 1985; Andrew et al. 1998; Proietto et al. 2016). Seasonal presentation is suspected to be related tofluctuations in temperature and humidity (Henriksen et al. 2014a; Proietto et al. 2016). To the authors 'knowledge, the risk for keratomycosis in horses living at higher elevations anddrier climates of the western part of United States such as Colorado has not been evaluated. Environmental studies demonstrate that moisture (humidity) and moderate temperatures (15 to 40 \u00b0C) promote fungal growth, while low humidity and extreme temperature changes have inhibitoryeffects (Talley et al. 2002). High elevation speci cally has not been implicated as a factor reducing fungal growth (Weir1918; Talley et al. 2002; Meier et al. 2010), and in one study, a positive correlation was found between elevation andenvironmental fungal growth (Talley et al. 2002). We are unaware of studies examining fungal growth at differentelevations and risk of infection. No studies have evaluated the prevalence of ulcerative keratomycosis in horses from northern Colorado. This retrospective study was performed to evaluate the prevalence of ulcerative keratomycosis in horses presented to the Colorado State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital (CSU-VTH) ophthalmology service and to describe the correlation with season, temperature, humidity, wind speed and elevation. Age differences between ulcerative keratomycosis versus non-fungal related ulcerative keratitis, as well as treatment plan and clinical outcome for horses with ulcerative keratomycosis presented to CSU-VTH were also evaluated and compared with data from other veterinary teaching hospitals. Since CSU-VTH is located in northern Colorado (Fort Collins), 1500 metres above sea level with a dry climate compared to other reported localities, we \u00a92019 EVJ keratomycosis at CSU-VTH be lower than that reported at veterinary teaching hospitals in other areas of the United States. Materials and methods This was a retrospective descriptive study. Medical recordsfrom equine cases presented to the ophthalmology service at CSU-VTH were electronically searched from January 2002 to August 2017. To be included in the study, horses were required to have a complete ophthalmic examination performed by the ophthalmology service at CSU-VTH and a clinical diagnosis of 'corneal ulceration' or 'ulcerative keratitis '. Horses with accessible results for corneal cytology and/or corneal culture (aerobic, anaerobic and/or fungal)and/or histopathology (enucleation or keratectomy) in the medical record were included; all diagnostic tests were not performed in all cases. Cytology evaluation was performed either by the clinical pathology service at CSU-VTH, the ophthalmologist (board-certi ed) or the ophthalmology resident on the case. Diff-quick stain 1was used for cytology samples stained and analysed by the ophthalmology service, whereas Giemsa stain2was used for samples submitted to the clinical pathology service. Culture samples were submittedto CSU Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratories (CSU-VDL) and analysed by the Bacteriology Laboratory. Corneal tissue samples collected from surgical cases were submitted in formalin 10% solution 2and processed by the pathology laboratory at The histopathology samples werestained with Haematoxylin Silver stain2to look for fungal organisms. The histopathology were evaluated by board-certi ed anatomic pathologists at CSU-VDL. Data collected from each record included signalment, age of thehorse, previous treatment, date of presentation associated with ulcer diagnosis, boarding location, cytology and/or culture results, medication regimen, clinical outcome and date of outcome. Outcome for horses with ulcerative keratomycosis was categorised as 1) healed with medical therapy alone, 2) surgical correction (keratectomy and conjunctival graft versus enucleation) after failure of medical therapy or 3) unknown if the case was lost to follow-up. Excluded from the study were horses presented to CSU-VTH 'corneal ulceration 'or examination by theophthalmology service or diagnostic tests, such as cytology,culture or histopathology. Environmental factors The following data were obtained: (1) date of presentation toestablish the season as follows; spring (March, April and May), summer (June, July and August), fall (September, October and November) and winter (December, January and February); (2) The average temperature (Celsius) for the month of presentation; (3) The ambient humidity (%) for the month of presentation; (4) Average wind speed (m/s) for the month of presentation; and (5) Elevation (metres) for the location of the weather station from which environmental data were collected. The Weather Underground online database was used as the source of the environmental data. The date of presentation and zip code for the location of the housing facility of the horse were used as the search criteria on the Weather Underground homepage 4.Data analysis The age, sex and breed of each horse were recorded. Median /C6standard deviation (s.d.) and range for age were calculated for horses with ulcerative keratomycosis and non-fungal related ulcerative keratitis keratitis was calculated. keratitis, and non-infected ulcerative keratitis, and the prevalence of each were determined. The mean /C6s.d. for the environmental factors of temperature, humidity, windspeed and elevation were calculated for ulcerative keratomycosis and non-fungal related ulcerative keratitis. The seasonal occurrence for each condition was characterised. Excel Microsoft was used to characterise the descriptive data. The Mann -Whitney U test was used to identify differences between the ages of each group and differencesbetween the environmental factors for ulcerative keratomycosis versus non-fungal related ulcerative keratitis. A signi cance level of 0.05 was used for test of differences (P<0.05 was deemed signi cant). Results Nine-hundred and thirty- ve horses were examined by the CSU-VTH ophthalmology service from 2002 to 2017. Two- hundred and forty-two case records were reviewed based on the search terms of corneal ulceration and ulcerative keratitis. Sixty-one cases t the total inclusion criteria, including 26 mares, 32 geldings and 3 stallions. The followingbreeds were represented: Quarter Horse (n =24), Thoroughbred (n =10), Appaloosa (n =7), American Paint horse (n =8), Fox Trotter (n =3), Pony (n =2), Mule (n =1), Miniature horse, Arabian (n =1), Fjord horse (n =1) and undocumented breeds (n =4). Mean /C6s.d. for the age (in years) of ulcerative keratomycosis cases was 13 /C68 years and for non-fungal related ulcerative keratitis cases was 11/C68 years, which were not statistically signi cantly different (P =0.490). Ten of 61 horses (16.4%, 10/61) were diagnosed with ulcerative keratomycosis, three of which were co-infectedwith bacteria (4.9%, 3/61). prevalence of in 87% of cases (53/61). Nine out of the 10 horses (90%) that were diagnosed with ulcerative keratomycosis in this study were positive for fungal hyphae ontheir cytology ( Table 1 ). Bacterial culture was performed in 46% of cases (28/61), with positive growth in 71% (20/28).Fungal culture was performed in 20% of cases growth in 16% ulcerative keratitis one case (1/61, 1.6%).

Outcome for the 10 horses with ulcerative keratomycosis follows: were lost to follow-up (3/10). Three of the four cases (75%) that healed received medical and surgical \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd25 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2021treatment (keratectomy followed by a conjunctival graft placement), while one received only medical treatment (25%, 1/4). The three horses that were enucleated received no medical treatment at CSU-VTH except for post- enucleation treatment. The owners of these horses elected enucleation after the initial ophthalmic examination due to nancial concerns and a poor prognosis for healing without aggressive medical treatment and likely surgery. Signalment,cytology results, culture results, treatment and outcome for the 10 fungal ulcerative keratomycosis horses are detailed in Table 1 .The seasonal presentation of all ulcerative keratitis horses was as follows No differences were found between the groups for any environmental factor in the spring season (temperature;TABLE 1: Fungal equine ulcerative keratitis (EUK) cases and amnion to graft dehiscenceHealed 7 saline 5% ophthalmic solution, Bausch & USA Neopolybac (Neomycin-Polymyxin B- Bacitracin) ophthalmic ointment, & Alcon, Fort Worth, Texas, USA Serum, horse itself Fluconazole $$Atropine 1% ophthalmic solution, Bausch & Lomb, New Jersey, USA \u00b6\u00b6Oral doxycycline 100 mg tablets, Alvogen, Pine Brook, New Jersey, USA ***Oral flunixin meglumine 1500 mg paste, Merck, Kenilworth, New Jersey, USA Voriconazole 1% ophthalmic solution, Stokes compounding pharmacy, Mt Laurel, New Jersey, USA Oral fluconazole 100 mg tablets, P zer, New York, New York, USA $$$SSD (Silver Sulfadiazine 1% Cream), Dr. Reddy 's laboratories, Princeton, New Jersey, USA \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd26 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION and elevation; P =0.465). No P-values could be calculated for summer, fall and winter because of insuf cient numbers of keratomycosis cases in those seasons. When all seasonal data were added together in a cumulative analysis, there was a signi cant difference in wind speed (P =0.047), with the ulcerative keratomycosis horses being associated with areas ofhigher wind speed compared to all other ulcerative keratitis horses in this study. No other differences could be found between the groups for environmental conditions (temperature; P=0.535, humidity; P =0.542 and elevation; P =0.289). Discussion This study evaluated the prevalence of fungal infection amongst equine ulcerative keratitis cases presented to CSU- VTH 's ophthalmology service over a 15-year period. The historical clinical impression was of relatively low rates offungal infection; however, data were lacking for objective evaluation. The prevalence of fungal involvement in equine ulcerative keratitis at veterinary teaching hospitals has been reported by the University of Florida at 84.6% (Andrew et al. 1998), the University of Pennsylvania 's New Bolton Center at 24% (Utter et al. 2009) and the University of Missouri at 43% in 1983 (Moore et al. 1983) and 38% in 1995 (Moore et al. 1995). In our study, the prevalence of 16.4% at CSU-VTH is considerably lower than the three other veterinary teaching hospitals 'reported data. We also found that ulcerative keratomycosis cases constituted only 1.1% of the equine ophthalmology patientspresented to the CSU-VTH during the study period. This also is lower than other veterinary teaching hospitals, which have reported a range from 2 to 8.62% (Peiffer 1979; McLaughlinet al. 1992; al. 1998; Gal /C19anet al. 2009; Reed et al. 2013). Reviewing the literature, the University of California-Davis had the lowest prevalence at 2% of their equine ophthalmology cases presenting with ulcerative keratomycosis (Reed et al. 2013) whereas the University of Cordoba (Spain) had the highest prevalence at 8.62% (Gal /C19an et al. 2009). California and Colorado both have a dry climate, whereas Cordoba, Spain is known for its high temperaturesand humidity 4. Proietto and colleagues evaluated environmental risk factors for 390 cases of equine deep stromal abscesses presented to the University of Florida (Proietto et al. 2016). Deep stromal abscesses are a form of non-ulcerative keratitis inhorses with likely fungal aetiology (Henriksen et al. 2014b). The Proietto et al. study found a positive correlation between horses presented with deep stromal abscess and high wind speed, whereas they did not nd any association between deep stromal abscess and temperature or humidity (Proiettoet al. 2016). Our study also found a correlation between wind speed and ulcerative keratomycosis. Higher wind speed willincrease the risk of flying material, potentially containing hyphae, that could traumatise the cornea, thereby increasingthe risk for ulcerative keratomycosis. It should therefore be recommended to collect cytology samples as well as performing aerobic and fungal cultures from ulcerative keratitis lesions diagnosed following high winds or a storm in Colorado or any other areas with risk of fungal infection; presumptive treatment with a topical antifungal medicationsuch as voriconazole 1% ophthalmic solution may be warranted while awaiting test results. We found that ulcerative keratomycosis most commonly presents to CSU-VTH in the spring and fall, with no cases presented in the winter months. The effect of season on the presentation of keratomycosis (ulcerative and non-ulcerative/ stromal abscesses) cases has been evaluated in multiple studies (Coad et al. 1985; Barton 1992; Grahn et al. 1993; Andrew et al. Andrew et al. 2003; Gal /C19anet al. 2009; Henriksen et al. 2014a). In the southeastern United States, the prevalence of equine keratomycosis is lowest in the summerand more prevalent in the winter and spring (Coad et al. 1985; Andrew et al. 1998; Henriksen et al. 2014b; Proietto et al. 2016), while more temperate northern regions see an increase in keratomycosis cases in the late summer and fall (Gaarder et al. 1998; Utter et al. 2009; Ledbetter et al. 2013; Sherman et al. 2017). Soil temperatures of 25 -30 degrees Celsius are ideal for bacterial and fungal growth in soil (Pietik \u20acainen et al. 2005). Fungal growth is impaired at higher temperatures, moreso than bacteria (Pietik \u20acainen et al. 2005). This effect of temperature on fungal and bacterial growth ts with the typical seasonal pattern of ulcerative keratitis cases /C0with fewer cases in the summer in the south and more cases in thenorth. At CSU-VTH, the overall prevalence of ulcerative keratitis cases was highest in the summer (35%, 21/61) and fall (36%, 22/ 61), whereas the ulcerative keratomycosis cases tended to present in the spring (50%, 5/10) and fall (40%, 4/10). The fungal presentation at CSU-VTH ts with optimal local temperature and humidity parameters for fungal growth for the area ofCSU-VTH (Pietik \u20acainen et al. 2005). Considering temperature, humidity, wind speed and elevation in the 'All cases 'group (Fig 2 ), temperature is lower, but wind speed seems to be higher in the winter. This is not surprising since CSU-VTH is located at the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and winters in the Rockies are associated with cold weather and snowstorms.TABLE 2: Bacterial and fungal culture isolates Bacterial isolatesNumber of cases with positive growth onculture (n) Streptococcus zooepidemicus 9 Non-haemolytic 1 Streptococcus constillatu 1 Alpha haemolytic Streptococcus 1 No growth 8 Total 34 Fungal isolatesNumber of cases withpositive growth onculture (n) Aspergillus species 1 Cladosporium species fungus 1 Total 3 \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd27 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2021Difculties with transportation could also depress the case load and result in low numbers of ulcerative keratitis presentations during the winter months (total n =5). Andrew et al. (2003) evaluated the conjunctival flora in a herd of horses from Florida and determined that fungus was found at the highest frequency during the fall and winter months, which correlated to the time of year when most fungal cases present to equine hospitals in the southern United States (Andrew et al. 2003). Other factors, such as housing (pasture vs. stall), have been evaluated, and there is a signi cant increase of fungal organisms in the conjunctiva of horses housed in stalls (Whitley et al. 1983; Moore et al. 1988; Rosa et al. 2003). A future study of normal conjunctival flora in horses from the area around CSU-VTH may further elucidate differences in prevalence of bacterial and fungal agents amongst infectious ulcerative keratitis and potentially account for the decreased prevalence of fungal infection. Future climate changes and their impact on the prevalence of ulcerative keratomycosis in horses from the area around CSU-VTH should also be considered. We would be interested in repeating our retrospective study in 10 years to see if the climate changes have had an impact on infectious agents in horses presented to CSU-VTH with infectious ulcerative keratitis. Of the 10 horses with fungal ulcerative keratitis presented to CSU-VTH, only one resolved with medical therapy ( Table 1 ). Three horses were enucleated due to the severity of their ulcerative keratomycosis; three horses had keratectomy and conjunctival graft performed subsequent to failure of medicaltherapy; and three horses were lost to follow-up. Theoutcome of ulcerative keratomycosis varies but is generally good, with early aggressive and appropriate medical treatment with topical antifungal medication. Positive outcomes for healing and retention of vision with topicalantifungal medication have been reported to be as high as 89-100% (Andrew et al. 1998; Utter et al. 2010). Our study showed a poor recovery rate for the ulcerative keratomycosiscases presented to CSU-VTH when only medical a) b) c) d) Fig 1: Four equine infectious ulcerative keratitis cases. a) a horse with ulcerative keratomycosis encompassing 60% of the corneal surface.

Fungal hyphae were found with cytology. b) another horse with ulcerative keratomycosis with an ulcer in the axialaspect of the cornea incorporating 20% of the corneal surface. The ulcer is surrounded by a 3 mm halo of cellular in ltration. Only mild corneal vascularisation is in ltrating the cornea from the dorsal limbus. The pupil is dilated due to atropine treatment.

The ulcer is located in the ventral aspect of the cornea taking up 30% of the corneal surface. The ulcer has severe cellular in ltration and keratomalacia (melting). Corneal vascularisation can be appreciated in the dorsal aspect of the cornea. d) a horse with infectiousulcerative keratitis culture positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis (Coagulase Negative Staph). The ulcer is located in the temporal aspect of the cornea taking up 30% of the corneal surface. The ulcer has severe cellular in ltration and has 20% stromal loss with a dark central aspect -indicating loss of tissue and risk of perforation.

Notice that the winter months have a noteworthy low number ofulcerative keratitis cases presented to CSU-VTH, and noulcerative keratomycosis cases were presented in the wintermonths in this time period. \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd28 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2021management was used, but the data should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size of ulcerative keratomycosis cases in our study. It could be speculated that no treatment with a topical antifungal medication such as voriconazole 1% prior to presentation at CSU-VTH could be the underlying cause for the poor outcome of the ulcerative keratomycosis horses in our study. A general belief amongst general equine practitioners that keratomycosis in horses is a rare condition in northern Colorado could potentially be the reason why general practitioners choose not to start complicated corneal ulceration cases on an antifungal medication. This study shows that keratomycosis can also occur in horses in this region and fungal infection should be considered when a horse has an infected corneal ulcer, especially in the spring and fall months and/or after a severe storm or high wind speeds. Diagnostic tests such as cytology and culture, as well as topical antifungal medication, are recommended for these horses. Conclusion The prevalence of ulcerative keratomycosis in horses presented to CSU-VTH is considerably less than reported by other veterinary teaching hospitals. Spring and fall are the most common seasons for horses to present with ulcerative keratomycosis at CSU-VTH, and there seems to be a low risk for ulcerative keratomycosis in the winter months. Keratomycosis should be considered in horses with ulcerative keratitis following a severe storm or high wind speeds. Authors 'declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

Imaging techniques play a crucial role in the diagnostic work-up of head disorders. Tomographic imaging methods, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are particularly useful in avoiding problems associated with superimposition of multiple structures in this highly complex region. Both techniques are becoming more widely available in equine medicine. However, the choice between CT and MRI for imaging the equine head is not always straightforward. Each modality has advantages and disadvantages in terms of practicality, costs and diagnostic value for particular problems. The aim of this review is to describe the application of CT and MRI for imaging the equine head and to provide a practical guide for their use in different anatomical structures and clinical indications. This should allow the equine practitioner to make an informeddecision on which modality to choose. Introduction The equine head anatomy is highly complex, comprising parts of the respiratory, alimentary and nervous systems, in addition to musculoskeletal structures, con ned in a relatively small space (K\u20aconig and Liebich 2010). Therefore, many different disorders of potentially major clinical importance can affect the head and result in a wide range of clinical signs, making the diagnosis of these conditions often challenging. Information obtained from physical examination is often insuf cient to reach a conclusive diagnosis, hence the valuable role of diagnostic imagingtechniques (Tucker and Farrell 2001; Lane 2013). Advanced imaging modalities, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have become more widely available in equine referral institutions. Both modalities are tomographic techniques, producing a stack of image slices and thus avoiding superimposition of structures, which is the major limitation of traditional radiography. The aim of this article is to provide a review of the use and main indications of MRI and CT for imaging the horse 's head. Basic principles Computed tomography and MRI are based on fundamentally very different technical principles and both have their advantages and disadvantages.Computed tomography Computed tomography is an x-ray-based technique, wherean x-ray tube is arranged across multiple detectors within the circle of a CT gantry. This arrangement rotates around the patient while sending out a narrow slice of x-rays whilst the patient is moved through the gantry (in some set-ups the gantry is moved in relation to the patient). This produces a volume of data that gets reconstructed into a stack of thin cross-sectional slices in transverse plane ( Fig 1 ). Being a volume however, data can be displayed in whichever planeusing post-processing multiplanar reconstruction software on the workstation or remotely on any off-line computer equipped with medical imaging viewing software (DICOM viewer). Similar to radiographs, different structures appear in varying shades of grey on the resulting image based on their radiodensity (i.e. degree of beam attenuation). On CT, this degree of attenuation can be quanti ed using Houns eld Units (HU), which has water as a reference value of 0 HU. Unlike radiographs, CT has the added advantage that each pixel has its own density value, which is not affected by the summation of densities through superimposition or the thickness of the tissue as is the case in radiography. The use of different post-processing lters or windows makes it possible to 'enhance 'speci c tissues and match their attenuation values to the available shades of grey of the computer monitor (256). Most acquisitions are reconstructed at minimum in a 'bone window 'and a 'soft tissue window ' (Fig 1 ). Computed tomography of the equine head can be performed either with the horse under general anaesthesia orwith the horse standing (usually under sedation; Fig 2 (Barbee et 2011; Dakin 2014; Porter and Werpy 2014). Two different CT set-ups are used for scanning in standingposition: either the horse moves in relation to the static CT gantry with the help of an air skate mounted platform or the CT gantry moves in relation to the patient (Saunders et al. 2011; Dakin et al. 2014; Porter and Werpy 2014). In both scenarios the gantry opening has to be adjusted to the horse 's height either by elevating the CT in relation to the horse or lowering thehorse in relation to the CT. Magnetic resonance imaging Magnetic resonance imaging images are the result of the stimulation of magnetised tissues by radio waves and capturing the returning radio waves from the stimulated tissues. Depending on the type of emitted radio wave (duration, \u00a92019 EVJ images at the level of the second maxillary cheek teeth (07s) (a,b) and the orbit (c,d) using bone (a,c) and soft tissue (b,d) windows. a) b)c) d) Fig 2: Positioning of the horse for performing a computed tomography examination of the head under general anaesthesia in standing position (c,d). \u00a92019 VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2021phase, frequency) and the time at which the returning wave is captured, different sequences can be obtained. The sequences selected for head examinations in horses usually follow the protocols used in small animals, including T2- weighted, T1-weighted, fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR), T2 *-weighted echo (GRE) and single- tau inversion recovery (STIR) ( Fig 3 ). Depending on the selected sequence, different tissues appear in different shadesof grey based on their molecular composition. This results in a high contrast resolution (ability to differentiate tissue types) which represents the main advantage of MRI. Besides different sequences, MRI studies usually include several different acquisition planes, including transverse, dorsal and sagittal planes ( Fig 4 ). A separate acquisition is needed for each different sequence, as well as for each different plane, makingMRI studies considerably more time-consuming than CT acquisitions. Computed tomography scanning times are around 30 -60 s, depending on the parameters used, with a set-up time of around 15 min for a standing scan. On thecontrary, each MRI sequence lasts approximately 3 -5 min. A basic, routine, MRI examination therefore takes at least 40 - 50 min (set-up time of 10 -15 min). Equine head MRI examinations can only be performed with the horse anaesthetised ( Fig 5 ) (Kraft and Gavin 2001; Tucker and Farrell 2001; Werpy 2007; Murray 2011). Correctpositioning of the horse in the MRI gantry can be challenging in short-necked, large horses, as well as in very small horses. The main measurements to consider when planningperforming a head MRI in a horse include the length of the neck and the distance between the shoulders. This limitation is a big issue when imaging the brain, where in someinstances the caudal aspect of the cerebellum and medullaoblongata may not be included in the eld of view ( Fig 6 ) (Tucker and Holmes 2011). The use of contrast media in the equine head Further enhancement of structures can be achieved by using contrast media in both modalities. Contrast-enhanced images provide better tissue delineation and differentiation, thereby improving diagnostic capabilities ( Fig 7 ). Iodinated nonionic contrast media are the most commonly used in CT,while organic chelates of gadolinium are used in MRI (Nelson et al. 2017). These media can be administered intravenously or intra-arterially, depending on the application. The recommended intravenous dose of iodinated (I) contrast for CT is 600- 880 mg I/kg bodyweight and gadolinium for MRI is 0.01 mmol/kg body weight, which in a 500 kg standard adulthorse would signi cantly increase the costs of the procedure. Minimising the volume of contrast administered is desirable toreduce cost. The use of an intra-arterial route in CT studies allows administration of a low-dose of contrast in a targeted area, which represents less than 50% of the intravenous dose. Studies have shown similar degrees of soft tissue enhancement compared with systemic intravenous administration (Carmalt and Montgomery 2015; Crijns et al. 2016). In MRI, different doses have been described in the literature based on empirical experiences(Ferrell et al. 2002; Werpy 2007; Judy 2011). Halving the dose to 0.005 mmol/kg body weight resulted in similar subjective lesiondetection compared to the full dose and has therefore been proposed as an appropriate dose in clinical settings (Saveraid and Judy 2012). a) b)c) d) Fig 3: Comparison of different transverse magnetic resonance sequences of the head at the level of the temporomandibular joint. a) T2-weighted; b) T1-weighted; c) / JANUARY 2021Costs implications Both imaging modalities are substantially more expensive than, for example, radiographs. Performing a procedure under general anaesthesia carries a considerable increase in costs due to the anaesthesia itself, but also due to the additional expenses of hospitalisation and the length of the procedure. The purchase cost of CT and MRI scanners differs as well, with MRI scanners generally being more expensive to buy, to install and maintain. Due to the need for general anaesthesia, duration of examination, duration of hospitalisation and equipment overheads, MRI examinations are generally more expensive than CT examinations. Choice of MRI or CT for the equine head The choice between CT and MRI for imaging the equine head is not always straightforward. A tentative clinicaldiagnosis based on a thorough clinical examination is paramount in deciding which modality may be the most useful. Other considerations, such as the risk of general anaesthesia, nances and logistics, will also in fluence the decision. Imaging of the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses Radiographic diagnosis of disorders of the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses in the horse is challenging due to the anatomical complexity of this region and the inherent lack of soft tissue contrast. In some cases, no radiographic abnormalities can be detected at all or pathologies cannot be differentiated since their radiographic features are very similar. A recent study described low to moderate sensitivityfor radiographic identi cation of sinusal disease c)d) e) f) Fig 4: T2-weighted magnetic resonance images of the head at the level of the brain (a- c) and the nasal passages (d -f) on sagittal / JANUARY 2021et al. 2015b). Depending on the sinus affected, it can however yield a high speci city. The lowest sensitivity using radiographs was seen in and CT can show the different sinuscompartments and their anatomical variations in great detail thanks to the tomographic characteristics of the images they produce (Arencibia et al. 2000; Smallwood et al. 2013; 2014; Tucker et al. 2016). Therefore, identi cation of individual sinus involvement can be better performed using eithertomographic technique. Magnetic resonance imaging is superior to CT for soft tissue structures depiction, such as mucosal lining or the nasal plexus, especially on T2-weighted images; whereas CT produces images of high quality of thethin osseous walls of the paranasal sinuses (Kaminsky et al. 2016) and provides very high detail of the anatomy of thenasal conchae and their bullae (Kaminsky and 2016).Mild alterations mucosal lining of the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses may represent the only nding of sinusitis and they are only visible with MRI or CT unlike radiology. These alterations are characterised bythickening of the mucosa, changes in signal intensity in T2- weighted images on MRI and mild enhancement after contrast injection (Manso-D /C19az et al. 2015b). Computed tomography might then be in cases of subtle lysis ofthe thin sinusal bony walls, which is typically sinusitis, ethmoid haematomas or tumours et al. 2013). Both modalities are superior to radiography in identifying the nature of the disease, for example diagnosing sinusal cysts, progressive ethmoid haematomas, abscesses, neoplasia Henninger et al. 2003; Annear et al. 2015; Manso-D /C19azet al. 2015a,b). In cases of homogenous soft tissue masses being surrounded by fluid, e.g. a sinus cyst with secondary sinusitis, CT may show similar attenuation values for both, making differentiation between them dif cult ( Fig 8c,g). Measuring the HU may help to characterise tissues of different attenuation, such as the sinusfluid and the cystic content. Injection of intravenous contrast medium may also improve lesion delineation on CT. Moreover, the use of an intra-arterial route versus intravenous route would potentially allow evaluation of further lesions that are characterised by increased blood flow. In comparison, MRI evaluation of images have higher soft tissue contrast,resulting in different signal intensities for each type of soft tissue and fluid making it easier to delineate soft tissue masses (Manso-D /C19azet al. 2015a). The high bony detail of CT images is particularly useful for assessing the osseous canals that cross the nasal passagesand paranasal sinuses, such as the infraorbital canal and the a) b) Fig 5: Positioning of the anaesthetised horse for performing a magnetic resonance examination of the head. Fig 6: Sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance image of thebrain in which the caudal part of the cerebellum and the medullaoblongata has not been included in the eld of view due to the size of the patient (arrowheads). \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd35 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2021nasolacrimal duct (Kaminsky et al. 2016). The rst is of clinical importance as lesions of the infraorbital nerve can be associated with headshaking (Roberts et al. 2009; Fiske- Jackson et al. 2012). However, mild changes within the nerve are dif cult to detect on CT images, whereas MRI will potentially show them (Beltran et al. 2016). Computed tomography can also delineate the osseous anatomy of the nasolacrimal duct and it is possible to assess the patency ofits lumen by injecting contrast medium (dacryocystography) (Nykamp et al. 2004). Diseases of the nasolacrimal duct commonly manifest themselves as an obstruction. Severalcauses can lead to such an obstruction and radiography may be able to identify the cause, however, cross sectional modalities, specially CT, can delineate this duct without superimposition of surrounding structures et et al. 2011; Manso-D /C19az and Taeymans 2012). Nonetheless, MRI should be considered as a potential alternative for the evaluation of the nasolacrimal duct (Manso-D /C19azet al. 2015c). Either MRI or CT will be required when radiographic ndings are inconclusive. In the majority of conditions CT is commonly preferred due to shorter scan times, betteravailability, as well as the possibility of performing the CT examination in the standing patient (Kinns and Pease 2009; Dakin et al. 2014; Kaminsky et al. 2016). The latter avoids the necessity for general anaesthesia, both decreasing risks andcosts (Dakin et al. 2014). Another main advantage of shorter scan times with CT results in the possibility of performing bothprocedures, CT acquisition and surgery, under the same general anaesthetic. However, limited MRI protocols using 3DGRE sequences could equally decrease the anaesthesia time and would eliminate the necessity of acquiring sequences in different planes by using multiplanar reconstructions. These could be considered as a good alternative where CT is not readily available. An important word of caution is however warranted when combining imaging and surgery during the same anaesthetic, as this will inevitably lead to interpretation errors when reading a large number of images under timepressure. In this respect, MRI is better as the images become gradually available after each sequence, with an average number of images in the range of a few hundred, whilst CT results in hundreds to thousands of images obtained at once. Imaging of dental disease Approximately 22% of horses with sinonasal disease haveunderlying dental disease (Tremaine and Dixon 2001), as there is a close relationship between maxillary cheek teeth and the paranasal sinuses. Radiography is the imaging technique of choice for evaluating dental structures in equine general practice, as it can be performed under eld conditions. This technique has moderate sensitivity (76%) andhigh speci city (90%) for diagnosis of periapical infections (Townsend et al. 2011). However, radiographic signs detectable in the early stages of apical infection (e.g. widening of the periodontal space and loss of the laminadura) are less reliable (Townsend et al. 2011). Moreover, assessment of the internal tooth anatomy cannot beachieved with radiography. Computed tomography is able to distinguish with high detail the internal structures of the a) b)c) d) Fig 7: Transverse T1-weighted magnetic resonance (a,b) and computed tomographic (c,d) images of the brain at the level of the pituitary gland.

A recent study compared radiographic, CT and histological features of maxillary cheek teeth with apicalinfection, showing a 97% agreement between CT diagnosis and the presence of pathological changes in the extracted teeth, con rming the high diagnostic accuracy of CT (Liuti et al. 2018). Not all dental tissues can be visualised with MRI due to their molecular composition. Magnetic resonance imaging relies on the presence of mobile hydrogen atoms which are restricted in enamel, dentin, cement and cortical bone. The same principle is applied to air, which is lacking hydrogen atoms, resulting in dark areas (signal voids) in the oral cavity and paranasal sinuses. The lack of signal is a limiting factor in the use of MRI for assessing these structures (Fig 9b,d) (Gerlach et al. 2013; Schoppe et al. 2017). Magnetic resonance imaging can depict certain dentaldiseases, such as advanced pulpitis, periapical infections and large fractures ( Fig 10 ) (Manso-D /C19az et al. 2015a). Studies using a 9.7 T magnet show that very speci c sequences (e.g. ultra-short spin echo time and zero spin echo time) are able to depict both soft and hard (enamel, dentin and cementum) dental tissues in extracted equine and human teeth, but clinical application of this is currently not realistic (H\u20acovener et al. 2012). Imaging assessment following loss or removal of a tooth is often necessary and can present a challenge. Presence ofsmall dental fragments, maxillary or mandibular fractures, sequestra formation or the development of oronasal or oromaxillary sinus stula are common. Computed tomography has been proposed to be the most usefulimaging modality to identify the problem, its extent and aid in pre-surgical planning (Manso-D /C19azet al. 2015b; Hargreaves and Dixon 2018). Imaging of the skull Trauma to the head is relatively common in horses and, therefore, skull fractures are often identi ed. They are dif cult to assess on radiographs because of the complexmorphology of the skull bones and overlapping of numerous structures. Therefore, numerous tangential views are usually required (Gibbs and Lane 1987; Ramirez et al. 1998; Ramirez and Tucker 2004; Gerding et al. 2014). In addition, involvement of the surrounding soft tissues (e.g. eye globe orbrain) cannot be detected on radiographs. Ultrasonography is a useful imaging tool for evaluating the bone surface, therefore in some instances can be used for diagnosing skull fractures, specially to the most super cial bones. Although most skull fractures can be diagnosed radiographically, CT issuperior in identifying the exact extent and con guration of osseous changes, and allows detailed assessment ofthe involved structures, such as the infraorbital canal, nasolacrimal duct, nerve foramina, calvarium, temporomandibular joint, teeth or airways (Crijns et al. 2019). Although MRI is very sensitive at identifying bone marrowlesions, flat bones and petrous temporal bones are shown as black areas due to signal void on MRI. Subtle lesions affectingthese bones are therefore dif cult to identify on MRI (Scrivani 2013). The presence of gas within the airways (paranasalsinuses, pharynx and guttural pouches) surrounding these flat bones complicate detailed assessment of osseous structures with MRI even further. Hence CT is considered the method of choice for the assessing osseous structures of the head (Manso-D /C19azet al. 2015b; Crijns et al. 2019). Imaging of the temporomandibular joint Computed tomography and MRI anatomy of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) has been extensively studied (Rodr /C19guez et al. 2008, 2010). Both modalities allow a thorough examination of most structures in this area. a) b)c) PP P PInIn d) Fig 9: Transverse (a and dorsal (c and d) computed tomographic (CT) (a and c) and T1-weighted magneticresonance (MR) (b and d) images of the maxillary cheek teeth.In CT images distinction of the different dental tissues is possible,while in MR images enamel, 2020-02 KPPvet.com Developed by: Maintains optimal levels of bone density when young horses are most at risk for bone loss Supports bone mineral content and bone turnover to encourage the swift repair of microdamage Supplies the unique ingredient Lithothamnion that provides a readily available form of calcium and trace minerals needed for optimal bone growth Recommend for foals and young horses: Con/f_i ned to a stall or laid up for any reason Exhibiting signs of bucked shins or developmental bone diseases Growing (weanlings, yearlings, 2-year-olds) In training or competing regularly Recovering from a skeletal injury BoneWise is supported by research showing 11% more mineral content in the bone of supplemented horses.BoneWiseTM Supporting strong, resilient bones in growing horses Available through all major veterinary suppliers.

Conversely, MRI is considered the best modality to evaluate the articularcartilage, the articular disc and synovial pouches (Rodr /C19guez et al. 2010). Understanding the anatomy and anatomical variations of this region is essential for establishing the clinical signi cance of imaging ndings. A recent study described that the TMJ undergoes age-related remodelling, both interms of shape and CT attenuation alterations early in life. Presence of hypoattenuating regions consistent with osseous cyst-like lesions in the mandibular condyle and linear hyperattenuating regions consistent with soft-tissue mineralisation within the articular disc can be found in asymptomatic horses. The latter is highly correlated with age and the clinical signi cance of these changes is unknown (Carmalt et al. 2016). Intra-articular TMJ disease has been reported as a cause of facial pain and dysphagia in horses, with published studiesprimarily reporting septic arthritis (Barnett et al. 2014). Osteoarthritis can also be identi ed in this joint but is very infrequently reported as clinically relevant. Other diseasesaffecting the TMJ include trauma (fracture or subluxation) or neoplasia (Manso-D /C19az et al. 2015b). Use of advanced imaging techniques (MRI and CT) is recommended when TMJpathology is suspected (Smyth et al. 2017) since the diagnostic value of radiography is limited ( Fig 11 ). Imaging of the temporo-hyoid apparatus The hyoid apparatus consists of a series of small and thin bonesthat suspend the tongue from the temporal bone. Computedtomography allows assessment of each hyoid bone as well as their junctions. Although it is possible to evaluate the hyoid apparatus using MRI, CT is considered the gold standard (Chalmers et al. 2006; Hilton et al. 2009). Temporohyoid osteoarthropathy (THO) is the most common disease affectingthis area, however, trauma (fracture or subluxation) or congenital abnormalities have also been previously reported (Manso-D /C19az et al. 2015b; Dixon et al. 2017a). A signi cant association between horse 's age and the presence of bilateral degenerative changes within the temporohyoid articulation has been observed, which may predispose horses to the development of THO (Naylor et al. 2010b). Main CT features associated to THO include: osseous proliferation of thestylohyoid bone and temporohyoid articulation, thickening of the ceratohyoid bone and proliferation of its articulation, fracture of the petrous temporal and stylohyoid bones, fluid accumulation within and remodelling of the tympanic bulla, aswell as narrowing and mucosal thickening within the external ear canal (Hilton et al. 2009). a) c) b) d) Fig 10: Comparison of magnetic resonance (a,b) and computed tomographic (CT) (c,d) images of different dental diseases. a) Dorsal T1-weighted image of the maxillary arcade with a comminuted crown fracture of 109 (arrowheads). b) Transverse T2-weighted imageof the nasal passages, there is a hyperattenuating band surrounding the crown and apices of 207 (arrows) and the left ventral nasalconcha is partially obliterated by the root (arrowheads), consistent with periapical infection.

Observed abnormalities included fluid accumulation adjacent to the proximal portion of the stylohyoid bone and wall of the guttural pouch,consistent with haemorrhage or in flammation, structural changes of the middle and inner ear and evidence offracture of the stylohyoid or petrous temporal bone (Walker et al. 2002). This imaging modality may be preferred when further evaluation of the inner ear, peripheral nerves and thebrain is needed ( Fig 12 ). Intracranial imaging Intracranial lesions are relatively uncommon in the horse and the diagnostic value of radiography and ultrasonography is usually very limited. Notable exceptions are the identi cation of pneumocephalus with radiographs and hydrocephalus inneonates with ultrasound (Dunkel et al. 2012; Archer 2014). Intracranial lesions may either have an intra-axial, extra- axial or intraventricular localisation (Divers 2006). Extra-axial disorders are localised outside the brain parenchyma, the most common examples in equine practice include trauma with extradural haemorrhage, abscesses and tumours, e.g. pituitary masses, of orbital or nasal (Feige et al. 2000; Robertson et al. et al. 2004; Dyson et al. 2007; al. al. 2011; et al. 2013; Johns et al. 2014; Maischberger et al. 2014). The most common intraventricular lesions are cholesterolgranulomas. Although MRI has higher soft tissue contrast resolution than CT, both imaging modalities can potentially depict these types of lesions ( Fig 13a,b,e,f ). The use of contrast medium is however necessary for detailedclassi cation, delineation of the lesion and assessing its relationship with the surrounding tissues in both modalities(Fig 7 ). Magnetic resonance imaging might show associated changes within the brain, such as oedema or malacia, whichare not clearly identi able using CT; whereas if the lesion involves osseous structures, CT would able to 13c,d,g,h Intra-axial lesions comprise pathologies localised within the brain parenchyma and are very uncommon in horses. Computed tomography would likely fail showing these type of lesions (Lacombe et al. 2010), and MRI should therefore be considered as the gold standard in studying the equine brainparenchyma ( Fig 13d,h ) (Manso-D /C19azet vast majority of horses with recurrent seizure-like activity and normal neurological examination do not havevisible MRI abnormalities (Manso-D /C19azet al. 2015a). Therefore, cryptogenic epilepsy is the most likely differential diagnosis inthese cases (Lacombe et al. 2012, 2014). Although MRI ndings are negative in most of these cases, performing MRI is still a vital part of their work-up, as it helps ruling out morphological causes for seizures, such as tumours. Cranial nerve abnormalities are also uncommon in horses, and only a few references describing lesions within the optic and trigeminal nerve are available (Manso-D /C19azet al. 2015a; Beltran et al. 2016). Recent studies compared CT and MRI for a) b)c) d) Fig 11: Comparison of transverse T2-weighted (T2W) (a) and T1-weighted (T1W) (b) magnetic resonance and bone (c) and soft tissue (d) windows computed tomographic (c,d) images of a grey horse. There is a parotid carcinoma that caused severe lysis of thetemporal bone (arrowheads), bone destruction is better evaluated with CT, however soft tissue involvement is better seen with MRI.Multiple melanomas (arrows) are also identi ed; they are hypointense on T2W and hyperintense on T1W magnetic resonance images and show on computed tomography images. \u00a92019 identi cation of normal cranial nerves and concluded that MRI allowed for excellent visualisation of most cranial nerves, whereas CT allowed for detailed visualisation of the osseous canals and foramina and occasionally the nerves themselves (Gonc /C223alves et al. 2015; Dixon et al. 2017b). The transverse plane was found to be the most useful planeand the acquisition of MRI high-de nition sequences with thin slice thickness improved nerve identi cation ( Fig 12 ) (Dixon et al. 2017b). Imaging of extracranial soft tissues Extracranial soft tissue disorders of the head are relatively common and they usually involve the tongue, salivary glands, lymph nodes, pharynx and orbit (Dixon 1991; Dixon et al. 2014).Ultrasound is often the rst imaging method employed for assessing these structures. The use of CT and MRI is usuallyrestricted to masses that need further evaluation for diagnostic or treatment planning purposes. Compared with ultrasound, CT and MRI provide better coverage of the entire lesion on the images (larger eld of view), allow using multiple imaging planes (or even 3D models) and allow visualisationof tissues covered by gas or bone ( Fig 14b,d ) (Ramirez and Tucker 2004; Wollanke et al. 2006; Gerlach et al. 2007; van Top et al. Jakesova et al. 2008; Pekarkova et al. 2009; Naylor et al. 2010a; Schneider et al. 2010; Santos et al. 2012; Bienert-Zeit et al. 2014; McConnell et al. 2014). The use of contrast media aids in determining the exact lesiondemarcation and assessment of potential invasion into the surrounding tissues. The orbit includes the globe, nerves and extraocular muscles that are surrounded by extraorbital fat, which provides good contrast and allows differentiation of soft tissue orbital structures on CT. Both CT and MRI can be used for evaluation of orbital cellulitis or abscesses, optic neuritis, neoplasia and orbital trauma. They are especially useful for assessing retrobulbar space-occupying lesions, as they allow detailed characterisation of the mass, but also provide signi cant diagnostic and prognostic information by determining the presence of nasal or intracranial extension(Fig 14a,c ). These techniques also allow evaluation of intraocular structures such as identifying lens luxation,intraocular haemorrhage, retinal detachment and loss ofnormal shape or air within the eye suggesting a ruptured globe (Ramirez and Tucker 2004). Computed tomography is advantageous over MRI in that it has a greater ability to detect osseous abnormalities and is superior at providing information for planning orbital surgery (Gerding et al. 2014). MRI provides better overall resolution of the retrobulbar tissuesbut may fail to detect defects in cortical bone or soft-tissue mineralisation. Conclusions Magnetic resonance imaging can be considered the goldstandard for studying the central nervous system, including the brain and cranial nerves, as well as the extracranial soft tissues, including the orbit, lymph nodes, blood vessels, muscles and salivary glands. Magnetic resonance imaging may also be adequate for studying the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses, and it is particularly useful for differentiatingspace-occupying lesions, as its high contrast resolution allows good differentiation of different soft tissue types. Diagnostic usefulness of MRI in cases of dental disease is limited to lesions involving the pulp cavity, the periodontal space, the lamina dura and the bone marrow of the surrounding alveolar bone. Computed tomography can be considered the gold standard for studying the skull bones, the temporomandibular joint, the temporohyoid articulation and teeth. It is also adequate for studying the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses, being particularly useful for identifying subtle nasal and sinusal osseous wall lesions. Computed tomography can identify intraventricular and extra-axial brain lesions, however, the diagnostic value of CT in cases of intra-axial lesions is limited. Extracranial soft tissue lesions can be identi ed with CT, but with less detail than with MRI. a) b) Fig 12: Transverse T1-weighted post-contrast magnetic resonance (a) and computed tomographic images at thelevel of the internal acoustic meatus (asterisks) of two differenthorses with otitis externa (white arrows) and media (arrowheads).

Reid Hanson* and J. Schumacher Department of Clinical Sciences, JT Vaughan Teaching Hospital, Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama, USA email: hansorr@auburn.edu Keywords: horse; small colon; rectum; impaction; management Summary Common causes of obstruction of the small colon and rectum Poor dentition, poor-quality hay, lack of adequate water, parasite damage and lack of exercise are risk factors for the development of small colon impactions. Clinical signs of small colon obstruction develop slowly because a large space proximal to the obstruction allows ingesta, gas and fluid to accumulate. Medical management of horses with faecal impaction of the small colon involvesimprovement of hydration, stimulation of colonic motility, softening the impaction by the administration of osmotic laxatives or lubricants, and control of pain. Surgical intervention is indicated when medical management fails to resolve the impaction or when intractable pain and a deteriorating cardiovascular status ensues. Introduction Diffuse small colon faecal impaction is the most commonpathological condition of the small colon except in regions with a high incidence of enterolithiasis. In several retrospective studies, diffuse faecal impaction was diagnosed in 1.9 -2.5% of all horses admitted for signs of abdominal pain (Ruggles and Ross 1991; Dart et al. 1992; Rhoads 1999). Poor dentition, poor-quality hay, lack of water, parasite damage and lack of exercise are risk factors for the development of small colon impactions (Edwards 1992; Schumacher and Mair 2002; Frederico et al. 2006). The increased incidence of diffuse faecal impaction during the cooler part of the yearobserved in some studies may be the result of inadequate water consumption or change of feed as horses are transitioned from pasture to hay (Ruggles and Ross 1991; Rhoads 1999). Horses older than 15 years, American Miniature Horses, and ponies were at an increased risk in several studies, but age, breed, and sex were not signi cant risk factors in other reports (Tennant et al. 1972; Dart et al. 1992; Rhoads 1999). Enterolith obstruction of the small colon ( Fig 1 ) accounts for up to 35% of small colon diseases in areas such as California where the incidence of enterolithiasis is high (Blue 1979; Dart et al. 1992; Hassel et al. 1999; Cohen et al. 2000). The small colon is occasionally focally obstructed by afaecalith, phytobezoar, material that form because of poor-quality diet, poor mastication, or reduced water consumption (Kellerand Horney 1985; McClure et al. 1992). The condition occursmost commonly in ponies in late fall when grass has lownutritional value and is high in ligand and, because the weather is cool, water consumption is reduced. Small colon faecaliths most commonly occur in ponies and American Miniature Horses, especially those <1 year or more than 15 years of age (Boles and Kohn 1977; Dart et al. 1992; Ragle et al. 1992). Bezoars are combinations of concretions of magnesium ammonium phosphate crystals and plantmaterial (phytobezoars), hair (trichobezoars) or a combination of plant and hair (phytotrichobezoars) (Livesey 1990; Schumacher and Mair 2002). Phytobezoars, or 'oat stones 'are most often composed of matted 'oat hairs '. They are permeated with magnesium ammonium phosphate crystals to form calculi that are relatively light and have an uneven, furrowed, velvet-textured surface ( Fig 2a,b). plant residuesformed into balls. Phytoconglobates occur most commonly in young horses and in horses with poor dentition. The smooth surface of phytoconglobates and bezoars may allow them to obstruct the lumen for relatively long periods without causing severe damage to the mucosa. Foreign materials involved in obstruction of the small colon include halters, ropes, hay nets, mops ( Fig 3a,b ), plastic 1977; Gay et al. 1979; Schmitt et al. 1999). Obstruction of the small colon with foreign material occurs generally in young horses because they are less Fig 1: Clusters of enteroliths obstructing the small colon. Enterolith obstruction of the small colon accounts for up to 35% of small colondiseases in areas such as California where the incidence ofenterolithiasis is high. and Kohn 1977; Dart et al. 1992). While residing in the large colon, foreign material becomes layered with mineral precipitate increasing its bulkand often forming irregular projections that can cause pressure necrosis when the material moves to the small colon. An intramural or submucosal haematoma ( Fig 4 ) is an uncommon, idiopathic lesion of the small colon (Spiers et al. 1981; Pearson and Waterman 1986; Edwards 1992).Haemorrhage within the intestinal wall may occlude the intestinal lumen and dissect along the submucosa producing intestinal necrosis. The condition occurs most commonly in old horses. Histology has not revealed the cause, and the source of haemorrhage contributing to the formation of mural haematoma is not usually evident during gross or microscopic examination of resected colon (Schumacher and Mair 2002). Meconium impaction is a common cause of abdominal pain in newborn foals. Meconium impaction occurs more frequently in males (because of their narrower pelvis), weaknewborns and foals born at more than 340 days of gestation (Fisher et al. 1987; Madigan and Goetzman 1990; White 1990; Edwards meconium impaction colostrum promotesgastrointestinal motility and has a laxative effect (Rakestrawand Hardy 2012). Signs of abdominal pain caused by meconium impaction usually appear between the rst 12 - 96 h of life (Madigan and Goetzman 1990; Edwards 1997). Diagnosis Horses with diffuse faecal impaction of the small colon initially show signs of mild abdominal pain followed by increasing signs of pain. Abdominal pain progresses slowly after colonic obstruction because of the large space proximal to the obstruction available for accumulation of ingesta, gas andfluid. The heart rate is often only mildly to moderately elevated. Leukopenia with a left shift is common in horseswith diffuse faecal impactions of the small colon, but serum biochemical and peritoneal fluid values are typically within a) b) Fig 2: a) Phytobezoar removed from small colon.

Foreign materials involved in obstruction of the small coloninclude halters, ropes, hay nets, mops, plastic bags, bailing twine,and rubberised fencing. b) The mop was removed from the smallcolon via a small colon enterotomy. Obstruction of the small colon with foreign material occurs generally in young horses because they are less discriminate in their eating habits. \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd48 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2021normal ranges (Ruggles and Ross 1991; Edwards 1992). Loops of tubular, rm, digesta- lled intestine, and oedematous or rough rectal mucosa, can be identi ed during a transrectal abdominal examination. Serosanguinous fluid can sometimes be seen on the rectal sleeve or manure pulled from the rectum. A single tenia identi ed during the examination con rms small colon as the segment of intestine involved (Keller and Horney 1985; Livesey 1990; Ruggles amotile small colon with a thickened >8 mm) and a lumen lled with hyperechoic ingesta may assist in the diagnosis especially when signs of abdominal pain occur in horses too small to allow abdominal palpation per rectum. For horses large enough to rectally palpate, small colon impactions are usually easily diagnosed by palpating rm coils of colon near the pelvic inlet (Freeman et al. 2001). Findings of diarrhoea, fever, leukopenia, and irritated rectal mucosa suggests that colitis may predispose somehorses to small colon impaction, possibly because of disturbance in motility (Dart et al. 1992; Frederico et al. 2006). Gastrointestinal stasis and in flammation associated with small colon impaction may predispose horses to colitis (Wiley et al. 1988; and Ross 1991). Enteroliths, can block passage of faeces yet allowpassage of gas and intestinal lubricants, such as mineral oil. Affected horses typically exhibit numerous episodes of minor colic, most likely from intermittent obstruction in the large colon before the obstruction enters the small colon. If the obstruction is too large to be passed, it often becomes wedged either in the transverse colon or the proximal portion of the small colon (Blue 1979). An obstruction within the small colon typically causes complete obstruction and affected horses tend to show signs of more severe abdominal pain than horses with partial or intermittent obstruction of the transverse or right dorsal colon. Evidence of an obstruction in the proximal portion of the small colon is usually not palpable during transrectal abdominal examination. Loops of gas- lled small colon may be recognised, however, if the enterolith is lodged in the middle or distal portions of the small colon. For horses with an intramural haematoma the rectum is usually devoid of faeces, but various amounts of clotted blood maybe found during transrectal examination (Schumacher and Mair 2002). Radiography can be used to con rm a suspicion of enterolithiasis. Enteroliths in the large colon are more easily identi ed radiographically than an enterolith in the small colon. Severe gas distention in the large or small coloncauses compression and distortion of intra-abdominal organs that negatively impacts the sensitivity of radiographic diagnosis of enterolithiasis (Yarbrough et al. 1994; Maher et al. 2011; Kelleher et al. 2014). Additional limitations include underexposure of the small colon with the use of analogue radiographs. Digital radiographs can compensate for underexposure by image processing mechanisms that allow for change in contrast after the image is acquired. The absence of a radiographic diagnosis does not preclude the presence of an enterolith. Increasing abdominal distention and signs of pain, tachycardia, with leukopenia and an increase in peritoneal fluid protein concentration and nucleated cell count are often found in horses with complete obstruction of the smallcolon. Pressure necrosis can occur at the site of the obstruction and in these cases, surgery should be strongly considered when the aforementioned values increase. Signs of meconium retention include tail swishing, restlessness, straining to defaecate, and abdominal distention due to gas accumulation. As the condition progresses, the foal develops signs of more severe colic, such as repeated recumbency, rolling, lying upside down, and abdominaldistention (Madigan 1987). Meconium can usually be identi ed either by plain or contrast abdominal radiography, by ultrasonography or by digital rectal examination. Followingappropriate sedation and restraint of the foal, a 28 -30 French Foley catheter with a 30 mL bulb is placed into the rectum,the bulb slowly in flated, and up to 20 mL/kg of 30% weight/ volume barium is administered by gravity flow. Contrast radiography is reportedly 100% sensitive and speci c for identifying mechanical obstructions of the transverse andsmall colon in foals younger than 30 days of age (Fischer and Yarbrough 1995). Radiographically, meconium appears as granular contents in the small colon and rectum, with fluid or gas-distended intestine proximal to the obstruction. Medical treatment Medical management of horses with diffuse faecal impaction of the small colon involves improving hydration, softening theimpaction by the administration of osmotic laxatives or lubricants and controlling pain. Intravenous administration of large amounts fluids (2 -3 times the maintenance volume) has been recommended to hydrate and soften a small colonimpaction (Ruggles and Ross 1991; Frederico et al. 2006), but over-hydration, in one study was shown to merely causeexcessive urination without an increase in intraluminal fluid (Lester et al. 2013). Enteral fluids (2 -4 L every 4 -6 h) are more likely to hydrate a small colon impaction and have the additional bene t of initiating a gastrocolonic re flex, whereby gastric distention stimulates contractile activity of the colon(Clark and Becht 1987; Freeman et al. 1992). Oral laxatives such as mineral oil (5 -10 mL/kg every 12 h), dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (50 mg/kg in 6 L of water), or magnesium sulfate (1 g/kg in 6 L of water) administered to adult horses by nasogastric tube are commonly administered to soften the impaction. Magnesium sulfate can be Fig 4: Intramural haematoma obstructing the lumen of the small or submucosal haematoma is anuncommon, idiopathic lesion of mucosa. \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd49 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2021administered once daily for 2 -3 days if the horse is well hydrated (Henninger et al. 1992; Prange et al. 2019). Enemas can be administered to soften the impaction (Fig 5 ). Because of the risk of perforating the small colon, caution should be exercised when administering an enema to a standing horse (Ruggles and Ross 1991; Rhoads 1999). The horse should be adequately sedated and restrained. Enemas should not be performed under pressure and the return of flow should not be prevented. The procedure is most effective if epidural anesthesia has been administeredbecause it prevents straining and allows more fluid to be administered. Flunixin meglumine (0.25 mg/kg 3 times a day, or 1.1 mg/ kg twice a day i.v.) can be administered to treatendotoxaemia and to control pain. Epidural morphine (0.1 mg/kg in diluted in 30 mL saline and administered slowly) can help to control pain in horses with small colon impaction (Zimmel 2003). Antibiotics may be indicated for horses with small colon impaction that have signs of septicaemia, severe leukopenia, or concurrent diarrhoea (Ruggles and Ross 1991). Cryotherapy using ice- lled boots should be initiated before clinical signs of laminitis (heat in the feet, a bounding digitalpulse and pointing or favouring the affected limb) develop (van Eps and Pollitt 2006). The feet should be maintained in ice boots to a level above the fetlock until heart rate, and mucous membrane capillary re ll time and colour are normal and immature neutrophils and neutrophils with toxic changeare no longer present on bloodwork. Most foals with meconium impaction respond to medical therapy that includes judicious use of analgesics, i.v. fluid therapy, oral laxatives (4 -8 oz. mineral oil administered via a nasogastric tube; 1 -2 oz. of milk of magnesia) and enemas. For an enema, warm water is mixed with a mild liquiddetergent (e.g. Palmolive; 1/2 teaspoon liquid detergent added to 500 mL water) 1. Commercial phosphate (Fleet/C226)2 enemas can also be administered. A 4% acetylcysteine enema solution has been recommended for treatment of retained meconium (Madigan and Goetzman 1990; Pusterla et al. sedated with diazepam (0.2 -0.4 mg/kg i.v.) and placed in lateral recumbency. A 30-French Foley catheter with a 30 mL bulb is inserted about 2.5 -5 cm into the rectum. The balloon is slowly inflated to avoid damaging the rectum. Between 100 and 200 mL of 4% acetylcysteine solution is administered slowly by gravity flow and retained for 30 -45 min (Madigan 1987). This procedure can be repeated, if necessary, up to three timesover a 24-h period. Acetylcysteine cleaves the disul de bonds in the mucoprotein molecules and decreases thetenacity of the meconium. The 4% solution is hypertonic and will cause some loss of fluid into the bowel, an action which may help detach the meconium from the bowel wall(Pusterla et al. 2004). The ef cacy of acetylcysteine enemas has been reported to be excellent (Madigan 1987; Pusterlaet al. 2004). Occasionally, repeated enemas can result in signi cant mucosal irritation and persistent straining beyond the resolution of the meconium impaction, thereby confounding the assessment of treatment success. Surgical treatment Surgical intervention for diffuse faecal impaction is indicated when medical management fails, the abdomen distends, cardiovascular deterioration is detected, or an increase in the nucleated cell count and concentration of total protein in the peritoneal fluid indicates a decrease in intestinal viability (Dart et al. 1992; Edwards 1992; Rhoads 1999). When palpated though the celiotomy, small colon is easily identi ed as a distended tube with a single antimesenteric taeneal band, with or without the usual sacculations ( Fig 6 ). After the small colon is exteriorised through a ventral midline celiotomy, the impaction is broken apart by intraluminal lavage with warm water administered by a stomach tube introduced rectally. The tube is inserted through the anus by a) b) Fig 5: Administration of an enema to a horse using an enema bell. \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd50 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION assistant ( Fig 7 ) and manipulated transmurally by the surgeon until the tube reaches the impaction. The surgeon 's hand closes the lumen of the small colon over the tube caudal to the impaction to allow water distention around the distal extent of the impaction ( Fig 8 ). To break up the distal portion of the impaction, the impaction is gently massagedas water is administered through the tube. The exercises are repeated working orad until the impaction is relieved. Extreme care should be used during manipulation of the small colon to avoid rupture of the colon. To decrease mechanical damage to the serosa during the massage, the small colon can be coated with carboxymethylcellulose (Ruggles and Ross 1991). If the impaction cannot be relieved by intraluminal lavage combined with external massage, a small colon enterotomy on the antimesenteric teniae can be performed. Lavage is used to evacuate the impacted faecal material through the enterotomy. Small colon resection andanastomosis is necessary if there is mural ischaemia or thrombosis of the mesenteric vessels that supply the small colon ( Fig 9 ). An end to end anastomosis in two layers using polyglactin 910 is used. A simple continuous pattern in the submucosa is used in the rst layer followed by a continuous Cushing pattern in the serosa for the second layer ( Fig 10 ). This pattern creates an ideal seal without excessive inversion of the anastomosis that could lead to post-operative obstruction of the small colon ( Fig 11 ) (Hanson et al. 1988). If a signi cant quantity of ingesta is found in the large colon, large colon evacuation through an enterotomy minimises early post-operative recurrence of impaction in the oedematous and in flamed small colon. Because large colon displacement or volvulus may occur secondary to gasdistention proximal to the impaction in some horses, the Fig 6: When palpated though the celiotomy, small colon is easily identi ed as a distended tube with a single antimesenteric taeneal band, with or without the usual sacculations.

Fig 9: Small colon resection and anastomosis is necessary ifthere is mural ischaemia or thrombosis of the \u00a92019 Ltd51 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2021position of the large colon should be determined before closure of the celiotomy incision. Treatment of horses in pain due to impaction of the small colon caused by surgical removal of the obstruction through an antimesenteric enterotomy or retropulsion and removal through a large colon enterotomy (Hassel et al. 1999). The obstruction should be manouevred distally or proximally so theenterotomy site can be made in a healthier portion of the intestine. Longitudinal enterotomies made through the antimesenteric tenia of the small colon are superior to incisions made adjacent to the tenia regarding ease of closure, larger luminal diameter after closure ( Fig 13a and b), and less interruption of the blood supply. An enterotomy performedthrough the antimesenteric tenia results in less haemorrhage and less in flammation, and sutured tenial incisions are stronger than sutured incisions adjacent to the tenia at 96 h (Edwards1997; Schumacher and Mair 2002). Obstructions found in the Fig 10: Two-layer closure arrow of the small colon following resection. A simple continuous pattern in the submucosa is usedin the rst layer followed by a continuous Cushing pattern in the serosa for the second layer.

Removal involves surgical removal of the obstruction throughan antimesenteric enterotomy or retropulsion and removal through a Faecolith removedfrom small colon. \u00a92019 EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2021proximal portion of the small colon often must be repelled into the right dorsal colon and then into the left dorsal colon for removal through an enterotomy. Retropulsion with lavage can be accomplished by retrograde infusion of water into the small colon. To repel an enterolith proximally, a stomach tube is inserted into the rectum and passed into the small colon. The tube is guided to the obstruction by the surgeon and, while the small colon is occluded by holding it tightly to the tube, warm water is infused into the intestine until the lumen expands to a size large enough to allow the enterolith to move orally. The obstruction is then repelled into the left dorsal colon where it can be removed safely via an enterotomy site remote from the abdominal cavity. If removing an obstruction in a retrograde fashion is not successful, the tube is inserted through a pelvic flexure enterotomy and advanced aborally to the obstruction. Warmwater is introduced to distend the small colon orad to the enterolith, while the intestine distal to the obstruction ismanually occluded. The obstruction is then massaged in anorad direction. Care must be taken during distention and manipulation of the small colon, since pressure necrosis can make the bowel susceptible to rupture. A parainguinal approach to the abdomen may provide access to the enterolith for removal at the site of obstruction in cases where the enterolith cannot be dislodged, and its location prohibits exteriorisation through a ventral midline incision (Barrett and Munsterman 2013). A complete examination of the large intestine, especially the right dorsal and transverse colon, is strongly recommended following the removal of a stone through a small colon enterotomy as, in one study, almost half of the horses with enteroliths in the small colon had additional stones in the large or transverse colons (Hassel et al. 1999; Pierce et al. 2010). To limit the risk of an impaction at the small colon enterotomy site, evacuation of the large colon through a pelvic flexure enterotomy may be indicated to decrease the amount of faecal material passing through thesmall colon in the immediate post-operative period. A linear foreign body may cause plication of the small colon leading to ischaemia or mechanical damage of the intestinal wall and complicating its removal. Over-sewing or even resection and subsequent end-to-end anastomosis of ischaemic or damaged small colon might be necessary (Boles and Kohn 1977; Gay et al. 1979; Schmitt et al. 1999). The post-surgical prognosis should be comparable to theoutcome after enterolith removal, unless small colonsegments are devitalised and require resection. In these cases, the risk for post-operative complications is higher and long-term survival less likely (de Bont et al. 2013). An intramural haematoma is recognised at surgery as a dense,circumscribed mass free in the lumen or attached to the wall of the small colon; they can usually be removed through an enterotomy ( Fig 14 ). Surgical intervention of meconium impaction should be considered if medical therapy is unsuccessful, especially in the face of persistent pain unresponsive to analgesics, persistent tachycardia, progressive abdominal enlargement, or increase in peritoneal fluid protein and or nucleated cell count. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered perioperatively for 24 h and nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory drugs are continued post-operatively for 3 -5 days depending on the surgical ndings and post-operative condition of the horse. Post-operatively, horses should be slowly re-introduced to feed. Feeding a complete pelleted diet for several weeks may help prevent re-impaction (Prange et al. 2010). Prognosis Survival after medical therapy for feed impaction of the small colon is reported to be good to excellent (72 -100%), and survival after surgical therapy is reported to be fair toexcellent (47 -95%) (Ruggles and Ross 1991; Dart et al. 1992; Edwards 1992; Rhoads 1999). Horses whose large colon wasnot evacuated during surgery are more likely to develop post-operative pain (Ruggles and Ross 1991). Horses treated surgically were more likely to have positive faecal culture of Salmonella spp. than horses treated medically (Rhoads 1999). The cause of the high incidence of salmonellosis in horseswith impaction of the small colon treated surgically is unknown. Post-operative antibiotic therapy may increase the a) b) Fig 13: a) First layer of small colon enterotomy closure with a simple continuous in the antimesenteric taeneal band.Longitudinal enterotomies made through the antimesenteric teniaof the small colon are superior to incisions made adjacent to thetenia regarding ease of closure, larger luminal diameter afterclosure, and less interruption of the blood supply. b) Second layerof the small colon enterotomy is closed with a continuousCushing pattern. \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd53 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / of developing salmonellosis by altering gastrointestinal flora (Ruggles and Ross 1991; Prange et al. 2010). Other common complications of small colon impaction treatedmedically or surgically are jugular thrombophlebitis, fever,laminitis, peritonitis, and recurrent impaction. Horses treated surgically may have additional complications of incisional infection, incisional hernia, and intestinal adhesions (Dart et al. 1992; Edwards 1992; Rhoads 1999). The cardiovascular health of the horse and the integrity of the affected area of intestine are factors that determine the prognosis for survival of horses undergoing surgery for enterolithiasis. Horses recovering from surgery for transverse and small colon enterolithiasis have a good to excellent prognosis for short (88 -96.2%) and long-term survival (up to 92.5%) (Hassel et al. 1999; Cohen et al. 2000; Pierce et al. 2010). In one study, horses treated surgically for small colon enterolithiasis were more prone to complications than horses treated surgically for an enterolith in the large colon (Hassel et al. 1999), but in other studies there was no difference in the incidence of complications (Taylor et al. 1979; Cohen et al. 2000). To minimise the recurrence of enterolithiasis, feeding areas should be free of gravel and debris or elevated from the ground, and grass hay rather than legume hay should be fed. Colonic pH below 6.6 tends to prevent the formation of enteroliths. Decreasing the amount of hay, adding cider vinegar (one cup twice daily) and increasing the amount of grain in the diets tends to decrease colonic pH (Schumacher and Mair 2002; Rakestraw and Hardy 2012). The prognosis for short-term survival of horses treated surgically for faecalithiasis, phytobezoar-, trichobezoar, phytotrichobezoar, or phytoconglobate is excellent (Scharner et al. 2015). For horses treated surgically for a foreign body in the small colon, the prognosis should be comparable to theoutcome after enterolith removal, unless small colon segments are devitalised and require resection and anastomosis. In these cases, the risk for post-operative complications is higher andlong-term survival decreased (Prange et al. 2010). Seven of 43 horses undergoing small colon resection and anastomosis didnot survive to discharge from the hospital in one retrospective study (de Bont et al. 2013). The prognosis a horse treated for anintramural haematoma is good if the entire lesion can beremoved (Schumacher and Mair 2002). Post-operative complications involving adhesion formation (Fig 15 ) are common after gastrointestinal surgery of neonates (Vatistas et al. 1996; Cable et al. 1997). Eight of 28 foals that failed to respond to medical therapy for meconium impaction required surgery; two of these were eventually euthanised as a result of colic caused by serosal adhesions (Hughes et al. 1994). Minimal handling of the bowel in surgery along with topical administration of 1% sodiumcarboxymethylcellulose during bowel manipulation may reduce adhesion formation. Conclusion Surgical intervention for faecal impaction is indicated in horses when medical management fails, the abdomen distends, cardiovascular deterioration is detected, or an increase in the nucleated cell count and concentration of total protein in the peritoneal fluid indicates loss of intestinal viability. Large colon displacement or volvulus can occursecondary to small colon impaction. Survival after medical therapy is reported to be good to excellent and survival after surgical therapy is reported to be fair to excellent if the cardiovascular health of the horse and the integrity of the affected area of intestine are good.
