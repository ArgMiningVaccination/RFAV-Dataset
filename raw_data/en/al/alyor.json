Notable parodies of pseudoscientific concepts are also included. Main topics[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_pseudosciences&action=edit\u00a7ion=1)] The following have broad consensus concerning their [pseudoscientific](/wiki/Pseudoscience) status. Indicative of this are assertions by mainstream, specialized scientific bodies. [[1]](#cite_note-1) [[2]](#cite_note-2) [[3]](#cite_note-3) [[4]](#cite_note-4) [[5]](#cite_note-5) [Astrology](/wiki/Astrology)refers to any of several systems of understanding, interpreting and organizing knowledge about reality and human existence, based on the relative positions and movement of various real and construed celestial bodies. - Planetary alignments are events where two or more planets and the [Sun](/wiki/Sun)and [Moon](/wiki/Moon)line up from the perspective of [Earth](/wiki/Earth). Much of astrology has been developed around such alignments. [Sun signs](/wiki/Sun_sign)are astrological signs that are determined by the location of the Sun at a particular moment in time such as an individual's birth. - Planetary alignments are events where two or more planets and the [Climate change denial](/wiki/Climate_change_denial)has been described as a form of pseudoscience by various groups including the [National Center for Science Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Science_Education). [[6]](#cite_note-6) [Creation science](/wiki/Creation_science)is the belief that the origin of everything in the [universe](/wiki/Universe)is the result of a [first cause](/wiki/First_cause), brought about by a [creator deity](/wiki/God), and that this thesis is supported by geological, biological, and other scientific evidence. This \"evidence\" is either Biblical in nature, or it attacks a tenet of evolution, incorrectly [assuming](/wiki/False_dichotomy)that if any part of evolution is wrong, the whole thing is wrong and creationism is right. [Baraminology](/wiki/Baraminology)is an attempt to create a bible-friendly version of biological species without invoking [evolution](/wiki/Theory_of_evolution). [Biblical scientific foreknowledge](/wiki/Biblical_scientific_foreknowledge)asserts that [the Bible](/wiki/The_Bible)makes accurate statements about the world that science verifies thousands of years later. A favorite of kdbuffalo/Conservative. Suffers from the problem that [prophesy](/wiki/Prophesy)should predict the future, not the past. Kinda the whole point. [Catastrophic plate tectonics](/wiki/Catastrophic_plate_tectonics) - Creationist cosmologies are ones which, among other things, allow for a universe that is only thousands of years old. [Flood geology](/wiki/Flood_geology), the creationist form of geology, advocates a [global flood](/wiki/Global_flood)can account for most of the geologic features on Earth. [Hydroplate theory](/wiki/Hydroplate_theory)is an attempt to explain how an earth-wide flood could occur. [Soft-sediment deformation](/wiki/Soft-sediment_deformation)is the idea that rocks can only be deformed if wet and soft. - [Intelligent Design](/wiki/Intelligent_Design)is a version of creation science stated in secular terms, viz. that \"certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not [by] an undirected process such as [natural selection](/wiki/Natural_selection).\" - The [banana fallacy](/wiki/Banana_fallacy)is an argument about how things are designed to suit humans, while ignoring other explanations such as artificial selection. [Irreducible complexity](/wiki/Irreducible_complexity)is the claim that some systems are so complex that they cannot have evolved from simpler systems. Proponents of intelligent design use irreducible complexity to argue that evolution by natural selection alone is incomplete or flawed, and that some additional mechanism (an \"Intelligent Designer\") is required to explain the origins of [life](/wiki/Life). - Specified complexity is the claim that when something is simultaneously complex and specified, one can infer that it was produced by an intelligent cause (i.e., that it was designed) rather than being the result of natural processes. - The [Modern geocentrism](/wiki/Modern_geocentrism)cites uniform gamma-ray burst distribution as evidence that we are at the center of the universe, and other ideas of this type. - [Crop circles](/wiki/Crop_circles)are geometric designs of crushed or knocked-over crops createdoccurring in a field. Aside from skilled farmers or pranksters working through the night, explanations for their formation include UFOs and anomalous, tornado-like air currents. The study of crop circles is termed \"cerealogy\" by proponents. [Dogon people and Sirius B](/wiki/Dogon_people)is a series of claims that the Dogon tribe knew about the white-dwarf companion of Sirius despite it being invisible to the naked eye. [Erich von D\u00e4niken](/wiki/Erich_von_D%C3%A4niken)'s proposal of [ancient astronauts](/wiki/Ancient_astronauts).

Perpetual motion has been recognized as extrascientific since the late 18th century, but inventors continue to make proposals and [patents](/wiki/Patent)for such devices to the present day. [Free energy](/wiki/Free_energy_(pseudoscience))is a particular class of perpetual motion which violates the [first law of thermodynamics](/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics)and the law of conservation of energy. Of particular note are proposals involving the extraction of [zero-point energy](/wiki/Zero-point_energy), a real energy found in [quantum mechanics](/wiki/Quantum_mechanics)that cannot be used to do work. [Racialism](/wiki/Racialism)is the theory that humans can be separated into distinct races and that race is an indicator of IQ. [Torsion field](/wiki/Torsion_field)physics is a theory about some new kind of fields that travel much faster than light. Torsion fields are often used to \"mathematically describe\" other pseudoscientific topics. - Hyperdimensional physics is a concept that has been very vaguely described by Tom Bearden. [Mike Bara](/wiki/Mike_Bara)once summed it up as \"a rotating body pulls energy from its higher state\". None of the examples he gives are actually valid. [Ufology](/wiki/Ufology)is the study of [unidentified flying objects](/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object)(UFOs) and frequently includes the belief that UFOs are evidence for [extraterrestrial](/wiki/Exobiology)visitors. - The [Face on Mars](/wiki/Face_on_Mars)(in [Cydonia Mensae](/wiki/Cydonia_Mensae)) is a rock formation on Mars asserted to be evidence of intelligent, native life on the planet. Higher-resolution images show it to appear less face-like. It features prominently in the pseudoscientific theories of [Richard C. Hoagland](/wiki/Richard_C._Hoagland). [Alien abductions](/wiki/Alien_abduction)are events where people claim to have been taken into a spaceship for [medical](/wiki/Medical)experiments by aliens before being returned to Earth.

[Chelation therapy](/wiki/Chelation_therapy)is therapy that is used to flush heavy metals from the body, by encasing them in soluble molecules. While it does have valid uses, like treating lead-poisoning, [some](/wiki/Rashid_Buttar) [idiots](/wiki/Geier_family)claim that it will cure [autism](/wiki/Autism), likely from the idea that autism is caused by [mercury](/wiki/Mercury)poisoning. - A [cleanse](/wiki/Cleanse)purports to take substances claimed to remove \"toxins\" from the colon, liver, kidneys, lymphatic system, or other organs. [Colonic hydrotherapy](/wiki/Colonic): \"what's in your colon makes you sick\" Really, what's in your colon makes me sick. They never quite got that right.

[Hair Analysis](/wiki/Hair_Analysis)is the theory of diagnosis through the levels of minerals in hair. [Herbalism](/wiki/Herbal_supplement)is healing by the ingestion of various plant preparations \u2014 teas, tinctures, poultices and the like. A few herbalist remedies have been shown through controlled clinical trials to have a physiological effect, but the majority are simply folk remedies. Some (e.g. [Aristolochia](/wiki/Aristolochia)) are quite dangerous. [Homeopathy](/wiki/Homeopathy)is a medical practice that claims to work by diluting various things in a solute. While modern pharmacology works similarly, and indeed likely owes much of its history to homeopathy, there is a patent denial of the dose-response relationships that chemicals have with the body. Homeopathy is the exact opposite of modern pharmacology \u2014 homeopathy claims that things get more potent as they become more dilute. By current laws in most countries, in order for something to be labeled as \"homeopathic\" it must not contain anything but the solution that the treatment has been \"distilled into\" (usually purified [water](/wiki/Water)). Homeopathy is entirely \"natural\", but not always harmless (because of impurities, insufficient dilution, or avoiding actual medicine). [Ivermectin](/wiki/Ivermectin)is a totally fine medicine, except for the fact that it's for deworming horses and not for curing [COVID-19](/wiki/COVID-19). [Laetrile](/wiki/Laetrile)is a [quack](/wiki/Quack) [cancer](/wiki/Cancer)treatment, outlawed in the U.S. because it breaks down into cyanide in the body. [Magnetic therapy](/wiki/Magnetic_therapy)is the practice of using magnetic fields to positively influence one's health.

Unless otherwise noted, the entries are referenced from [The Skeptics Society](/wiki/The_Skeptics_Society)'s The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience Finally, some of these items are not considered pseudoscientific in and of themselves: only certain aspects, explanations, and/or applications of them. See an item's description text for more information on this. [2012 apocalypse](/wiki/2012_apocalypse)We're all gonna die, and its gonna to happen in 2012, because the Mayans said so, and they would know. [[note 1]](#cite_note-7) [Anthroposophy](/wiki/Anthroposophy)is a philosophy which holds that that spirit world can be scientifically investigated. - Anthroposophical medicine is the practice within the Anthroposophy belief system of various remedies intented for illnesses of a person's non-physical \" [soul](/wiki/Soul).\" - Anthroposophical medicine is the practice within the Anthroposophy belief system of various remedies intented for illnesses of a person's non-physical \" [Attachment psychotherapeutic treatment for aggressive, disobedient, and/or unaffectionate [children](/wiki/Children)(so-called attachment disorder). A minor version (relative to most other attachment therapies) involves the child being physically restrained by adults who then attempt to maintain prolonged eye contact. Perhaps the most extreme is \" [rebirthing](/wiki/Rebirthing),\" in which the child is wrapped tightly in a blanket and then made to simulate emergence from a birth canal. This is done by encouraging the child to struggle and pushing and squeezing him/her to mimic contractions. [The Bermuda Triangle](/wiki/Bermuda_Triangle)is a region of the Atlantic Ocean that lies between Bermuda, Puerto Rico, and (in its most popular version) [Florida](/wiki/Florida).

They are usually derived from exotic(-sounding) plant life and are often sold over the Internet. [Earth changes](/wiki/Earth_changes)is belief in a period of coming cataclysmic events on the earth based in New Age mysticism rather than scientific evidence. [Earthquake prediction](/wiki/Earthquake_prediction)is the purported ability to accurately forecast the time, place, and size of earthquakes.

[Mobile phone radiation and health](/wiki/Microwave#Mobile_Phone_Radiation)concerns have occasionally been raised as possible causes of immune system dysfunction and cancers of the nervous system, brain, and blood. [Near-death experiences](/wiki/Near-death_experience)are experiences reported by persons who nearly died or who experienced clinical death and then revived. [Neoshamanism](/wiki/Neoshamanism)is a combination of [shamanistic](/wiki/Shaman), [new-age](/wiki/New_Age)spiritual, and other philosophies which include belief in [spirits](/wiki/Spirits), [meditation](/wiki/Meditation)and sometimes the use of entheogens. [Out-of-body experiences](/wiki/Out-of-body_experience)are experiences where a person seems to see the world from a location outside of the physical body. Qua experience, OBEs are real and theory-neutral, but some explanations invoke the paranormal. [Parapsychology](/wiki/Parapsychology)is the study of certain types of paranormal phenomenon. [Phrenology](/wiki/Phrenology)is a theory which claims to be able to determine character and personality traits on the basis of the shape of the head (reading \"bumps\"). [Polygraph](/wiki/Polygraph)/ [Lie detection](/wiki/Lie_detection)are methods used to detect lying and truthfulness in a subject. Its use in [police](/wiki/Police)departments and other [government](/wiki/Government)agencies persists despite its questionable reliability.

Obscure and parody pseudoscience[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_pseudosciences&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] The following are subjects that are sufficiently notable to warrant mention yet still too obscure for any mainstream group (of the sort cited above) to comment on them. They are nonetheless uncontroversially regarded as pseudoscientific: the only people insisting on the topics' scientific status appear to be their lone, respective proponents and, perhaps, a single digit quantity of devotees. Also included here are notable parodies of other pseudosciences and pseudoscientific concepts. [Flying Spaghetti Monster](/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster)is the deity of a [parody religion](/wiki/Parody_religion)founded by Oregon State University physics graduate Bobby Henderson. He created it in response to the 2005 evolution controversy sparked by Kansas's State Board of Education. [Intelligent falling](/wiki/Intelligent_falling)is a parody of [intelligent design](/wiki/Intelligent_design)which attacks gravitation in the same way intelligent design attacks origin theories. [Time Cube](/wiki/Time_Cube)is a proposed [theory of everything](/wiki/Theory_of_everything)which holds that time is cubic. Its creator, [Gene Ray](/wiki/Gene_Ray), finds those who are ignorant of his theory to be \"STUPID AND EVIL.\" - The [Magic 8 Ball](/wiki/Magic_8_Ball)knows! or does to pseudoscience what [The Onion](/wiki/The_Onion)is to [politics](/wiki/Politics). Was it real or a spoof? You decide. Partial pseudoscience[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_pseudosciences&action=edit\u00a7ion=5)] Those subjects that may be genuine science, but many people take them to extremes that surpass the ability of current science to justify, or verify, their claims. [Alchemy](/wiki/Alchemy)is basically [chemistry](/wiki/Chemistry)but without applying the [scientific method](/wiki/Scientific_method). [Audio woo](/wiki/Audio_woo)is making claims for the fidelity of sound reproduction that are unable to be objectively measured or substantiated. [Chiropractic](/wiki/Chiropractic)healing is healing by the cracking of one's back. As long as your problem only lies with your back, then a chiropractor can be helpful (though neck cracking can be deadly). However, a lot of chiropractors go way above \"I can help with back-aches!\" to \"I can cure autism!\" [Cryptozoology](/wiki/Cryptid)is the study of animals whose existence is suspect. Famous examples include [Bigfoot](/wiki/Bigfoot), the [Loch Ness Monster](/wiki/Loch_Ness_Monster), and the [goat](/wiki/Goat)-killing \" [Chupacabra](/wiki/Chupacabra).\" [Cattle mutilations](/wiki/Cattle_mutilation)are cases of domestic livestock with seemingly unexplainable wounds. Sources of these wounds are said to be supernatural, malevolent forces or bizarre \u2014 but terrestrial \u2014 creatures. Another claim ascribes them to the work of [Satanic cults](/wiki/Satanic_Panic). [Exobiology](/wiki/Exobiology)is the study of non-terrestrial life forms. Currently this is a branch of science without a single thing to do except theorise. [Forteanism](/wiki/Forteanism)is scepticism beyond the bounds of reason. [Hypnosis](/wiki/Hypnosis)is an extremely relaxed state in which a person is unusually responsive to suggestions made by the hypnotist. While hypnosis in some sense is almost universally regarded as real, explanations of the phenomenon invoking anything more than just an especially cooperative subject have far less scientific support. In addition, certain applications of hypnosis in psychotherapy, such as [smoking](/wiki/Smoking)cessation and self-esteem improvement, also lack empirical support. [Psychoanalysis](/wiki/Psychoanalysis)is a genuine area of study, but the field has historically been and continues to be dominated by ideas lacking empirical support. [Sigmund Freud](/wiki/Sigmund_Freud)and his ideas are the most prominent within psychoanalysis. Many of his ideas have since been refuted and lack empirical evidence but are still popular in psychoanalysis. [Transactional Analysis](/wiki/Transactional_Analysis)is a non-Freudian approach to psychoanalysis popular during the late 20th century, also lacking in empirical support and best viewed as an arbitrary system of categorizing human interactions. [Myers-Briggs Type Inventory](/wiki/Myers-Briggs)claims to categorize human personality types. - Denialism[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_pseudosciences&action=edit\u00a7ion=6)] [Denialism](/wiki/Denialism) While not entirely fields of pseudoscience, denialism is denying a robust [scientific consensus](/wiki/Scientific_consensus). It often uses forms of pseudoscience such as highly flawed or misleading studies, huge [conflicts of interest](/wiki/Conflict_of_interest), [cherry-picking](/wiki/Cherry_picking), [abusing statistics](/wiki/Pseudostatistics), [making up statistics](/wiki/PIDOOMA) and, denying large swaths of evidence that say otherwise. Denialism by those who have power also tends to have devastating consequences, with many of these denialist movements being responsible for deaths of millions of people. [Anti-vaccination movement](/wiki/Anti-vaccination_movement)is mentioned already, but they do deny or grossly understate the benefits of pretty much all vaccines. [Climate change denialism](/wiki/Global_warming)is the delusion that humans aren't causing climate change despite mountains of evidence saying otherwise. The entire thing can be summed as dishonest cherry-picking on steroids and it is arguably as crazy as other pseudosciences. Also, the deniers in this one tend to be pretty nasty by [abusing FOIA requests](/wiki/Climategate)and [otherwise mud slinging them](/wiki/Tim_Ball#More_lawsuits). They also [oil [AIDS](/wiki/HIV/AIDS)is not caused by HIV, but by something else such as recreational [drugs](/wiki/Drugs)and malnutrition. [Denialism about the negative effects of tobacco](/wiki/Tobacco_smoking)was rampant for decades, with paid tobacco shills downplaying or outright denying these effects, [despite the tobacco industry being fully aware of the dangers long before anyone else](/wiki/Coverup). - In general, whenever an industry is doing something dangerous, they will attempt to [cover up](/wiki/Coverup)studies that show the dangers, and try to fund pseudoscientific \"studies\" that try to downplay the dangers. The [radium](/wiki/Radium), [lead](/wiki/Lead), and [asbestos](/wiki/Asbestos)industries, among others, have been through this song and dance, and any attempt to cover up their negative effects is certainly pseudoscientifical.
