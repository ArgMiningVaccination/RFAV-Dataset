XBB.1.9.1 (Hyperion) -1st descendant of the 9th descendant of the first descendant of XBB -It is not descended from XBB.1.5 (Kraken) XBB.1.9.1 is the first variant to have a clear increased transmission advantage over XBB.1.5 First detected in Southeast Asia in January 2023. By late January it was circulating globally at over 1% and by mid -February over 4% globally. -First appeared on CDC Nowcast on February 27th. It has also been increasing in the United Kingdom and Europe www.fda.govXBB.1.9.1 (Hyperion)17 XBB.1.16 is a recombinant of BA.2.10.1 and BA.2.75 Additional mutations in the spike protein compared with XBB.1.5 -Contains T478R and E180V mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) -ORF9b I5T mutation provides growth advantage The mutations of this variant have been associated with signs of increased transmissibility and a higher degree of infection As of April 29, 2023 represents about 12% of US viral isolates www.fda.govXBB.1.16 (Arcturus)18 Approach to Updating Vaccine Composition: High -level Overview a Continuous* Iterative 3 -Step Process *at least annuallyVaccine Campaign X Manufacturers update their vaccines as recommended and submit data package to FDA for review Step 2Review integrated data to determine need for an updated composition recommendation Step 1 Real world evidence of updated vaccine effectiveness Step 3 VRBPAC strain change decision EUA &/or Approval Vaccine Campaign Y Manufacturers update their vaccines as recommended and submit data package to FDA for review Step 2Review integrated data to determine need for an updated composition recommendation Step 1 Real world evidence of updated vaccine effectiveness Step 3 VRBPAC strain change decision EUA &/or Approval CMC data Nonclinical data Clinical immunogenicity dataAnticipate that this process will apply to all COVID -19 vaccine types moving forwardKaren Broder, MD CDCBivalent mRNA COVID -19 Vaccine Safety UpdateNational Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases Bivalent mRNA COVID -19 Vaccine Safety Update CDC/IDSA Clinician Call May 4, 2023 Karen R.

Euro Surveill . Feb. 23, 2023Clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses are circulating in wild birds and poultry in most regions of the world, with sporadic spillover to mammals, and rare sporadic human infections; other clades of H5N1 viruses are in circulation in some countries H5N1 viruses are well -adapted to infect and spread among wild birds and poultry Sporadic spillover to mammals is not surprising; no evidence of sustained transmission among mammals, no instances of mammal -to-human transmission Nearly all sporadic human cases reported since 2022 had exposure to poultry No indication of human -to-human transmission Expect additional sporadic human infections with H5N1 viruses H5N1 viruses currently lack ability to bind well to receptors in the human upper respiratory tract and lack ability to spread efficiently among people The public health risk is low, but because H5N1 viruses continue to evolve: vigilance and on-going monitoring is needed in animals and peopleSummary/Conclusions Case definitions: -definitions.html Jong et al.
