The state government has issued a notification amending the Drugs and Cosmetic Act, 1945, thereby including ayurveda graduates as registered medical practitioners (RMP) within the meaning of the Act. A copy of the notification is with The Tribune. Describing implications of the notification, Narender Ahooja Vivek, Assistant Drug Controller, Haryana, said it would help in providing medical facilities at the grassroots level, as MBBS or specialist doctors avoid going to villages. He, however, clarified that ayurveda graduates would not be allowed to conduct medical termination of pregnancy or ultrasound tests, since these practices are governed by special laws (MPT Act and PNDT Act) that required higher qualifications and experience. He also clarified that only those possessing Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery (BAMS), Graduate of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery (GAMS) and Bachelor of Integrated Medicine and Surgery (BIMS) degrees from any recognised university would be considered RMP under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and those with degrees of Ayurvedacharya from the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, Prayag, or likewise degrees would not be included in it.
