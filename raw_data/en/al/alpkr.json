Most influenza-associated deaths occur in persons aged 65 yr or older with associated chronic disease ( [3](#B3)). Vaccination to prevent influenza is particularly important for elderly persons who are at an increased risk for severe complications from influenza ( [4](#B4)). [5](#B5), [6](#B6)). A well-designed study to evaluate the effectiveness of dietary supplements on reduction of the severity of symptoms and duration of upper respiratory tract infections has not been approved to date ( [6](#B6)). [7](#B7)- [9](#B9)). In addition, treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia in rats with ginseng was found to reduce bacterial load and lung pathology, as well as to increase immunoglobulin G2a in serum. They suggest that the antimicrobial properties of ginseng are due to its induction of [12](#B12), [13](#B13)). These results suggest that ginseng extract was effective for the prevention of upper respiratory illnesses caused by various viruses. [14](#B14)- [18](#B18)). However, there has been no data accumulated Korean red ginseng for its preventive activity against ARI, as has shown in American ginseng. In this study, to investigate the effectiveness of KRG for its preventive activity against ARI, we administered KRG and placebo to healthy volunteers for 12 weeks. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study design [Fig. 1](#F1)). Subjects who responded and met the inclusion criteria during a telephone screening interview were scheduled for a baseline visit. The evaluation included a physical examination, electrocardiogram, and screening blood parameter study. In addition, subjects were scheduled for a screening visit (within 3 weeks) where the informed consent was reviewed and signed. A random number between 1 and 100 was generated by a computer for each subject. The randomization codes were hidden from all subjects, research staff, investigators and pharmacists until all the data were analyzed. Subjects Study drugs The study endpoint and safety assessment [6](#B6), [12](#B12)). The total number of days of symptoms was calculated through telephone interviews every day until the symptoms disappeared. Safety assessments were in the case of adverse events, and included laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis) and vital sign assessments (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rate). Statistics Ethics statement RESULTS General characteristics of study subjects [Fig. 2](#F2)). The mean age of subjects was 46.0 \u00b1 9.0 yr old (KRG group 45.5 \u00b1 8.3, placebo 46.6 \u00b1 9.6, P = 0.537). There were no significant differences in general characteristics of the study population between the two groups ( [Table 1](#T1)). Alcohol and smoking was more frequent in the KRG group, but there were no significant differences between the two groups (P = 0.110, P = 0.059). Compliance [Table 2](#T2)). Blinding was also maintained adequately during the study period. After the study, 26.7% of those taking KRG and 21.3% of those taking placebo thought they had been given the KRG. Frequency rate of ARI [Table 3](#T3)). In these, KRG and placebo was 12 (24.5%), and 22 (44.9%), respectively. The frequency of ARI in the KRG group was lower than in the placebo group and these findings were statistically significant (P = 0.034). In this study, the absolute risk reduction that absolute rate difference between two groups was 20.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6%-37.4%) and the relative risk reduction which means that giving KRG reduces the ARI was 45.5% (95% CI, 2.5%-69.5%). Symptom duration and score of ARI [Table 3](#T3)). The symptom score (KRG 9.5 \u00b1 4.5 vs placebo 17.6 \u00b1 23.1) was lower in the KRG group than in the placebo group. However, no statistical significance was observed (P = 0.241). Among the symptoms, the frequency rate of cough (P = 0.045) in the KRG group was significantly lower than in the placebo group. The nasal congestion (P = 0.064) and headache (P = 0.059) in the KRG group was lower than in the placebo group, which was marginally significant. Safety assessment [Table 4](#T4)). The laboratory findings for safety, which included hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis, was not statistical difference between the two groups ( [Table 5](#T5)). Supplementary medications, and 16.3% (8/49) of the subjects in the KRG and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.372). Antibiotics (placebo vs KRG, 18.4% vs 6.1%, P and KRG, 12.2% vs 4.1%, P = 0.004) were used for colds and flu respectively. The differences in the incidence of NSAIDs usage between the two groups were not found to be statistically significant. The incidence of antibiotics usage was marginally more common in the placebo than in the KRG group. Anti-histamine usage was significantly more common in the placebo than in the KRG group. DISCUSSION [14](#B14)- [16](#B16), [19](#B19)- [22](#B22)). It has been proven to have a broad range of biological activities including T-cell mediated immune reaction, as well as antioxidant and anti-tumor actions ( et al. ( [14](#B14)) reported the effect of oral administration of KRG on influenza A (H1N1) virus infection. In the study, they investigated the inhibitory effect of KRG extract on plaque formation by influenza A virus in a cell-based plaque assay, and the effect of orally administered KRG on influenza A virus infection in mice. They suggested that KRG could potentially be used as a complementary treatment of influenza A virus. Kaneko and Nakanishi ( [25](#B25)) performed a retrospective study of long term use of KRG in the staff of geriatric hospital. They also reported that KRG has preventive effects on the common cold symptom complex, including flu. However, there was no well designed clinical trial regarding the effect of ARI for KRG. [11](#B11)) compared American ginseng with a placebo in preventing acute respiratory illness in an institutional setting during influenza seasons. In their study, the mean age of volunteers was over 80 yr old, 74% female, and approximately 90% had received influenza vaccine in each of the 2 yr. Confirmation of viral acute respiratory illness was conducted by culture or serology for influenza. They showed that the incidence of laboratory confirmed influenza illness was lower in American ginseng groups than in placebo groups (odds ratio [OR], 0.14; 95% CI, 0.02-0.97). Combined data for laboratory confirmed influenza illness and respiratory syncytial virus illness (OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.01-0.86) were also lower in American ginseng study groups than in placebo groups. This suggests that American ginseng is potentially effective for preventing acute respiratory illness. Predy et al. ( [12](#B12), [26](#B26)) performed a clinical trial that was very similar to our study. The mean age of volunteers was 43, 60% female, and subjects were excluded if they had been vaccinated against influenza in the previous 6 months. The mean number of colds per person was lower in the ginseng group than in the placebo group (ginseng vs placebo, 0.68% vs 0.82%, 95% CI, 0.04-0.45). The proportion of subjects with 2 or more Jackson-verified colds (ginseng vs placebo, 10.0% vs 22.8%, P = 0.004) was significantly lower in the ginseng group than in the placebo group, as were the total symptom score (ginseng vs placebo, 77.5 vs 112.3, P = 0.002), and the total number of days that cold symptoms were reported (ginseng vs placebo, 10.8 vs 16.5, P < 0.001). These results showed that American ginseng had protective effects for ARI. However, the effect of KRG on ARI has not been studied although it is known to have a broad range of biological activities and effect of KRG on influenza A (H1N1) virus infection. In this study, we showed that KRG has a significant protective effect for ARI and decreases the symptom duration and symptom score similar to American ginseng. [5](#B5), [6](#B6)). Most herbal medicine or dietary supplements appear to be safe, and the medical literature supports their effectiveness for certain conditions ( [5](#B5)). Among them, ginseng is one of the most well studied herbal medicines. KRG has a broad range of activity as well as protective effect against ARI, and hence is potentially more effective in combating different emerging strains of virus. "}
