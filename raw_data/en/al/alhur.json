Development of vaccine Current vaccinations available Timing of vaccination Improving ontime vaccination Navigating vaccine hesitancy 1 2 35/10/2023 2 HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS VIRUS THAT CAUSES SKIN OR MUCOUS MEMBRANE GROWTHS (WARTS) THERE ARE OVER 100 VARIETIES OF HPV SOME TYPES CAUSE WARTS, SOME TYPES CAUSE DIFFERENT FORMS OF CANCER INFECTIONS ARE TRANSMITTED SEXUALLY OR THROUGH SKIN TO SKIN CONTACT SYMPTOMS OF HPV IN MOST CASES, THE IMMUNE SYSTEM DEFEATS HPV INFECTION BEFORE IT CREATES WARTS WHEN WARTS DO APPEAR, THEY VARY IN APPEARANCE ACCORDING TO WHICH HPV TYPE IS INVOLVED GENITAL : SMALL AND FLAT, CAULIFLOWER LIKE BUMPS. NO PAIN, BUT CAN ITCH/ FEEL TENDER : FEMALE - VULVA, ANUS, CERVIX AND VAGINA MALE -PENIS, SCROTUM AND ANUS. COMMON : ROUGH AND RAISED. USUALLY ON HANDS/FINGERS. UGLY AND CAN BE PAINFUL- SUSCEPTIBLE TO INJURY PLANTAR : HARD, GRAINY GROWTHS ON HEELS OR BALLS OF FEET. UNCOMFORTABLE AND PAINFUL FLAT: FLAT TOPPED, SLIGHTLY RAISED LESIONS. OFTEN ON FACE, BEARD, LEGS CAUSES OF HPV INFECTION OCCURS WHEN THE VIRUS ENTERS THE BODY THROUGH A CUT OR SMALL TEAR IN THE SKIN (SKIN TO SKIN CONTACT) GENITAL INFECTIONS ARE CONTRACTED THROUGH SEXUAL INTERCOURSE, ANAL SEX, AND GENERAL SKIN TO SKIN CONTACT IN THE GENITAL REGION SOME HPV INFECTIONS THAT RESULT IN ORAL OR UPPER RESPIRATORY LESIONS ARE CONTRACTED THROUGH ORAL SEX PREGNANT WOMEN WITH HPV HAVE A SMALL CHANCE OF PASSING THE INFECTION ON TO THE BABY.

IF A PATIENT HAS A COMMON WART, SPREAD CAN BE PREVENTED BY NOT PICKING THE LESIONS AND NOT BITING NAILS PLANTAR HPV - WEAR SHOES OR SANDALS IN PUBLIC PLACES, POOLS GENITAL HPV - REDUCE RISK BY BEING IN A MONOGAMOUS RELATIONSHIP, REDUCING # OF PARTNERS, USING CONDOMS 7 8 95/10/2023 4 HPV INFECTION MOST COMMON STI WORLDWIDE OVER 40 HPV TYPES SPREAD BY SEXUAL CONTACT 2 TYPES CAUSE GENITAL WARTS ABOUT 1 DOZEN CAUSE CANCERS OF THE CERVIX, ANUS, OROPHARYNX, PENIS, VULVA, AND VAGINA HOW DO THE VACCINATIONS WORK? VACCINES STIMULATE THE BODY TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES THAT, IN FUTURE HPV ENCOUNTERS WITH HPV, BIND TO THE VIRUS AND PREVENT IT FROM INFECTING CELLS VACCINES ARE BASED ON VLP'S (VIRUS LIKE PARTICLES) THAT ARE FORMED BY HPV SURFACE COMPONENTS VLP'S ARE NOT INFECTIOUS BECAUSE THEY DO NOTCONTAIN THE VIRAL DNA VLP'S CLOSELY RESEMBLE THE NATURAL VIRUS THUS INITIATE GOOD PROTECTIVITY TO THE NATURAL HPV VIRUS VLP'S ARE STRONGLY IMMUNOGENIC; MEANING THEY PRODUCE HIGH LEVELS OF ANTIBODY PRODUCTION. 10 11 125/10/2023 5 RECAP VLP'S = STRONGLY EFFECTIVE VACCINE HOWEVER! HPV VACCINATION DOES NOTPREVENT OTHER STI'S HPV VACCINE DOES NOTTREAT EXISTING HPV INFECTIONS OR HPV CAUSED DISEASE CURRENT VACCINES AVAILABLE WHAT THEY PROTECT AGAINST (WHY THE VACCINE IS IMPORTANT) 3 VACCINES AVAILABLE WORLDWIDE GARDASIL GARDASIL 9 CERVARIX SINCE 2016, ONLYGARDASIL IS AVAILABLE IN THE US13 14 155/10/2023 6 GARDASIL 9 PREVENTS INFECTION OF 9 HPV TYPES HPV 6 & 11 CAUSE 90% OF GENITAL WARTSHPV 16 & 18 HIGH RISK HPV'S THAT CAUSE 70% OF CERVICAL CANCERS AND HIGH PERCENTAGE OF OTHER HPV CANCERSHPV 31, 33, 45, 52 &58 HIGH RISK HPV'S THAT CAUSE AN ADDITIONAL 10- 20% OF CERVICAL CANCERS VACCINE SIDE EFFECTS SORENESS , REDNESS , OR SWELLING AT THE INJECTION SITE FEVEROR HEADACHE AFTER VACCINATION TEENAGERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO FAINTAFTER ANY VACCINATION VERY REMOTE CHANGE OF CAUSING A SEVERE ALLERGIC REACTION , OTHER SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH WHO SHOULD BE VACCINATED? VACCINE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE BY THE CDC ADVISORY COMMITTEE OF IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES (ACIP) AGES 9-26 RECOMMENDATION IS FOR ALL PERSONS IN THIS AGE GROUP NOT PREVIOUSLY VACCINATED CAN START AT AGE 9, BUT ROUTINELY STARTED AT AGES 11-12 AGES 27-45 CAN DISCUSS WITH PATIENT IF NOT ALREADY VACCINATED.

AT THAT TIME, THERE WAS NO RECOMMENDATION FOR MALE VACCINATION REDUCED HEALTHCARE EXPENSE FULL VACCINATION REDUCES THE NEED FOR SCREENING REDUCES THE NEED FOR SUBSEQUENT MEDICAL EVALUATIONS BIOPSIES INVASIVE PROCEDURES FROM POSITIVE SCREENS REDUCES ANXIETIES RELATED TO FOLLOW UP CARE MORE FACTS TO CONSIDER: AS CERVICAL CANCER HAS DECLINED IN THE US, HPV OROPHARYNGEAL, VULVAR AND ANAL CANCERS HAVE BEEN INCREASING! 2012-2016 CAUSED MORE OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER THAN CERVICAL THERE ARE NOFORMAL SCREENS FOR THE OTHER HPV CANCERS VACCINATION CAN HAVE HUGE OVERALL HEALTHCARE IMPACT22 23 245/10/2023 9 HPV & CANCER NEARLY ALL ARE CERVICAL CANCER SOME CANCERS OF THE VULVA, PENIS, ANUS, OROPHARYNX ( BACK OF THROAT, BASE OF TONGUE, TONSILLAR) 90% OF ANAL AND CERVICAL CANCERS ARE CAUSED BY HPV 70% OF VULVAR AND VAGINAL CULTURES ARE CAUSED BY HPV 60% OF PENILE CANCERS ARE CAUSED BY HPV 60-70% OF THROAT CANCERS MAY BE LINKED TO HPV (FORMERLY TOBACCO & ALCOHOL) HPV DNA HAS BEEN FOUND IN CANCEROUS CELLS FROM MANY SPECIMENS OBTAINED IN SURGERY CERVICAL CANCER 90% CAUSED BY HPV CAN TAKE 20 YEARS OR LONGER TO DEVELOP AFTER INITIAL INFECTION EARLY CERVICAL CANCER DOES NOT CAUSE SYMPTOMS REGULAR SCREENING IS VITAL TO DETECT PRECANCEROUS LESIONS IN THE CERVIX GUIDELINES FOR CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING AGES 21-29 MUST HAVE A PAP TEST EVERY 3 YEARSAGES 30-65 HAVE A PAP TEST EVERY 3 YEARS OR EVERY 5 YEARS IF THEY HAVE THE HPV DNA TEST AT THE SAME TIME AS CERVICAL SCREENOVER 65 CAN STOP CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING IF THEY HAVE 3 NORMAL SCREENS OR IF THEY HAVE HAD 2 NEGATIVE HPV DNA TESTS25 26 275/10/2023 10 NATURAL COURSE OF INFECTION MOST OF THE TIME, HPV GOES AWAY WITHIN 2 YEARS AND DOES NOT CAUSE PROBLEMS LIKE OTHER VIRUSES, THE IMMUNE SYSTEM CAN TYPICALLY FIGHT OFF HPV NATURALLY WHEN IT STAYS IN THE BODY FOR MANY YEARS, IT CAN CAUSE CANCER IT IS NOT KNOWN WHY HPV GOES AWAY IN MOST, BUT CAUSES CANCER IN OTHERS THERE ARE NO TESTS FOR HPV INFECTION WE CAN TEST CANCEROUS CELLS FOR HPV VIRAL DNA TIMING OF VACCINATION PREVENTION OF HPV INFECTION PROVIDES THE GREATEST PROTECTION TO HPV RELATED MEDICAL PROBLEMS. THE BEST PREVENTION INVOLVES BEING FULLY VACCINATED BEFORE HAVING ANY CONTACT WITH THE VIRUS CONTROVERSY28 29 305/10/2023 11 HPV=SEX NOTMY CHILD! PARENTS ARE WORRIED ABOUT... VACCINE CONTINUES TO RIAL UP CONTROVERSY BECAUSE IT PROVIDES PROTECTION FROM A SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE MOST PARENTS DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE STARTING AGE IS 9-11 MOST PARENTS ARE ALSO CLUELESS ABOUT WHEN THEIR CHILDREN START TO HAVE SEX AND OTHER INTIMATE ENCOUNTERS. TEENAGERS LOVE TO TRY NEW THINGS! 31 32 335/10/2023 12 TEENAGERS...SIGH! 10% OF GIRLS ARE INFECTED BY AGE 15 20% OF GIRLS ARE INFECTED BY AGE 17 12.5 % OF MALES AGED 14-19 38.2% OF MALES AGED 20-24 SEXUAL HABITS ARE CHANGING. INTERCOURSE IS NOT PREFERRED, BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS! NAVIGATING VACCINE HESITANCY DECISION MAKING AROUND VACCINATION BASIC VACCINE FACTS VACCINATION IS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS VACCINATION HAS LED TO THE ELIMINATION AND CONTROL OF MANY DISEASES THAT WERE ONCE COMMON IN THE USA. RECENT OUTBREAKS OF VACCINE PREVENTABLE DISEASE (VPD) INDICATE THAT CONTINUED VIGILANCE IS NEEDED34 35 365/10/2023 13 IMPORTANCE OF VACCINE VIGILANCE HERD IMMUNITY IS NEEDED TO PREVENT PERSON TO PERSON TRANSMISSION OF DISEASES UNDER VACCINATED COMMUNITIES HAVE THE HIGHEST INCIDENCE OF VPD GROWING INCIDENCE OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE AND GLOBAL TRAVEL IS MAKING VACCINATION EVEN MORE IMPORTANT PARENTAL CONCERNS ARE ON THE RISE TOP REASONS FOR NOT VACCINATING INCLUDE : 1.NECESSITY 2.SAFETY 3.SIDE EFFECTS 4.AUTISM 5.VACCINE ADDITIVES 6.LONG TERM HEALTH PROBLEMS 7.TOO MUCH FOR THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO HANDLE DECISION MAKING AROUND VACCINATION INVOLVES A COMPLEX MIX OF SPIRITUAL, POLITICAL, CULTURAL, PSYCHOSOCIAL AND COGNITIVE FACTORS MOST FIT INTO 3 GENERAL CATEGORIES: VACCINE CONFIDENCE LACK OF EFFECTIVENESS SAFETY VACCINE SYSTEM IN GENERAL GOVERNMENTCOMPLACENCY FOR MOST PARENTS, THE PERCEIVED RISK OF INFECTION FROM VPD'S IS RELATIVELY LOWLACK OF CONVENIENCE VACCINE AVAILABILITY VACCINE ACCESSIBILITY VACCINE APPEAL: INCLUDES TIMING, PLACE, CULTURAL AND LANGUAGE CONCERNS37 38 395/10/2023 14 ROLE OF THE PROVIDER, NURSE, AND ANCILLARY STAFF FOR TIMELY VACCINATION WHEN THEY HAVE QUESTIONS, PARENTS WILL SEEK INFORMATION! PARENTS WILL SEARCH THE INTERNET! MANY SITES ARE INACCURATE AND PROVIDE VACCINE NEGATIVE INFORMATION THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF \"VACCINE\" WEBSITES THAT LOOK VERY PROFESSIONAL PARENTS WILL CONSIDER INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THEM FROM TRUSTED HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS 66% OF PARENTS BELIEVE THAT THEIR PROVIDER IS THE MOST VALUABLE SOURCE OF INFORMATION 23% CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THE INTERNET PARENTS WHO RECEIVE INFORMATION FROM THEIR PROVIDER ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE CONCERNS THAN THOSE THAT GET INFORMATION FROM THE INTERNET, FAMILY, OR FRIENDS 40 41 425/10/2023 15 EARLY, HONEST COUNSELING IN THE OFFICE CAN MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WITH VACCINE HESITANT PARENTS AND INCREASE VACCINE CONFIDENCE HOW YOU DISCUSS NEEDED VACCINES KNOW HOW TO ADDRESS COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS: BE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT VACCINE COMPONENTS, ESPECIALLY MERCURY, ALUMINUM. KNOW WHAT A CHILD'S IMMUNE SYSTEM CAN DO AND BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT \"OVERWHELMING THE IMMUNE SYSTEM\" BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ONLINE RESOURCES AAP.ORG CDC.GOV HOW TO BUILD CONFIDENCE STEPS THAT YOU CAN TAKE TO IMPROVE VACCINATION START EARLY DISCUSS VACCINATIONS IN A SAFE AND NON-JUDGEMENTAL SPACE PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT YOU KNOW AND BE TRUTHFUL DON'T BE AFRAID TO SAY \"I DON'T KNOW THAT ANSWER, BUT I WILL GET THAT INFORMATION FOR YOU.\"43 44 455/10/2023 16 PRESENT THE VACCINATIONS WITH A \"DEFAULT APPROACH\" STATE THE VACCINATION RECOMMENDATION AS IT IS DO NOT USE WORDS LIKE: \"OPTIONAL\" OR SAY THINGS LIKE: \"YOU CAN GET THESE IF YOU WANT\" PRESENTING VACCINES THIS WAY HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT PARENTS HAVE HIGHER VACCINE ACCEPTANCE WITH THIS, EVEN IF INITIALLY DESCRIBED AS A LOWER RATING WITH VISIT EXPERIENCE BE HONEST ABOUT SIDE EFFECTS VACCINE RELATED ADVERSE REACTIONS (VAER'S) ARE EXTREMELY RARE DISCUSSING COMMON SIDE EFFECTS OF VACCINES BEING GIVEN HELPS WITH VACCINE CONFIDENCE WHEN THEY DO OCCUR PROVIDE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I WAS CONCERNED AS WELL, BUT.... I WAS SCARED WITH MY CHILD'S FIRST VACCINES AS WELL HERE'S WHAT I COMMONLY SEE AFTER VACCINATIONS46 47 485/10/2023 17 BUILD TRUST WITH PARENTS SPEND EXTRA TIME, IF NEEDED, DISCUSSING VACCINES ADDRESS PARENTAL CONCERNS WITH AN OPEN MIND ASK WHAT MADE THEM HAVE THE CONCERN, WHERE THEIR INFORMATION CAME FROM PROVIDE GOOD KNOWLEDGE KNOW WHAT THE VIS SHEETS SAY, HAVE SOME BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE ON THE DISEASES BEING VACCINATED FOR PROVIDE HONEST ANSWERS DON'T BE AFRAID TO SAY THAT YOU ARE NOT SURE ABOUT THEIR QUESTION. TAKING TIME TO LOOK SOMETHING UP AND RESPOND TO THE PARENTS MEANS A LOT TO THEM ADDRESS PAIN FOCUS ON THE PROTECTION OF THE CHILD AND THE COMMUNITY TALKING ABOUT THE DISEASES THAT ARE BEING PREVENTED AND SUBSEQUENT SIDE EFFECTS IS VERY HELPFUL HOSPITALIZATION INCREASED HEALTH CARE, MORE OFFICE VISITS LONG TERM EFFECTS OF VPD'S DEATH DISCUSS HOW VACCINATION HELPS THE COMMUNITY FAMILY AND FRIENDS THAT ARE IMMUNOCOMPROMISED AND CANNOT RECEIVE VACCINATION THE IMPORTANCE OF HERD IMMUNITY AND THE REDUCTION OF DISEASE AND DISEASE SPREAD49 50 515/10/2023 18 IN SUMMARY HPV IS A VERY COMMON INFECTION THAT CAN LEAD TO WARTS AND CANCER THERE IS A WELL TOLERATED VACCINE THAT, WHEN GIVEN ON TIME AND BEFORE FIRST EXPOSURE, IS VERY EFFECTIVE AND CAN PREVENT INFECTION THE RELATIONSHIP THAT THE ENTIRE HEALTHCARE TEAM BUILDS WILL HELP BUILD CONFIDENCE WITH PARENTS AND SUBSEQUENTLY IMPROVE VACCINATION RATES IMPROVED VACCINATION RATES WILL LIMIT VACCINE RELATED ILLNESS AND REDUCE HEALTHCARE COSTS AS WELL AS OUTBREAKS OF VACCINE PREVENTABLE ILLNESS.
