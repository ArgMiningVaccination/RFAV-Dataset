Feeling some anxiety about receiving any new vaccine is understandable. However, while the COVID-19 vaccine was created and approved more quickly than the average vaccine, safety and testing precautions were not sacrificed to achieve effective results. COVID-19 is a highly infectious and, in some cases, highly dangerous disease. Some populations, including the elderly and persons with underlying medical conditions (i.e., comorbidities) are at greater risk for severe symptoms and even death. Natural immunity combined with vaccine-induced immunity appears to be the most effective means of safeguarding against COVID-19. Advantages of Vaccination Here's how a COVID-19 vaccination benefits you: - Protection against COVID-19: The best means of staying healthy is to avoid infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. If, however, you do become infected, vaccination appears to limit the risk of developing severe or even fatal symptoms. This is because the currently available vaccine primes your immunological system for producing antibodies without causing you to get sick. If you do become infected, your body is prepared to fight the disease. Vaccination typically results in fewer or milder symptoms when you're ill (or no symptoms at all). - Protection for your family and friends: By getting the COVID-19 vaccine, you also lessen the chance of spreading the COVID-19 pathogen to family members, friends, or other people with whom you have contact. - High rates of effectiveness. All FDA-approved medications are clinically tested before release to the public. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been shown to be 94-95 percent effective within two weeks of full inoculation against the original strand of the COVID-19 virus. Vaccines also show high numbers of efficacy protecting people from serious illness from COVID-19 variants. As with any vaccination, some side effects have been recorded. These include soreness at the injection site, headaches, chills, fever, and fatigue. In the great majority of cases, these post-inoculation symptoms will disappear quickly. They are also far less severe than the most serious COVID-19 symptoms. Vaccination and Public Health Safety Measures The availability of vaccines does not decrease the need for safety measures to help beat the COVID-19 pandemic. Even after inoculation, you should: - Practice good personal hygiene, including frequent handwashing - Wear a face mask in public - Practice social distancing - Avoid prolonged contact with crowds, indoors or out The ultimate defeat of COVID-19 requires every tool available: vaccination, natural immunity, and effective public health measures.
