Horny goat weed is an herb. The leaves are used to make medicine. As many as 15 horny goat weed species are known as \"yin yang huo\" in Chinese medicine. Horny goat weed is used for weak back and knees, joint pain, osteoarthritis, mental and physical fatigue, memory loss, high blood pressure, heart disease, bronchitis, liver disease, HIV/AIDS, polio, a blood disorder called chronic leucopenia, viral infections of the heart, bone loss after menopause, weak bones (osteoporosis), and as a tonic. Some men use horny goat weed for sexual performance problems including erectile dysfunction (ED) and involuntary ejaculation. It is also used to arouse sexual desire. How does it work? Horny goat weed contains chemicals which might help increase blood flow and improve sexual function. It also contains phytoestrogens, chemicals that act somewhat like the female hormone estrogen, that might reduce bone loss in postmenopausal women. [](https://www.rxlist.com/nutritional_health_slideshow_vitamin_d/article.htm) SLIDESHOWSee Slideshow Insufficient Evidence to Rate Effectiveness for... - Osteoporosis. Developing research shows that taking a specific extract of horny goat weed for 24 months seems to decrease bone loss of the spine and hip in women who have passed menopause. This particular extract, made by Tong Ji Tang Pharmacal Company in China, contains phytoestrogens (specifically containing 60 mg of icariin, 15 mg of daidzein, and 3 mg of genistein). These chemicals act somewhat like the hormone estrogen. - Postmenopausal conditions. Early research suggests that taking horny goat weed water extract for 6 months can decrease cholesterol and increase estradiol levels in postmenopausal women. - Erectile dysfunction (ED). - Ejaculation problems. - Sexual problems. - Fatigue. - Memory loss. - High blood pressure. - Heart disease. - Liver disease. - Bronchitis. - Joint pain. - HIV/AIDS. - Other conditions. Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate [(detailed description of each of the ratings).](#) Horny goat weed extract is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth, appropriately. A specific extract of horny goat weed containing phytoestrogens has been taken by mouth for up to 2 years. Also, a different extract of horny goat weed containing icariin has been taken by mouth for up to 6 months. However, some types of horny goat weed are POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used for a long period of time or in high doses. Long-term use of these other forms of horny goat weed might cause dizziness, vomiting, dry mouth, thirst, and nosebleed. Taking large amounts of horny goat weed might cause spasms and severe breathing problems. A heart arrhythmia has also been reported in a man who took horny goat weed in a commercial product used for sexual enhancement. Research also shows that a specific multi-ingredient commercial product (Enzyte, Berkeley Premium Nutraceuticals) that contains horny goat weed might cause abnormal heart beats when measured by an electrocardiogram. These changes might increase the chance of having a heart arrhythmia. However, since these products contain multiple ingredients, it is not clear if these effects are caused by horny goat weed or other ingredients.

However, it is not known if this is a big concern. In theory, taking horny goat weed might make bleeding disorders worse. Hormone sensitive cancers and conditions: Horny goat weed acts like estrogen and can increase estrogen levels in some women. Horney goat weed might make estrogen-sensitive conditions, such as breast and uterine cancer, worse. Low blood pressure: Horny goat weed might lower blood pressure. In people who already have low blood pressure, using horny goat weed might drop blood pressure too low and increase the risk of fainting. Surgery: Horny goat weed slows blood clotting and might increase the risk of bleeding during surgery. EstrogensInteraction Rating: Moderate Be cautious with this combination.Talk with your health provider. Horny goat weed might have some of the same effects as estrogen and can increase blood levels of estrogen in some women. Taking horny goat weed with estrogen might increase the effects and side effects of estrogen. blood pressure (Antihypertensive drugs)Interaction Rating: Moderate Be cautious with this combination.Talk with your health provider. Horny goat weed seems to decrease blood pressure. Taking horny goat weed along with medications for high blood pressure might cause your blood pressure to go too low. Some medications for high blood pressure cause an irregular heartbeat (QT interval-prolonging drugs)Interaction Rating: Moderate Be cautious with this combination.Talk with your health provider. Horny goat weed might increase your heart rate. Taking horny goat weed along with medications that can cause an irregular heartbeat might cause serious side effects including irregular heartbeat. Some medications that can cause an irregular heartbeat blood clotting (Anticoagulant / Antiplatelet drugs)Interaction Rating: Moderate Be cautious with this combination.Talk with your health provider. Horny goat weed might slow blood clotting. Taking horny goat weed along with medications that also slow clotting might increase the chances of bruising and bleeding. Some medications that slow blood clotting include appropriate dose of horny goat weed depends on several factors such as the user's age, health, and several other conditions. At this time there is not enough scientific information to determine an appropriate range of doses for horny goat weed. Keep in mind that natural products are not always necessarily safe and dosages can be important. Be sure to follow relevant directions on product labels and consult your pharmacist or physician or other healthcare professional before using.
