Manuli, M.D.", "date": "2020-01-01", "cleaned_text": "Homeopathy is a distinct system of medicine developed in the 18th century by the German physician Samuel Hahnemann. It is still widely and successfully used today in many countries throughout the world. Following the core principle of \"like cures like\", the homeopathic physician carefully takes a patient's symptoms and matches them to a remedy that produces a similar clinical picture, rather than prescribing a medicine that opposes or suppresses the patient's symptoms. How does homeopathy work? The way homeopathic remedies work is very simple - they stimulate your body to heal itself. At its deepest level, your body's default state is one of good health and resilience against becoming ill. However, the physical, environmental, infectious or emotional stressors we face can sometimes throw our body \"out of balance\" and overcome our natural resistance to disease. A properly matched homeopathic remedy gently nudges your system back on track and allows self-healing to take place. The profound and often rapid improvement that occurs after taking a remedy is the result of your body returning to its normal healthy state of balance. What conditions can homeopathy treat? Homeopathy affects all body systems, and has been used to successfully treat acute and chronic conditions including colds and flu, seasonal allergies, pain, gastrointestinal problems, autoimmune diseases, sleep disorders, as well as behavioral issues such as depression and anxiety. Since homeopathy treats you holistically as an individual, rather than as your illness, it can be used to improve symptoms that don't conform to a specific medical diagnosis or fall into a particular \"disease category\". Are homeopathic remedies safe? Since homeopathic remedies do nothing more than stimulate your body to heal itself, they don't produce the harsh side effects commonly seen with traditional pharmaceuticals that target a particular symptom, pathway or body system. They are safe for people of all ages and condition, and are frequently given to infants, children, pregnant women and nursing mothers with excellent results. Do homeopathic remedies interfere with other medications? Homeopathic remedies can safely be taken with prescription medications, and neither one will interfere with the other. As you begin responding to homeopathic treatment, you may find that your dosage of pharmaceuticals can be reduced. We will monitor this together and coordinate with your other physicians to discuss your options, personal preferences and any needed changes to your current medications. "}
