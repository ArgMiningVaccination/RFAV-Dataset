The video surfaced Monday, a day after Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan [wrote](https://theprint.in/india/health-minister-asks-ramdev-to-withdraw-his-unfortunate-statement-on-allopathic-medicines/664041/) a strongly-worded letter to Ramdev, asking him to withdraw his \"unfortunate\" statements on allopathic medicine.

Since then, several clips of Ramdev's addresses, in which he is seen mocking modern medicine, have gone viral on Twitter. Their dates of airing cannot be ascertained, though most of them were broadcast on Aastha channel, where Ramdev's yoga demonstrations with members of the public are a daily fixture. In the aforementioned video, the yoga guru is seen advising a member of the audience on the merits of yoga exercises in strengthening lungs against the virus. , . ? 2021] \"More than 10,000 doctors have died despite getting two doses of coronavirus vaccine,\" he claims. In another viral video, Ramdev can again be heard mocking doctors and ridiculing the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines. He also claims to be a doctor with \"divinity\" and \"dignity\". Nothing more needs to be said Nothing more needs to be heard He is an insult to any religion. At least let him drop the 'Swami' prefix He is as far removed from \"divinity\" could be. \"A thousand doctors have died even after getting the double dose of vaccines. What kind of doctors are they if they could not save themselves?\" he says, as his audience laughs. \"If you want to become a doctor, then be like Swami Ramdev, who doesn't hold any degree but is everyone's doctor. Without any degree, with divinity and dignity, I am a doctor,\" he said. Last week, the Indian Medical Association [had said](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/very-few-covid-19-deaths-among-fully-vaccinated-doctors-but-many-wait-for-first-vaccine-dose-2446002) that over 244 doctors across the country died due to the second wave of Covid-19, but that only seven of these doctors had been fully vaccinated against the virus.
