We studied 6-7-year-old children from Phase Three of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) programme to investigate the association between paracetamol consumption and asthma.

However, a specific description of subtypes of atopic dermatitis depending on the timing of onset and progression of the disease in childhood is lacking. Objective: To identify different phenotypes of atopic dermatitis using a definition based on symptoms before age [6 years](/6-Years/KOLS__b_o.html) and to determine whether some subtypes are more at risk for developing other allergic ... |Also Ranks for: | BACKGROUND: Associations between exposure to cats and dogs and respiratory and allergic outcomes in children have been reported in affluent countries, but little is known about such associations in less-affluent countries. METHODS: The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood, phase 3 was carried out in children aged 6-7 years and adolescents aged 13-14 years across the world. Questions about cats and dogs in the home were included in an additional questionnaire.

Prenatal exposure to a farming environment through the mother might also play an important role. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the role of maternal exposures to environments rich in microbial compounds for the development of atopic sensitization, asthma, and corresponding alterations in the innate immune system in offspring.

Unknown factors between birth and [school age](/School-Age/Influencers__b_t.html) determine the progressive loss of pulmonary function in children with persistent asthma. We investigated the role of allergic sensitisation and [allergen exposure](/Allergen-Exposure/Influencers__j_e.html) early in life.

The genetic factors associated with susceptibility to asthma remain largely unknown. METHODS: We carried out a genomewide association study involving children with asthma. The sample included 793 North American children of European ancestry with persistent asthma who required daily inhaled glucocorticoid therapy and 1988 matched controls (the discovery set).
