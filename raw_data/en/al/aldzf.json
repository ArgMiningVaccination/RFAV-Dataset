Specifically, Chiron is a centaur, meaning he has the head, face, and upper body of a human, and the legs and lower body of a horse. The phonetic pronunciation of Chiron is ''kai-ruhn.'' Although Chiron is not the only centaur in Greek mythology, he is one of the most important because he is the wisest. Chiron is presented as a ''civilized centaur'' because he is more human-like and less beastly than typical centaurs, who were portrayed as violent, wild, lustful, drunk, and/or irresponsible. Often, Chiron has the front legs of a man, with only the back legs of a horse. This visually differentiates him from other centaurs, who typically have four horse legs, and makes Chiron seem more human-like. Chiron from Greek mythology is the son of Apollo, the god of the Sun, the truth and prophecy, diseases and healing, archery, music and dance, poetry, and more. Chiron shares many characteristics with his father. For example, Apollo taught Chiron how to be a healer, astrologer, hunter, oracle, and musician. Because he is the son of Apollo (who had taken on the form of a horse temporarily) and a nymph, Chiron is technically not related to the other centaurs. Rather, the influence of his parents seems to be the reason why Chiron became the wisest and most civilized centaur. Because of his knowledge and rationality, Chiron's main role in mythology was being a wise teacher to heroes. Chiron and Greek Heroes In Greek mythology, Chiron played the role of a tutor or teacher to various heroes due to his wisdom. Topics that Chiron would teach his students include medicine and healing, hunting, battle, music, and basic life skills. In addition to being a teacher of skills, Chiron also acted as a protector, mentor figure, and helper to many heroes, especially in their youth. Although he is not usually the main character in the spotlight of myths, he is important because, without Chiron's influence, many heroes could not have succeeded. One of Chiron's famous students was Achilles, a great warrior from Greek mythology who was a hero of the Trojan War. Later, Achilles taught his own son what Chiron had taught him. Another of Chiron's students was Jason, the leader of a group of heroes from Greek mythology called the Argonauts. According to the myth, Jason was taken from his parents as an infant and was raised instead by Chiron, who taught him everything. Later on, Chiron was also a teacher to Jason's child. Chiron also raised Asclepius, the Greek god of doctors, and taught him about medicine and healing.

Specifically, Prometheus (the god of fire) defied the other gods by giving fire to humans and teaching them what to use it for. Some of the other gods, such as Zeus (the king of all the gods), did not want humans to have fire because it would make them too powerful. Therefore, Prometheus was captured, chained to a rock, and left to die as punishment for his actions. Heracles (a hero and one of Zeus's sons) then made a deal with Zeus in order to free Prometheus so that he could keep teaching humans about fire. Zeus agreed that the life of Chiron could be exchanged for the life of Prometheus. Thus, Heracles used a poison arrow on Chiron. Interestingly, Chiron is the one who taught Heracles about the poison he then uses to kill Chiron. Even though Chiron was a master of medicine and healing, he did not heal himself from the poison and died willingly so that Prometheus could go on living and continue his mission of teaching humankind. Because of this, Zeus placed Chiron in the sky to be honored as a constellation after he died. The constellation Centaurus is supposed to represent "}
