HE 6: 4 Executive Summary Mission: Why We Are Here To improve health and well -being in partnership with our members, patients and community Vision: Where We Are Headed Health as it could be, affordability as it must be, through relationships built on trust Values: How We Act Excellence Compassion Partnership Integrity Integration of Quality, Population Health and Utilization Management To support the Triple Aim values of health, experience and affordability, HealthPartners integrates our quality improvement, population health management and utilization management functions. We can better serve our members because quality, health and experience are integrated across these strategies and programs. To support this approach, we have consolidated our utilization management program into our Annual Health Plan Quality Evaluation. We also include our Utilization Management (UM) Program Description as an attachment to our Quality P rogram Description. Our Annual Evaluation includes topics demonstrating this integration with UM such as Emergency Department Utilization, Reducing Hospital Admissions and Readmissions, a report on the Experience with the Utilization Management Process and our Financial Affordability/Stewardship initiatives. The HealthPartners Quality Council reviews and approves the Annual Quality Plan, Quality Program Description, Annual Evaluation, Population Health Management Program Description and Population Health Reports at various times during the year. Consistent reporting structure ensures our programs remain aligned. All these reports articulate our Triple Aim approach towards program administration. HealthPartners approach to improving health equity and offerin g culturally and linguistically appropriate services (CLAS) aligns NCQA's \"Big Idea\": Quality care is equitable care No quality without equity, Build equity into all programs We have structurally aligned service quality improvement and CLAS programs into our existing Service Quality Council rather than creating a separate committee structure or designated specific staff for each of these activities. 5 Health Improvement Outcomes Performance on publicly reported measures HealthPartners has once again been recognized by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) as one of the top- rated health plans in Minnesota and among the highest -rated plans in the nation. We earned a rating of 4.5 out of 5, according to the NCQA's commercial Health Plan Ratings for 2022. This is the 18th year in a row that NCQA recognized us as the highest or one of the highest performing plans in the state. The NCQA awarded HealthPartners \"excellent\" accreditation status for its health maintenance organization (HMO ), point -of-service (POS) and preferred provider organization (PPO) commercial plans in April 2020. In September 2020, NCQA transitioned to a new scoring system and HealthPartners NCQA accreditation was updated to \"Accredited\" which is the highest accredit ation level that NCQA now designates. Last year, 62% of our commercial HEDIS measures are in the top 25% in the nation, with 31% in the top 10%. All HealthPartners Medicare plans were awarded an overall 5 out of 5- Star Rating from the CMS for 2022. These strong results mean all HealthPartners Medicare members across the health plan's six -state service area - Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota - were enrolled in a 5 -star plan for 2022. Plans that earned a 5 -star rating inc lude: o HealthPartners\u00ae Journey (PPO) and HealthPartners\u00ae Robin (PPO) Medicare Advantage o HealthPartners UnityPoint Health (PPO) Medicare Advantage o HealthPartners\u00ae Freedom (Cost) o HealthPartners\u00ae Minnesota Senior Health Options (MSHO) (HMO SNP) o HealthPartners\u00ae Retiree National Choice Prescription Drug Plan Pharmacy quality measures Due to our ongoing focus on quality improvement related to pharmacy, HealthPartners achieved remarkable results in 2022: 1. Overall unique members who participated in our Medication Therapy Management (MTM) program increased from 8,896 in 2021 to 10,992 in 2022 (23.6%). Total visits 2021 to 18,389 in 2022 (19.2%). Additionally, 97% of MTM participants would recommend the program to family/fri ends. This strong performance comes despite struggle with our network providers having sufficient resources to dedicate time to quality related activities. 2. We also saw strong progress reducing opioid use among our membership. a. From 4Q2021 through 4Q2022, t he rate of chronic high dose (>= 120 mg MME) opioid use among HealthPartners members has decreased 14%. 6 b. From 4Q2021 through 4Q2022, the rate of chronic high dose (>= 90 mg MME) opioid use among HealthPartners members has decreased 14%. 3. In 2022, over $2 mil lion in savings resulted from clinical interventions on high- cost cases driven by pharmacy spend. Of the $2 million, about $1 million in savings resulted from high- cost case management specifically prioritizing members where site of care or network contrac ting interventions were appropriate. HealthPartners received a national award for this program in September 2022 from PBMI (Pharmacy Benefit Management Institute), a research institute dedicated to assisting employer groups with optimizing their pharmacy benefits. 4. Effective 1/1/2022, we've expanded our relationship with OncoHealth so that all oncology drug requests are reviewed by an oncologist. This ensures appropriate use of cancer medications, improving quality, safety, and affordability. a. This program br ings expert oncologists closer to prescribers for case reviews and supports our broader oncology programs and initiatives across the organization. b. Identifies alternative therapies with equal efficacy. c. Improves evidence- based care by covering drugs with str ong literature support; educating providers with peer -to-peer consultations rather than automatically issuing a denial. d. Connects members to clinical trials for cancer types in which drug efficacy is not yet well -established. Behavioral Health Performance and Initiatives Targeted Post Discharge Training: Behavioral health, inpatient, and restricted recipient program case managers participated in training with a focus on assessing for safe transitions of care and avoidance of risks related to readmission. Behavioral Health Lunch and Learns (PTSD, Borderline Personality Disorders, Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar disorder, Schizophrenia, Trauma Informed Care): Case managers received training on a series of behavioral health conditions to enhance their understandin g of complications and risks for readmission. The 2022 goal for the behavioral health case management readmission rate was 16.1%. The 2022 measurement period results were 16.7% for members engaged in behavioral health case management. As we didn't achieve our goal, this continues to be an area of focus. All interventions for this initiative have been integrated into standard care coordination processes and this initiative will continue in 2023. To increase providers' knowledge of Behavioral Health Case Management as a resource for patients with mental health conditions who may have corresponding needs around social determinants of health, HealthPartners Behavioral Health Case Management leaders and staff presented on the Behavioral Health Case Management program to various primary care network providers and clinics. Throughout these presentations, providers were educated on and reminded of the nature of the HealthPartners Behavioral Health Case Management Program, including efforts Behavioral Health Case 7 Managers make to collaborate with and facilitate communication between behavioral health and primary care providers of members engaged in the program, and how providers can refer members for Behavi oral Health Case Management. Focusing on Health and Wellbeing During 2021, we implemented a variety of tactics designed to improve overall member wellness: 1. Expanded myStrength digital resilience solutions to all member plans. 2. Implemented Omada diabetes pr evention and condition management programs. 3. Increased Choice Card benefit for select Medicare plans services beyond what Medicare allows (chiropractic, eyewear, over -the-counter pharmacy items) 4. Offered NationsOTC over -the-counter benefit for select Medicare plans - either as a standalone benefit or as part of a Choice Card 5. Implemented an online mental health hub to promote our mental health resources and help members understand the resources available. 6. Added personalized resources within My Pregnancy exper ience based on member's race, ethnicity, language and/or insurance product. 7. Launched new personalized campaigns connecting members to NowPow and other social drivers of health resources for those who indicated a need via the health assessment. Health Equity HealthPartners engages in a broad array of initiatives designed to improve health equity including: 1. To better serve our African American population, HealthPartners has partnered with Healthy Black Pregnancies. This group provides professional expert ise; knowledge of prenatal African American maternal and child health issues; knowledge of the African American community; and connections to local, national, and international resources and colleagues. Our Healthy Pregnancy care coordinators make referral s to their DIVA Moms program and other support services. In 2022, HP gifted Healthy Black Pregnancies a $50,000 grant to support the formalization of their structure as a 501c3 and to increase access to their support services. 2. HealthPartners PowerUp program is actively trying to reach and recruit more vulnerable communities to participate in our School Challenge. Using the Center for Disease Control's Social Vulnerability Index, we reassessed our recruitment strategy to target socially vulnerable districts and zips codes through partnerships, outreach, and social media ads. With our increased focus on social needs and health equity, PowerUp convened the newly formed Community Health Education Advisory Council at HealthPartners to review and advise on the Pow erUp Family Magazine, distributed to kids and families during the School Challenge. The group provided their perspectives and insights, keeping in mind inclusiveness, cultural relevance, health literacy, physical abilities, body sizes, and social needs. 8 3. In partnership with CHW Solutions, HealthPartners implemented targeted outreach to our diverse MSHO membership to encourage them to get screened for breast cancer. As trusted members of the community, CHW Solutions staff contacted members in their native language when possible and utilized interpreters when needed. The program engaged members who speak English, Spanish, Hmong, Karen, Oromo, Russian, Romanian, Somali, Swahili, and Vietnamese. 4. HealthPartners systematically collects data on race, ethnicity, language and country of origin directly from patients and members in a variety of ways, all of them voluntary. These data collection sources include healthpartners.com, online through our health assessment, and the electronic medical record in our care delivery system and in our dental group. We've found that collecting this information face- to-face from patients at the point of care or health plan contact is an effective data collection method. Across our care delivery system, we have collected race and language information for over 90% of our patients, with language and race collection rates at our hospitals exceeding 97% in 2022. In addition, we receive data from the Minnesota Department of Human Services, Minnesota Community Measurement, and Minnesota Immunization Information Connection (MIIC) for our members covered by Minnesota Health Care Programs. When we combine all these data sources, we have this information documented for over 97% of our Medicaid members under age 65. 5. Starting in 2022, HealthPartners implemented NCQA Health Equity accreditation standards for our Medicaid products. According to NCQA, this accreditation program focuses on the foundation of health equity work and supports health care organizations in evaluating and elevating the health of the populations they serve. Specific focus areas include building an internal culture that supports the organization's external health equity work; collecting data that helps the organization create and offer language services and provider networks that are mindful of individuals' cultural and linguistic needs; identifying opportunities to reduce health inequities and improve care. HealthPartners achieved accreditation status in March 2023. 6. HealthPartners Human Resources team created and shared a colleague diversity dashboard that detailed the racial experiences of colleagues within the organization. Leaders utilize the findings in the dashboard to create annual plans and DEI goals. Experience Outcomes For overall member satisfaction, HealthPartners had the highest member satisfaction among commercial health plans in MN and WI, outscoring other plans in our region for the CAHPS Health Plan Rating for the 15th year in a row. HealthPartners also continues to surpass the national average for customer service. 2022 showed incremental improvement across many measures in our member experience surveys that had experienced declines in the previous year. This includes improvement for key metrics like net promoter score where both commercial and Medicare Advantage sur passed 9 their 2022 goals. This steady incremental improvement is attributed to an organization- wide focus on experience and service. The areas of greatest opportunity based on key driver analysis across measurement tools continue to be access to out -of-pocket cost information before receiving care or filling a prescription and understanding your health plan and how to use it. During 2022, we conducted the following activities to improve member experience: 1. Engagement across member email communications was st rong and increased from 2021. In 2022, we sent 3.8 million email outreaches and had a 55% open rate and 7% click through rate. Both are well above the industry average (22% open, 2 -3% click through). Additionally, those who engaged with our outreach took t he recommended action 25% more often than those who didn't open or click through the communication. 2. Created a financial hub that streamlines and brings better visibility to our cost tools for our members. 3. Implemented quarterly get connected campaigns for Medicaid members without web accounts, using department of human services enrollment file, to create online account and go paperless. 4. Updated our online Plan Directory to add ability to search for nursing facilities and surgical centers (inst ead of just filters), filters for race/ethnicity for doctors, information on language services and added in -network/cost level status plus link to benefits in results list. 5. Implemented the Harper - Digital Chat Assistant experience when members initiate a chat with member services. This chat feature is available 24/7 to members when they are logged into their myHealthPartners account. Harper attempts to assist with various simple and complex questions depending on what the member sends as their chat message. 6. Created online COVID test reimbursement form for eligible members and regularly updated public facing web information with most current details on testing, vaccines, therapeutics, coverage and more. 7. Launched new personalized campaigns connecting members to NowPow and other social drivers of health resources for those who indicated a need via the health assessment. 8. Launched pilot with N1 targeting SNBC members to encourage them to complete a health risk assessment and enroll in care coordination, which inc reased rates of both. 9. Implemented an automated pharmacy prior authorization process, reducing processing time from 10- 20 minutes to less than 20 seconds per case. This auto approval process currently accounts for about 5- 10% of the prior authorization volume. Within the next year, roughly 50 additional drugs will be added to this initiative. 10 10. Beginning in 2022, we used an external vendor (Bolger) to coordinate the order and issuance process for MSHO supplemental benefit items. Members received an order form early in 2022 that included the member's name and ID number. This process eliminated the need for members to call member services to order. Affordability Outcomes HealthPartners Triple Aim affordability approach is built on a strong foundation of activitie s designed to reduce overuse and misuse of resources and to improve the value of services provided to our members. We systematically identify new opportunities and enhance our programs to capture cost savings. In 2022, we identified 37 different affordabil ity strategies encompassing administration, health and care engagement, products and benefits, pharmacy and provider relations. At the end of the year, 25 of these strategies were on track to meet their affordability targets and progress was made on an additional 8 strategies. Examples of key affordability focus areas include: Improve management of high- cost cases by enhancing our ability to support members in their cancer journey through the OncoHealth pilot partnership (Iris Oncology) and through our evolving partnership with our internal pharmacy admin team. Implementing, Now Pow a third party managed and updated community resource directory that will enable member facing teams to make referrals with higher likelihood of member follow -through, replacing less robust in- house maintained directory Support digital channels for engagement in comprehensive care advocacy services: Better engage members in condition support by connecting members to available online resources for condition management and network navigation, and to close targeted gaps in care (aligned with HEDIS) in Core DM programs. Implemented dynamic refill too soon pharmacy processing. Refill too soon limitations are intended to limit stockpiling and waste. The intent is to ensure members are t aking medications correctly and as intended by their prescribing physician. The refill too soon edits in our system control excess fills by members who continuously refill medications early. The system calculates at the member and medication level based on the member's history of accumulation for each medication. The pharmacy sees a point -of- sale (POS) message when a claim rejects for refill too soon. The message includes the date the medication can be refilled, which is based on the member's fill history. Leadership Involvement 1. The Board of Directors has final authority and ultimate responsibility for the quality of care and services provided to members of the plan and for oversight of the Quality Improvement (QI) Program. 2. HealthPartners Medical and Executive Leadership are actively involved in the QI program on an ongoing basis. For more than 20 years HealthPartners has been setting ambitious goals about every five years to improve health in our community. The first set 11 of health goals was developed in 1994. Partners for Better Health Goals 2025 goals are monitored and reported out yearly. 3. Our plan displays commitment to our multiyear goals, through routine publication of an enterprise- wide performance scorecard. 4. The Quality Committee of the Board provides oversight through review of quarterly reports about the progress specific to the QI programs. 5. The Quality Council meets quarterly to actively oversee multiple committees designed to improve quality and Council agendas reflect topics of the QI Annual Pl an. The following committees report up to the Quality Council: a. Pharmacy QUI (quarterly meetings) b. Quality Review Committee (quarterly meetings) c. Government Programs QUI (quarterly meetings) d. Service Quality Council (quarterly meetings) e. Medical Directors Committee (monthly meetings) f. Behavioral Health Committee was added in 2020 g. Additional Enterprise Leadership Committees provide routine reports and support cross- representation on multiple initiatives 6. These committees generally met as scheduled an d there was sufficient committee capacity to address their annual objectives. 7. Charters exist for every quality committee noted above and include goals, objectives, or purpose statements and a list of attendees. Charters are detailed in a separate Quality Program Description. Each committee reviews and updates their charter annually Adequacy and Realignment of Resources HealthPartners evaluates the adequacy of the Quality Council committee structure, practitioner participation, resources, and leadership at least yearly. Evaluating resource adequacy, staffing and technology are an ong oing part of program development and covers both our quality program and our population health management program. This analysis also supports key elements in the annual budgeting and Return on Investment (ROI) assessments for existing programs. During 202 2, HealthPartners acted on multiple opportunities to ensure appropriate staff deployment and make strategic investments in key programs. Staffing: The following key positions support the program: Medical Director and Associate Medical Directors: 5.4 FTEs HealthPartners is sunsetting the position of Senior Director, Behavioral Health Strategy which was previously available on a consulting basis to provide strategic direction and adding a Medical Director for Behavioral Health. This position is currently post ed. President of HealthPartners Institute which leads our Research Foundation and medical education division 12 The plan supports approximately 540 FTEs across the Quality/Population Health Management program up from 496 FTEs in 2021. This total includes analytical resources which support our initiatives. HealthPartners makes a significant investment in and strong commitment to achieving the Triple Aim. During 2022 we realigned staff to better utilize our resources. HealthPartners made significant program shi fts or investments in the following areas: 1. HealthPartners implemented the Health Equity Accreditation Standards and achieve Accreditation status. In second quarter 2022, the organization added a new Senior Compliance Consultant position to facilitate ongoi ng compliance with the Health Equity standards. 2. In 2022, HealthPartners expanded how we partner with community and gather community input by collaborating with the HealthPartners Institute to create a Community Advisory Council for Research and Evaluation. Council members partner with us to understand the needs of the communities we serve and provide input on ongoing and proposed activities to address those needs. This includes providing ongoing feedback on health plan quality improvement activities to addr ess health equity and improve service. 3. HealthPartners implemented a Health Equity Accreditation Steering Committee in 2020 to oversee progress to achieving accreditation. This model was effective and in 2023, we will continue to use this structure to asses s implementation of the Health Equity Plus standards. 4. We are implementing a new technology platform that offers best in class clinical workflow automation and simplifies the documentation process, improves reliability of interventions/decisions, and suppo rts the dynamic needs and dynamic relationships with members, providers, clients, and regulators. This tool supports: a. Workflow automation b. Clinically driven data to inform clinician interactions c. Efficient communication with providers Examples of the functions it will support include: a. Comprehensive Care Advocacy i. Complex medical and behavioral health case management ii. Disease Management iii. Care Coordination programs including SNBC, MSHO, and MSC+ b. Utilization Management i. New provider portal for providers to submit prior auth requests c. Worksite Health i. Work Comp managed care 5. HealthPartners has signed a contract with 1upHealth to support electronic data exchange including implementation of FHIR requirements and standards. The organization has chosen data sharing around colorectal cancer screening as a pilot in 2023. 13 6. HealthPartners is working to create a culture of innovation and joined the Health Plan Innovation Round Table to gain access to new vended solutions offered in the marketplace. Practitioner Participat ion HealthPartners continues to have substantial practitioner participation on our governing board, advisory boards, and QI committees and ad hoc provider advisory groups as needed. This represents input from across the network and a wide range of clinic s ites and practitioner specialties. HealthPartners practitioners participate in the planning, design, implementation, and review of the QI and population health management programs. Their activities ensure program alignment with evidence- based care and over all population management between the health plan, care delivery systems and community partners. Network practitioners serve on our: 1. Board of Directors 2. Quality Committee of the Board 3. Minnesota Community Measurement 4. Quality Review Committee 5. Credentials Committee 6. Member Focused Behavioral Health Advisory Committee 7. Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee 8. New Technology Committee and periodic advisory groups including genetic testing advisory groups 9. Health Equity Accreditation Steering Committee In addition, ad hoc groups and community collaboratives include provider representatives. HealthPartners also conducts several provider surveys to get broader feedback on key topics including satisfaction with the Utilization Management program and how the health plan can support providers by providing culturally relevant resources to support patients of diverse backgrounds. Organizationally, we feel this robust level of practitioner participation helps us achieve exceptional results and we will continue with this level of involvement during the next plan year. Quality Connections Forums continue to be a successful strategy to improve quality across our provider network. Sharing tested strategies provides opportunities for the provide r groups to use effective interventions for quality improvement. Forums are held three times per year to engage network provider groups in quality initiatives to improve publicly reported measures. This group has grown from 5 provider groups in 2012 to 17 in 2022. The meetings offer clinics a forum to share successes, challenges, and results of QI and health equity initiatives. Sharing tested strategies provides opportunities for the provider groups to use tested interventions for quality improvement. Medical Directors make multiple on- site visits to multispecialty care systems, primary care and specialty care providers to sustain engagement in improving clinical care, member experience and affordability. QIC Quality Consultants are actively partnering with HealthPartners Provider 14 Relations and Network Management to educate network clinics on Quality Consultant services and to promote safe, evidence- based care initiatives. Challenges/Barriers to Greater Success Challenges to greater success in health improvement include: 1. The COVID -19 global pandemic has created confusion and concern about members' ability and/or desire to seek preventive care. The health care community is concerned that delays in preventive screenings could result in later diagnosis of cancers, and delays in immunizations could lead to immunization preventable outbreaks in some communities. 2. Variation exists in the provider's ability to collect race/ethnicity data and language data, which can affect our ability to address disparit ies regarding preventative care. 3. Higher member costs for health care including prescription drugs used to control chronic conditions. Out of pocket expenses for members are often increasing due to changing deductibles and co- pays. 4. Difficult to focus improvement efforts for members who are not attributed to a specific care delivery system. 5. Improvement targets need to be flexible as measure technical specifications and star rating cut points are updated annually. 6. Community pharmacies continue to struggle wit h high workloads and staffing shortages coming out of the pandemic. Payment for MTM services needs to be adequate for pharmacies to commit resources to the work. Challenges to greater success with member experiences are related to: 1. The lingering impact of the COVID pandemic along with staffing shortages and clinic availability continued to impact consumers ability to receive primary and specialty care services as soon as needed. 2. The complexity around healthcare and coverage is a barrier to member satisfaction. Members from all products desire information and tools to help them more fully understand their benefits, coverage, and in- network provider options. Members who do not fully understand their benefits and coverage often have trouble seeing the value of their plan. 3. Network wrong clinic usage complaints were the highest complaint for 2022. Members struggle to understand how to use their network. The member education on these network changes varies by employer so some members understand the change while others do not and may use a clinic not in their plan network. The decision to remove our ability to make customer service adjustments by one of our largest plan sponsors when their members used a wrong clinic also contributed to a higher volume of complaints. 4. Benefit complaints related to preventive and non -preventive services remains within our top five complaints as members struggle to understand the difference between these services. 15 5. A continued theme for WI Marketplace members' complaints is related to scenarios where HealthPartners does not manage the issue. In these cases (enrollments, disenrollments, demographic changes and tax credit determinations) we must divert the member to the Federally Facilitated Exchange for resolution. Members are dissatisfied when HealthPartners cannot resolve their complaint directly. 6. Medicaid grievances for 2022 included members concerns with their experiences with Ridecare, clinic networks or experience with clinics, coordination with other insurance, provider billing, general benefit concerns and quality of care. Challenges to greater success with affordability improvement include: 1. As new technologies are striving to increase market share, we see an impact on member requests for specific services, increased expectations of coverage, and third-party vendors appealing on the member's behalf. We expect this will always be a dynamic within the healthcare market, especially as we strive to ensure evidence- based coverage, as vendors are often marketing new technologies once they receive FDA approval, but before the quality evidence regarding effectiveness, safety, and effect on health outcomes is available. 2. We have increasing rates of retirement and interest in part time positions, increasing competition between employ ers based on salary and benefits. This means we are more challenged with having sufficient resources to support increasing volumes of UM reviews. The increasing volumes are related to prior authorization program changes and additional complexity related t o expansion to other regions and changes to other lines of business. COVID -19 has also created resource limitations in addition to challenges with staff burnout and stress from sustained impacts of the pandemic on daily life. 3. Multiple competing priorities of policy development to meet requirements for new technologies, Medicare and Medicaid policies, revision of policies, affordability topics and changes to policies to better support prior authorization programs. 4. Genetic testing rapid pace of new tests, growth of large scale/panel tests, limited clinical evidence, coding and payment challenges. 5. Absence of sufficient evidence on some topics to make an adequate coverage determinations. 2023 Areas of Focus As this report is being written, the world continues to be challenged by the COVID -19 pandemic. Global unrest, rising inflation and staffing challenges create new barriers to affordability, quality and member experience. Despite this difficult situation, HealthPartners remains dedicated to achieving Triple A im quality. Areas of focus for 2022 include: 1. Implementing to improve performance on the organization- wide Partners for Better Health 2025 measures and goals and our organizational Health Equity goals 16 2. Execute our member experience framework, \"See Me, Know M e, Hear Me, Partner with Me\". For example, expand use of personalized member messages for preventive services to our members by providing messages that meet the member's preferences. 3. Assess implementing the Health Equity Plus Standards and if approved b egin implementing the requirements. 4. Invest in technology that supports clinical workflow automation, interoperability, data exchange and accessible data to make informed decisions and improve care for members. 5. Continue to build innovation into our business model so we can implement solutions that drive measurable value to our purchasers and members. Focus on implementing simple and affordable solutions designed to address high frequency, high cost, high variability or complexity. 17 Health - Clinical Quality Improvement Preventative Services Accountable Owner Quality Improvement and Compliance - Courtney McElfresh, BSN, RN Member Populations Targeted x Commercial x Medicare Advantage/Cost/PDP x Medicaid x MSHO HPUPH x WI Marketplace Description Obtaining appropriate preventive care improves health outcomes and can prevent disease in our member population. HealthPartners supports improving the delivery of appropriate clinical preventive services by providing tools and resources to support our members and health care providers. HealthPartners utilizes a data driven approach to identify members in need of preventive service reminders. This program supports HealthPartners strong performance on NCQA ratings, HEDIS\u00ae measures, CMS Stars and Medicaid withhold requirements. We proactively contact members who have not received best care as defined by evidence-based clinical guidelines established by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Based on member preferences, communications are sent via postal mail, email, and text. Many members have access to a secure web mailbox through their HealthPartners portal which enables them to access messages from both the plan and select care providers. Interactive voice response (IVR) messages and h ome testing kits have also been utilized to reach members with preventive health messages. Goals Our goal is to engage, empower and partner with members, patients, providers, and purchasers to achieve the best health for our members. Our objectives include: Educating and facilitating providers and members in the delivery of preventive health care services. Empowering members in self -care around incorporating healthy behaviors and seeking preventive care. 18 Initiatives/Interventions Preventative Care Memb er Campaigns: Internal and external communication channels through targeted campaigns build awareness of the importance of preventative care services for our members. The following preventative care campaigns were deployed in 2022 by HealthPartners: Campai gn Audience Products / Regions Channels Other Notes Breast cancer screening reminders Women age 50 -75 who are due for a mammogram.

Comprehensive care advocacy case managers review preventative service needs with members who are enrolled in case management to ensure that members are aware of what they are due for and how to access the services. 2. A member survey on cancer screening preve ntive services identified cost as a barrier for completing the screening. HealthPartners now includes language in our outreach campaigns about cost as most preventive screenings are covered with no cost sharing for nearly all members. 3. Prepaid Medical Assis tance Program (PMAP) members are incentivized for completing all adolescent immunizations needed by age 13, for completing all recommended immunizations by age 2 and for completing postpartum care between 3 and 8 weeks postpartum. Members are sent a card f ollowing the birth of their baby with information on plan resources, such as the BabyLine, which includes information on both the postpartum incentive and childhood immunization incentive. 4. MSHO members are incentivized to complete a mammogram, colorectal c ancer screening, osteoporosis screening and or an annual wellness visit when they are due. 5. In 2022, HealthPartners continued their collaboration with Virtuwell to offer in- home, self - swab chlamydia screening for health plan members. 6. In 2022, HealthPartner s continued their collaboration with Virtuwell in a ship direct -to- home FIT Kit campaign. Over 53,000 members were eligible and were invited to request a kit through Virtuwell. Once the kit is completed, members are contacted by a Virtuwell provider who wi ll discuss results and next steps. 20 7. Childhood well visits and immunizations continue to be available during the COVID -19 pandemic. We utilize member reminders to encourage parents to keep their child on schedule for childhood and adolescent immunizations and instill confidence in the safety of seeking care. Preventative Care Provider Initiatives: 1. More than half of our contracted care system providers have been trained to, and utilize a proprietary tool, the Patient Management Application (PMA) to help tran slate opportunities into tangible actions that the provider can take to facilitate improvement related to total cost of care, quality measurement and diagnosis accuracy. The PMA provides patient information that can assist the provider in proactively managing patients, fostering coordinated care, facilitating pre- visit planning and customize care models. 2. Public reporting of comparative provider performance is done through the Minnesota Community Measurement and HealthPartners's specific clinical indicators report. 3. Member -specific registries identify members due for preventative screening and are updated quarterly. Providers are notified and encouraged to access the data. 4. Quality Connections Forums engage HealthPartners network provider groups in quality initiatives to improve publicly reported measures. a. Hosted by HealthPartners, the group creates the agenda which includes both preventive and chronic improvement projects as well as process improvements. b. Participants share the latest science and best practice m ethods and share successes and challenges of quality improvement initiatives. 5. Consultations are available from Clinical Quality Consultant RNs for medical groups interested in improving their quality outcome measures. HealthPartners supports network partne rs virtually as needed to support work on HEDIS/Stars quality measures and initiate discussions around the medical group's CAHPS surveys and health equity work. Barrier Analysis/Gaps in Care 1. The COVID -19 global pandemic has created confusion and concern about members' ability and/or desire to seek preventive care. The health care community is concerned that delays in preventive screenings could result in later diagnosis of cancers, and delays in immunizations could lead to immunization preventable outbreak s in some communities. 2. Much of our preventative care communications are done through digital platforms which can be a barrier to those members that have a technological deficit. 3. Some member populations are very difficult to contact and engage; this is especially true with our state public programs members. 21 4. Most, but not all, plans cover preventive services at 100%. Members with health saving accounts (HSA's) and other high deductible plans have a lower completion rate of preventive services than members w ith low or no deductible plans due to the potential for out -of-pocket costs. 5. Preventive guidelines change which can result in confusion for members to know when to start screening, the frequency of screening, and which screening to have done when there ar e multiple options. 6. Medical societies publish and promote consensus -based preventive guidelines that may be inconsistent with the evidence or with other endorsed guidelines which can cause patient and provider confusion. 7. Variation exists in the provider's ability to collect race/ethnicity data and language data, which can affect our ability to address disparities regarding preventative care. 8. Providers have limited resources for testing proposed initiatives and the time and resources needed to make systemic change can be cost ly. By sharing successes and strategies via Quality Connections we support tested interventions for quality improvement. Opportunities for Improvement: Results/Outcomes 2022 Preventative Care Member Outreach Campaign Results Outreach campaigns to members are deployed each calendar year and impact HEDIS\u00ae results for the next measurement year.

HealthPartners supports chronic care improvement by helping our members achiev e optimal care goals and by promoting effective change in provider groups to support evidence- based clinical and quality improvement across a wide variety of health care settings. HealthPartners uses a data driven approach to identify members in need of chronic condition management. This program supports HealthPartners strong performance on NCQA ratings, HEDIS\u00ae measures, CMS Stars and Medicaid withhold requirements. Goals Our goal is to improve the health outcomes of members with chronic diseases and to prevent or delay complications of these diseases. Success is measured by improvement in HEDIS\u00ae rates and on conversion rates for members who received member outreach through postal mailings, emails and disease or case management services. HealthPartners goal for commercial members is to achieve Band 1 performance. HealthPartners also has goals related to achieving a 5 -Star rating for our Medicare Advantage and MSHO plans. CMS uses these ratings to assess and rate health and drug plan quality, performance, and satisfaction of members. The Star Ratings strategy is consistent with the Triple Aim of better care, healthier people and communities, and lower costs. Initiatives/Interventions Chronic Care Member Campaigns: Internal and external communication channels through targeted campaigns build awareness of the importance of chronic condition management for our members. The following chronic care campaigns were deployed in 2022 by HealthPartners: 25 Campaign Audience Products / Regions Channels Other Notes Get matched with a doctor for your care needs - primary care Newly enrolled and unattributed adult members.

HealthPartners provides disease management programs for asthma, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, heart failure, and rare/chronic diseases for all our product lines including commercial, Medicare, and Minnesota Health Care Program (MHCP) members. a. Disease management member materials share condition specific infor mation and education. b. Pharmacy plays an important role in assuring members with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease and heart failure are on medications important to their condition and that members refill their medications on time. c. Disease and case management nurses work with members to navigate the complexity of care involved with these conditions. 2. HealthPartners has multiple initiatives currently in place and in development to ensure our members with chronic diseases receive the services they need to effectively manage their condition. Historically, there have been separate committees and work groups that oversee commercial and Medicare populations. To ensure effective coordination of our initiatives across product lines , several years ago, HealthPartners enhanced the scope of our HEDIS\u00ae oversight committee to also include oversight of CMS Stars measures. To further strengthen the committee, HealthPartners created a sponsor group in 2019 to provide strategic direction. The HEDIS\u00ae/CMS Stars Steering committee provides 27 strategic direction on the many initiatives designed to improve both chronic and preventive care, especially as they relate to HEDIS\u00ae and CMS Stars measures. 3. A published FastFacts article included information on disease, case and lifestyle management services available to our members who use high- cost services or have multiple health issues, are in deteriorating health, or are at high risk of hospitalization in the next six to 12 months. Chronic Care Provider I nitiatives : 1. Chronic disease member registries are distributed to providers and highlight missing or overdue services as well as the status of member's participation in a disease management program. 2. Patient Management Application (PMA) is an excel -based tool that is shared with network provider partners. This tool includes the attributed membership for all lines of business, if appropriate for the network partner. The PMA identifies areas of opportunity in cost, utilization, reconfirmation of chronic condit ions, annual wellness visit completion and incented HEDIS\u00ae measures. 3. The Quality Management Application (QMA) is a Tableau workbook located in the PMA tool which identifies quality performance results and gaps in care for the annual wellness visit, reconfi rmation rate and incented HEDIS\u00ae measures. The QMA is intended to be accessed at a future date through the provider portal. Currently, HealthPartners provides the QMA report in a PDF format to the incented network partners who are set up in the portal. 4. Registries include race/ethnicity and language data when available. 5. HealthPartners monitors condition specific, evidence- based guidelines aligned with USPSTF to assure programs and measures are consistent with current evidence. 6. Quality Connections Forums engage HealthPartners network provider groups in quality initiatives to improve publicly reported measures. a. Hosted by HealthPartners, the group creates the agenda which includes both preventive and chronic improvement projects as well as process improvements. b. Participants share the latest science and best practice methods and share successes and challenges of quality improvement initiatives. Barrier Analysis/Gaps in Care 1. Higher member costs for health care including prescription drugs used to control chronic conditions. Out of pocket expenses for members are often increasing due to changing deductibles and co- pays. 2. Our ability to provide accurate outreach to members is dependent on claims information and thus claims lag can be a barrier to timely identification of gaps in care. 28 3. Inability to identify all retinal eye exam claims for persons with diabetes due to eye benefits increasingly covered by third party benefit carve- outs. 4. Members who do not have an established relationship with a primary care provider may experience fragmented care and lack of coordination from inconsistent providers. 5. Providers experience ever increasing pressure to attend to numerous health goals in a limited amount of time with patients. 6. Providers have limited resources for testing proposed quality improvement initiatives, and the time and resources needed to make systemic change can be costly. 7. State and federal quality impr ovement measures such as those related to DHS withholds and CMS Stars measures continue to change and evolve which can make targeted improvement activities challenging. 8. Some member populations are very difficult to contact and engage; this is especially tr ue with our state public programs members. 9. The pandemic continued to strain medical resources with the ongoing COVID -19 variants, pent up demand, and staffing shortages due to illness and burnout. Providers had to shift care to meet the needs of the members which made it more difficult to receive appropriate medical care in a timely manner. 10. Fear of exposure to the virus for those who must use public transportation or while in the clinics. 11. The pandemic has added to already strained staffing resources with m any medical staff away from work due to isolation/quarantine requirements. This has led to extended wait times for open appointments in both primary care and specialty care. Opportunities for Improvement: Results/Outcomes 2022 Chronic Care Member Outreach Campaign Results Outreach campaigns to members are deployed each calendar year and impact HEDIS\u00ae results for the next measurement year. Campaigns through the Personalization Pipeline included email, website bell notifications, push notifications for myHP app users, text messages, and member services talking points. Campaign Email Bell Push Notification Overall Conversion Rate Regular Doctor Visit Reminder 84,957 89,916 0 24.3% Diabetes Support 21,943 Case Management 30,203 31,685 10,124 N/A Iris Cancer Support 242 248 75 N/A 29 2022 HEDIS\u00ae Results A comprehensive list of HealthPartners 2022 HEDIS\u00ae results for chronic care can be found under the appendices. Sustainability of Chronic Care Activities HealthPartners is committed to building on the efforts noted above to ensure that members are receiving timely chronic care services. Through our HEDIS\u00ae results, it is known that improvement can be gradual and non -linear. System and process changes at the provider level leads to the greatest, sustained improvement, and we continue to encourage our network clinics to utilize best practices in their care. Challenges remain in understanding lack of improvement or decr eases in goals for chronic diseases. We believe the more we can learn about members and the more strategies we use to connect with members, the more effective we will be. Current activities will continue in the next program year with expanded collaborative efforts with Marketing and Health Informatics to identify members by micro- segments and tailor messages that resonate with member values (i.e., cost and convenience). We believe this will improve our current outreach efforts in improving the health of mem bers with chronic diseases. 30 Stars Initiatives Description The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) uses a 5- Star rating system to assess health and drug plan quality, performance and member satisfaction. Higher Star ratings can lead to the i mprovement in the quality of care and general health of Medicare beneficiaries. It supports the effort of CMS to improve the level of accountability for the care provided by physicians, hospitals, and other providers, which drives quality improvements. The contracts for the stars initiatives are as follows: H2462 (Journey/Robin). CMS publishes the Star ratings each year to assist beneficiaries in finding the best plan for them. Reviews are published online in the Medicare Plan Finder. Star Ratings impact the Medicare Advantage quality bonus payments. Plans with higher Star ratings may be able to offer increased benefits and lower premiums. There is a strong correlation between higher rated plans and enrollment which further perpetuates performance. The significance of maintaining a higher star rating: It supports the Triple Aim o Member experience o Member health o Affordability through improvement Ability to retain membership and attract new members hip and enroll year -round Higher CMS payment for Medicare Advantage plans Market differentiator - HealthPartners is a top, high quality plan Goals The mission of the CMS Star Ratings Workgroup is to maintain 5 Star ratings or improve measures from current levels that are lower than 5 Stars. Our objectives: 1. Establish year round strategies to ensure 5 Star ratings or improvement to next star. 2. Identify priority measures with key partners to determine strategies for improvement in these measures. 3. HealthPartners is continuing efforts to advance health equity and it is one of six key strategies in the HealthPartners 2025 Strategic Roadmap. HealthPartners is building a strong foundation to address health equity and reducing disparities with a focus on community partnerships and advocacy. HealthPartners has achieved the NCQA Health Equity Accreditation for Medicaid in 2023 which includes the MSHO population. Please refer to the Health Equity Chapter for more details. 31 Initiatives/Interventions The CMS Star Ratings Workgroup analyzed health plan performance to identify 2022 priority areas based on current rates, gap to goal, and ability to effect a positive change in rates. Methodology Methodology to determine Star rating includes several data sources: 1. HEDIS\u00ae (Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set): medical claims data and chart reviews 2. Health Outcomes Survey (HOS): self -reported health status and outcomes 3. Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS):member satisfaction, c are accessibility, and network navigation 4. PDE/Pharmacy: Part D drugs claims and medications 5. Other: call center metrics, access and performance problems, appeals, complaints to Medicare and enrollment data 6. Improvement Measures: comparison of current and prior year measure scores; score calculated with and without improvement measures. 7. HEDIS\u00ae measures account for approximately 15% of the Star rating and the CAHPS and HOS surveys combined will account for approximately 44% of the Star rating. The CAHPS su rvey is currently quadruple weighted in measurement year 2022 for the 2024 Star rating year. Health Plan Member Interventions: 1. 2022 continued focus on Medicare annual wellness visits (MAWV). Those members who signed up to receive email notifications were sent reminders to complete the annual wellness visit. Approximately 85% of the Medicare Advantage population and 50% of the MHSO population currently have authenticated accounts. For those members who do not have an authenticated account, annual wellness v isit reminders were sent in Q4.The largest provider group did continue to add the AWV to member visits. The annual wellness visit is beneficial to address health concerns, chronic conditions, obtain needed preventive care and an opportunity to discuss topi cs like those listed below: a. Staying physically active (HEDIS\u00ae/HOS) b. Reducing risk of falls (HEDIS\u00ae/HOS) c. Improving bladder control 2. Preventive campaigns continued to run via authenticated accounts. Engagement remains strong across campaigns. a. The Silver Sneakers benefit promotes an opportunity to improve or maintain physical and mental health, staying physically active and reduce risk of falling. (HEDIS\u00ae/HOS) b. Member blogs identifying preparation for appointments and prescriptions. c. Falls Prevention Facebook cam paign in early fall to encourage members to talk to their doctor about their fall risk. (HEDIS\u00ae/HOS) d. MSHO supplemental benefits include health education classes, weight management programs. (HEDIS\u00ae/HOS). There is a community partnership with 32 Juniper which hosts a variety of classes in which MSHO members may sign up and attend as part of their plan benefits. Juniper continued to offer online classes in 2022, which had a positive impact for rural beneficiaries and their ability to attend. Please see MSHO supplemental Benefit Utilization 2022 at the end of this document. e. Members received health assessment mailings which will help determine the health status of members. MyStrength program continues to have above average engagement in 2022. Members are targeted using claims & health assessment (HA) data to identify those with: mental health attributes in the high or medium category (HA results), and/or diagnoses of anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, PTSD, smoking, substance abuse and insomnia. Targeting aligns with myStrength programs. New members are identified & sent campaigns monthly. Members are sent one per year. f. Pharmacy Initiatives: i. Partnership with MSHO care coordinators to increase MSHO Medication Therapy Management (MTM) engagement has been successful and we will plan to continue in 2023 ii. Pay for performance program incentivizing Stars engagement across our MTM network iii. The Mail Order Pharmacy vendor launched an auto- refill program for Medicare members in Q42022. iv. 2022 marked the first year of focused int erventions to improve medication adherence across Medicare Advantage products with care coordinator teams; several tools were built to support this work. g. In 2022 HealthPartners continued to utilize social media, where communication was customized with link s to blogs and customer education. i. Member HEDIS\u00ae specific interventions 1. Breast cancer screening: Those members who signed up to receive email notifications were sent reminders to complete breast cancer screening. a. Screening reminders launched mid October for patients and member/patients i. Member/patients have coverage information and online scheduling call to action embedded b. MSHO member/patients include incentive language c. Three touchpoints: i. Awareness (age 40) ii. Reminder 1 (one year since last screening) iii. Reminder 2 (two years since last screening) d. Translated into Spanish, Somali and Vietnamese for MSHO e. New patients are identified & sent campaigns weekly. Sent max one per quarter. 33 f. MSHO Community Health Workers Solutions provided outreach to select individuals to encourage completion of breast cancer screening. 2. Colorectal cancer screening: Those members who signed up to receive email notifications were sent reminders to complete colorectal cancer screening. Preventi ve care reminders on mobile and blogs, MSHO member incentive. HealthPartners utilized an \"opt in\" Colorectal FIT Kit Campaign through Virtuwell in 2022 to Medicare members in need of colon cancer screening. 3. Osteoporosis management in women with a fracture: The largest provider group enhanced the electronic medical record (EMR) using a Smartform with questions for identified orthopedic patients which populated a standardized Smartest to include a referral for bone health, a referral for DEXA and appropriate labs. A member letter is sent from the health plan, encouraging members to receive follow -up screenings. QIC sends the list of members with a history of a fracture per QIC process. 4. Diabetes care: Kidney disease monitoring, MSHO Chronic Care Improvement Pr ogram (CCIP) focused on diabetic nephropathy and is in it's final year. h. HealthPartners has submitted comments to CMS regarding the member perception surveys and how they are weighted. CAHPS surveys will continue to be quadruple weighted for 2024 Stars. CM S supports the strong body of evidence that better experience is associated with adherence to treatments across a whole spectrum of diseases which identifies a tight connection to clinical outcomes. Provider Interventions: 1. Fast Facts article highlighting annual wellness visits and the importance of falls and physical activity discussions. 2. Fast Facts article highlighting the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) new colorectal screening recommended guidelines to age 45 for screening. 3. Breast cancer screening: the largest provider group reviewed needed screenings in the care model process and provided outreach. 4. Colorectal cancer screening: the largest provider group reviewed needed screenings in the care model process and provided outreach, FIT Kit campaign coordination with HealthPartners care group as they also identified eligible members for FIT kits, 5. Osteoporosis management in women who had a fracture: the largest provider group conducted fracture follow up to facilitate bone density testing or medication prescriptions to treat or prevent osteoporosis within the 6- month timeframe of the fracture. A quality committee met to determine future strategy. Collaboration with incented providers to 34 conduct fracture follow up to facilitate bone densit y testing or medication prescriptions to treat or prevent osteoporosis within the 6- month timeframe. The osteoporosis grant was completed and work continued. 6. Diabetic nephropathy: The largest provider group implemented updated work flows around diabetic nephropathy to increase the frequency of urine testing. Subject matter experts met and determined that the health maintenance alert for the screening should fire eight months after the last screening was complete and turns off when a member turns 86 years old. If due, the microalbumin test is automatically ordered by support staff, which makes it easy to close this gap in care at the visit. This process has been in place for primary care at all HealthPartners Medical Group clinics, and Park Nicollet clinics . This work continued in 2022. This measure retired at the end 2022 and could possibly be replaced by Kidney Health Evaluation for Persons with Diabetes (KED). 7. Falls prevention: HealthPartners Care Group implemented a two question survey for falls risk in the electronic medical record (EMR) Smartset. Providers in the largest provider group have the ability to see the positive falls risk and order a physical therapy order if warranted. 8. HealthPartners continued the incentive program with the network partner s with annual wellness visit completion, select HEDIS\u00ae measures in 2022, and reconfirmation of chronic conditions as appropriate. 9. HealthPartners met with MA incented network partners in the current incentive program with discussions regarding advancing health equity, member experience as well as more robust interoperability opportunities. The network partners continued to focus on social determinants of health (SDOH) by identifying food insecurities and transportation barriers for vulnerable populations and strengthening community partnerships to address the needs of the population. 35 Table 1 2022 Priority Measure Results Color Legend 1 Star 2 Star 3 Star 4 Star 5 Star 36 Table 2.

Medicare Advantage decreased to a 2 Star. Falls Prevention Facebook campaign was completed in September with a reach of 177,089 (total # of people who see the content), 156 clicks, and a click through rate of 0.09%. Barrier Analysis 1. Inability to monitor the full impact of improvement interventions on hybrid HEDIS\u00ae Source Star measures over the course of a measurement period. 2. Inability to monitor impacts of improvement interventions for Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) and Health Outcomes Survey (HOS) Source Star measures over the course of a measurement period. Additionally, CAHPS measures are m ember reported which rely on member perceptions. 3. Difficult to focus improvement efforts for members who are not attributed to a specific care delivery system. 4. Improvement targets need to be flexible as measure technical specifications and star rating cut points are updated annually. 5. Access to care continued to be an issue with pent up demand, and staffing shortages due to illness and burnout. Providers had to shift care to meet the needs of the members which made it more difficult to receive appropriate m edical care in a timely manner in the early part of 2022.

Goals HealthPartners Pharmacy's goals (as detailed in the 2021 Quality Improvement Annual Plan) included: 1. Continue to align our Medication Therapy Management (MTM) activities for sustainability and expansion. 2. Continue to enhance our opioid safe use program to maintain leadership position. 3. Continue to improve and expand pharmacy opportunities in our P artners in Excellence Program. 4. Enhance partnership between HealthPartners Health and Care Engagement (HCE) with pharmacy for high risk and/or other defined members. 5. Leverage pharmacy navigator program to improve member experience in our Medicare Advantage Program. 6. Continue work to automate prior authorization (PA) and appeals process. 7. Achieve best CMS Star Ratings, Pharmacy Quality Alliance (PQA), and pharmacy HEDIS measures. 8. Increase participation in MTM as percent of eligible members. 9. Evaluate results of Slice of PIE Program(SoP) performed to assist and reward community pharmacies in providing MTM services to HP members. 10. Expand member engagement of our price transparency tool and other apps to improve experience. 11. Alignment with organizational strategies for advancing health equity to address unconscious bias; cultivate cultural inclusion. 12. Be proactive about how we review and present data about the populations we serve. Find disparities where they exist so we can begin to strategize how t o address the problems. 43 13. Expand partnership with OncoHealth to drive appropriate oncology medication therapy that ensures access and affordability to oncology medications. Initiatives/Interventions 1. Medication Therapy Management Implemented electronic health record (EHR) tools to identify patients targeted by the health plan for MTM services which allowed for automated pending of referrals to the MTM program during primary care visits and upon discharge from HealthPartners hospitals. o Two new initiatives devel oped to increase MTM Provider network engagement: o The Medicare Stars Partners in Excellence Program(PIE) rewards network providers for engaging high risk members in MTM services. We initiated a \"Take -Back\" program to reattribute members whose network prov iders are not adequately engaging members in MTM. 6 new contracted practices were added to the MTM network in 2022: Drilling Morningside Pharmacy IA, Guardian, Lake Region HealthCare, Lewis Drug IA/SD/MN, Mille Lacs Health MN, NuCara Pharmacy IA. In 2023, we expanded our proactive outreach efforts by adding a 0.5 FTE outreach assistant in addition to our existing staff. This significantly increased our ability to proactively connect with and encourage targeted members to schedule MTM visits. In 2022, we experienced membership growth across commercial and government groups, and added enhanced MTM to two new self -insured groups. To market the value of MTM pharmacists, MTM leadership has re- committed to conducting care system site visits to show clinical, experience, and stewardship data related to care provided by MTM pharmacists. Additionally, we provided patient marketing materi als to increase awareness. We've also provided these types of materials to network providers upon request. 2. Opioid Safe Use Program Provider monitoring programs continue to be used to monitor providers across the network and monitor clinic prescribing patterns. Gold Card Program continues to improve palliative care and oncology providers' access to pain treatment by excluding them from formulary limits. This program is intended to improve service by reducing barriers and improve efficiencies as requests from these providers are generally approved. An update to an opioid audit now allows multiple providers from the same practice location to prescribe a patient opioids. The audit previously flagged and blocked patients receiving opioids from multiple prescriber s regardless of clinic location. This update has only been made for Medicare patients thus far. 3. Health and Care Engagement (HCE) Partnership MTM pharmacists continue to participate in biweekly MSHO and Medicare Advantage case rounds. MTM adds input on specific HP member cases and provides MTM perspective and in some cases interventions when fitting. 44 MTM pharmacists also present to MSHO and SNBC (Special Needs Basic Care) care coordinators to educate on MTM and services provided and encourage referrals. Pharmacy participates in complex case review meetings with HCE, behavioral health, and other clinical teams to discuss high risk patient cases and if there is more that can be done to support the member. Pharmacy's involvement may include referrals to MTM, recommendations for drug changes or optimizations for safety or affordability, and more. HealthPartners' High- Cost Case Management program identifies high cost pharmacy cases in which opportunities may be present to intervene for clinical appropriateness and cost savings. All cases are reviewed by clinical pharmacists and interventions are carried out with multi -disciplinary groups, including patients and their doctors. These cases may be brought for discussion at complex case review meetings with our Health and Care Engagement teams, as well as the clinical teams of our strategic ACO partners. 4. Pharmacy Navigator Program Pharmacy Navigator Program provided additional support for disease and case management, and Riverview Member Services (RVMS) related to affor dability questions. RVMS will call the Pharmacy Navigators if they have pharmacy related questions that they are struggling to answer. Increased collaboration with Medimpact to develop plan for times of turbulence in the community, health systems, or drug supply chains. Continuing to collaborate with the internal pharmacy team to overcome drug shortages through temporary authorization of brand/generic equivalent. 5. Prior Authorization (PA) and Appeals Continuing implementation of #RFIALT initiative in the pr ior authorization process that steers prescribers towards our preferred products at the point of PA request. This prevents some unnecessary denials for non- preferred brands or biosimilars, and steers towards clinically appropriate, more affordable medicati ons. ePA auto- approval expansion: increased number of decision trees(DT) tied to auto- approval Re-implementation processes have led to improvement in the automation of NF/NF PA reviews which decreased challenges previously presented by non- formulary drugs and commercial open plans. Appealed medical cases can now be auto -routed. This decreases administrative burden on the DRT/MRB teams as well as the PA team by the avoidance of emails. The entire process is now systematic. This improves efficiency and decreases wait time for patients receiving care. Created first auto approval DT for Medicare patients and currently running quality analysis on its accuracy. This will determine if we can set up more Medicare DTs for auto approval to help further reduce administ rative burden on the PA team and decrease time to treatment for members. 6. Slice of PIE (SoP) Program 45 To continue having community pharmacist participation and engagement in our MTM provider network, enhanced payment rates for our Partners in Excellence Program participants continued. A financial evaluation of the SoP program was conducted. 7. Price Transparency Tool Continuing to drive member engagement with the Price Transparency Tool though improved accessibility and member awareness. Pricing tool is now available for specialty medications for Medicare patients. 8. Health Equity and Disparities Continued work with Medimpact, CVS specialty pharmacy and other vendor partners on opportunities to advance health equity. This topic is addressed with all vendors. Improving access to healthcare through the Medicare $0 tiers initiative for increased acces s to vaccines. Addressed gender dysphoria with a coverage policy, to ensure appropriate medically indicated coverage based on Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People, Version 8 (SOC -8). Making medications accessible for Medicaid members to ensure that prior authorization criteria does not disadvantage any populations. Inclusive leader cohort: Diversity Equity and Inclusion(DEI) engagement training for staff, embedding work sessions at the department level for discussing DE I initiatives as well as micro aggression learnings have all been initiated. Brought in expert leader in DEI (Barbra Banks) to train and introduce DEI strategy. This laid groundwork for DEI leader engagement on multiple levels including department level work sessions for DEI initiatives and microaggressions. Initiated pay for performance to engage providers in Medicaid referrals to MTM based on low utilization in Medicaid population. Race has been added to adherence dashboard for MTM. Currently gathering information and identifying opportunities to use this information to further address inequities. Initiated work with vendors (Fairview and CVS) to pull race from claims data to identify and address any inequities or disparities that may be present. P&T pol icy and procedures have been updated to reflect its additional function of preventing selection bias or discrimination in HealthPartners' formularies through a non-discriminatory formulary design. 9. OncoHealth This program brings expert oncologists closer to prescribers for case reviews and supports our broader oncology programs and initiatives across the organization. o Insert oncology expertise into the existing HP prior authorization process. o Steer to alternative therapies with equal efficacy. o Do not cover drugs with insufficient literature support; peer -to-peer rather than denial. o Improve consistency and confidence in drug denials. 46 o Connect members to clinical trials for cancer types in which drug efficacy is not yet well -established. Effective 1/1/2022, we'v e expanded our relationship with OncoHealth so that all oncology drug requests are reviewed by an oncologist rather than a generalist. This ensures appropriate use of cancer medications, improving quality, safety, and affordability. Worked with top 20 prov ider groups that care for cancer patients, and worked with them to explain the benefits of making these changes and how to implement this change into their workflow to properly submit prior authorizations. 10. Pharmacy Quality - Medicare Stars, Partners in Excellence Continued focus on increasing pharmacy navigator role in supporting our Medicare Advantage members in partnership with our Riverview Member Services representatives to improve member experience. Developed new reporting and workflows in support of m edication adherence interventions and outreach for our members with MSHO coverage. Added PQA/Medicare Stars medication adherence measures and statin use in persons with diabetes measures to our community pharmacy Partners in Excellence Program P4P opportunity. Created a pay for performance (P4P) opportunity to incentivize improvement in the Medicare Part D Comprehensive Medication Review completion measure. Created P4P opportunity to eliminate DPP4- GLP1 medication concomitant use. Barrier Analysis 1. Medication Therapy Management Testing the components of a risk score to flag patients as well as pulling information out of the risk score has been a difficult process which led to delay in implementing new EPIC tools. Improving community pharmacy engagement in MTM relies on funding to implement, leadership support at each individual pharmacy, and efficient platforms to bolster engagement. In the ambulatory setting, pharmacists face challenges regarding stereotypes and expectations about what a pharmacist should do and how much they should or can be involved in caring for patients in partnership with the rest of the care team. Some pharmacists who practice in clinic have had difficulties finding and keeping a space within their clinic where they can practi ce; this is due to clinic construction projects, turnover and growth of clinician teams, etc. Continue to see missing objective values (BP, A1c, etc.) due to members relying on the telehealth options that were more fully developed during the pandemic. We c ontinue to have high levels of engagement in MTM via phone or virtual visits due to patient preferences. Currently able to take patient -reported BP values but have no way of measuring A1c values besides via lab. Ability to proactively sell enhanced MTM to self-insured groups is limited by internal resources. 47 2. Opioid Safe Use Program Medimpact needs coding in place to more effectively run/support the Gold Card Program intended to improve specific provider access to pain treatments for patients. 3. Health and Care Engagement (HCE) Partnership Interventions in high- cost case management situations often require buy -in from prescribers and patients, and recommended interventions may be voluntary. Therefore, some potential interventions have been unsuccessful due to provider and patient preferences. Health informatics resources that are required for high- cost case management and building a designated queue for this work. 4. Prior Authorization (PA) and Appeals Increasing the number of DTs tied to auto- approval is challenging due to competing priorities for staff working on DT data entry and testing. Currently DTs are reviewed/targeted as they come up for review due to other changes (e.g. formulary changes, suggestions for improvement from staff, compliance concerns, high cost). It is not feasible to complete a larger -scale expansion beyond this due to the need to prioritize other DT changes and competing projects/work of those involved in the DT process(there is no staff dedicated to only DT work). System limitations from MHK still present challenges, although work is currently being done to test new functionality due to a system upgrade in 2023 for multiple overrides. Expansion of the auto approval process into Medicare pharmacy reviews. A pilot in 2022 was started but has yet to be expanded to more DTs. Due to system set -up, Medicare cases continue to need human review and approval for each case, so even with current piloted DTs, human intervention is still needed. Dual coverage still presents a challenge in implementing auto -routing of appeal cases. Appeals Turn -around Time(TAT) differs across different lines of business, so Medhok TAT's are not able to be automated due to the variability of case types, and appeals TAT's. 5. Slice of PIE Program Unable to compl ete ROI evaluation of the SoP program due to losing access to a national commercial claims database that was integral in being able to perform a comparison between the SoP group and a control group. Clinical and engagement results have been positive and ensure the continuation of a SoP cohort for our MTM focused pay -for-performance metrics which provide sufficient incentives for their relatively smaller HP population. Community pharmacies continue to struggle with high workloads and reduced reimbursement coming out of the pandemic. Payment for MTM services needs to be adequate for pharmacies to commit resources to the work. 6. Price Transparency Tool 48 The pricing tool only takes into account the member's primary insurance. For this reason, members who have dual -coverage without coordination of benefits through HealthPartners do not necessarily receive an accurate price. 7. Health Equity and Disparities No national standard or guidance exists related to the role of a health plan, in advancing health equity, addressing unconscious bias, or identifying disparities. 8. OncoHealth When in the process of implementing this partnership, provider practice patterns required change. This presented challenges for providers in needing to change their workflow and how they submitted PA requests. 9. Pharmacy Quality - Medicare Stars, Partners in Excellence We continue to learn which information is most important for surfacing pharmacy intervention opportunities related to Medicare Star Ratings measures. We continue to work on ho w frequent to identify and disseminate pharmacy intervention opportunities. We continue to struggle with our network providers having sufficient resources to dedicate time to quality related activities. Gaps in Care 1. Medication Therapy Management Varying levels of success in engaging members are experienced when comparing different MTM providers within our network. Currently most focused on selling the enhanced MTM program to larger groups with most potential to benefit. As the program improves and resources increase, smaller groups will be targeted more often. 2. Health and Care Engagement (HCE) Partnership Real-Time Pharmacy Benefits are limited to pharmacy benefit medications only. Not all practices have Real Time Pharmacy Benefits implemented into their EHR. 3. Prior Authorization (PA) and Appeals Cannot auto approve for anything for Medicaid that is on the PDL(Medicaid), but drugs where we follow commercial, we can auto approve. This is due to the criteria for non - preferred drugs on the Medicaid list requiring trial failure of other drugs which requires a manual review of chart notes. Opportunities for Improvement: Results/Outcomes 1. Medication Therapy Management Appointment 'no show' rates increased in the care system from in 2021 to 14% (1,192/ 8,308) in 2022. This was likely a result of the additional focus on engaging Medicaid members. Medicaid members accounted for 48% of the 'no shows' in 2022 compared to 35% in 2021. 49 There is an opportunity to partner with network providers to understand how we can optimally support those with low engagement. Community pharmacy engagement in MTM from external provider groups is difficult to increase due to them being autonomous. More frequent touch bases with this group could help improve this. Overall engagement of Medicare Stars targeted members increased from 84.6% in 2021 to 86.7% in 2022 o MSHO and PDP engagement star level 87.5 (2021)>93 (2022)% MSHO 72.3>85.2% PDP o Medicare Advantage will remain 4 star level 86.6%>85.3% o Expected MTM star ratings based upon modeled cut points (official not available until September 2023) Targeted members increased from 22,492 in 2021 to 25,468 (13.2%). The number engaged increased from 5,400 to 8,607 (37.3%). Overall engagement of targeted members increase d from 24% to 26.78% in 2022. MTM Patient Satisfaction: 97% of MTM participants are willing to recommend to family/friends. Network pharmacist visits increased 27.8% year -over-year compared to HealthPartners care system visits increasing by 5.4%. Overall ( not targeted) unique members with MTM increased from 8,896 in 2021 to 10,992 in 2022 (23.6%). Total to 18,389 in 2022 (19.2%). 2. Opioid Safe Use Program Pharmacies are retrospectively reviewed for any outlier patterns of opioid dispensing. This past year there have been no pharmacies that needed to be reported by HP. From 4Q2021 through 4Q2022, the rate of chronic high dose (>= 120 mg MME) opioid use among HealthPartners members has decreased 14%. From 4Q2021 through 4Q2022, the rate of chronic high dose (>= 90 mg MME) opioid use among Medicare HealthPlan50 Among HealthPartners members receiving their first fill of opioid medication (i.e., no prescriptions for opioids were filled in the preceding 120 days), there is an increasing percentage who are receiving low quantities (i.e., fewer than 20 tablets). In 1Q 2017, only 56% of members were receiving low quantities; that percentage improved to 78% in 4Q2022. 3. Health and Care Engagement (HCE) Partnership In 2022, over $2 million in savings resulted from clinical interventions on high- cost cases driven by pharmacy spend. Of the $2 million, about $1 million in savings resulted from high- cost case management specifically prioritizing members where site of care or network contracting interventions were appropriate. o HealthPartners received a national award for this program in September 2022 from PBMI (Pharmacy Benefit Management Institute), a research institute dedicated to assisting employer groups with optimizing their pharmacy benefits. o Improved queue management of high -cost case management is an ar ea of opportunity for improvement. Continued expansion and improvements of the high cost case management program to identify more opportunities and work with our provider community to make positive changes for affordability and clinical appropriateness. 4. Pharmacy Navigator Program For 2022, 208 total members that were running into issues with the coupon accumulator program, coupon maximizer program, or medical injectable site of care (MISOC) program have been supported by the navigator program. See \"Pharmacy Quality - Medicare Stars, Partners in Excellence\" section for no previous fill 120 days prior % of Mbrs with Qty <=20 % of Mbrs withMME <= 10051 5. Prior Authorization (PA) and Appeals 70 brand new DTs were created in 2022. As of March 2023, 734 total DTs are completed or actively being worked on (673 are live in MHK). 6,486 auto approvals were processed in 2022 compared to 5,890 in 2021. Approximately 8.5% of all pharmacy benefit requests were auto approved. Approximately 11.3% of commercial pharmacy cases with a request type of \"Pharmacy PA\" were proc essed through auto approval by the end of 2022. Approximately 7.4% of Medicaid pharmacy cases with a request type of \"Pharmacy PA\" were processed through auto approval by the end of 2022. 134 different drugs are available to be processed through auto approval since the program's inception 10,217 total cases did not need to go to a human reviewer in 2022. This includes 6,486 auto approvals and 3,731 that were not auto approvals (e.g. dismissed by system or withdrawn by provider). Graph of percent auto approv ed over time is below. Less than 2% of all PA's approved for Medicare have missed turn- around time requirements in 2022. o Medical claims have a much longer TAT window so when they get to the PA team, the Medhok TAT shows as a miss, but the claim TAT has not been missed. From 2021 to 2022 staff productivity was maintained at about 12 cases per hour Increase comprehensive trai ning of all team members to decrease knowledge gaps resulting from turnover. Cross -trained staff on processes to diversify skillsets. Processes included medical policy, DMR (direct member reimbursement), DCM (denied claim management), RFI, and intake (logging faxed requests). 6. Slice of PIE Program 12 community pharmacies have been enrolled. 52 593 patients were provided MTM services as a result. o 2 Gold Winners o 1 Silver Winner 7. Price Transparency Tool Of the 480,519 medical members who logged into their HealthPar tners account, 20,371(4.2%) accessed the Medimpact Price Transparency tool in 2022. 8. Health Equity and Disparities Increased access to vaccines for all lines of business. Engaged 70% more Medicaid members in MTM services in 2022 compared to 2021 as a result of the P4P initiative. 9. OncoHealth OncoHealth has exceeded 24 out of 24 timeliness metrics. We have seen a reduction in appeals and overturns for cancer drugs since expanding our partnership with OncoHealth. For Employer and HP savings, there was $10.7 mil lion in cost avoidance over the course of 2022 Oncohealth is in the process of updating their platform. This will go live in June 2023. This will align their system capabilities more closely with our custom formulary. This will lead to an improvement in operations and efficiencies. OncoHealth will begin reviewing medical exception requests with site of care for oncology drugs which will improve efficiency and quality and safety. 10. Pharmacy Quality - Medicare Stars, Partners in Excellence We experienced year over year improvement on 7 out of 15 potential Star measures across our Medicare contracts. 53 For Medicare CAHPS patient experience measures, which were a focus of our pharmacy navigator effort, we saw: o Improvements of 1- 2 stars on 4 out of 6 measures and equal performance on the other 2 MSHO saw significant performance drops. In October of 2022, MSHO adherence became a top priority for our MTM pharmacists in collaboration with the MSHO care coordinators . Effects were not significant due to the late start and limited opportunity to effect final outcomes, but increased knowledge and expertise on how to operationalize the work sets us up well for 2023. Out of a potential of 5 community pharmacy Partners in Excellence Community Pharmacy Awards, only 1 award met P4P criteria (CVS pharmacy achieved silver performance for high performance on the 3 Medicare Part D Stars Adherence measures) For MTM Partners in Excellence, 4 practices achieved gold level performanc e and 4 achieved silver level performance. For our DPP4- GLP1 concomitant use program, 45 successful interventions occurred in the first 6 months of the program. 54 Safety Member Populations Targeted X Commercial X Medicare Freedom (Cost) X Medicaid X MSHO HPUPH X WI Marketplace Description Safety is a top priority for the HealthPartners organization. HealthPartners is dedicated to function as a high reliability organization by consistently delivering on the triple aim, providing a culture of safety, and creating a safe and healing environment for everyone. The importance to report all safety events and member feedback is essenti al to us becoming a high reliability organization. HealthPartners is committed to eliminating harm due to error in the delivery of medical care. Hospital and patient safety is addressed by many organizations including The Leapfrog Group, The Joint Commiss ion, The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and America's Health Insurance Plans. However, less research has focused on patient safety in the ambulatory setting, including group practices, yet members are receiving the greatest proportion of their care in these settings. Safety is top priority for our organization. Everyone at HealthPartners plays a role in creating a safe and healing environment. We recognize errors can occur during the care delivery of patients, and that these errors are a sourc e of significant suffering, illness, cost, and death. A \"culture of patient safety\" is an essential factor in the care delivery model of an organization. Goals HealthPartners will demonstrate its commitment by reducing errors for our members and patients w herever they receive care by: 1. Enhancing the knowledge base about safety through our experience and research. 2. Supporting care delivery systems by establishing standards and expectations related to safety. 3. Working collaboratively with government and private groups to improve safety. 4. Establishing safety measures and reporting results to members' physicians and practitioners. 5. Training health care professionals to be competent in health care practices that improve patient safety. 6. Reporting and investigation of quality issues such as medical errors, potential medical errors, patient safety issues, and service issues. 55 Initiatives/Interventions 1. The 2023 Ambulatory Patient Safety Toolkit was updated and is available at www. healthpartners.com . 2. Completed an annual assessment of member safety, communication of safety improvement opportunities to providers, and updates to safety improvement tools. 3. HealthPartners continues to be involved with the MN Health Plan Collaborative which reduced the rate of new chronic users of opioids in the Medicaid and Medicare population. 4. Implemented a comprehensive approach to pain management. 5. Safety indicators are incorporated in the measures that define the tiered provider networks for member informed decisions about network selection. 6. The Medication Therapy Management (MTM) program continues to expand and improves coordination of care and medication safety of our member and patients. 7. Improved strategies to minimize the abuse of drugs, including a continued focus on pain management. 8. Distributed Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Patient Safety indicator comparative results to hospitals. 9. Alerts sent to providers whose prescribing dosages were outside of safe limits. 10. Identified and initiated interventions for overprescribed medications and diversion, such as quantity limits and enhanced prior authorization review requirements. 11. Identified high -risk medications in the elderly and initiated interventions through the MTM program. 12. Identified members using medications newly identified with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) safety concerns and sent safety alerts. 13. Supported a safe network of care through a robust credentialing program. 14. Worked to improve patient understanding of health information by reviewing and simplifying patient education materials, letters, and forms across care delivery clinics and hospitals. 15. Continue to utilize \"Keep It Simple\" - a glossary of preferred terms to use in member and patient communications and \"Teach Back Method\" - for patient teaching. 16. Prioritized key communications for updates to improve member understanding. 17. Posted stories about pain and medication management on our social media sites and worked with the local media to raise awareness of the public. Barrier Analysis HealthPartners identified three key barriers to patient safety; member awareness and knowledge of best safety practices, practitioner knowledge and the use of improved systems to ensure safe care is delivered. Member knowledge: 1. Interactive safety tools are available through the Drug Interaction Checker and the Health Information Library online at www.healthpartners.com . 56 2. HealthPartners broadened access to telehealth and telemedicine services so that members can receive a wider range of services from their providers without having to travel to a healthcare facility. 3. When a member has a new prescription for an opioid and they get a refill, a letter is sent explaining some of the risks of opioids and giving information about other treatments that help manage pain. Members are encouraged to talk to their doctor about their options. 4. Members now have access to MTM services across the county. 5. When Special Needs Basic Care (SNBC) members refill their prescription, their care coordinator will work with them, so the member uses their medications safely. Practitioner knowledge: New and revised USPS TF guidelines and pharmacy alerts are shared with providers via electronic provider communications and Fast Facts Newsletters. Electronic prescribing prompts are used whenever possible to steer practitioners to safe and effective first -line medications. Physicians and practitioners are encouraged to use the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines and other health plan endorsed guidelines as a resource and encouraged to recommend the clinical guidelines for patients to review, which can be accessed on the USPSTF website. Systems issues in the organization: 1. Quality of care issues involving safety are shared with involved physicians and practitioners and, if warranted, an action plan is requested. 2. Tracking/monitoring of quality -of-care concerns is routinely done to identify areas requiring follow -up. 3. HealthPartners has been a key partner in the development and support of the Minnesota Health Information Exchange; resulting in a statewide source of translated documents providing information on patient medications, easing the task of medication reconciliation, and improving information availability across different care systems. 4. HealthPartners has worked to assure clear communications through support and delivery of interpreter services, translated materials and programs to address low health literacy and promote health equity. 5. A safety and patient feedback reporting and tracking system were implemented across the organization. 6. Pharmacy has implemented new pain prescription guidance documents sy stem wide. 7. Continue to work with our clinics and hospitals to make sure they are using best practices and adopting the Minnesota Opioid Prescribing Guidelines. 8. HealthPartners focuses on ensuring consistent safety across the organization. New roles were cr eated to help align pharmacy and safety protocols across the organization to ensure safe medication administration and alignment with industry standards. Opportunities for Improvement: Results/Outcomes HealthPartners MTM Program continues to show an elevated level of patient satisfaction with 97% willing to recommend (agree and strongly agree) our MTM pharmacists in 2022. 57 HealthPartners members use their pharmacy benefits more often than any other benefit offered by the health plan. As such, pharmac y measures represent a comprehensive and broad- based measure of overall patient safety. HealthPartners has multiple programs to ensure appropriate prescribing. Pharmacy measures help the plan monitor efforts to reduce inappropriate care, ensure best treatm ent practices are followed and reduce the potential for harm.

Concerns are categorized as quality of care, access to care, provider communication and behavior, coordination of car e, technical competence and issues related to the provider, facility and/or environment affecting patient safety. These categories include concerns regarding quality of service and/or care. HealthPartners conducts quality case reviews on all categories exc ept access. Total number of investigation and evaluation of quality -of-care case reviews Year Count SE 2020 1315 2021 1243 2022 1575 60 Total number of quality concerns received from Member Services in a rolling 36 months 61 62 Health - Compliance Activities Withhold: Emergency Department Utilization Description Non-urgent use of emergency department (ED)services is a recognized problem, driving high health care costs and preventing continuous primary care. The lack of coordination and continuity of care between emergency departments and primary care providers can lead to lack of follow -up care, redundant testing, and even medical errors. At one time, HealthPartners data suggested that up to 70% of all ED visits fit the categories of either non -urgent or primary care treatable. More recent monitoring of HealthPartners member ED usage shows that the use of the ED for care that could more appropriately be received in another location has decreased significantly for all products (approximately 31% for Medicaid, 24% for commercial and 25% for Medicare Advantage members) but there is still opportunity to improve these rates. In 2020, the COVID -19 global pandemic dramatically impacted the way that people accessed care across all places of service. At the onset of the pandemic, the Governor's orders impacting medical care, directed that non -essential care should be delayed. At the same time, we saw a significant drop in ED use and care systems ramped up their telemedicine offerings to offer alternatives to in- person care to continue to meet patient needs while mitigating the risk of exposure to COVID -19. Some of these changes were temporary, while others will likely continue to be part of the new normal for health care delivery going forward. Ensuring that members use a site of care that is appropriate for their condition is directly related to all three objectives of the Triple Aim. Coordination of care and access to the right care at the right time will promote health and improve the member's quality experience. By providing the best care in the most appropriate site, costs reflect care received. To address this issue, HealthPartners has implemented a multi -pronged approach that addresses the key drivers of avoidable ED visits, while encouraging members' use of services in an appropriate setting and developing a relationship with a PCP. Through the efforts detailed below, the rate of ED use among HealthPartners members has dropped significantly. Goals The goal of this project is to decrease non- urgent ED use among all populations with additional emphasis on public programs members Reduce avoidable ED visits, to achieve an overal l 25% reduction in ED visits to meet the DHS withhold Educate members about where to go for care Improve access and availability of alternative services Create care strategies to reduce avoidable ED visits 63 Initiatives/Interventions HealthPartners initiatives focus on three key areas: member education, improving access to primary care, and initiating innovative care strategies. Member Education In 2012, our CAHPS scores showed that over 25 percent of Medicaid members did not know where they should go for after-hours care. To address this lack of awareness, HealthPartners launched a member education and communication campaign in partnership with our clinics and community organizations. Using an algorithm developed by New York University (NYU), we identified members with low intensity ED claims or were related to problems that could have been treated in primary or urgent care settings. Members who had two or more low -intensity visits received an outreach call from a nurse. This program continued until late i n 2017, when we changed from this reactive approach to educating members about the best location of care to a more proactive approach. Currently HealthPartners utilizes micro- segmentation analysis to identify members who are at high risk of potentially using the ED and develops personalized messages to educate them prior to ED use. 1. HealthPartners deploys micro segmented communication strategies via e- mail, push notifications into member on- line accounts, through the HealthPartners app and by member servi ces. There are two versions of the message for members who are likely to use the emergency room. One message to members who are more likely to choose urgent care and one to members who are more likely to try on- line care as a replacement to the ED. More t han 1,300 members received this outreach in 2022. 2. The urgent care message includes information about the closest urgent care to their home address and is tailored with a sample condition that they are likely to seek care for - such as an ear infection or back pain. 3. Other personalization campaigns that potentially impact ED use include messages about video visits for primary care, extended hours for primary care clinics and a provider match campaign. 4. At the outset of the pandemic, we encouraged our membe rs to establish online accounts to increase the ease of communicating the changing situation. This increase in online accounts allowed us to provide regular communication to members about their options for care. We continue to encourage members to establis h online accounts and share their email address to support these outreach efforts. 5. HealthPartners offers the book, What To Do When Your Child Gets Sick to local public health partners. They distribute it to clients at home visits and provide education on how the book can help them make appropriate decisions about their child's care. With the onset of the pandemic, home visits were largely curtailed by family home visiting agencies, so this intervention showed little impact in 2020 or 2021. We will continue to offer these books to local public health through our Government Programs County team. 64 6. CareLine is our 24/365 nurse line which is a powerful tool to provide access to medical advice outside of regular clinic hours and is a valuable internal partner in supporting members to access the right level of care at the right time. CareLine staff are trained to triage situations and assess medical need for treatment. They can advise to wait until the member is able to be seen by their primary care provider, or they may direct people to the ED. a. HealthPartners developed multiple CareLine promotions to educate members about the support provided and how to access it. b. Sometimes CareLine nurses encourage members to visit the ED as the most appropriate option for their care needs. Following these ED r eferrals, nurses contact the family to understand the outcome of the visit and assist with any needed follow -up. 7. Community education is a valuable component when working to change behaviors that have been normalized over a long period of time or when a member is new to the healthcare system and unsure how to get the care they need. HealthPartners has collaborated with community organizations to share key messages and reach those who are connected to those organizations. a. HealthPartners distributes a \"Resources at Your Fingertips\" guide that includes Member Services, CareLine and virtuwell contact information to help members easily seek advice. We share the guide at health fairs, clinics and in the emergency department at Regions Hospital. Improve Access HealthPartners recognizes that many people choose the ED at times when clinics are open because it is more convenient than having to schedule an appointment. To address this behavior, HealthPartners worked to make care easier to access. 1. The health plan cont inues to fund a Nurse Practitioner at the HealthPartners Medical Group St. Paul Clinic to offer walk -in care. This is a supplemental position to the Urgent Care that operates daytime hours there. When this position was established, we promoted this option by mail to all Medicaid members in the surrounding area. 2. Urgent Care access is an important strategy to ensure people have alternatives to the ED. Urgent care hours have been expanded at almost all of our care group locations to increase the availability of non- emergent care. Extended clinic hours (from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.) and weekend hours also help us keep members out of ED when a lower level of care is best. This is communicated to patients and members in a variety of ways. a. Most of our care group urgent care locations have full day hours that run in- tandem to primary care to increase access to same- day care. b. Urgent cares have implemented a \"Save My Spot In Line\" option. In conjunction with a feature that indicates the estimated wait time, this allows pati ents to decrease their on- site wait time. Besides being a convenience factor, it also decreases the number of sick people potentially cross -contaminating others in the waiting room. 65 c. Urgent care locations that do not have the Save my spot in line option have implemented an option to choose a virtual visit as an alternative to in- person care. The virtual visit can be requested with one click on the clinic locator site. d. Virtuwell and Doctors on Demand are on- line care providers that are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Members can access care options instantly without an appointment and certified clinicians typically provide treatment plans within just 30 minutes. We promote these care delivery options in member materials and in a variety of plan communications and have seen steady increases in usage. Care Strategies Minimizing the dangers of fragmented care communication between our partner emergency departments and our network clinics is a health plan priority. Regions Hospital, Children's Hospitals and Clinics and Methodist Hospital have implemented communication between their ED and HPMG and Park Nicollet Clinics. The hospitals electronically share ED visit summaries including the reason the member sought care and the ED discharge instructions with the patient's primary care provider. Each clinic proactively contacts the member to schedule appropriate follow -up care. Regions Hospital expanded this discharge notification to include select community clinics and more are being added to expand this initiative. The health plan created an educational tool for residents at Regions Hospital on the efforts around appropriate ED use, education on PMAP and restricted recipients to support residents' understanding of the program. Barrier Analysis 1. The changing situation with the Covid -19 pandemic may have created unease with the healthcare system and potentially created a situation where members may have felt they needed care but couldn't access their normal source of care. 2. The demand for health care services coupled with staffing shortages at some locations made access to routine care appointments difficult in 2022, which may have compelled people to seek care at the ED when they would normally have gone to their PCP. 66 3. EDs often \"fast track\" care to low -intensity patients, making the wait times shorter for those members and limiting the inconvenience factor. These disparate priorities between segments of the health care system send mixed messages to members. 4. Member perception that care received in the ED is higher quality than care received in a primary care clinic. 5. Lack of convenient appointments and keeping scheduled appointments can be a barrier for some members - particularly younger members who seek immediate access. 6. Lack of member knowledge concerning the kinds of services urgent care clinics and convenience clinics offer. 7. Lack of member knowledge of locations of urgent care and hours of operation. 8. Lack of knowledge on when it is appropriate to seek care in the ED and when to seek other optio ns for care. 9. Members are not asked for payment at the ED, making the cost of care a non- issue. Opportunities for Improvement: Results/Outcomes By targeting interventions to those areas where the greatest impact can be seen, we have achieved a reduction in our low -intensity ED use as well as the overall rate of ED use and have met the overall reduction goal for this withhold. The sharp increase in ED use in November 2022 coincides with the sharp increase in RSV and flu activity in Minnesota. This increase is evident in both the Medicaid and commercial populations. Tables 1 (Medicaid) and 2 (Commercial) clearly show the dramatic decline in ED use in March and April of 2020 at the onset of the pandemic. As the year progressed, and throughout 2021, the usage of the ED did normalize, and has now returned to a more predictable cadence. We will continue to monitor the relationship between all locations of care and the impact to ED usage. HealthPartners Internal Monitoring Emergency Room Monitoring Me dicaid 67 Table 2 Emergency Room Monitoring Commercial Table 3 The raw number of ED visits for all products has fluctuated over the past several years due to membership growth. The percentage of all ED visits that are considered non- emergent is an important metric to evaluate ED usage. This measure has consistently trended down across all products until 2022, when both Medicaid and commercial saw a very slight, not statistically significant bump. This c ould be reflective of the access issues that clinics are experiencing considering staffing shortages. As you can see, the use of the ED among Minnesota Health Care Program members remains higher than among our commercial population. We will continue to monitor the ED use by all populations. Encouraging appropriate ED use has positive 68 effect on our members as they receive care in the most appropriate setting and costs for unnecessary care is limited. Medicaid Commercial Medicare Advantage Telehealth Telehealth visits include both e- visits (on -line care such as virtuwell and Doctors on Demand) and telephonic care which is provided over the telephone without a video component. E -visit use has increased among MHCP members each year, however usage in 2020 escalated quickly at the onset of the pandemic. As the pandemic continues and people's health care usage normalizes, we see that usage of telehealth has trended downward, but is still significantly higher than pre- pandemic usage. This could indicate that for a certain segment of the population, telehealth has become a more comfortable form of care, while others prefer to 69 return to traditional care. We will continue to monitor these rates and how other locations of care are impacted. Conclus ions/Lessons Learned The disruption to the health care system during the COVID -19 pandemic cannot be over -stated. It is difficult to draw conclusions on the impact of the traditional interventions employed to encourage members to get care at the best locat ion for the care they need. Recurrent communication around the ever -changing COVID -19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 supported members in decision making on where to go for care. Now that the immediate crisis of the pandemic has subsided, we will need to stay v igilant to ensure members do not slip back into old habits of care. Effective communication with members is dependent on our ability to reach them. During the pandemic, we encouraged members to establish an online account and share an email address to facilitate communication. We had limited success with our Medicaid members in establishing online accounts. Our Medicaid members are less likely than our commercial members to have an online account for member communication. Within the Medicaid population, people of color are less likely to have an on- line account than White members. While this clearly is not causal, members in the Black/African American, Indigenous and Hispanic populations have a higher ED use rate, making our ability to communicate with t hem more urgent. 70 Commercial Online accounts 54% Medicaid ED visits / 1000 Overall Medicaid On -line Accounts 45.1% Black/African 185.4 White 55.1% 318.6 We have learned that some people who utilize the ED for low intensity reasons are open to more appropriate alternatives. However, there are some patients who use the ED for non- urgent care and prefer to continue to use the ED in this way. Based on conversations with the CareLine nurses, many members have indicated that the ED fits their needs, and they will continue to use it for care as they choose. Partnerships between hospitals and primary care providers enhances communication and improves continuity of care by enabling clinics to contact their patients and coordinate follow -up care. Personalizing educational messages about alternatives to the ED in a way targeted to member beliefs and motivations effectively changes behavior. Sustainability of the Act ivity HealthPartners is committed to building on these efforts to ensure that members are receiving care in the most appropriate setting. We will continue to implement creative strategies such as virtual care, expand access and walk -in clinics to improve easy access to care. We will also support and engage members in decision making that leads to the best health outcomes for themselves and their families. 71 Withhold: Admissions and Readmissions Description Avoidable hospital admissions and readmissions are a leading driver of health care costs. These rates remain higher in the Medicaid population compared to the Commercial population. HealthPartners closely monitors these measures and builds them into our provider reimbursement methodologies, including our total cost of care model. Since 2012, the Department of Human Services (DHS), per state legislation, has identified these as improvement measures for the managed care organizations that provide Medicaid and MinnesotaCare services, and they are contractual financial withholds. HealthPartners has implemented numerous initiatives designed to reduce avoidable hospital admissions and readmissions and thus achieve our withhold, but more importantly, to improve the health of the members we serve. Goals HealthPart ners analyzes our performance to understand the trends and drivers behind our hospital admission and readmission rates and identifies strategies to reduce these rates. DHS will provide HealthPartners with our 2022 withhold performance rates in July 2023. D HS will conclude the financial withhold when we achieve a 25 percent reduction from our 2011 baseline rates. Withhold 2011 Baseline 2014 Rate 2015 Rate 2016 Rate 2017 Rate 2018 Rate 2019 Rate 2020 Rate 2021 Rate 2022 Goal 2022 Rate* 25% through 12/2022. HealthPartners Health Informatics department tracks admission rates monthly through the Monthly Utilization tableau report which attempts to replicate the measure based on the DHS Technical Specifications. DHS typically provides us with pr eliminary data quarterly, and we receive our final data in July of the following year, in this case July 2023. Initiatives/Interventions Efforts to decrease hospital admissions and readmissions continue to be a challenge for HealthPartners. The Covid -19 pandemic and resulting access issues with the health care system added complexity to these measures. HealthPartners has a designated workgroup to monitor admission and readmission trends, conduct root cause analysis, identify opportunities for improvement and determine next steps. During the pandemic, the activity of this work group was limited due to changes in the nature of admissions and demands of staff due to the COVID - 19 pandemic, but renewed focus has been directed to these measures. 72 The findings of this group have consistently shown that the social drivers of health directly impact utilization of services, including admissions and readmissions. There has been significant research in this area and the workgroup felt it is important to note that impact , especially among our Medicaid members. In addition, as a health plan, we under -utilize our own internal member support resources such as care coordination and MTM services. Automation of referrals into these programs are attempting to improve access and acceptance of these services. Collaboration between the health plan and our care system to identify high risk members who may be at risk for hospitalization or re- hospitalization provides an opportunity to impact these measures. The admissions/readmissions work group examines existing initiatives and makes recommendations for additions or enhancements as appropriate. Standard activities continued in 2022 to support our members include Comprehensive Care Advocacy (CCA) Services, Medication Therapy Management, Care Coordination, and Population Health. Comprehensive Care Advocacy 1. Members identified for CCA services include those with complex medical and behavioral health conditions or poorly managed chronic conditions that are at high risk of future hospitalization. Our goal is to improve member self -management of their complex or chronic conditions. Both Complex Case Management and the Inpatient Case Management programs can directly impact risk of future admissions including readmissions. Toward that end, Complex Case Management nurses provide tailored disease management education to members with complex, high risk health conditions to minimize or prevent complex or catastrophic health events. Inpatient Case Management helps to coordinate appropriate dis charge care and perform post discharge calls and outreach to members who have been hospitalized. Included in these efforts are the following targeted interventions: a. Post-discharge/transition support for all members participating in Case Management services who experience a hospital admission. b. Connection to Medication Therapy Management (MTM) services for members with complex medication regimens or medication adherence concerns. c. Holistic assessment and care planning with interventions tail ored to address the member's unique needs, barriers, and identified clinical gaps in care. d. Enhanced EMR communication, for real time communications with the treating care-team. e. Collaboration and coordination with care team members including PCPs and healt h care home nurses, home care providers, MTM/pharmacy resources, and community - based providers. 73 f. Inpatient Case Management services to support real time identification and engagement of high- risk members to ensure milestones and care plans are implemented before discharge. Including transition support and referral into CCA services and connection to providers and community -based resources. g. We partner with Lutheran Social Services (LSS) to outreach and assess high risk PMAP members residing in greater Minnesota whom HealthPartners was unable to reach through our traditional outreach methods. Lutheran Social Services utilized local staff within the geographic areas and conducted telephonic/in-person (during non- pandemic) assessments upon successful contact. Those members reached by Lutheran Social Services were warm -transitioned into our services/programs for ongoing support. h. We send email appointment confirmations from our engagement specialist to members who have agreed to engage with a nurse for case or disease management. With increased sustainability of engagement of at least 30%, we have an increased ability to impact utilization and improve health. i. Our health plan and clinic systems use NowPow to connect members with resources to impact social drivers of health. Medication Therapy Management 1. Our MTM program utilizes a medication risk score to pr ioritize outreach to members for MTM services. a. The score includes calculations intended to identify members who may be at risk of having a medication interaction based on multiple medications prescribed, special dosing instructions and other risk factors. b. Flagging the medical record of patients with a qualifying medication risk score began in 2021. 2. Automation of the MTM referral/enrollment process began in October 2022. a. Automation ensures that every patient within our care group or discharged from Regions Hospital with a qualifying medication risk score and HealthPartners insurance with MTM coverage will receive a referral to the MTM program. b. Utilization of MTM program referrals to connect members/patients with pharmacists to prevent, identify, and resolv e medication related problems. 3. Provider Interventions: HealthPartners Medical Group (HPMG) and Park Nicollet Clinics receive daily discharge notifications from hospitals. They have implemented outreach processes for post -discharge calls with patients. Care delivery uses an algorithm to identify those who may be at especially high risk for readmission to prioritize patient calls and ensure they are scheduled for follow -up with their clinic in a timely manner. a. Transitions in Care is a transitional care manag ement system that was launched in early summer of 2022. A specific billing code is used which not only reimburses providers for treating patients with complex medical conditions during the 30- day post -discharge period but also enables us to identify and cl osely follow these members/patients that may need additional services. 74 b. The care group is working to optimize patient after visit summaries to ensure valuable information is passed on to the patient. Ensuring the patient has complete and accurate informati on about recommendations and follow -up supports the continuity of care plan in EPIC. c. Communication hand offs to next level of care and follow up appointments are established with the EMR. There is a grid for the common wraparound services and transitional levels of care available to most patients following a discharge. These options are evaluated by the discharge planning team and communicated within the medical record. d. There are six care coordinators for Medicaid members in the Regions Emergency Departm ent. These care coordinators can help connect members to resources and support them to access resources that can result in avoiding an admission. e. Park Nicollet care system implemented a text -first communication approach to reach patients following dischar ge. A text message is sent via a texting platform and asks a series of automated questions to help assess a patient's risk for readmission. Based on the patient's answers, the platform automatically notifies the care team of their responses and nurses prioritize those who need attention. f. The HPMG/Park Nicollet care system has a predictive analytics tool embedded into Epic. Risk of Unplanned Readmission alerts assist in identifying patients who are at risk of readmission by looking at the following components: age, demographics, diagnosis, medications, order type lookback, lab lookback and utilization. Inpatient case managers document readmission risk in a note prior to discharge for access by the clinic team. g. The health plan and care group utilize NowPow/UniteUs to connect patients and members with resources to mitigate social drivers of health with referrals to local resources via a comprehensive resource directory. 4. Community paramedic services are coordinated through the care system to provide certain care. Network clinics and hospitals use Community Paramedics (CPs) and EMTs to conduct home visits to support members after discharge and reduce the likelihood of readmission. CPs are experienced 911 paramedics with additional education to provide non-emergency care to members and help manage chronic conditions. We coordinate follow -up to hospital discharge through the hospital, based on individual need; we coordinate additional services with providers as appropr iate. We also identify members that may have trouble getting to the clinic for care or could benefit from a home visit. We offer extensive experience running this model through our Regions, Methodist and Lakeview Hospitals and understand the value it brings to the rest of the care team and the member. We currently support and pay for community paramedics to perform services, as approved by DHS, including: a. Health assessments b. Chronic disease monitoring and education 75 c. Medication compliance d. Immunizations and vaccinations e. Laboratory specimen collection f. Hospital discharge follow -up care g. Minor medical procedures approved by the ambulance medical director Current diagnoses that can be referred to our CP program include but are not limited to congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pneumonia, and stroke. As the benefits of these visits are recognized, the diagnoses that are targeted for visits continue to expand, and partnerships with Community H ealth Workers allow additional needs to be addressed. CP home visits include: a. Measurement of vital signs b. Performing physical exams c. Reviewing upcoming appointments or assistance with scheduling follow -up d. Medication reconciliation, education, and compliance checks e. Connecting members to community resources f. Conducting home safety assessments g. Reinforcement of dietary recommendations We currently have a team of 10 Community Paramedics for a total of over 5 FTEs. During 2022 our Community Paramedics worked in two distinct areas of patient care. a. Community Paramedic Discharge follow -up - our traditional post -discharge hospital follow -up program, aimed at reducing readmission and improving patient safety and satisfaction. a. This group of patients completed a tradit ional hospital stay and then had home visits from our Community Paramedics once or twice a week for up to 4 weeks. b. Hospital@Home - Community Paramedics are the primary in- person care provider for the Hospital@Home program. a. The HealthPartners Hospital@Home program is designed to treat acutely ill patients in their home in lieu of hospitalization. The program admits patients who otherwise would be admitted to the physical hospital and brings the hospital care to the home. b. The team includes hospital medicine physicians, nurse clinicians and community paramedics (CPs). i. The CPs visit the patient at home twice per day and provide medication administration, lab monitoring and other care, while also facilitating a telemedicine visit with the physi cian each day. ii. Our nurse clinicians provide plan of care phone calls to each patient daily as well as screen, triage and support the admission process. 76 5. HealthPartners Community Senior Care program offers care for seniors where the patient is located - in their home, a nursing home, transitional care center or assisted living center. a. Care At Home sends medical teams to the home of MSHO and Medicare Advantage patients at risk of readmission; this care team includes both Advance Practice Nurses (NP) as well as MDs. b. To reduce readmissions due to symptom management, care teams ensure that comfort care appropriate geriatric focused care is provided after discharge at the location the member is going to reduce the likelihood they will be readmitted for sympto m or pain management. The medical team works with the staff at the TCU or nursing home to provide the appropriate level of symptom management. The team will also focus on comfort care approaches when appropriate, accessing palliative care and hospices serv ices, which are part of the team. The Community Senior team works in partnership with hospital, specialty, and primary care providers in the care group, utilizing a common medical record insuring safer transitions. Barrier Analysis 1. The impacts of COVID -19 on the health system in 2020 and continuing through 2022 cannot be overstated. a. Members may have been unable to access their primary care clinic to monitor ongoing health issues or were unwilling to go in person to their clinic due to the pandemic. While t elehealth visits filled that gap for many members, some conditions require in person labs or other tests that may have been delayed or avoided altogether, resulting in gaps in care for chronic conditions. b. Members with pre- existing conditions are at higher risk for poor outcomes if they do have COVID -19 which could result in more likely admissions to our members with chronic disease. c. Staffing shortages are widespread across the health care system in Minnesota. This can impact clinics' ability to conduct the routine follow -up with patients after a hospital discharge. 2. Member access, preference, and education are barriers to engaging in care. Members may decline supportive services to enhance their health such as care coordination or home care. Or there may be difficulties in communication to enact those services, such as lack of follow -up to outreach calls or care coordination or bad phone numbers may limit the program's ability to reach out to the member. 3. Members may avoid preventive or chronic care maintenance until a health issue has escalated to the point of hospitalization. a. HealthPartners care coordination is delivered telephonically, and this could be a barrier for some members without a phone or who have limited minutes on their phone plan. b. HealthPar tners continues to conduct member education and outreach regarding preventive care and appropriate ED use. 77 4. HealthPartners CCA review admissions for members involved in complex case management to identify if there was a point when we could have taken action to improve the outcome and avoid the admission. Case managers also work with members who are having planned admissions to ensure that transitions into the hospital and home again go as smoothly as possible. This transition planning includes medication rec onciliation, communicating with the primary care provider or other specialists and assisting with accessing and coordinating additional home resources. Gaps in Care Post-discharge follow -up and care is crucial to reduce the 30 -day readmission rate. This i s a focus for members participating in disease and case management (DCM) services. Additionally, for the broader population, work is already being done with community paramedics, fire fighters, and population health nurses at clinics and hospitals to reduc e readmission rates. Inpatient case managers work to increase the coordination between the health plan and our hospital providers to ensure a smooth transition from inpatient to home, to decrease potential readmissions. In addition, to improve care coordin ation, our hospital case managers can access risk -stratified patient data. Opportunities for Improvement: Results/Outcomes Our DHS preliminary results as of January 2023 [for 2022] show our admissions rate at 2.34/1,000 and our 30- day readmission rate at 11.73%. We will continue our internal monthly monitoring of 2022 results with claims run out. We will receive the final report in June of 2023 from DHS which will include full claims run out. Admissions Data: Our internal monitoring shows our Medicaid admissions trend at 33.9 for 2022. This is a decrease from the final 2021 rate of 36.9 and aligns with the withhold preview provided by DHS. Final withhold results will be received from DHS in June 2023 which will determine any potential withhold return for this measure. 78 Table 1 Readmissions Data Internal monitoring of the 30 -day All -Cause Hospital Readmission rate for PMAP and MNCare shows the readmission rate is 1 point higher than the same time last year. Table one shows the variation over time of this measure. 79 Table 2 Readmissions for Memb ers in DCM In 2022, a total of 615 Medicaid members participated in CCM care coordination services for at least 60 days. Of these, 374 experienced a hospital admission, and 94 experienced a readmission within 30 days yielding a readmission rate of 25.13%. In 2022 the total number of members participating in CCA support increased slightly but resulted in an increase in the 30-Day All -Cause Readmission rate from 2021 of 17.49%. Members participating in CCA services are at high risk of readmission due to thei r complex medical needs, and the unique circumstances. In 2022, while the overall admissions were relatively stable compared to 2021 at 60.8%%, the overall readmission rate increased significantly. In addition to providing post discharge/transition support to members, CCA nurses collaborate with the care team, members and the CCA Medical Director and psychiatrist for all members experiencing readmissions. CCA nurses review and update each member's care plan to address any gaps or barriers. As well as prov ide resources for SDOH, and address basic needs, and provide decision support and education. 80 Sustainability of the Activity Our internal monthly hospital services report provides ongoing results and analysis. More detailed analysis will occur as triggered by these reports. The work groups will continue to monitor trends in admissions and readmissions and adapt interventions to respond as needed. 81 Withh old: Annual Dental Visit Dental Service Utilization Description Oral health is an important part of overall health and wellbeing. According to the Academy of General Dentistry, there is a relationship between oral health and health complications such as stroke and heart disease as well as prenatal issues. The Annual Dental Visit (MSHO, MSC+ and SNBC) m easure is a contractual withhold for our SNBC and Seniors Contracts with the Department of Human Services (DHS). DHS identified dental measures as a priority for the Medicaid population as many members do not receive their annual dental visit which could i mpact their overall health. In 2022, the Annual Dental Visit measure has a value of 15 points. Goals The specifications for both withholds correspond to the NCQA HEDIS 2018 Technical Specifications for Annual Dental Visit, with expanded ages to include adults 19- 64 years of age and seniors 65+. For each contract year, our goal for SNBC and Seniors is to increase the percentage of members in each age group who receive an annual dental visit by a 10% relative improvement from our baseline rate toward the ultimate goal of 80% of members receiving an annual dental visit. Annual Dental Visit Withhold Performance Measure Baseline (2018) 2022 Goal 19-64 41.72% 46.34% We monitor monthly through internal reports from HealthPartners Health Informatics Department and with the data provided by DHS in July and October of 2022 and January of 2023. DHS provides our final performance in June of 2023. Improvement Acti vities Access to dental providers has been identified as an ongoing issue for Medicaid members in Minnesota. The reimbursement rate is a well -documented barrier to dental clinic access. HealthPartners is committed to ensuring that our members can receive t he dental care they need and have implemented several targeted interventions to support those efforts, and this withhold. 1. HealthPartners Dental Plan continuously works to add additional dental providers to our dental network. Statewide, we have over 900 c linics in our HPCare dental network. 82 2. To assist members to locate a dentist who is accepting new patients, HealthPartners created a State Public Programs Navigator role within Member Services. Member Services representatives can look to this navigator for assistance with dental support on complex benefits, provider access and as a resource for community services when non-plan benefits are needed. 3. HealthPartners dental staff met with staff interpreters to share information on the importance of dental care and the need for members to get preventive care. This assisted the interpreters in encouraging their clients to seek dental care. Information was shared on how to schedule dental visits. Some interpreters work at clinics where medical and dental services are co -located which allows them to further assist members to make appointments. 4. A product of the collaborative SNBC Dental Project is the Medicaid Dental Services Grid. This grid outlines relevant dental benefits and incentives available to members of the Medicaid health plans and CBOs. It is updated annually and continues to be shared with county staff, our C&TC partners and clinics as requested. 5. SNBC and MSHO Care Coordinators discuss the importance of dental care during their interactions with members and assist the member to find a dentist or schedule an appointment when needed. Barrier Analysis In 2022, the actual number of dental visits by members of state public programs increased compared to 2019 pre- pandemic numbers, however the rate per product did not increase due to a much larger number of members eligible to receive dental care. This reinforces many of the dental clinic -based barriers identified below result in lower rates of care when there are more members eligible for the limited number of services available. For example, limits that dental clinics place on the number of Medicaid members they are willing to see resulting in lower rates when there are more members seeking care. Additionally, the current staffing crisis across the dental care sector contributes to a constrictor of available care for everyone. Barriers to Medicaid members receiving dental care are well documented. 1. In many areas of the state, there are limited dental clinics, and the clinics may not be accepting new Medicaid m embers. Providing the Dental Navigator service lessens the burden on the member to make repeated calls to multiple clinics to find an open clinic. 2. Dental clinics identify low payment rates and high appointment fail rates as reasons they limit the number of Medicaid members they serve. HealthPartners hopes that upcoming increases in the reimbursement rate will have a positive impact on this issue. 3. In analysis of our own dental clinics service of Medicaid members, we identified that following outreach efforts, the volume of Medicaid patient visits increased, but the number of unique members did not increase at the same rate. As more members 83 received pr eventive care and issues were identified, more visit slots were taken up by follow -up restorative care, potentially causing the unintended consequence of limiting access to more new patients. 4. Dental clinics have long identified high 'fail rates' among Medicaid patients as a reason to limit appointment access to that population. If the patient does not complete a scheduled appointment, that is an appointment lost to another patient and lost revenue to the dental clinic. HPDG conducted an analysis of the fail rate at a primarily commercial practice and compared it to a high Medicaid- patient population clinic. The fail rate at the Medicaid clinic was 18% compared to 7% at the commercial clinic for a 12-month period. This data reinforces the concern of failed appointments to this population for dental clinics and combined with the issue of low reimbursement rates helps to explain why they may limit access to Medicaid members. 5. While outreach to Medicaid members results in success in scheduling appointments, staff has identified a lack of correct phone numbers as a barrier. 6. Dental care is often a low priority for seniors; especially those who have dentures. Many believe that they do not need to see a dentist regularly if they do not have their own teeth and only seek treatment if they experience problems. MSHO Care Coordinators educate members about the importance of dental care. 7. The covered benefits for both MSHO and SNBC can also be barriers. Often the services that are needed are not covered by the benefit set. 8. Transportation is often a barrier to care for Medicaid members. If the closest dental clinic with availability is not in their community, RideCare approves transportation outside of the typical distance parameters so they can get to the dental clinic available to them. 9. Language and cultural issues can play a role in members understanding the need for dental care. Even among English- speaking populations, low health literacy related to preventive care is common. The educational efforts with the interpreters used by our dental clinics are a strategy to create opportunities to educate members and help to mediate health literacy gaps. 10. Social and financial stressors have a strong impact on a person's ability to prioritize health care. Members enrolled in Medicaid are by definition low -income and may experience many of the social determinants of health that are barriers to seeking dental care. These may include housing and food instability, lack of transportation, lack of paid time off for appointments, etc. By offering the support of our Dental Navigator, members can get the support they need to navigate the system to schedule an appointment. 84 Opportunities for Improvement: Results/Outcomes/Analysis HealthPartners monitors our withhold rates on a monthly basis. We have a Dental Withhold Work Group which meets to monitor the activities and make recommendations. The withhold is also monitored in the Medicaid Quality Utilization and Improvement (QUI) workgroup and reports up to the Government Programs QUI workgroup. The data graphs below show HealthPartners internal monitoring of dental visit data for each of the withhold groups. The bar charts show the same information. Measurement 10% of the di fference between 80% and the basel i ne rate 85 In January 2023, we received a preview of full year withhold data from DHS, r eflected in the table below. Full year run- out with final rates will be received from DHS in June 2023 which will determine final status of our withhold achievement. Sustainability / Plans for Moving Forward HealthPartners dental contracting continues to work with dental providers to increase our network of available dentists, and with members to access the care they need. HealthPartners is committed to assisting our members to receive the dental care they need. We will continue our Dental Navigator program to assist members in finding available dental appointments. We will continue to explore innovative ways to reach out to our members through targeted e -mails and/or mailings and direct phone outreach. We will continue to make exceptions to standar d transportation limits to meet the needs of members to access dental care. Additionally, HealthPartners has launched a Dental Residency Program to support and enhance the dental workforce. The first class of dental residents began July 2022 and will see a large number of Medicaid members based on the clinics they are located within. Dental residents are primarily located at our HealthPartners Midway Dental clinic. While in the clinics they receive training and experience dealing with a broad cross section of public program patients. 86 They will see many patients who have complex medical, dental, and mental health needs. Residents will increase their competency, sensitivity, and comfort in addressing the oral health needs of this population. This residency program will increase access to care at our clini cs. Another benefit will be increasing our dentists' involvement in community activities that improve the oral health of these populations because they will be rotating through Hope Dental Clinic (providing free dental care) and other volunteer dental acti vities. HealthPartners looks forward to continued collaboration with our contracted dental clinics and DHS to meet the dental needs of our members. 87 Withhold: Health Equity Accountable Owner: Patty Graham, QIC Member Populations Targeted Commercial Medicare Freedom (Cost) X Medicaid X MSHO HPUPH WI Marketplace Description Minnesota consistently ranks as one of the healthiest places to live in the Unites States, data shows that the situation for people of color is very different. According to the Minnesota Department of Health, Minnesota has some of the greatest health disparities in the country between White Minnesotans and BIPOC Minnesotans. Gaps between people on Minnesota Health Care Programs insurance are among the greatest disparities. In 2022, the MN Department of Human Services (DHS) updated the withholds for our Fam ilies and Children's contracts to include equity withholds that aim to close gaps in care for Black, Indigenous, Hispanic, and Asian members compared to white members. Table 1: List of Withhold Measures (Performance and Compliance) and Related Details Measure Ages Points Allocated *Childhood Immunization Status (CIS) - (i) Combo 10 2 years 14 *Well Child Visits in First 30 Months of Life (W30) - (i) W15; (ii) W30 0 to 15 months; 15 to 30 months 14 (7+7) *Child & Adolescent Well-Visits (WCV) All (3 to 21 years) 14 *Prenatal and Postpartum Care (PPC) - (i) Postpartum Care; (ii) Timeliness of Care All Child -bearing age 14 (7+7) *Initiation & Engagement of Alcohol, Opioids, & Other Drug Dependence Treatment (IET) - (i) Total Engagement; (ii) Total Initiation All (13 to 65+ years) 14 (7+7) *Follow -up After Hospitalization for Mental Illness (FUH) - (i) 7 day; (ii) 30 day All (6 to 65+ years) 14 (7+7) 88 Goals DHS created technical specifications for the intended measurement and shared these along with baseline rates for measurement year 2019 with the MCOs. The baseline rates were intended to show MCOs where disparities exist between white members and members of the following race/ethnicity groups: 1. Hispanic 2. Native American 3. Asian/Pacific Islander 4. Black 5. White If there was a disparity between the white population and the disparate population, the measure would be eligible for points to be rewarded if the gap was closed during the 2022 measurement year. If the gap widened, negative points would be applied and if there were no changes in the gap, no points would be awarded. If there was not a disparity for a specific racial/ethnic group, that measure would not be eligible for points. 89 Initiatives/Interventions In an effort to achieve a reduction of disparities on these measures, we implemented a variety of outreach efforts including updating personalization campaigns, phone outreach, partnering with our care group and engaging with a CHW agency to educate members about the importance of care. HealthPartners has multiple campaigns that deploy letters, emails, push messages, newsletters, and member services staff to deliver messages that educate members about the importance of care or screenings and remind members when they are due for care. These communication channels were utilized to send reminders to members about the importance of care, how to receive extra support services, incentives, and other relevant information. Well-child care across the continuum - We updated and expanded our well -child visits campaigns to include varied messages targeted at specific age groups for children 0 - 18. Members ages 18 -21 are included in annual health visit messages. Well-c hild care 0 - 2 years old. This campaign focuses on the importance of completing the visits as well as the immunizations recommended by age 2. Utilizing personalization metrics for this outreach, two different messages were developed for the Medicaid campaign. Some members received a message that emphasized 'Authority'. A message was delivered by an expert who shared information about why it is important to bring your child in for well care and immunizations. Other members received a 'Reciprocity' message. Some parents don't know what shots their child needs, so a printable visual is included to help them . Both messages also included information about the incentives available to members when they complete all recommended immunizations by their second birthday. If the member doesn't have their own clinic, there is a link to help them find care in the network. These messages are delivered through email, push notification, the landing page when someone logs into their on-line account, and through Riverview Member Services. 90 The messages for children older than two years varies by the age of the child and the recommendations for that age group: Ages 2 years through 10 years old is focused on essential screenings, staying up to date on immunizations and monitoring growth and development. 11- and 12- year-olds receive a message specifically focused on the impor tance of the recommended vaccinations for adolescents and the incentive that is available for completing the series. The message for ages 13 - 17 includes well child exams, immunizations and addressing issues such as substance use, sexual health and mental health concerns. Community Health Workers Community Health Workers (CHW) are trusted, knowledgeable front line health personnel who typically come from the communities they serve. CHWs bridge cultural and linguistic barriers, expand access to coverage and care, and improve health outcomes. As critical links between their communities and the health care system, CHWs reduce health disparities; boost health care quality, cultural competence, and affordability; and empower individuals and communities for better health. HealthPartners implemented a project with WellShare, a local agency with a large cadre of experienced CHWs, to reach out to members in need of well -child visits and childhood immunizations. 1. HealthPartners created scripts for the CHWs who would be making the outreach phone calls. 2. We held an on- line training with the CHWs to clarify the messages to be delivered and background information and resources to support them in their discussions with members. 91 3. HealthPartners obtained 'back -door' scheduling line for our care group to assist in scheduling appointments and gave WellShare staff access to our oral interpreter line for conversations with parents who didn't speak available languages. 4. We pulled a list of 10,000 members in need of either well care or immunizations (or both), sorted by language and care needed, and shared them with WellShare. 5. WellShare reported back on the success rates of the outreach. a. Over five months of outreach. WellShare was able to complete outreach to 77% of the members on the list. Of those: i) 18% of the members received education on the importance of the services. ii) 801 had invalid contact information. iii) 169 were assisted by a CHW in scheduling an appointment for the service with their PCP. Prenatal and Postpartum Care: HealthPartners offers a Healthy Pregnancy program for pregnant Medicaid members. This program offers individualized 1:1 nurse support to members at high risk for negative pregnancy outcomes. In addition to the Healthy Pregnancy program, we added a robust online digital experience called My Pregnancy as a complement to offer a well - rounded education and support experience for our members that is tailor ed to meet the needs of each pregnant woman. Health Informatics identifies members who are pregnant using either enrollment information or claims data and sends an outreach letter to the member inviting them to take a healthy pregnancy assessment. This healthy pregnancy assessment helps to identify current health issues that may be of concern. It also helps us identify the member's due date and other information such as clinical or social risk factors that may not be identified via claims. Members can be identified as higher risk either through the pregnancy risk assessment or by utilizing an algorithm which includes current and historical claims when available. These members are reached out to and invited to participate in 1:1 pregnancy care coordination with a Healthy pregnancy program RN. Members can also be referred to this support from their clinician or self -referred. Typically, the initial outreach is conducted by an outreach specialist and interested members are assigned to a Healthy Pregnancy RN. However, our Native American members have a significantly lower rate of prenatal care compared to other populations, so for those members identified as Indigenous, the nurse is the first contact to attempt to decrease loss of contact during the transition. Members receive an incentive for completing the Healthy Pregnancy Assessment, and another incentive if they complete the Healthy Pregnancy Program. My Pregnancy is an online experience available to all pregnant members regardless of risk scores. 92 The c ontent is personalized based on where in their pregnancy the member is at, if they completed the healthy pregnancy assessment, and if they are a member only, or if they are also a patient in our care group. Our content for members with PMAP or MN Care inc ludes topics that are important to low-income populations or those with Medicaid coverage. Examples include pregnancy - and post -partum related insurance benefits, such as doula and breastfeeding support, public insurance coverage for newborns, and post -partum birth control options; and content that addresses the health risks facing low -income pregnant women, such as pre- term birth and inadequate nutrition. The platform allows members to access personalized information to support their pregnancy, including i nformation about their health insurance benefits and coverage, patient friendly videos and blog content written by HealthPartners' pregnancy experts. To facilitate access to culturally humble resources, the My Pregnancy digital platform surfaces community resources for members based on their identified race, language, and residence. The platform includes search functions to help members identify the type of pregnancy care provider they prefer as well as a provider locator resource to connect with the provider. Content on the My Pregnancy platform is personalized to members based on their due date, their residence, needs, and preferences identified via the pregnancy assessment and information obtained through claims. Resources for BIPOC women are personalized based on their race and ethnicity, preferences identified in the assessment and their location in Minnesota. We connect members to online educational materials and videos about pregnancy, including information about nutrition, breast feeding, caring for your newborn, mental health and well -being, and pregnancy complications like preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. Content includes topics like Medicaid coverage for doulas and other prenatal Figure 1 Samples of Communication from My Pregnancy 93 and childbirth supports; information about WIC and SNAP; and information about our organization's Medicaid- serving partners in the community, such as Everyday Miracles, Hunger Solutions, and others. Our Member Services staff and other member -facing teams can see what messages the member has received and can reinforce the referrals, answer questions about benefits or assist the member to the Healthy Pregnancy team for more information. Doula support is considered a key strategy to support members during their pregnancy and birth experience, and can be especially valuable to Black, Indigenous and other People of Color. In 2022, HealthPartners created a video explaining the value of a doula to help educate members as well as clinicians and others who work with pregnant Medicaid members about this important resource. (34) Value of a Doula - YouTube The video has been translated with subtitles into Somali, Spanish, and Hmong. It has been shared widely with partners in the community and across our care network. Our Healthy Pregnancy nurses, Member Services and other member facing staff have been educated about doulas and how to help members connect with our primary doula provider, Everyday Miracles. The video is surfaced to members who use the My Pregnancy platform. As a result of the focus on encouraging Doulas, usage by Medicaid members has increased over 200% since 2019 when we first started tracking this, with 72% of those members being non- white members. With 3,185 births in 2022, this reflects doula support provided for 4.5% of birthing members. This is still a small percentage of total birthing members, but it is encouraging. Postpartum Outreach: Medicaid members are eligible for a $25 gift card incentive if they complete their postpartum visit. Following delivery, members are sent a congratulations card with information about this incentive and the childhood immunization incentive to encourage these visits. The card is typically sent within 2 weeks after delivery. In 2022, 151 members received the postpartum incentive. BH Interventions (FUH, IET, AMM) HealthPartners Behavioral Health implemented activities to focus on the behavioral health measures included in the DHS withholds: Follow -up After Hospitalization for Mental Illness (FUH), Initiation and Engagement of Alcohol, Opioids, and Other Drug Dependence Treatment (IET). BIPOC members admitted to inpatient psychiatric care are assigned to a BIPOC Behavioral Health Case Manager for support throughout their admission and upon discharge. This effort is aimed at improving the rate of members who attend an outpatient appointment with a mental health professional within 7 days and within 30 days of discharge (Follow -up After Hospitalization (FUH) measure). To support the Initiation and Engagement in Treatment (IET) measure, Medicaid BIPOC members were added to the Screening and Brief Intervention Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) identification process and assigned to a BIPOC Behavioral Health Case 94 Manager licensed as a LADC to screen the members' substance use and to assist them with them getting connected to appropriate chemical health treatment/support. All outreach conducted to members out of our Comprehensive Care Advocacy team, which includes behavioral health case management, includes assessment of social drivers of health and referrals to local resources through the NowPow platform. Barrier Analysis HealthPartners feels that the most personal outreach is likely to have the greatest impact in reducing disparities in these important measures. The most common barrier to successful outreach is lack of current contact information. Incorrect phone numbers or mailing addresses make direct outreach unsuccessful. Members who are also patients in our care group are more likely to have current information available, but those who get their care in other systems or are unattributed were difficult to reach. Data barriers The lack of final baseline data until after the actual measurement period meant that we were unable to accurately target our efforts to the right members or race/ethnicity groups for some measures. DHS provided us with a member level list with race/ethnicity data, but we were unable to replicate the baseline rates that we received from DHS. The complexity of the tech specs made monitoring of our progress difficult. Health Informatics created a monitoring tool in Power BI which includes the Combo 10, FUH and IET. We have used this information to monitor our progress and help guide activities. However, the data in the monitoring tool does not match the data received from DHS in the withhold previews, making it difficult to predict success of the interventions on the withhold calculations. DHS Withhold Monitoring - Power BI Opportunities for Improvement: Results/Outcomes We will receive the results of these withholds from DHS in July 2023. HealthPartners will continue our efforts to reduce disparities in these measures and other areas of health for our members. 95 Focus Study 2021 Performance Improvement Project: A Healthy Start for Mothers and Babies Accountable owner: Patty Graham, QIC Member Populations Targeted Commercial Medicare Freedom (Cost) X Medicaid MSHO HPUPH WI Marketplace Description The project is intended to promote a \"Healthy Start\" for Minnesota children in the PMAP and MNCare populations by focusing on and improving services provided to pregnant people and infants, particularly in areas exhibiting the most significant racial and ethnic disparities. Nationally, overall maternal morbidity and mortality have increased over recent decades. So too have the racial disparities in mortality rates with Black women being three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy related causes than white women. In Minnesota, these disparities hold true for populations of color and are reflected in other important birth outcome data such as infant prematurity, low birth weights, and infant mortality. For babies born on Medical Assistance in Minnesota, 7.3% of white babi es experience a low birth weight while 13.5% of African Americans do. American Indian babies in Minnesota experience similar disparities as do African American babies. This disparity continues into childhood and is reflected in the immunization status of children. In general, since the Vaccines for Children program began, immunization rates have risen steadily over the past several years, prior to the pandemic, and racial disparities have decreased, but have not disappeared. To address these disparities, H ealthPartners is working to improve access to prenatal care and supports for pregnant women, especially women of color, and to improve well child visit rates and immunization rates for our members. Goals HealthPartners will improve prenatal and postpartum care for women on PMAP and MNCare as measured through administrative data for the HEDIS Prenatal and Postpartum Care measures by 2.5% over the course of the three- year project. 96 HealthPartners will decrease the disparities in immunization rates for Combo 10 Childhood Immunization rates between white and non- white members by 2.5%. Methods and Data Limitations TheHEDISPrenatal and Postpartum Care measure and Childhood Immunization measure are reportedusing ahybridcalculation.Hybrid measures are measures in which additional information in the medical chart may be sought to compliment claims data in order to provide a full picture of the care/services provided.Thus, a sample of the population is drawn vs.abstractingmedical recordevidencefor the entire measure denominator.Generally, the samplesizeis 411. Since the project has an emphasis onclosingdisparity gaps, using the hybridmethodologywould not produce anaccuraterepresentation of the aimedreductionin disparity. Taking these variables into consideration, HealthPartners has chosen to report on progress for this project utilizing only the administrative rate, which is based on claims and supplemental data (data sharing). Prenatal and Postpartum Care This project measurement will follow a modified HEDIS criteria and focus on the percentage of deliveries that had a postpartum visit on or between 21 and 56 days after delivery. Eligible Population for HEDIS Prenatal and Postpartum Care (Per HEDIS 2020 Technical Specifications.) Denominator: De livered a live birth on or between October 8 of the year prior to the measurement year and October 7 of the measurement year using the Deliveries Value Set. Continuous Enrollment: We will NOT be using a continuous enrollment qualifier for this measure to capture a larger population. In seeking to understand the disparities that exist in our populations for the pre and postnatal care measures, we were unable to identify a disparity in prenatal or postpartum care rates using the race data that is available to us. In our analysis of available race data, non- white rates are actually higher than white members for both timely prenatal care and postpartum care. Given broader state and national research about disparities in these areas, this no doubt reflects the lack of complete race data available to us for this population. For these measures, 33.6% of members did not have an identified race, so we believe this missing data is the cause of the lack of disparities. To address this, our interventions will focus on supporting non -white members and increasing overall pre and postpartum rates which should allow us to impact the non-white population. Table 4 Baseline Prenatal and Postpartum Measures by Identified Race White Non-white Table 1, 'unknown race' is excluded, making the rates appear higher than our standard HEDIS measure. 97 Other important metrics for birth outcomes that the health plan can measure are the C -section rate and low birth rate (LBW). While we were unable to identify disparities in the pre and postpartum measures because of lack of data, we did identify disparities in both of these areas despite a lack of race data for approximately 44% of the babies born. Table 2 shows the three-year average (2017 -2019) for both the C -Section rate and LBW rate. 2017-2019 Overall Average Outcome People of Color White Gap C-Section Rate 28.0% 26.8% 2 Low Birth Avg. Number of Newborns 1,173 442 Childhood Immunization Status The Childhood Immunizations Status (CIS) measure looks at the percentage of continuously enrolled children 2 years of age who have received the recommended vaccines by their second birthday. Continuous enrollment for this measure is the 12 months prior to the child's second birthday. The baseline rates for the CIS measure is the disparity between white and non- white identified children in 2020 HEDIS which reflects 2019 dates of care. The races included in 'non- white' for this measure are: American Indian or Alaska Native Asian or Pacific Islander Black or African American Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander Another race Two or more races It excludes \"unknown\" race which makes up 47.9% of members in this measure. HealthPartners goal will be to reduce the disparity in childhood immunization rates between white and non -white members by 2.5% to 12.1% for those members for whom we have race data available. Eligible Population for HEDIS Childhood Immunization Status Combo 10 (Per HEDIS 2020 Technical Specifications.) Denominator: Children who turn two years of age during the measurement year. Continuous Enrollment: Twelve months prior to the child's second birthday. Numerator Requirement: Children who have received all of the following immunizations prior to their second birthday as indicated following the HEDIS 2020 technical specifications: four diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis three B 98 three (HepB); one chicken pox (VZV); four pneumococcal conjugates (PCV); one hepatitis A (HepA); two or three rotavirus (RV) and two influenza (flu) vaccines. Table 5 Baseline Rates Childhood Immunizations Status Baseline Disparities 2019 DOS Enrollment White Non-white gap Combo 2 rate 58.5% 43.9% 14.6 Initiatives/Interventions HealthPartners has offered the Healthy Pregnancy program for Medicaid members for many years. This program offers individualized 1:1 nurse support to members at high risk for negative pregnancy outcomes. In 2021, we enhanced the Healthy Pregnancy program and added a robust online digital experience called My Pregnancy as a complement to offer a well -rounded education and support experience for our members that is tailored to meet the needs of each pregnant woman. Healthy Pregnancy Redesign - The Healthy Pregnancy program is a HealthPartners condition management program for our members who are pregnant and at higher risk for negative pregnancy outcomes. Historically, Health Informatics has identified higher -risk women by utilizing an algorithm which includes current and historical claims when available. Healthy Pregnancy then sends an outreach letter to the member inviting them to participate in the program. HealthPartners updated the Healthy Pregnancy program in important ways to increase the likelihood that the highest risk women will participate by better addressing health equity and social drivers of health as well as curate fully developed content for the My Pregnancy experience. My Pregnancy Experience is an online education and support experience available to HealthPartners health plan members and HealthPartners care group patients on our authenticated website. This information supplements the support received from the Healthy Pregnancy program but is also available to all members and patients regardless of their participation in the more intensive Healthy Pregnancy Program. 1. We updated the algorithms we used to identify women for the Healthy Pregnancy program. We incorporate demographics, including payer -type, into our algorithms to identify members who are eligible for high -touch nurse support. 2. We offer a Healthy Pregnancy assessment where women can answer questions about their current health and questions related to their pregnancy, including support services they may benefit from. This self -reporte d information also helps inform their referral into the Healthy Pregnancy program and the content that is surfaced to them via My Pregnancy. 3. We updated the content for the emails/letters sent to members at each stage of their pregnancy. The content is personalized based on where in their pregnancy the member 99 is at, if they completed the healthy pregnancy assessment, and if they are a member only, or if they are also a patient in our care group. 4. Our content for members with PMAP or MN Care includes topics that are important to low-income populations or those with Medicaid coverage. Examples include pregnancy - and post -partum related insurance benefits, such as doula and breastfeeding support, public insurance coverage for newborns, and post -partum birth control options; and content that addresses the health risks facing low -income pregnant women, such as pre- term birth and inadequate nutrition. 5. The platform allows members to access personalized information to support their pregnancy, including information about their health insurance benefits and coverage, patient friendly videos and blog content written by HealthPartners' pregnancy experts. To facilitate access to culturally humble resources, the My Pregnancy digital platform surfaces community resources for members based on their identified race, language, and residence. The platform includes search functions to help members identify the type of pregnancy care provider they prefer as well as a provider locator resource to connect with the provider. 6. Content on the My Pregnancy platform is personalized to members based on their due date, their residence, needs, and preferences identified via the pregnancy assessment and inform ation obtained through claims. 7. Resources for BIPOC women are personalized based on their race and ethnicity, preferences identified in the assessment and their location in Minnesota. We connect members to online educational materials and videos about pr egnancy, including information about nutrition, chest feeding, caring for your newborn, mental health and well -being, and pregnancy complications like preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. Content includes topics like Medicaid coverage for doulas and othe r prenatal and childbirth supports; information Figure 2 Samples of Communication from My Pregnancy 100 about WIC and SNAP; and information about our organization's Medicaid- serving partners in the community, such as Everyday Miracles, Hunger Solutions, and others. 8. Our Member Services staff and other member -facing teams can see what messages the member has received and can reinforce the referrals, answer questions about benefits or assist the member to the Healthy Pregnancy team for more information. Together with the clinical care provided by their prenatal he alth care provider, these programs provide a robust suite of information and resources for our pregnant members. Figure 3 Graphic of Pregnancy Supports Provided 101 Process Measures: 1. The number of PMAP/MNCare members who receive communications from the new system. a. In 2022, 7,414 members were sent information via email introducing them to the My Pregnancy platform. Of those, 4,836 opened the email, and 1,071 people clicked through from the email to view the content on the platform for a 14.5% click -through rate. Race Number Sent Opened Click Through Asian 945 71.4% 13.8% American 2630 64.4% 16.6% 2022, a total of 13,720 Medicaid members visited the My Pregnancy web experience. i) The most common page visited was the benefits page, followed by the delivery preparation page. ii) The average time spent on the site per visit was 27.05 minutes. iii) Most members accessed the site from a mobile phone (77.7%) followed by another device such as a computer (21.55%) and a tablet (0.74%). iv) American Indian (42.75 minutes) Black (34.49 minutes) and Hispanic members (28.44 minutes) spent longer on the site than other groups. 2. Referrals into the Healthy Pregnancy Program. In 2022, there were 1,982 pregnant Medicaid members referred into the Healthy Pregnancy program. These referrals came from the high- risk registry which gets data from claims, the Pregnancy Risk Assessment, and live referrals from other areas of the plan or from clinicians. a. Of these members, 1,613 were identified as eligible for the program and 470 engaged with the program resulting in a 29% engagement rate for 2022. Members could be deemed not eligible for the program if they did not meet the risk criteria, were no longer pregnant, were inappropriately identified or other similar reasons. b. Incentive completion - 376 members completed the initial assessment and were eligible for the assessment incentive and 424 completed the program and received the second incentive as well. Doula Support Expansion As HealthPartners began to plan for the Healthy Start PIP, we evaluated the data that we had available to us about our members as well as research about birth outcomes and disparities. Doulas were clearly identified in the literature as a strategy to better support women of color. We looked at our own utilization of doulas by our Medicaid members and saw that only about 2% of our members who gave birth in a 12- month period had utilized a doula at any time. 102 HealthPartners consulted with many community partners during the development of the PIP proposal on the barriers to widespread doula utilization. We heard from the community that they would like to see more doulas who look like the communities they serve. People of color want BIPOC doulas who have been trained to provide culturally congruent support, but there is a lack of availability to doulas who can bill Medicaid. We heard from clinical partners that most clinicia ns are not aware that this is an eligible benefit for women with state coverage. And we heard from doulas that there are multiple structural barriers to the current administrative requirements for medical billable doula services. At the time of proposal submission to DHS, HealthPartners had identified this as an internal strategy but because of the potential impact of improving access to doulas for the entire community, this has evolved into a collaborative intervention. HealthPartners has taken some steps to improve access to the service for our members in addition to the collaborative efforts outlined elsewhere. HealthPartners: 1. Agreed to increase the doula reimbursement rate to enhance the amount of reimbursement that the doula agencies can offer to their doulas. This is an important step to aid in recruitment and hopefully retention. 2. HealthPartners gave a grant to Everyday Miracles to train a cohort of doulas of color. Combined with grant dollars received from another Medicaid health plan in MN, this allowed training of additional BIPOC doulas to increase access to this service for women of color. These scholarships are for Black, Indigenous, and other women of color to become doulas. The first training took place in the Twin Cities metro and the second one took place in St Cloud for the central MN counties. They both included African, African American, and Indigenous women. 3. HealthPartners was invited to join the Birth Equity Community Council (BECC) during the planning stages of this PIP. We have become active with the group's efforts to impact the administrative barriers to doula certification and are working collaboratively to impact the training and supervision requirements for doula reimbursement. We were recognized as a BECC Community Partner at the December 2021 meeting. 4. In 2022, HealthPartners gave grants to both Everyday Miracles and the Ninde Doula program at Division of Indian Work (DIW) to support the continued development of their doula programs. 5. HealthPartners continues to work to educate internal staff about the value of doulas including establishing meetings between our Healthy Pregnancy staff and Everyday Miracles to share updates between the two organizations. 6. Collaborated with Everyday Miracles and DIW doula programs to create a video, Value of a Doula , which explains how a doula can support pregnant members to those who may not be familiar as well as explaining the Medicaid benefit. The video has been translated with subtitles into Spanish, Somali and Hmong. 103 7. We promoted the use of doulas in our provider newsletter, with information on how clinicians can assist their patients to access a doula. We also educated ou r Member Services staff on how to access doula services and included doula services in the My Pregnancy online platform. Process Measure: 1. Number of PMAP and MNCare members who access doula services each year. The claims data through 2022 shows an increas e of over 200% in usage of doula services overall. With 3,185 births in 2022, this reflects doula support provided for 4.5% of birthing members. We will continue to monitor this measure through the life of the project to evaluate trends.

Number of contracted doulas/doula agencies available to our members. a. No new doula agencies were contracted during 2022, but we have been actively supporting Division of Indian Work to enable their doula program to become Medicaid eligible. With the addition of the Zaggi'idiwin Full Spectrum Indigenous Doula Training to the state register, DIW doulas who have been trained by this program are now eligible to be Medicaid doulas and we can finalize the contract. b. As a result of the enhanced focus on training doulas of color, Everyday Miracles roster of certified doulas is now 70% people of color compared to 40% at the start of 2020. 3. Impact of Doula Support. For 2022 births we wanted to quantify the benefits of doula support services for our members based on birth outcomes. An ongoing issue with Medicaid members is that it is not always possible for us to link the newborn baby with the mother who gave birth, and this impacted our ability to get accurate information for this metric. We were unable to link 23.5% of newborns to confirm if their mother used a doula. This data gap makes the outcomes data less than compel ling. 104 Medicaid Doula Delivery Outcomes Summary January 2022 - December 2022 Medicaid 2022 People of Color White Missing Race Outcome measure* With Doula No Doula With (0) (31) Birth 5.9% 1.4% (23) 6.5% (2) 0.9% (7) 0% (0) (0) Birth 5.6% 6.8% 4.8% (37) 0% (0) 0% (0) NICU Avg.

Referrals to County Home Visiting HealthPartners has provided counties who request it with monthly lists of our members who we identify as pregnant through claims or enrollment file. In 2021, we added elements to these member lists to add value and improve the county's ability to effectively engage members in family home visiting services. . W e added demographic information where we have it, which includes race, ethnicity, and preferred language of the member. We added risk information when it is available from either prior pregnancies or current claims to enhance the knowledge of the county staff and inform their educational efforts. Counties have also requested due date information, but this is not something that is available in claims, so we have thus far been unable to identify a process for this element. Process Measure: Number of members who receive Home Visiting Services. In 2022, 341 members received a nurse home visit following birth. 105 Childhood Immunization Outreach During 2020, outreach about well child visits and immunizations were temporarily suspended due to the pandemic. When limited messaging resumed it was combined with messaging about the efforts clinics were taking to make it safe to visit. HealthPartners took the opportunity to create new messaging encouraging early childhood well visits and immunizations. Utilizing personalization metrics for this outreach, two different messages were developed for the Medicaid campaign. Some members received a message that emphasized 'Authority'. A message was delivered by an expert who shared information about why it is important to bring your child in for well care and immunizations. Other members received a 'Reciprocity' message. Some parents don't know what shots their child needs, so a printable visual is included to help them. Both messages also included information about the incentives available to members when they complete all recommended immunizations by their second birthday. If the member doesn't have their own clinic, there is a link to help them find care in the network. These messages are delivered through email, push notification, the landing page when someone logs into their on-line account, and through Riverview Member Services. Process Measures for Wel l Child/Childhood Immunization Outreach 1. \"Conversion rate\" for PMAP/MNCare members who receive a well child and immunization reminder communication. A conversion is defined as a member taking action to complete the recommended care within three months of r eceiving the message. 106 a. Reminder messages were sent to 3,911 members in 2022. The overall open rate for the messages was 60.2% and 7.5% clicked though to further content. b. The two message segments performed similarly but not exactly the same. i) The 'Expert\" message had an open rate of 59.1% and a click through rate of 7.3%. ii) The 'Reciprocity' message had an open rate of 60.6% and a click through rate of only 7.6%. iii) Overall, 6.1% of members who received the message 'converted' within 30 days and completed the full set of care. This rate could be impacted by delays in access to clinic scheduling which were prevalent in 2022. 2. Number of members who achieve the incentive rewards available to them. a. Childhood immunization reward is sent to children who are fully im munized for the 10 childhood immunizations recommended by age 2 = 1,778 b. Postpartum incentives are available to members who keep a postpartum appointment between 3 weeks and 8 weeks = 151 c. Healthy Pregnancy Assessment = 376 d. Healthy Pregnancy Completion = 424 Community Health Worker Outreach In addition to our outreach campaigns, HealthPartners implemented a project with WellShare to have Community Health Workers (CHW) reach out to members in need of well visits and childhood immunizations. CHWs are trusted, knowledgeable front line health personnel who typically come from the communities they serve. CHWs bridge cultural and linguistic barriers, expand access to coverage and care, and improve health outcomes. As critical links between their communities and the health care system, CHWs reduce health disparities; boost health care quality, cultural competence, and affordability; and empower individuals and communities for better health. 1. HealthPartners created scripts for the CHWs who would be making the outreach phone calls. 2. We held an on- line training with the CHWs to coach them on the messages to be delivered and background information and resources to support them in their discussions with members. 3. We pulled lists of members in need of the services, sorted by race and language, and shared them with WellShare. Ten thousand children were included on the outreach lists. 4. Members who needed more services - either multiple well child visits or multiple immunizations to get caught up - were prioritized for the earliest outreach. 5. WellShare reported back on the success rates of the outreach. a. Of the total list, 3,159 members received education about the importance of immunizations and well child care. An addit ional 16 received the education and assistance from the CHWs to schedule the needed appointment. 107 b. We will analyze the success of this outreach based on claims submitted for the recommended services once full calendar year run -out is available. Collaborat ive Interventions HealthPartners participates in the health plan collaborative for this PIP along with Blue Plus, Hennepin Health, South Country Health Alliance (SCHA), and UCare. Stratis Health provides project development support and assistance to the collaborative. Together we have worked on interventions that address creating and strengthening community partnerships, and providing education to the healthcare community and those who work with birthing people and young children. Increasing doula capacity - The health plan collaborative agreed that increasing doula utilization was an activity that could improve pregnancy and birth outcomes for members. We met with several community partners to explore the issue, join efforts that were already underway and encourage focus on specific efforts. These groups included the BECC Partnership, Healthy Black Pregnancies, Everyday Miracles, Division of Indian Work Ninde Doula Project, Minnesota Indian Women's Resource Center, and others. We met with Dr. Chomilo, DHS M edicaid Medical Director, and shared the concerns we have heard from the community and our partners and Dr Chomilo reported hearing many of these same concerns from his sources. Many of those barriers are outlined below in the barrier analysis. As a result of these conversations, the health plans have become more involved with the advocacy efforts of the community to impact the barriers to doula care. We have been involved with the Birth Equity Community Council (BECC) which is focused on reducing disparities in maternal and infant birth outcomes for people of color. Over the course of the last three years, many of the doula issues have coalesced in importance to the community and this group is taking the lead on working with advocates and the state on several priorities including: Working to add culturally congruent doula trainings to the list of certifications that are accepted to be Medicaid eligible. We collaborated with community advocates and met with the Minnesota Department of Health to explain the issues. There are limited number of doula curriculum (8) that were approved by the state, many of them very traditional and not reflective of the diverse makeup of Minnesota's Medicaid membership. The legislature had revised statute to allow MDH to determine the appropriate curriculums to include as Medicaid eligible. The department established a process for application of curriculums to be added to the approved list. As of 3/22/23, six additional training programs have been added to the approved list, and one of the original ones has been inactivated. Community doulas believe that the need to bill under a clinician is a barrier to access. The Medicaid Medical Director advocated to include removal of this requirement in the Governor's 2023 proposed budget. The current reimbursement rate is not enough to provide a livable wage to doulas. The BECC collaborative, working with the Minnesota Coalition for Home Visiting, has 108 proposed legislation to increase the reimbursement for both the pre- and postnatal visits and the support for birth visit. This increase in the reimbursement rate would bring Medicaid reimbursement in- line with private pay doulas and encourage more doulas to provide this service to Medicaid members. The Minnesota Council of Health Plans and some individual health plans have signed the letter of support for this change. This work will continue as needed and will expand to include promotion of doula services to clinical providers and community organizations that work with birthing people and their families. Education Webinars: The collaborative developed an educational webinar series to address topics that can impact birth outcomes and early childhood health with a focus on health equity and addressing racial bias. Webinars presented in 2022 wer e: Doulas 101: A Valuable Part of the Care Team. How Doulas Support a Healthy Pregnancy presented by Akhmiri Sekhr -Ra and Kaytee Crawford on March 23, 2022. Doulas can be a valuable part of a woman's health care team, and in Minnesota can be reimbursed by Medicaid, but they are underutilized for those at highest risk who could benefit the most. This webinar will introduce attendees to the value doulas can bring, what doulas do and do not do, and share strategies for integrating doulas into the prenatal care team to support women as well as hear examples of how doulas have positively impacted birth experiences. The webinar was attended by 144 people, primarily in public health. Eighty four percent of participants rated the webinar good or excellent and 93.3% felt it improved their understanding of the role of a doula in supporting birthing persons. Perinatal Substance Use ECHO - Legal Implications of Perinatal Substance Use presented by Dr Cresta Jones on December 13, 2022. Recent changes to Minnesota's mandated reporting laws were intended to reduce barriers to birthing people who may be using substances that have traditionally been included in mandatory reporting. For some clinicians and organizations, the changes have created confusion, resulting in inconsistent application of the standards. This webinar aims to clarify the requirements of the mandatory reporting law and give clinicians practical suggestions for having meaningful conversations with their patients at risk. Offered as part of the Hennepin Healthcare ECHO series, this session was co- sponsored by the health plan PIP collaborative. A Reminder from your Healthcare Provider: Come back to get caught up . The Healthy Start PIP project, in collaboration with the Minnesota Council of Health Plans, created an educational blog about the importance of well child visits and immunizations. Directed at families with young children, the blog was posted on the MCHP site in December of 2022 in English with an accompanying voice recording to address concerns of health literacy. Additionally, the content has been translated into Spanish, Somali, and Hmong. The translated voice recordings will be 109 posted as they become available as well. This will be promoted to community partners once all pieces are finalized and posted on the website. Barrier Analysis and Gaps in Care The barriers to quality care for BIPOC people are numerous and complex and result in inequities in both birth outcomes and early childhood care. The specific interventions implemented in this project were initiated to begin to address some of those inequit ies in outcomes, but there are barriers to success inherent in these activities as well. 1. Early identification of pregnancy has been an ongoing issue for health plans. Many pregnant people are not financially eligible for coverage until they are pregnant, and this can delay prenatal care until they have this coverage in place. For those who already have coverage, delays or variation in claims submission can delay the notification of health plans to their pregnancy. It is not uncommon for clinics to schedule initial prenatal visits beyond the 12 week mark due to clinic capacity, missing the opportunity for early prenatal care as defined by HEDIS. Additionally, women who have a repeat pregnancy may not feel the urgency of early prenatal care or completing all recommended prenatal appointments. 2. Notifications of plan- related pregnancy resources can be hindered by lack of email addresses or incorrect mailing addresses. Engagement into the Healthy Pregnancy program relies on the availability of a phone and some members who have limited cellular minutes may be reluctant to use them communicating with a health plan nurse. 3. Immunization and well child visit reminders to parents of young children are also vulnerable to a lack of email and incorrect address. Additionall y, some families may still be delaying care due to safety concerns related to visiting their clinic during a pandemic. Some clinics are experiencing severe staffing issues which makes access to appointments for care difficult. 4. Phone outreach to families proved to be challenging because of missing or incorrect phone numbers. Some caregivers expressed hesitancy to get recommended vaccines, including many who preferred a delayed schedule to what is recommended. 5. Doulas have been shown to improve birth outcom es, especially for women of color. In MN, it is a covered benefit for women on Medicaid. However, there remain barriers to women to access doulas of their choice, and barriers to become a doula who is able to submit reimbursement to Medicaid. a. The communi ty wants to have more doulas that look like the community they serve. People of color want BIPOC doulas who have been trained to provide culturally congruent support. b. Clinicians including OB providers may not be aware that doulas are a covered benefit for women on Medicaid. And if they are aware, they may not fully understand the role of the doula or they may have misconceptions about doulas and may not 110 understand what a doula can do to enhance or reinforce the medical care they provide. c. Individual doulas report that the requirement to work under a physician NPI number for Medicaid billing is difficult. Providers - especially in greater Minnesota - are reluctant to play that role. d. Doula agencies who have developed a successful model to provide doula services to Medicaid members struggle to recruit and retain doulas of color due to many factors including: i) The Medicaid reimbursement rate is too low to provide a livable wage so many doulas choose to serve private pay clients where the fees are double or more. ii) The cost to obtain doula certification is significant and includes both the cost of the training itself as well as the cost for doulas to be listed on the DHS doula provider site, and the renewal every three years. iii) Once a doula is trained, there is a significant time lapse between beginning to provide care and when they can be paid, which is unsustainable for most people to support themselves. iv) Agencies make every effort to pair women of color with a doula from their own race or culture but if one is not available, they may be paired with a non - congruent doula or referred to a community partner who provides culturally congruent care but is not equipped to bill Medicaid. v) The structure of relying on grants to provide doula supports to their community is unsustainable, and the burden of becoming eligible for Medicaid billing is daunting. Opportunities for Improvement: Results/Outcomes The interventions discussed in this report were implemented throughout calendar year 2022 and are ongoing. Claims run out for establishing HEDIS rate achievement is not available for pre and post -partum care or childhood immunizations, but will be included in the update in next year's annual evaluation. Interim pr ocess measures are included above where relevant. As this project is focused on reducing disparities, the following summary estimates PMAP volumes (prevalence) associated with key outcomes relating to maternity and deliveries. Most current data available was used to determine race. People of Color includes - American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and other race. PMAP Delivery Outcomes Summary January 2021 - December 2022 Medicaid 2021 Medicaid 2022 Outcome People of Color White Missing Race People of Color White Missing Race C-Section Rate 29.5% (8) 2.3% (33) 1.7% (28) 3.4% (18) 1.8% (14) 111 Low Birth Weight 7.1% (145) 5.4% (54) (6) 6.8% (118) of Newborns 2,032 993 198 1,726 672 787 Disparities in these measures will be monitored over the three years of this project to help determine if there has been movement on these measures. As it is early in the project, we hesitate to assign causality at this early stage. Prenatal and Postpartum Care rates HEDIS data for Measurement Year 2022 will be available later in 2022 to monitor progress. Below are 2021 HEDIS rates, comparing white members to non- white members for the prenatal and postpartum measures. Rates of prenatal and postpartum care have decreased across the board for all populations during the pandemic and have not rebounded. The overall rate for non - white members continues to be higher than white members. Prenatal Postpartum Product White vs. Non- White 2019 Baseline rate 2019 GAP MY 2021 Rate 2021 GAP 2019 Baseline rate 2019 GAP MY 2021 Rate 60.4% ------ 112 Focus Study 2022 Improving Adolescent Immunization Rates Accountable owner: Patty Graham, QIC Member Populations Targeted X Commercial Medicare Freedom (Cost) X Medicaid MSHO SNBC HPUPH WI Marketplace Description This focus study aims to increase the number of Medicaid members who receive all recommended adolescent immunizations by their thirteenth birthday. Adolescent immunizations are an important way to prevent serious and deadly illnesses, and even prevent cancer later in life. However, adolescent immunization rates have remained stagnant, even decreasing during the height of the Covid- 19 pandemic. The immunizations recommended by age 13 include meningococcal, Tdap (Tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis) HPV (Human papillomavirus) and influenza. While influenza was included in the outreach education for this project, the measurement does not include that vaccine. Meningococcal and Tdap vaccines have been widely available and accepted for many years, and while the HPV vaccine has also been available for many years, it has been slow to gain widespread acceptance, resulting in much lower rates for that vaccine than the others. Additionally, recommendations have changed in recent years to include both males and females, so communication of this information is important to convey to parents so they can offer this protection to their children. Reluctance of parents to approve all adolescent immunizations is primarily focused on the HPV vaccine. This vaccine is recommended for children at age 11- 12, however can be given to the child as early as 9 years old. The reluctance of parents' centers around the fact that HPV is a sexually transmitted virus, and children are not typically sexually active at that age. Research has shown that children are not more likely to initiate sexual activity if they receive the HPV vaccine. However, research shows that the HPV vaccine is more effective over the long term when given at an earlier age ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4969174/ ). When the conversation of this vaccine is focused on sexual activity, it can make clinicians and parents uncomfortable. It is important to note that research shows that within 12 years of the HPV vaccine being introduced in the United States, the incidence of the four HPV types which the vaccine addresses, decreased 88% among 14 -19-year-olds and 81% among 20 -24 year old females in the US. ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30998672/ ) 113 This project will focus on communication to parents about the importance of adolescent immunizations and providing cli nician with tools to have these difficult conversations. Goal This project seeks to increase the HEDIS\u00ae measure, Immunizations for Adolescents (IMA) Combo 2, which includes Meningococcal, Tdap and both HPV vaccines recommended by age 13 years. Medicaid A dolescent Immunization Rates Baseline Year HPV 1 dose HPV 2 dose Meningococcal Tdap/TD IMA Combo 2 2020 72 38 84 84 36 2021 67 35 72 73 31 Commercial Adolescent Immunization Rates Baseline Year HPV 1 dose HPV 2 dose Meningococcal Tdap/TD IMA Combo 2 2020 69 40 86 88 38 2021 70 41 79 81 37 Methods and Data Limitations The IMA measure is typically a hybrid measure for publicly reported HEDIS, which means that a sample of the population is included, and information can be included that is extracted directly from the patient's medical record. In order to include the broadest population, we chose to utilize administrative data and include the full population. This data comes from claims, Minnesota Immunization Information Connection (MIIC) system and clinic electronic health records when available. For this reason, more i ndividuals are included in the data, but it may be incomplete if a claim was not submitted, or if the clinic did not submit the vaccine to the MIIC system. Additionally, it will not mirror the publicly reported HEDIS measure exactly. Initiatives/Interven tions HealthPartners participated in the American Cancer Society Health Plan Adolescent Immunization (HPV Vax) Learning Collaborative in 2022. The overall project was on adolescent immunizations but was heavily focused on the HPV vaccine because that is the individual rate that brings the overall Combo 2 rate down. Quality improvement staff participated in a bi -monthly learning opportunity with presentations by experts in the field who shared information on best practices, tools, and resources for improving HPV vaccination rates. Participating health plans shared their own experiences including successes and barriers to create a co- learning environment. Research and best practice topics included a focus on data analytics as well as provider and members com munication strategies. Topics included: 114 On-time vaccination recommendations, including starting at age 9. Increasing vaccine confidence. Understanding data. Evidence based and informed interventions. Value based architecture. Effective provider communication. Relevant information was shared with our provider network through articles in our provider newsletter, Fast Facts, as well as disseminating them to immunization- focused colleagues within our care group partners. Immunization Communication HealthPartners primary intervention for this project was to create an updated Adolescent Immunization campaign. In the past, we sent a communication out to parents of members in the target age group one time per year with basic information about the immunizations recommended for that age group. When the Covid -19 pandemic started, all communication about adolescent immunizations was halted. Once the Covid vaccine became available, the communications focused largely on that vaccine. We took the opportunity to enhance both the message and data analytics behind the message. HealthPartners has multiple campaigns that deploy letters, emails and push messages that educate members about the importance of care or screenings and remind members when they are due for car e. We created new messages for 11 -12-year-olds focused on the immunizations recommended for that age group, and created a wrap -around Child and Teen Checkup campaign recommending well visits every year for all children. Two differing messages (segments) were created for the adolescent immunizations campaign, and analytics determined which message we sent based on which message was deemed most likely to resonate with the parent based on analytics. Some members received a message that emphasized 'Authority ' which emphasized the message from a trusted physician voice making the recommendation based on best practice. Basic factual information about what the immunization prevents backed up by a trusted voice would resonate with these caregivers. Other members received a 'Fear' message. This focused on the dangers of not providing the vaccines and some very basic information about how dangerous each of the preventable conditions could be. This is intended to evoke an emotional reaction which would resonate with other caregivers. 115 Both messages also included information about the incentives available to members when they complete all recommended immunizations by their thirteenth birthday. If the member doesn't have their own clinic, there is a link to help them find care in the network. These messages are delivered through email, push notification, the landing page when someone logs into their on- line account, and through Riverview Member Services. For members without an online account or email on file, we sent a letter via US mail. 116 Immunization Campaign Results Because of difficulties matching children to parents within the Medicaid population, email was not an effective delivery mechanism for this campaign. The members who received the message through their online account were mos t likely to respond to the message and get the needed care. However, the vast majority of members received the message through US Mail. The overall conversion rate for this campaign for Medicaid members was 11.1% compared to Commercial members with a 20.7% conversion rate. Medicaid Results Delivered by (Medicaid) Number of members Open rate Click through rate** Conversion rate*** Email 29 21 (72%) 9,773 na na 11.1% *Bell notifications are delivered when a member logs into their HealthPartners on- line account ** Click through rate means that the member's caregiver clicked into the message and went to the landing page where they could get more information. ***Conversion rate shows that the member received the recommended care within 60 days of receiving the message. Message Results While the numbers are quite small, those members who received the Authority message via email were almost 15 percentage points more likel y to open the email and read it. By contrast, those Medicaid members who received the Fear campaign were significantly more likely to act and have their child receive the immunizations. Medicaid Message Conversion rate Expert 6.7% Fear 27.3% Commercial Results By contrast, commercial insurance members responded to the two different messages slightly differently. Both the fear and authority messages were opened at almost the same rate, and the conversion rate for both segments were identical. This could be partly because commercial members have a larger trail of consumer data attached to them, so we were able to identify the 117 best message for them more accurately. By contrast, the Medicaid members were largely sent a letter \"To the Parent or Caregiver of\" the member. Going forward, our communications area will continue to attempt to refine who receives each message to achieve highest performance of this campaign.

Commercial Message Conversion rate Expert 21.4% Fear 21.4% Member Incentive for Medicaid HealthPartners provides a member incentive for our Medicaid members who are up to date on immunizations (meningococcal, TDAP and 2x HPV)) by their 13th birthday. This information is included in the reminder message they receive regardless of whether they r eceive the fear message or the authority message. Of 3,608 members eligible for the incentive, 1,163 received it in 2022 (32%) Care group MOC HealthPartners and Park Nicollet care groups offer primary care providers Maintenance of Certification (MOC) opportunities. The MOC portfolio offers a streamlined process for physicians and physicians assistants to complete a QI project that is required to renew their specialty board certification. In 2022, MOCs were offered for Improving Child and Adolescent Immunizations, and Addressing Health Disparities for Child and Adolescent Immunizations. Clinicians who chose to 118 participate received training on how SDOH impacts patients and explored their own implicit bias. Eighteen clinicians signed up for Addressing Health Disparities in Childhood Immunizations MOC. While none of them met their full disparity goals, other self -reported outcomes such as awareness of cultural humility, understanding the difference between health equity and equality and having the tools to support patients were greatly improved. The data below shows results for both the Child and adolescent immunizations cohort and the Addressing Health Disparities - Child and Adolescent Immunizations cohorts.

We included links to trainings recommended during the ACS/Health Plan Learning Collaborative. We also discussed this topic at our Quality Connections forum, where QI leaders from our network clinics share best practices on various QI topics. Two care groups presented their process for improving adolescent immunization rates including their outreach protocols, clinic processes and their provider training. 19 care groups attended this meeting. Barrier Analysis and Gaps in Care 1. Adolescent HPV immunization rates continue to lag far behind other immunizations recommended for children in this age group. Attitudes and beliefs about the HPV vaccine and access to health care are significant barriers. 119 a. Providers who present the immunization as routine, and as a cancer prevention strategy have the most success in parent acceptance of the vaccine. Provider education efforts have focused on encouraging this approach. Some providers remain uncomfortable talking about the vaccine which reduces their ability to educate parents and caregivers. 2. Clinics in Minnesota were heavily impacted by staffing shortages which resulted in difficulty getting patients scheduled for routine care. 3. During the height of the Covid- 19 pandemic, patients were reluctant to go to clinics for care. While this has largely rebounded for our commercial membership, o ur Medicaid membership has not retuned to routine care at the same level. This delay in care has impacted many quality metrics. 4. It has been widely reported by our clinic partners and health department colleagues that attitudes towards immunizations is changing. Negative attitudes toward the Covid vaccine have seeped into other preventive care, especially immunizations. Clinics report that families who have previously always accepted the vaccines are now pushing back on the advice of their clinician. 5. Medic aid members are far less likely to have active on- line accounts, have their email on file with us or to have current addresses in our system. All these barriers make a member communication campaign challenging. Opportunities for Improvement: Results/Outcomes Overall, progress was made to increase adolescent immunization rates in 2022, but these efforts were more impactful in the commercial membership. Medicaid rates increased over 2021 but did not return to pre- pandemic rates. While Commercial rates increased over both the previous year and surpassed pre- pandemic rates.

We will continue to work with our providers to encourage improvement in IMA Combo 2 rates and will continue to explore strategies to improve this measure for all members. 121 Focus Study 2021 Performance Improvement Project: Reducing Disparities in Blood Pressure Control for Diabetes Accountable owner: Tammy Chambers, Patty Graham, QIC Member Populations Targeted Commercial Medicare Freedom (Cost) Medicaid X MSHO X SNBC HPUPH WI Marketplace Description This Performance Improvement Project (PIP) is intended to improve Comprehensive Diabetes Care and services for seniors and SNBC members with a focus on reducing disparities in blood pressure control for Black members compared t o White members. To support improvement, HealthPartners is involved with joint collaborative interventions as well as plan specific strategies. This PIP is a collaboration of Minnesota Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) (\"the Collaborative\"). MCOs participating in this Alliance (SCHA) and UCare. Stratis Health provides project development support and assistance to the Collaborative. According to the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH), since 2011, Minnesota adults have reported the lowest age- adjusted high blood pressure prevalence of any state in the country. MDH data showed very little change in the percentage of adults reporting they have been told they have high blood pressure, hovering around 1 in 4 adults from 2011 through 2017. An additional analysis of Minnesota adults with insurance coverage in 2014 showed similar rates of age-adjusted hypertension prevalence (25.4%). Segments of data were identified by age group, ethnicity, and disability. More than half of adults aged 65 or older report being told they have high blood pressure at 52.7%. The break down by race/ethnicity was 30.4% for African American/African, 24% for White and 23% for Hispanic. It is difficult to assess whether there are significant differences in high blood pressure prevalence between people from different racial and ethnic groups because the available race or ethnicity - speci fic data is based on small numbers. There is evidence that age -adjusted high blood pressure prevalence is about 6 percentage points higher in African American/African Adults in 122 Minnesota compared to Whites. The small number of American Indian and Asian adults in the survey prevent the calculation of an age- adjusted prevalence estimate. Among individuals who are not disabled, 23.5% of adults reported having high blood pressure. Compared to non- disabled individuals, Minnesota adults with a disability were more likely to report high blood pressure. Among those with a disability, those with a vision disability had the lowest prevalence of high blood pressure. Alternatively, adults with disabilities affecting mobility, independent living, and self -care were more likely to report high blood pressure than those with vision or cognitive disabilities. This PIP focuses on decreasing the health disparity gap in HEDIS\u00ae and/or process measures chosen year- over-year from 2021 thru 2023 by improving member's self -management of their diabetes. To be able to reduce the disparities in diabetes, we will look to the already present evidence- based approaches to address the many factors that influence health, such as access to nutritious foods, options for physical activity through a collaborative approach between both health care and non- health care, and the social and environmental factors that affect vulnerable populations. Goals This project seeks to decrease the health disparity gap between Black/African American MSHO and SNBC members in the HEDIS\u00ae Comprehensive Diabetes Care, BP Control measure year - over-year from 2021 thru 2023. Methods and Data Limitations The MSHO project is focused on those members who receive care within the HealthPartners and Park Nicollet care systems with a focus on decreasing the disparity between Black/African American member- patients and white member -patients. In 2019, 70% of the members in the diabetes measure received their care through our own care group, making this project a collaboration between our plan and the member's caregiver. Because the SNBC membership is not as concentrated within our own care group, the SNBC project will focus on all members regardless of attribution and will focus on clinician education and member outreach to improve blood pressure control. Member identification will follow HEDIS specifications from the technical specifications for measurement year 2021 for Comprehensive Diabetes Care - BP Control. This measures the percentage of members 18 - 75 years of age with diabetes who have their blood pressure in control. Control is defined for this measure as <140/90 mm Hg). Continuous enrollment and inclusion criteria - Members are continuously enrolled during the measurement year. Only MSHO members who are attributed to the HealthPartners and Park Nicollet family of care. All SNBC members who are included in the HEDIS sample AND all SNBC members who are attributed to the HealthPartners and Park Nicollet family of care. 123 The MSHO measure will utilize only administrative data utilizing claims and EPIC. We will produce yearly rates of blood pressure control for white members and Black/African American identified members with diabetes who are attributed to the HealthPartners and Park Nicollet care systems and determine the disparity for the MSHO product. The SNBC Measure w ill utilize those members in the HEDIS sample as well as SNBC members who are attributed to the HealthPartners and Park Nicollet care systems. We will include more members than just the sample by using EPIC data to supplement the data we capture during chart review. The combination of data allows us to maximize the number of SNBC members included. Baseline- Because the number of members in the measure can fluctuate from year to year, HealthPartners will use a three- year average (2017 -2019) as our baseline rate upon which to improve. (Table 1) Goal - HealthPartners will seek to decrease the disparity gap between Black or African American members and white members by 2.5% to 8.1 for MSHO and to 6.2 for SNBC. Table 6 Baseline Blood Pressure Control for People with Diabetes. Disparities 2017- 2019 Product Race 2017 2018 2019 3 year num 3 year denom 3 year rate Gap to white MSHO Black or African American 50/73 68.5% 1. A known barrier with using the HEDIS Comprehensive Diabetes Care measure is that it is reported using a hybrid calculation. Hybrid measures are measures in which additional information in the medical chart may be sought to complement claims data in order t o provide a full picture of the care/services provided. Thus, a sample of the population is drawn vs. abstracting medical record evidence for the entire measure denominator. Generally, the sample size is 411. Since the project has an emphasis on closing disparity gaps, using the hybrid methodology would produce a limited representation of the aimed reduction in disparity. Therefore, we will supplement SNBC sample data with members who receive their care in our care group. The primary intervention for MSHO members will be concentrated in our care group, so for MSHO we will be able to report the most robust administrative 124 data. Due to these adaptations to the traditional HEDIS measure, our reported data will not mirror HEDIS exactly. 2. HealthPartners does not have pharmacy data for our MSC+ members and we are unable to reliably identify members for this measure, so we will not include MSC+ members in the measurement. However, MSC+ members who can be identified will be included in all interventions and member outreach. Initiatives/Interventions Inexpensive blood pressure monitors are an effective way to monitor blood pressure at home. The USPSTF recommends out -of-office blood pressure measurement before making a new diagnosis of hypertension. Researchers at UT Southwestern Medical Center studied data from the Dallas Heart Study and learned that at -home measurements are more accurate, less expensive, and easier to obtain than blood pressure screenings done in medical settings. Patients' readings tend to be higher in the clinic due to stress or anxiety. According to guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and AHA, \"people with high blood pressure should measure their blood pressure at home, keep a log of the results and show it to their doctor. Provider Communication There is limited awareness among members and clinicians that home blood pressure cuffs are a covered benefit for Medicaid members. We included an article in Fast Facts, our provider newsletter, reminding clinicians of the importance of blood pressure monitoring for comprehensive diabetes care, describing our commitment to reduce disparities in this measure, and informing them of the coverage for home blood pressure monitoring equipment for members who qualify. We also shared this information with our care coordinators for both MSHO and SNBC as they can support members to access this equipment if needed. Home Blood Pressure Monitor Project During the height of the pandemic, the ability of clinicians to work with their patients to monitor their high blood pressure was impacted by the inability of patients to come to in- person visits. Clinics addressed this by utilizing home blood pressure monitors. We identified at that time that most members and many clinicians were not aware that blood pressure monitors are a covered benefit for Medicaid members who qualify. At the same time, while clinics are fully open for all care, staffing shortages make it difficult to devote time to outreach to patients who do not have an updated blood pressure reading on file. 1. HealthPartners collaborated with our care groups to identify our members who receive their healthcare in our care system, who have diabetes and whose blood pressure is not at goal. 2. For those members, we sent them a letter telling them they were eligible for a home blood pressure cuff, and we would provide one if desired. 125 3. We worked with the care group and the health care products team to identify and procure the preferred blood pressure cuff which has blue- tooth capability, allowing it to transmit the reading i nto the patient's medical record once the care group's technology allows for this. 4. We identified key educational pieces to help patients understand the importance of blood pressure control with diabetes and to help ensure they take their readings correctl y. We had the following information translated into Spanish, Somali, Vietnamese, Cambodian/Khmer and Hmong: a. Understanding High Blood Pressure b. How to Take Your Blood Pressure at Home c. Dash Diet 5. Blood pressure cuffs were sent in the mail to those members who accepted the benefit and were offered support from the clinic if they needed help to understand how to use the cuff or had other questions. Ultimately, over 3200 Medicaid members with diabetes received a home blood pressure cuff to help monitor this important measure. Of these, 254 were MSHO members. We were unable to identify exactly how many MSC+ and SNBC members were included as the report did not distinguish between MSC+, SNBC and other Medicaid products (MNCare and PM AP). We will attempt to break this down and delineate the numbers in our year two interim report to DHS to show the impact this project had on member blood pressure control. 126 Member Education Communication HealthPartners has an outreach campaign that encourages members with diabetes to get care from their clinician for many issues related to diabetes including A1C, nephropathy and eye exams. In 2021, we completed an update of this outreach to address BP control more effectively for diverse members. 1. We conducted a focus group of Black and African American colleagues to learn what people liked about our health plan outreach efforts and what could make the messaging stronger. Relevant input included the appearance of the envelope and letter itself to appea r more friendly and more likely to be opened. We also adjusted who delivered the message. The group felt that if they weren't getting the information from their own clinician, that a nurse who looks like them would be more effective than a plan Medical Director. 2. Language was included about which diabetes management tests the member is due for and why it is important. Blood pressure monitoring was included for the first time. 3. A full color postal mailing was delivered to those members who don't have an on- line account. 4. We included resources for seniors and people with disabilities that are available from the plan including nurse support and on- line health coaching tools. Process Measure: Of the members who received the communications, how many clicked through to learn more about the action they could take to improve their diabetes. Below is information on the messages delivered to those members in 2022. 127 Overall, 19.5% of MSHO, MSC+ and SNBC members who received information encouraging them to get their recommended diabetes screening tests, acted and got the screenings they were due for. In addition, 442 MSHO and 795 SNBC members received a postal mailing with this information, however conversion data on that is not available at this time. Product Email Msg sent Opened Clicked Conversion MSHO/MSC+ 312 192 21.9% MSHO and SNBC Care Coordinators complete a health assessment with each member at least yearly. HealthPartners has many supplemental benefits which are relevant to MSHO members with diabetes, and it is important for care coordinators to know about them and to assist their members to access them when it would be beneficial to the member. To assist the Care Coordinators in connecting members to relevant resources, HealthPartners created a grid linking questions in the health assessment to the supplemental benefits that would address a vulnerability for the member. This easy reference tool has been shared with Care Coordinators and made available with direct links to the supplement benefits information that is applicable. Process Measure: Annual utilization of supplemental benefits that support healthy diet and exercise.

In 2021, our care group initiated a pilot project: Increase the Use of Home Blood Pressure Monitoring: A step in reducing the disparity gap for Medicaid patients with hypertension. This project aims to: Provide standardized cardiovascular education utilizing Priority Wizard in a hypertension focused clinician visit. Increase use of home blood pressure monitors in hypertensive Medicaid patients on diabetes, hypertension, and vascular registries, who agree to program guidelines, by 25% from baseline in 6 months. Decrease proportion of hypertensive Medicaid patients with overdue blood pressure readings by 25% from baseline in 6 months. Improve blood pressure by 10 mmHg systolic, and/or 5 mmHg diastolic in 6 months. This pilot was planned to be implemented in 4 clinics with a large percentage of patients with Medicaid coverage, with a lead physician in each clinic. Patients included need to be open to scheduling an appointment to address hypertension and receive education for accurate home blood pressure monitor ing. Training was provided to all clinical and relevant support staff. The focus is on patients who have Medicaid as their health insurance because automated blood pressure monitors are covered under Medicaid insurance. However, the specific model preferr ed by the clinicians was not the 'standard' cuff in stock with our DME provider for Medicaid payment. Due to the ability to import data into the EMR, the project team felt it was important to utilize that equipment. A significant number of negotiations and approvals were needed to fully implement the project using the preferred technology. 129 We needed to define and establish the billing processes with the DME department of the care group and the health plan network management area. This resulted in a delay i n kick -off of the project to March 2022. Training for the participating teams included delineation of responsibility based on the team members role, information on how to use the SDOH screening tools in EPIC, and the workflows that would be followed (see figure 1). Figure 4 Clinic Workflow for Hypertension Pilot It is important to note that while the focus of this project was all Medicaid members with hypertension, this did include members with diabetes who have hypertension. The project showed positive results in several areas, including a 6% increase in blood pressure control for those patients in the cohort, compared to a slight decrease in control for patients overall. (See graph 1) 130 Graph 1 : HealthPartners Care Group Health Disparities Maintenance of Certification In addition to this pilot, HealthPartners care group is offering a Maintenance of Certification (MOC) on Addressing Health Disparities MOC with a focus on Diabetes and Vascular Management . In 2022, there wer e two cohorts of clinicians who participated in this project, with varying successes. This MOC will continue to be an option for clinicians to work on in 2023. Cohort 1 decreased the race disparity gap among their patients by over 6%. o Race data showed inc rease in patient of color outcomes by more than 5%. o Race data showed patients of color 67% at goal and more than 8% higher than white patients. Cohort 2 decreased the payor disparity gap by over 1% o Payor data showed increase for patients in Government Programs outcomes by more than 1%. o Payor data showed increase for patients in Government Programs at 57.1% at goal and 2% higher than Commercial patients. Support for Social Drivers of Health We know that social drivers of health (SDOH) such as food and housing resources directly impact a person's ability to meet health goals. In 2021, HealthPartners implemented a new approach to addressing SDOH for our members through a partnership with NowPow. This platform allows staff to make referrals for basic needs and other community resources that are local to the member. 131 Needs are identified by members in a variety of ways including the Health Assessment, member -facing teams such as MTM Pharmacists, RideCare, Member Services, Disease and Case Management, Health Coaching as well as by clinicians within our care system. A customized list of resources is created for the member based on their location, hours the service is open, etc. and can be translated into many different languages. The list can be sent to the member via email. This resource is now available to anyone who logs onto the HealthPartners website regardless of participation with other HealthPartners services. Search local resources , assistance, and support | HealthPartners In 2022, four out of the top 10 types of services offered to members were food related. Because food insecurity is both such a prevalent issue, and so directly impacts health, HealthPartners is partnering with FarmboxRx to deliver boxes of fresh produce directly to members' homes for free. This is part of the organization's ongoing effort to address social and community factors that impact overall health, including food insecurity . Eligible seniors can receive up to two boxes of fresh fruits and vegetables each month. The boxes contain different seasonal options designed by a team of registered dietitian nutritionists and can be customized for specific health conditions. They also include nutrition and food education materials. Juniper Collaboration Healthy Aging classes through Juniper are covered for MSHO members as part of our supplemental benefits package. Juniper classes include Living Well with Chronic Conditions, Living Well with Diabetes, and several classes to increase physical activity and strength. In 2022, HealthPartners and Juniper collaborated to reach out to eligible members and refer them for classes when the member is interested. HealthPartners supplied a list of 2,963 members with qualifying conditions for outreach. Juniper sent out mailings and conducted outbound calls to 2,444 members and successfully had conversations with 48% of them. Ultimately, 254 MSHO members participated in Juniper classes in 2022. 132 Class # of MSHO members Living well with Diabetes 3 Living well with Chronic Conditions 6 Walk with Ease 115 Tai Ji Quan 88 Foundation Exercise program 15 Stay Active and Independent for Life 17 Juniper Live Well program participant feedback: 8/8 respondents reported that they: o Can manage their chronic condition o Can work with healthcare professionals o Feel better about managing their chronic conditions after the program Since participating in the program, participants reported making the following lifestyle changes: o Implementing exercise into their daily routine o Making changes to their eating habits Collaborative Interventions Community Outreach and Partnerships 2030 Minnesota Cardiovascular Health and Diabetes State Plan In September 2018, CDC awarded funds to State and Local Health Departments to design, test, and evaluate innovative approaches to address the significant national health problems of diabetes and heart disease and stroke. MDH was one of the awardees. With CDC support, this grant will allow MDH to develop new approaches to increase the reach and effectiveness of evidence- based public health strategies in populations and communities with a high burden of diabetes, or heart disease and stroke. Recipients will conduct rigorous evaluations so that CDC and others can learn from this work. The creation of the 2030 Minnesota Cardiovascular Health and Diabetes Plan is a collaborative effort of state and local partners; started in 2019 and lead by MDH. The plan will be a road map and call to action for individuals, communities, and organizations to collaborate and prevent, treat, and manage diabetes, heart disease, and stroke for the next ten years. MDH shared multiple resources with the project team that each plan shared with our provider network and others working on diabetes care in our communities. These resources are also posted on the project page on the Stratis Health website. In addition, we presented two joint webinars in collaboration with MDH in 2022 to fill knowledge and resource gaps for providers across Minnesota. These webinars are included in the webinar summary below. 133 Webinar series The Collaborative offered a series of webinars in 2021 which will continue throughout the project to improve the comprehensive diabetes care and services for seniors and SNBC members, focusing on closing the gaps in health care disparities within our populations. Care Coordinators/Case Managers have an essential role in educating, supporting, and assisting members in setting and achieving health goals to improve their diabetes care. While some Care Coordinators/Case Managers are nurses, many are social workers who benefit from additional information on the role they can play to support their members with diabetes. All webinars are recorded and posted on the project page of the Stratis Health website for viewing anytime. The webinars offered in 2022 were: Meeting the Challenges of Diabetes: Consequences of Disease Progression - 5/11/2022 Presented by Janet Ungs, Nurse Practitioner, Endocrinology, Park Nicollet Clinic This webinar is the first in a series addressing knowledge gaps of care coordinators and others in diabetes progression. The goal of the presentation series is to provide Care Coordinators, Case Managers, and other professionals working with Minnesota Senior Health Options (MSHO) and Special Needs Basic Care (SNBC) members information to understand the impact of diabetes better and enhance their skillsets when working with members with diabetes. The webinar was attended by 401 people. Food is Medicine - Integrating Effective Nutrition Interventions into the Healthcare System: A Concept Whose Time Has Come - 6/28/2022 Presented by Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, Dean at the Tufts Friedman School of Nutrition Science/Policy Presented in collaboration with the Minnesota Department of Health Diabetes section, this webinar focused on food insecurity as a social determinant of health and contributor to chronic disease prevention and management. Participants learned how health care clinicians and systems are finding new clinical and community interventions to improve patients access to quality nutrition and education. This webinar was attended by 607 individuals. Implicit Bias & the Pursuit of Health Equity 8/10/2022 Presented by Dr. Talee Vang licensed health psychologist and Director of Health Equity Education & Welcome Services at Hennepin Healthcare Implicit bias occurs on an unconscious level. Research suggests that implicit biases affect behaviors more than explicit biases. Research also points to the positive correlation between implicit bias and health disparities. Rooted in psychological theory, research, and practice, this webinar focused on developing a deeper understanding of implicit bias, how it is formed, and its impact on health disparities. In addition to increasing awareness of the relationship between implicit bias and health disparities, evidence- based approaches to decreasing implicit bias are presented. This webinar was attended by 471 people. Transforming Food Shelves to Meet Clients Needs with SuperShelf 9/20/2022 Presented by a panel of collaborators with the MN SuperShelf partnership. 134 Minnesota's SuperShelf partnership is helping to increase access to healthy, appealing, and culturally connected foods across the state. Presented in collaboration with the Minnesota Department of Health Diabetes section, this webinar shared how food shelves are transforming to meet the food needs and improve the experience of people who are food insecure in Minnesota. This presentation will include an overview of the results of the SuperShelf Evaluation Study (NIH) including the Statewide Food Shelf survey, a unique data set with direct insight from people served by food shelves throughout the state. This webinar was attended by 479 individuals. Meeting the Challenges of Diabetes: Working with Non -English Speakers with Diab etes 12/6/2022 Presented by Hilda Hererra, CHW with CHW Solutions and Marie Sherwood, Health Coach Disease Management, UCare Diabetes Health Journey program and Migraine Management Program A diagnosis of diabetes can be overwhelming. When you don't speak the primary language of the health care system, it can be especially daunting to learn about your condition and understand all the recommended steps patients should take to stay healthy. This webinar reviewed the basics of working with interpreters; how language and cultural differences impact care, create misunderstandings, jeopardize appropriate follow -through, and common points where misunderstandings can happen. Community Health Workers and Care Coordinators can play a valuable role in reducing these barriers and the presenters will share tips from their years of experience working directly with people with diverse languages and cultures. This webinar was attended by 496 individuals. Barrier Analysis and Gaps in Care The initiatives implemented within the scope of this project are intended to improve seniors and SNBC enrollee members self -management of their diabetes. Additionally, this project will reduce the disparities by addressing factors such as nutrition and phy sical activity. 1. Members and clinicians may not be aware of supplemental benefits available to them, and members may not understand how those programs and services could benefit their chronic condition. 2. Clinics continue to be impacted by staffing shortages due to burn -out and leaving the profession, making access to appointments problematic. Some clinics are unable to fully support nurse- only blood pressure checks. 3. Clinics and members may not be aware that home blood pressure monitors are a covered benefit for Medicaid members. 4. Patients do not always schedule requested follow -up appointments for an elevated blood pressure. 5. In early 2022 there was continued hesitancy by members to return to clinics for preventive care services due to masking mandates and continued reluctance for in person visits even if vaccinated. 6. If blood pressure is elevated during a clinic visit, there is not always time for repeat auto average blood pressure measurement process as it takes an additional 8 minutes. 135 Opportunities for Improvement: Results/Outcomes The core measurement for this project is the HEDIS\u00ae Comprehensive Diabetes Care, BP Control measure. Below is the baseline data and first -year data with claims run- out which reflects the 2021 measurement year. Additional outcomes data will be reported to DHS later in 2022 and will be included in next year's update for this project. Table 8 Baseline Blood Pressure Control for People with Diabetes.

We will continue to partner with the other Medicaid healt h plans to develop supports, resources and education for Care Coordinators as they work to support members with diabetes. 136 MSHO Chronic Care Improvement Program Summary of CCIP: This chronic care improvement program (CCIP) will focus on identifying and diagnosing members with hypertension to engage members in clinical care for blood pressure management and improve health outcomes . 2022 CCIP Title: H2422 Identifying Members with Hypertension to Improve Health Outcomes MCO Name HealthPar tners, Inc. Contact Person : Tammy Chambers, Clinical Quality Consultant 952-883-5761 Tammy.j.chambers2@healthpartners.com Implementation Date: The hypertension CCIP will begin 1/1/2022 and conclude 12/31/2024. Target Chronic Condition: Hypertension Description of CCIP The chronic care improvement program (CCIP) will focus on identifying and diagnosing hypertension in the MSHO population. HealthPartners will utilize claims in capturing diagnosis of hypertension during clinic office visits and measure the prevalence year over year for the program. The progress will be measured based on the prevalence of members diagnosed with hypertension. The goal of the CCIP is to increase the identification and diagnosis of hypertension by 3% by the end of the three- year program. Clinical Knowledge/Research Screening for Hypertension in Adults: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) prepared for Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality U.S. Department of Health and Human Services identified that blood pressure screening at a single visit has a low sensitivity and adequate specificity for detection of hypertension, leading to a substantial number of potentially missed cases. Hypertension is one of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). 1 Although hypertension is often discussed as though it is a disease entity, it is more appropriately categorized as a continuous risk factor that is a 1Aihara A, Imai Y, Sekino M, et al.

KQ2E4a, KQ3E5, KQ4E4. 137 strong predictor of poor health.23 The USPSTF recommends screening for hypertensio n in adults aged 18 years or older with office blood pressure measurement (OBPM). The USPSTF recommends obtaining blood pressure measurements outside of the clinical setting for diagnostic confirmation before starting treatment. The USPSTF suggests annual screening for hypertension in adults aged 40 years or older and for adults at increased risk for hypertension (such as persons with high- normal blood pressure, who are overweight or obese, or who are African American). The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening for hypertension with office blood pressure measurement and treatment of hypertension in adults substantially reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events. 4 According to an article in The Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety \"hypertension increases risk for heart disease and stroke, and many persons are unaware that they have it. Blood pressure (BP) measurements are used to detect and diagnose hypertension and evaluate treatment. Controlling hypertension is a significant contributor to reducing risk for heart attack and stroke, which are leading causes of death in the United States. A 2010 article asserted that treating hypertension was the clinical preventive service that could avert the greatest number of deaths. Moreover, controlling hypertension may significantly reduce the more than $320 billion in health care costs and lost productivity caused by cardiovascular disease every year.\" 5 Approximately 11 million U.S. adults with a usual source of health care have undiagnosed hypertension, placing them at increased risk for cardiovascular events (1- 3). Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed the Million Hearts Hypertension Prevalence Estimator Tool, which allows health care delivery organizations to predict their patient population's hypertension prevalence based on demographic and comorbidity characteristics (2). Organizations can use this tool to compare predicted prevalence with their observed prevalence to identify potential underdiagnosed hypertension. This study applied the tool using medical billing data alone and in combination with clinical data collected among 8.92 million patients from 25 organizations participatin g in American Medical Group Association (AMGA) national learning collaborative* to calculate and compare predicted and observed adult hypertension prevalence. Using billing data alone revealed that up to one in eight cases of hypertension might be undiagnosed. However, estimates varied when clinical data were included to identify comorbidities used to predict hypertension prevalence or describe observed hypertension 2 Akilli H, Kayrak M , Aribas A, et al.

These findings demonstrate the tool's potential use in improving identification of hypertension and the likely importance of using both billing and clinical data to establish hypertension and comorbidity prevalence estimates and to support clinical quality improvement efforts.\"6 Target Population Total Enrollment: In 2021, there wer e 2,138 HealthPartners MSHO members diagnosed with hypertension without complications. Of those 2,138 members, who in 2021 were enrolled for a minimum of 9 months in the H2422 MSHO contract that covers members in Minnesota, 92.2%, or 1,972, had hypertensio n without complications reconfirmed. This results in an opportunity to improve the hypertension reconfirmation rate by 7.8%, or 166 members. It is noted YTD for dates of service through December 2022 without the minimum numbers of months of continuous enrollment and without claims runout the prevalence was 37.3%. However, these results could be impacted by the membership growth and full runout of claims not included in the most recent data. Once the final runout is available, a review of the prevalence pe rcentage will be performed. MSHO continues to have a high reconfirmation rate of those who have had a previous diagnosis. Target Population Description: The MSHO population is typically members greater than 65 years of age. According to the Minnesota Department of health, 52% of Minnesota adults aged 65 or older reported being told they have high blood pressure. 7 There is an opportunity to accurately identify and diagnose members with high blood pressure to appropriately manage the chronic condition of hypertension to prevent adverse health outcomes. Again, using 2021Q4 baseline data, HealthPartners has identified approximately 2,138 MSHO Medicare members in the target population with a diagnosis of hypertension without 6 https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6729a2.htm 7 https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/cardiovascular/cardio -dashboard/hbpprev.html 139 complications. This equates to a prevalence of 50.7% which differs slightly from the Minnesota statistic of 52%. Target Goal This chronic care improvement plan will seek to increase the diagnosis of hypertension in the MSHO population by (3%). Baseline The HealthPartners prevalence in the MSHO population for members with a diagnosis of hypertension without complications is 50.7% This will be utilized as the baseline. The goal is to increase the prevalence through better documentation and diagnosis of hypertension in the MSHO population by 3%. National Standard According to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, hypertension is a prevalent condition, effecting approximatel y 45% of the adult U.S. population. It is the most diagnosed condition at outpatient office visits. Hypertension is a major contributing risk factor to heart failure, heart attack, stroke, and chronic kidney disease.8 Data Source(s) Used to Measure Goal The data source used to measure this goal will be claims data. Planned Interventions 1. Multifactorial communication to reinforce identification and diagnosis of hypertension. 2. Enrollee outreach via authenticated accounts and once yearly direct mail sent to t hose members who do not have an authenticated account for those that have not completed an annual wellness visit. 3. Enrollee/Caregiver Engagement -utilize not only the annual wellness visits but all visits to address high blood pressure. 4. Enrollee/Caregiver Engagement -outreach members not at goal for blood pressure or overdue for monitoring. 5. Caregiver Engagement -patient education materials for high blood pressure in additional languages including Spanish, Somali, Vietnamese, Cambodian/Khmer, and Hmong. 6. Healt h Plan Care Management 8 https://www.usp reventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/draft -recommendation/hypertension- in-adults -screening- 2020 140 Description of Intervention 1. The largest provider group which cares for approximately 75% of MSHO members utilizes a consistent robust multifactorial approach to raise visibility of evaluation and management of hypertension to deliver optimal care in blood pressure management. 2. Enrollee outreach via authenticated accounts if the member has signed up and once yearly direct mail sent to those members that do not have an authenticated account for those that have not completed an annual wellness visit. Approximately 50% of the MSHO population have authenticated accounts. Health plan diabetes outreach in 2022 included messaging for high blood pressure. 3. Utilize current outreach process to identify members who need annual wellness visits and encourage member to schedule those preventive visits and manage chronic conditions. Continue current process of addressing high blood pressure at every visit. These interventions will increase the rate of preventive visits completed and number of members identified with high blood pressure. The health plan is in conversations with the largest provider group that serves most of this population. This medical group is familiar with the Million Hearts Project that started in 2012 which was mentioned above. The implementation of standard blood pressure measurement in primary care with auto average measurement for elevated BP readings using Omron in one of the larger clinics in 2007 and for all patients and supported the expansion of this process across the whole organization in 2019. This medical group is currently using the Wizard tool developed by an internal research team to support hypertension management, treatment plan and shared decision making with the patient for all populations. They also have a new hypertension analysis with robust outcome data. Due to the continued impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic they have seen a significant drop in optimal care. These barriers will be discussed further in the annual update. 4. Utilize the annual wellness visit to identify chronic conditions and schedule follow up screenings and identify risk of hypertension for members with high -normal blood pressure, who are overweight or obese, or who are African American. Ensure the screenings are completed by providing outreach to those members and establish an individualized care plan for those members. This intervention will increase the rate of members who are appropriately identified and diagnosed with hypertension. 5. The largest provider group follows the continuous improvement model and adjusts as necessary and currently has an initiative for those members not at goal or overdue for blood pressure monitoring where a letter is sent encouraging members to send readings back into my chart which will be manual ly updated as not automatic. 6. The largest provider group initiated 2022 Year End Chronic Condition Focus a. Focused List (Diabetes and Vascular) b. Action List (Hypertension) 7. Track my Health MyChart BP Outreach 141 8. There are patient education handouts that are provided to patients with 2022 year end initiatives: a. Blood Pressure Patient Education i. Understanding High Blood Pressure ii. How to Take Your Blood Pressure at Home iii. Dash Diet b. Additional languages include Spanish, Somali, Vietnamese, Cambodian/Khmer, and Hmong. 9. Health Plan Home BP Monitors Benefit and Distribution a. Eligible diabetes members not at goal b. Omron home BP monitor sent to patients at no cost. 10. Health Plan Care Management: follows process to identify and engage members with chronic conditions and provide support through care management if appropriate. Measurement Methodology How will progress be measured? 1. Identify MSHO Medicare Advantage members who have been diagnosed with hypertension in the previous year. 2. The number of members identified compared to the number of members that are diagnosed in the current year. 3. Member outreach: a. Identify MSHO Medicare Advantage members using internal metrics who need an annual wellness visit. b. The number of members identified for outreach compared to the number who scheduled preventive visits. 4. Utilize annual wellness visit (AWV): a. The annual wellness visit will be used to identify chronic conditions and ensure screenings that are clinically appropriate. b. MSHO members w ith the chronic condition of hypertension will be identified by the clinical team during the AWV and current process of addressing high blood pressure at every visit. The plan will conduct outreach to encourage them to complete an annual wellness visit and develop care plan to manage high blood pressure. c. Of those identified for outreach related to an annual wellness visit, how many have completed the AWV. 5. Member outreach for blood pressure monitoring: a. Identify members and send letter to members not at goal for blood pressure or overdue for blood pressure monitoring. b. The number of members identified for outreach compared to the number who are at goal for blood pressure or have been monitored. 142 6. Care Management Engagement: a. Identify member eligible for care mana gement. b. The number of members engaged in care management compared to the number who are eligible. 143 Medicare Advantage Chronic Care Improvement Program Summary of CCIP: This chronic care improvement program (CCIP) will focus on identifying and diagnosing members with hypertension to engage members in clinical care for blood pressure management and improve health outcomes. 2022 CCIP Title: H4882 Identifying Members with Hypertension to Improve Health Outcomes MCO Name: HealthPartners, Inc. Contact Person : Tammy Chambers, Clinical Quality Consultant 952-883-5761 Tammy.j.chambers2@healthpartners.com Implementation Date: The Hypertension CCIP will begin 1/1/2021 and conclude 12/31/2023. Target Chronic Condition: Hypertension CCIP Annual Update Barriers Encountered 1. Healthcare Team Issue(s) - The largest provider group which cares for approximately 80% of the HealthPartners Medicare Advantage population identified these barriers below: a. Limited access due to the continued impact from the pandemic; postponement of preventive visits and other routine care and pent -up demand b. Increase in staffing shortages across care groups due to health care burn out and declining enrollment in health care schooling programs. i. If blo od pressure elevated, there is not always time for repeat auto average blood pressure measurement process as it takes an additional 8 minutes. ii. Inability to support nurse only blood pressure checks. c. Virtual visits: i. Inability to obtain a blood pressure reading if patient does not have an automated digital machine. ii. If patient has a machine and provides a reading that is elevated, no ability to follow auto average blood pressure measurement process. d. Patient engagement i. Patients do not always schedule requested f ollow -up for an elevated blood pressure. 144 2. HealthPartners has an incentive program with the largest provider group (new in 2022) and select network partners who manage much of the Medicare Advantage population. One of the incentives was in completing an annual wellness visit and a potential for earnings in reconfirming chronic conditions. a. These providers experienced staffing shortages, shift in ambulatory services to cover urgent care closings and pent -up delay in care continuing into 2022 due to the new COVI D-19 variant surges. 3. Member issues: a. May not understand the importance of preventive care visits and getting their blood pressure checked. b. May not have ability to purchase a home blood pressure cuff to monitor blood pressure more closely. c. In early 2022 there was continued hesitancy by members to return to clinics for preventive care services due to masking mandates and continued reluctance for in person visits even if vaccinated. Mitigation Strategies 1. The largest provider group clinicians use the \"Priority Wizard\" to assess a patient's risk for cardiovascular disease, and this tool also makes recommendations for next steps in care. 2. For elevated blood pressures they have follow -up guidelines established that are followed. 3. 2022 Year End Chronic Condition Focus a. Focused List (Diabetes and Vascular) b. Action List (Hypertension) 4. Track my Health MyChart BP Outreach 5. There are patient education handouts that are provided to patients with 2022- year end initiatives: a. Blood Pressure Patient Education i. Under standing High Blood Pressure ii. How to Take Your Blood Pressure at Home iii. Dash Diet b. Additional languages include Spanish, Somali, Vietnamese, Cambodian/Khmer, and Hmong, 6. There are nutrition services available, and clinicians can consult with them or refer a patient who can schedule a visit with a dietician. 7. The Health Plan has an incentive program with the largest provider group and select network partners with potential earnings for both completion of an annual wellness visit and reconfirming chronic conditions. 145 8. The Health Plan provides outreach through authenticated accounts to members to encourage completing an annual wellness visit. Approximately 85% of the Medicare Advantage population have authenticated accounts. For those who do not have authenticated ac counts they will receive direct mail outreach in Q4 2022 with a reminder to complete the annual wellness visit. Language was added to the diabetic outreach campaigns with a reminder for members to get their blood pressure checked, this will be distributed via authenticated accounts in 2022 communications. 9. The Health Plan Comprehensive Care Advocacy coordinators provide outreach to members who meet criteria for disease management and promote and coach members to complete the annual wellness visit. Results and Findings This project for 2020 dates of service identified a prevalence of 42.2%. The overall goal for this CCIP is to increase the prevalence by 3%. It was also noted the reconfirmation rate was 86.9% with an opportunity of 13.1%. Year to date through December 2022 without the minimum number of months requirement and without claims runout identified an increase of membership from 21,963 in 2020 to 37,433 in 2022 with a prevalence of 36.3% and opportunity of 11.6%. The 3% goal was not met in t he annual update. However, these results could be impacted by the membership growth and full runout of claims not included in the most recent data. Once the final runout is available, a review of the prevalence percentage will be performed. HealthPartners Medicare Advantage (HP MA) continues to have a high reconfirmation rate of those who have had a previous diagnosis. Total Target Population The total number of enrollees included members with at least 9 months of continuous enrollment in the evaluation year for the 2021Q4 dates of service was 34,003 with a reconfirmation rate of 88.2%. The opportunity for reconfirmation was 1,757 members or a rate of 11.8%. 146 Number of Enrollees Who Received Intervention(s) The total number of enrollees who received reconfirmation of hypertension for the 2021Q4 dates of service was 13,132. Results and/or Percentage The CCIP results and/or percentage data for each intervention; the overall 2021Q4 dates of service prevalence results were 43.8% which included all interventions combined. The numeric or percentage results comparing the target goal and baseline linked to each intervention; the prevalence percentage improved slightly from 42.4% to 43.8%. However, it was noted that the number of members increased with a slightly higher percentage completion rate. The data source(s) and data collection period. a. Claims and encounter data compile 2021Q4 rates include Medicare members with at least 9 months of continuous enrollment in the evaluation year. Analysis of Results or Findings There was a slight improvement in the prevalence percentage of 1.4% from 2020Q4 to 2021Q4 however YTD through December 2022 without 9 months of continuous enrollment was 36.3%, a decrease from the 2021Q4 43.8%. Next Steps& Action Plan 1. A description of the actual or proposed changes: The largest provider group will continue to follow their processes for identifying and documenting hypertension. The health plan did establish a contractual incentive program with the largest provider group (new in 2022) and select network partners to complete a annual wellness visit and reconfirm chronic conditions. The Health Plan provides outreach for memb ers to complete the annual wellness visit through authenticated accounts and direct mail for those who do not have authenticated accounts. The Health Plan offered an over -the-counter benefit in 2022 that may assist in providing partial coverage for a home blood pressure cuff if the member meets criteria. 2. The rationale for the changes and how the Action Plan will work towards achieving the project goal(s): The largest provider group follows the continuous improvement model and adjusts as necessary. They hav e developed a standard blood pressure (BP)measurement tip sheet; BP follow up guidelines tip sheet and other documents that support taking and managing blood pressure. They also provide education documents regarding blood pressure awareness and action plan to assist the members in recognizing blood pressure. Free blood pressure checks are offered at several clinics in the service area. The select incented network partners will continue to schedule annual wellness visits and address chronic conditions. 3. Whether or not these changes have already been implemented, or the plan for implementing these changes during the upcoming year. The largest provider group has 147 developed tools to assist in identifying and documenting hypertension in the Medicare Advantage po pulation. The annual wellness visit is encouraged and year to date for the Medicare Advantage population there is a 68% completion rate through December 2022. The Health Plan will be adding an over -the-counter benefit in 2022 that could help defray the cost of a home blood pressure cuff if eligibility requirements are met. The Health Plan added language in the diabetic outreach campaigns with a reminder for members to get their blood pressure checked, this was distributed via authenticated accounts in 2022 communications. In which approximately 85% of the Medicare Advantage population has authenticated accounts. Best Practices 1. How the MAO identified these best practices(s): The health plan meets regularly with the largest provider group and a annual wellness visit and reconfirmation rates are shared, and an incentive was implemented in 2022. The largest provider group has a very good clinical foundation to support identifying and documenting hypertension. Chronic conditions are identified and managed, the care model for hypertension includes standard guidelines and processes for diagnosis, treatment, follow -up care, measurement, and optimal care goals. The select incented providers also focus on completing the annual wellness visit and reconfirming chronic conditions. 2. How these best practices have or will impact the CCIP and expected results: It is expected that the clinical process workflows, annual wellness visits and reconfirming chronic conditions should increase the prevalence of the diagnosing and doc umenting hypertension. 3. How the MAO will share the details of these best practices with others: It is yet to be determined how the best practices will be shared more broadly and how they will be implemented. 4. How the MAO will or may implement these best practices going forward: The impact of the clinical processes for the largest provider group will be determined from the 2022 data. Also, the impact of the incentive program will be determined with 2022 data as well. Lessons Learned Lessons learned i n 2022 were that provider's clinical processes continued to be impacted due to the pandemic. The providers will continue to follow their processes for identifying and documenting hypertension to ensure that all member/patients receive an annual visit and therefore reconfirm chronic conditions and complete preventive screenings. It is our hope that all the lessons learned with the largest provider group will then be able to be shared more broadly and increase the identification and diagnosis of hypertension. 148 Medical Record Documentation Accountable Owner Quality Improvement and Compliance: Tammy Chambers Description Medical record documentation standards should facilitate communication, coordination, and continuity of care. HealthPartners conducts an annual audit to measure the quality of documentation of select indicators. The Medical Record Standards Advance Care Planning measure is a requirement under our DHS contract for State Public Program members. The measure includes PMAP, MNCare, MSHO and MSC+ mem bers 19 years and older seen at primary care clinics. 2022 Medical Record Documentation (DOS 2021) Indicators: Indicator Data Source Purpose Results Action Plan Advance Directives - documented in medical record that provider has discussed advance directive planning with member or member has a completed advanced directive on file. documented. Data set pulled for HEDIS - Preventive Services Public Program Members U p to Date - Adult (19 years and older) - same data specifications as HEDIS\u00ae Advance Planning in Care of the Older Adult Coordination of care and adequacy of medical record documentation. Eighteen medical groups were included in the medical record documentation clinical indicator audit. Continue to monitor and report clinic specific results.2022 result letters sent to medical groups, requesting they focus on a goal of20% or better advanced care planning documentation in 2023. Goals HealthPartners will continue to monitor and report medical record audit data. The 2022 result letters from HealthPartners Quality and Compliance team notified medical groups of their performance on this measure and requested groups work to meet a specific goal of at least 20% in 2022. 149 Opportunities for Improvement: Results/Outcomes Performance ranged from a high of 25.71% percent to a low of 0.00% percent. This report is a snapshot in time and performance is based on a sample of medical records. The variability in performance may, in part, be due to sample size. However, the levels of documentation do indicate a continued need to focus on this measure as the aggregate percentage for 2021 DOS was 6.67% overall which was down from an average of 15.2% for 2020 DOS. Interventions 1) In January of 2016 Medicare initiated payment to physicians to discuss end of life care planning with patients. 2) Communication regarding performance is shared with the selected provider groups with the recommended goal of 20% completion in the rec ords reviewed. 3) Examples of some of the work done by one of the largest provider groups in our network are Health, PAMinnesota Community CareOpen Cities HealthCommunity University Health Care Center (CUHCC)Stillwater Medical GroupMedical Record Documentation Advance Directives Public Programs, MSHO and Medicare Ages 19 and older 2022 Rates with 2021 Dates of Service150 a) In April 2022 a Huddle Article (a weekly recap of the most important information, news and events taking place across the organization) titled \"Creating a Health Care Directive\" was released for National Health Care Decisions Day. b) Work continues around areas of opportu nity identified in 2020: i) Clinicians trained in having advance directive conversations and provided tools/resources to do so such as a video example, clinician specific handbook and other pertinent resources. ii) Creation of two new forms for EPIC documentation. iii) Ability to track documentation by race, language, country of origin and payer. c) In 2021 interpreter training was completed in advance care planning. d) In 2021 EPIC advanced care planning projects were top priorities. The following work continues: i) What Matters Most offered an area within Epic where clinicians can document information gathered through interviews with patients about what is most important in their lives. Work is being done to add this information to the medical record. ii) An EPIC health care agent field is coming soon. iii) Communication has been shared with health plan regarding EPIC fields that identify advance care planning discussions. e) New health care directive forms are now available and shared broadly i) In spring of 2022, the HealthPartners short & long form health care directives are now available in Spanish. In the fall of 2022 new Somali directives were created. f) Reporting tools built in EPIC within the last year that answers the question, \"does this patient have an advance directive on file.\" Aggregated data for home and community services identified that 79.9% have an advance directive on file. g) The wellness visit (AWV) structure supports the discussion about advance directives between the provider and member for those who are eligible. Barriers The pandemic continued to impact preventive services in 2022. o There was pent up demand for delayed services. o Health systems experienced staffing shortages for front line, nursing and physician roles. Age can be a barrier to advance directive compl etion as young adults are less motivated to complete. Conversations and interpretations regarding having an advance directive may not translate in a culturally relevant way. 151 MSHO Model of Care Measurable Goals Accountable Owner: Emi Bennett Vo, Government Programs Member Populations Targeted Commercial Medicare Freedom (Cost) Medicaid X MSHO HPUPH WI Marketplace Description The MSHO Model of Care describes the management, procedures, and operational systems that HealthPartners has in place to provide access to services, coordination of care and the structure needed to best provide services and care for the MSHO population. The MSHO Model of Care was approved for years 2021- 2022. We have not presented historical data because the Model of Care Measurable Goals can differ from previous approved versions. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) requires plans to identify and define measurable goals and health outcomes for the Model of Care. HealthPartners received a three -year approval for a new MSHO Model of Care, which is in effect for years 2023- 2025. The new Model of Care includes updated measurable goals. Goals, Re sults, Initiatives/Interventions MSHO Model of Care Measurable Goals Measurable Goals Description Results Initiatives/Interventions 2021 2022 Initial Health Risk Assessment Rates Achieve a 0.5% increase over the 2020 baseline rate at the end of a three- year period for initial health risk assessments completed within 90 days of each beneficiary's initial enrollment. Not Met Met The MSHO care coordination team continued to address timeliness and engagement of members in initial HRA completion. The team exceeded its goal by the end of Q1 2022 and continued to exceed its goal at an increasing rate for Q2, Q3 and Q4. The interventions initiated in 2021 were successful in reaching and exceeding the goal. The Corrective Action Plan was formally closed in April 2022. The MSHO team 152 MSHO Model of Care Measurable Goals Measurable Goals Description Results Initiatives/Interventions 2021 2022 continues to closely monitor its initial HRA completion rate. Health Risk Assessment Reassessment Rates Achieve a 0.5% increase over the 2020 baseline rate at the end of a three- year period for reassessments completed within 365 days of the previous health risk assessment. Not Met Not Met The MSHO care coordination team continued to address timeliness and engagement of members in Reassessment HRA completion. The team did not reach its goal by the end of Q4 2022. The interventions initiated in 2021 were successful in maintaining but not improving the completion rate. The MSHO team experienced an increase in the number of members who declined an assessment or who were not reached over prior years. Although the Corrective Action Plan was formally closed in April 2022, the MSHO team continued to implement corrective action including care coordination staff retraining on tips to engage members who decline an RHRA, on member outreach to find members, and on documentation of m ember declines or unable to be reached. The MSHO care coordination team continues to evaluate, identify, and implement improvements. Mammography - Breast Cancer Screening Accomplish a relative 1.0% increase over the baseline of 69.4% from the 2019 HEDIS report reflecting 2018 dates of service at the end of a three - year period in the rate of breast cancer screenings. Met Not Met We achieved a rate of 64%. In 2022, HealthPartners continued email notifications to members with authenticated accounts to complete breast cancer screening. We also engaged CHW Solutions to have community health workers outreach to non-HealthPartners care group members to encourage them to complete breast cancer screening (~19% completion). Care coordinators encouraged members to complete breast cancer screening. 153 MSHO Model of Care Measurable Goals Measurable Goals Description Results Initiatives/Interventions 2021 2022 Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) Rates Achieve a 1.0% increase over the 2018 dates of service baseline rate of 30.18% per year over the three-year period for annual wellness visits completed yearly for eligible enrollees. Met Met We achieved a rate of 62.4%. In 2022, HealthPartners continued email notifications to members with authenticated accounts to complete the AWV. Also, there was a direct mail campaign sent to those members who did not have an authenticated account. Care coordinators encouraged members to complete the AWV. HealthPartners performs an annual comprehensive review of the current measurable goals and health outcomes to determine if goals have met benchmarks and have been achieved. An evaluation of all measures is conducted to determine which measures will be continued, be reevaluated and redefined, or be removed and replaced with a new measure or outcome. Barrier Analysis Some barriers are discussed in the table above. In addition, when the Model of Care was written, the goals were written over a three -year period in anticipation of a three- year approval. However, NCQA only approved the Model of Care for two years, so the goal period now extends beyond the timeframe of the Model of Care. The decision was made to not update the goals since it would require re-submis sion of the Model of Care for review. 154 2022 Over/Under Utilization Analysis: Inpatient Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Summary The Over/Under Utilization Analysis of inpatient days per thousand for mental and chemical health is completed annually to monitor and evaluate inpatient mental health and chemical health rates over time. Mental health and substance use disorder inpatient utilization for selected products is shown in tables A1- 2, B1- 2, and C1- 2 following this report. Data in red exceeds eit her the upper and/or lower threshold. When HealthPartners set thresholds, several years of historical data was included given year over year lowering of some days per 1000 outcomes. In 2015, HealthPartners rebased thresholds using more current experience data from 2011 - 2013. In 2020, a large enough data set was available and upper and lower thresholds were established for lengths of stay (LOS) for SNBC members who HealthPartners has provided insurance coverage for since 2016. This population continues t o be small and has a high number of members who have extended LOS for both mental health and substance use disorder conditions. Background HealthPartners has, through benefit design, network design, and medical management policies, structured a continuum of care which includes a variety of clinical services and options for members with varying acuity. Inpatient mental health and chemical health care are important components of the overall continuum of health services provided by HealthPartners. The behavi oral health inpatient admission rate is potentially sensitive to various impacts related to utilization of overall care, networks, benefits, and the population itself. For example, over -use of inpatient care can result from under -use of outpatient and intermediate levels of care. Conversely, under -use of inpatient care could result from over -dependence on outpatient and intermediate levels of care or avoidance of care despite increasing clinical complexity, inadequacy in the number of contracted facilities , or limited availability of contracted providers. Additionally, the prevalence of members who are diagnosed with behavioral health conditions and who may need or be seeking behavioral health care may fluctuate based on changes in required screenings, crit eria for different levels of care or benefits for behavioral health care. Another substantial factor can be the size of a population. Small populations that have only a few thousand members, such as MSHO, can be subject to significant utilization volatili ty based on just a few outlier cases. Relevance of the Analysis The Over/Under Utilization Analysis of inpatient days per thousand for mental and chemical health is completed annually to monitor and evaluate inpatient mental health and chemical 155 health r ates over time and to provide a global view of the effectiveness of behavioral health and utilization management programs (See Tables E and F), since the intent of these programs is to support improved continuity and coordination of outpatient care in efforts to decrease the likelihood of hospitalization. If it is found that inpatient rates exceed upper and lower thresholds, additional analysis and/or improvement actions, when required, are pursued with multidisciplinary input. How Thresholds were Determi ned Thresholds for over - and under - inpatient utilization are based on local and national HEDIS performance for mental health and chemical health utilization and developed using standard deviations and monthly averages that reflect a standardized approach to quantifying and projecting targets. Thresholds are set at the product and service levels to account for variance in benefits and health needs of members by product. For Medicaid, the upper threshold is the monthly average for the product/service type plus one standard deviation and the lower threshold is the monthly average minus one standard deviation. This applies to both mental health and chemical health separately. For MSHO and SNBC, the upper threshold is the monthly average f or the product/service type plus 30% and the lower threshold is the monthly average minus 30%. Due to the comparatively small MSHO and SNBC populations, this creates high variability in monthly utilization rates. Using a standard deviation to set over and under thresholds would not yield meaningful results. It is for these reasons, that a plus or minus 30% was used instead of a standard deviation. Findings The following thresholds were either not met or exceeded in Medicaid and MSHO products for Mental Heal th and Substance Use Disorder: Medicaid - Mental Health lower threshold of 74.3 days per 1,000. o 2022 fell short of the lower threshold with a LOS of 66.3 days per 1,000. Medicaid - Substance Use Disorder lower threshold of 20.6 days per 1,000. o 2022 fell short of the lower threshold with a LOS of 20.3 days per 1,000. MSHO - Mental Health lower threshold of 127 days per 1,000. o 2022 fell short of the lower threshold with a LOS of 119.2 days per 1,000. MSHO - Substance Use Disorder upper threshold of 11.7 days per 1,000. o 2022 exceeded the upper threshold with a LOS of 13 days per 1,000. SNBC inpatient LOS were within established thresholds for mental health and substance use disorder. 156 Quantitative Analysis Analysis was completed for thresholds that were not met or exceeded, which can be found in Tables A1- 2, B1- 2, and C1- 2. No analysis is required for results that were within established thresholds i.e. SNBC. Facility Analysis Data was gathered to analyze the five (5) highest volume psychiatric hospitals where members were admitted. Those facilities are Abbott Northwestern, University of Minnesota Medical Center, Regions, Mercy, and United hospitals. The analysis includes 1) average LOS for each hospital; 2) annual admission rates and 30- day readmission rates; 3) annual admission rates and 60 -day readmission rates. Average Length of Stay (See Table D1) Overall, average LOS increased from 2021 to 2022. Three (3) hospitals had a higher average LOS than the previous year whereas, two (2) hospitals had a decline in average LOS over the previous year. Median LOS was essentially unchanged year over year. United had the highest average LOS while Regions had the lowest in 2022. 30 Day Readmission ( See Table D2) Overall, 30- day readmission rate decreased from 2021 to 2022, while total admissions remained essentially the same. All five (5) hospitals had a significant decrease in readmissions with the average rate dropping from 12.6% in 2021 to 8.6% in 2022. In 2022, Mercy had the highest 30- day readmission rate (10.08%) but was a 5.6% decrease from 2021. Abbott Northwestern had the lowest 30- day readmission rate as well as the largest decrease in 30 -day readmission from 12.3% in 2021 to 7.2% in 2022. 60 Readmission ( See Table D3) Overall, 60- day readmission rates remained the same from 2021 to 2022, with total admission remaining essentially the same as well. Three (3) hospitals had an increase in 60- day admissions year over year. One (1) of those hospitals saw an increase of over 2% from 2021. Abbott Northwestern had the highest readmission rate of 14.1% in 2022. United had the lowest readmission rate of 7.7%. Qualitative Analysis Multiple factors outside the direct control of hospitals, care team and health plans affect health care outcomes. Health starts with our homes, neighborhoods, and families and is influenced by access to social and economic opportunities; the resources and supports available in our neighborhoods and communities; the quality and safety of schools and workplaces; the cleanliness of our water, food, and air; and the nature of our social interactions and relationships. Establishing and improving policies that positively affect social and economic conditions and those that support changes in individual behavior can, in turn, improve health for large numbers of people in ways that can be sustained over time. Additionally, COVID 19 continues to have unique influences on individuals and families that have led to increases in anxiety, depression, and substance abuse. It's possible that COVID has 157 contributed to the underutilization of inpatient care as patients may have either avoided hospitals or have been discharged prematurely due to concern for potential infection. While there has seemed to be underutilization of inpatient mental health care, there has been an increase in the need for inpatient substance use care as well as an increase in the need for step- down services for continuation of treatment. More severe and persistent substance use has required longer st ays for acute treatment, and the need for step down services has placed pressure on the limited amount of SUD programs for members to be accepted upon discharge from an inpatient setting for the member to succeed in treatment. Also influencing inpatient c are, has been challenges related to the reduction of avoidable hospital readmissions. Examples include medication adherence, health literacy, family/caregiver support, access to and timely availability of outpatient and other lower levels of care, and soc ial determinants of health. While external factors are generally out of the control of HealthPartners, we have made efforts to mitigate the effect on members by continuously looking to improve processes, as necessary and as able, that more effectively and efficiently accommodate members' needs. Actions Taken to Address Over or Under Utilization and Any Issues Identified in Data Analysis 1. Case Management services for all members admitted to inpatient care for psychiatric needs to support real time identific ation and engagement of high -risk members and to ensure care plans, including follow -up mental health appointments within 7 days and/or 30 days of discharge, are implemented before discharge. In addition, case management provides post -discharge counseling and support to all members. 2. Case manager collaboration with care team members including primary care providers, specialists, pharmacy resources, and community -based providers. 3. Case manager access to multiple electronic medical records with our regional pa rtners to enhance our communication with providers and support the physician's plan of care. 4. Assessment and care planning between case managers and members with case managers tailoring interventions to address the member's unique needs, social determinants , barriers, and identified clinical gaps in care, including connections to culturally specific care. 5. Reinforcement by case managers to members of the benefits of virtual clinic/provider visits, the effectiveness of COVID -19 precautions for in- person clinic al visits and the benefits of COVID -19 vaccinations in the prevention of disease transmission and severity. 6. Referrals by case managers to Medication Therapy Management (MTM) services for members with complex medication regimens or medication adherence conc erns. 158 7. Referrals by case managers to a HealthPartners' reserved psychiatry appointment at a contracted mental health clinic in the community for members who are in urgent need of psychiatry care but not established with a provider. 8. Educational newsletter s sent to members with designated behavioral health conditions who are prescribed designated types of psychotropic medications to support them in self-management of their condition and overall health. 9. Utilization management (UM) review of members admitted to psychiatric beds at in- network facilities by day 13 of the stay to help manage length of stays and costs. As part of this review process, UM and case management staff have the ability to seamlessly consult on members admitted to the hospital who may no longer require inpatient care. 10. Training for case managers to further enhance their expertise in working with members to reduce avoidable hospital readmissions, such as motivational interviewing, shared decision making, social determinants of health, cultural awareness, medical and behavioral health conditions, and post -discharge planning. Monitoring of Effe ctiveness of Interventions As demonstrated in the tables below, the initiatives noted above have effectively provided LOS and readmission rate year -over-year stability to the population. This has been supported by members participating in case management and disease management communications from 2021 to 2022. Therefore, this contributes to members receiving appropriate level or care as necessary for their mental health and substance use needs. We have continued to improve our process, including collaborat ion with network hospitals with significant mental health/substance use admissions, to focus more on clinically impactful interventions and engagement and less on administrative tasks and documentation. We hope to see further positive impacts over time. Conclusion HealthPartners aims to support members throughout inpatient admissions and beyond by collaborating with care teams to understand the progression of members' care and ongoing needs and to create action plans regarding potentially avoidable readmissions and avoidable inpatient days. While best efforts are made to influence admissions positively, there will always remain factors outside the direct control of hospitals, care team, and health plans that affect length of stay and readmissions. However, health plan initiatives are continually reviewed for clinical effectiveness, efficiency, and opportunities for improvement. HealthPartners also monitors for changes in membership and unique characteristics and needs of each population by product. This will be of particular importance as members on Medicaid are more likely than members on other types of coverage to experience severe mental health needs that could lead to longer or more frequent inpatient care. COVID- 19 has added an extra layer of compl exity and uncertainty in not only providing case management to members with already complex health needs but also complicates 159 the use of health care as well as establishing and comparing data as regulations, variants, and vaccines provide a changing health landscape. 160 Quantitative Analysis of Utilization Medicaid Table A1: Mental Health Measures Actual Performance Thresholds Upper Lower A2: Use Measures Upper Lower 2021 DOS Admits/1000 4.8 ALOS 20.3 36.9 20.6 MSHO Table B1: Mental Health Measures Actual Performance Thresholds Upper 2021 Admits/1000 119.2 235.8 127 Table B2: Substance Use Disorder Measures Actual Performance Thresholds Upper Lower 2021 DOS Admits/1000 8.9 ALOS DOS 2.9 4.5 Days/1000 13 11.7 6.3 162 SNBC Table C1: Mental Health Measures Actual Performance Thresholds 129.3 69.6 163 Average Length of Stay and Median Length of Stay Table D1 2021 2022 Avg.

Members identified for Comprehensive Care Advocacy programs have multifaceted medical and behavioral health conditions and are at high risk for future hospitalization. Reduction of hospital readmission rates continues to be a priority for care systems, health plans and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. According to quantitative studies, quality and patient safety are compromised during the vulnerable period when patients transition between different settings because of high rates of medication errors, incomplete or inaccurate information transfer, and lack of appropriate follow -up care. Communication interventions such as personalized transition care and post hospital telephone calls are associated with reducing hospital readmissions, improvements in treatment adherence and patient satisfaction (JAMA Network Open, 2021). Members hospi talized with COVID 19 may also benefit from personalized transition care planning. A 2021 retrospective cohort study found that interventions focusing on improvement in self -management planning reduced the risk of hospital readmission. Examples of self -management planning included shared decision making, patient education, medication management, and follow -up appointment reminders (The Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety, 2021). Multiple factors outside the direct control of hospitals, c are team and health plans affect health care outcomes. Health starts with our homes, neighborhoods, and families. In addition to eating well, staying active and doing preventative care, our health is influenced by access to social and economic opportunit ies; the resources and supports available in our homes, neighborhoods, and communities; the quality of our schooling; the safety of our workplaces; the cleanliness of our water, food, and air; and the nature of our social interactions and 167 relationships. By working towards establishing and influencing policies that positively affect social and economic conditions and those that support changes in individual behavior, we can improve health for large numbers of people in ways that can be sustained over time. HealthyPeople2020 goals and initiatives towards establishing policies continue to be reflected into HealthyPeople2030. The COVID 19 endemic continues to have unique influence on households related to employer and school vaccination policies and guidelines for quarantine, testing and treatment options. Goals The objective for this initiative is to reduce the percentage of actively managed comprehensive care advocacy members who had an inpatient readmission within 30 days of a previous hospital admission. The population includes actively managed patients enrolled in comprehensive care advocacy's complex, disease, and behavioral health programs who had an inpatient admission with a length of stay > 0 within 30 days of a previous admission, a case actively managed in the reporting period and admission dates in the reporting period. Authorization/notification data was gathered from CCA's case management system to identify admission dates. Numerator Number of readmissions for the denominator population. An admission is considered a readmission when the admit date is within 30 days of the discharge date of the previous admission. Denominator Number of admissions for Medical Complex, Behavioral Health Complex, and Core Disease Management members who were actively managed in the reporting period and had at least one admission in the reporting period. Admission information is sourced from paid claims data. Baseline and Goal There is a universal definition for the reporting criteria for complex, disease, and behavioral health programs. Each program has a unique readmission rate and baseline. Complex Case Management Baseline: Reporting definitions to capture readmission rates were defined in 2019 combining claims based and CarePartner data. A new baseline was established in 2020 which was 23.6%. 2022 Goal: In 2021 our readmission rate was 22.5%. Our 2022 goal for complex case management was to maintain or reduce the readmission rate from the 2020 baseline of 23.6%. Disease Case Management Baseline: Rep orting definitions to capture readmission rates were defined in 2019 combining claims based and CarePartner data. Baseline data was established in 2020 which was an 8.2% readmission rate. 168 2022 Goal: In 2021 our readmission rate was 4.7%. Our 2022 goal for disease management was to maintain or reduce the readmission rate from the 2020 baseline of 8.2%. Behavioral Health Case Management Baseline: Reporting definitions to capture readmission rates were defined in 2019 combining claims based and CarePartner data. Baseline data was established in 2020 which was a 16.1% readmission rate. 2022 Goal: In 2021 our readmission rate was 16.6%. Our 2022 goal for behavioral health case management was to maintain or reduce the readmission rate from the 2020 baseline of 16.1%. Initiatives/Interventions Case managers provide post -discharge support for members, participating in comprehensive care advocacy management programs, who experience a hospital admission. This support can include the following actions: 1. Enhanced engagement methods to meet the member needs, including adding digital notification regarding our services to high- risk members with HealthPartn ers web -based accounts. 2. Complex Care Navigators provide in person transition support to those at highest risk for readmission. Due to the COVID- 19 endemic, the in- person transition support may be provided via a video visit, home visit, or visit while the member is in a facility. 3. Reinforce the benefits of virtual clinic/provider visits, the effectiveness of COVID -19 precautions for in- person clinical visits and the benefits of COVID -19 vaccinations in the prevention of disease transmission and severity. 4. Assessment and care planning with interventions tailored to address the member's unique needs, social determinants, barriers, and identified clinical gaps in care. 5. Close collaboration with care team members including PCPs, specialists, health care home nurses, home care providers, pharmacy resources, and community -based providers. 6. Case managers have access to multiple EMR's with our regional partners to enhance our communication with providers and support the physician's plan of care. 7. Connection to Medication Therapy Management (MTM) services for members with complex medication regimens or medication adherence concerns. 8. Facilitate maximization of available community resources. 9. Inpatient Case Management services to support real time identification and engagement of high- risk members to ensure milestones and care plans are implemented before discharge. 10. Support by Inpatient Case Navigators to provide in- person/video visit transitions of care and connection to resources to members in targeted geographic regions. 169 11. Coordination of behavioral health care upon discharge to support ongoing management of mental and chemical health needs. 12. Clinical case consultations with Medical Director or Psychiatrist involvement to provide case managers with condition- , treatm ent-, and member -specific interventions related to case management as well as the importance of primary care and new learnings. 13. Access to myStrength, a digital behavioral health application, that allow members to participate in individualized online cognit ive behavioral therapy continues to be available to all members. Additionally, case managers received the following trainings in 2022 to further enhance their expertise in working with members to reduce avoidable hospital readmissions: 1. Motivational Intervi ewing: Motivational interviewing is a style of communication designed to promote change and offer support through exploration of members motivations in consideration of how difficult it is to make behavioral changes. Case managers use this approach to impr ove member health by assisting members to identify internal motivation and encouraging them to make a commitment to positive change. 2. Call Quality Program: Case manager calls are evaluated by a call quality professional on a routine basis. Case managers ar e provided written and verbal feedback to continuously improved and enhance their interactions with members. The call quality program includes monthly motivational interviewing tips provided in a written format and discussed in team meetings. 3. Shared Deci sion Making: Shared decision making is a crucial component of patient - centered health care, wherein both the member and case manager contribute to the decision- making process. Case managers support member to make decisions that are consistent with the member's preferences and values. 4. Social Determinants of Health: Social determinants of health are non -medical factors that influence health outcomes. They are the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age and the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life. Case managers are trained in assessing and mitigating these conditions using several internal and community resources. 5. Community supports and resources: Case managers receive training on community resources an d access to NowPow, a digital application that acts as a clearing house for community resources. 6. Cultural Awareness: Case managers have access to Culture Vision, a web- based platform, that providers cultural information on multiple cultures, religions, and populations (LGBTQ+, veterans, homeless, etc.) Case managers are provided training that support DEI topics to support member engagement and understanding of influences that may affect readmission to the hospital. 170 7. EMR Capabilities: Case mangers receive ongoing updates and reinforcement on regional partners protocols for communication and workflows. 8. CORE (Asthma, Diabetes, COPD, Heart Failure, CAD) condition training: Case managers received training on all the CORE conditions to enhance their understanding of complications and risks for readmission. 9. Behavioral Health Lunch and Learns (PTSD, Borderline Personality Disorders, Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar disorder, Schizophrenia, Trauma Informed Care): Case managers received training on a series of behavioral health conditions to enhance their understanding of complications and risks for readmission. 10. Targeted Post Discharge Training: Behavioral health, inpatient, and restricted recipient program case managers received training with a focus on assessing for safe transitions of care and avoidance of risks related to readmission. 11. Medical Director Quarterly Updates (Gerontology, CKD, Stroke, Alcohol and Substance Abuse): These training topics are based on the results of our team member annual training needs assessments. The medical director provides condition specific education using case studies that relates to case management and readmission risk. 12. Well-Being Activities: Case managers participate in well -being activities and occasional webinars to support their own resilience and coping. Comprehensive care advocacy has a Be Well committee and team champions that facilitate group activities. Barrier Analysis The COVID -19 endemic continues to be an additional challenge in establishing and comparing accurate baseli ne data. The regulations, variants, and vaccines provide a changing health landscape. It may be beneficial to establish new baselines after the state of emergency has been rescinded and the health care landscape has settled in addition to the current endemic nature of COVID 19 (as opposed to the pandemic state in previous years.) There are challenges related to the reduction of avoidable hospital readmissions. Examples include medication adherence, health literacy, family/caregiver support, access to outpatient and other lower levels of care, and social determinants of health. Seasonality impacts, such as influenza and related respiratory issues complicated by the COVID -19 variants during the winter months, also add to this challenge. There are ongoing opportunities to reduce avoidable hospital readmissions. Case managers will continue to utilize shared decision making and motivational interviewing to help members and families identify their personal goals for their plan of care. Case managers wi ll contact patients post discharge to support them through this transition and communicate with their primary care team regarding any identified concerns or barriers the member is experiencing. Additionally, care navigators will provide in person/video transition support to our highest risk members. 171 Gaps in Care Case managers work closely with discharged members to close gaps in care encountered post discharge. These gaps often center around social determinants of health, diversity and equity, and health care system limitations that create challenges to members accessing care. When members experience issues such as obtaining reliable transportation to appointments, establishing care with a provider of their preferred language or ethnicity, or identifying a provider taking new patients, they may struggle to adhere to care recommendat ions, resort to using more urgent or emergent levels of care, or avoid care altogether until their needs require hospitalization. To assist in closing gaps in care, case managers use the strong partnerships and ACO relationships that HealthPartners has dev eloped with care delivery systems to facilitate collaborations with the care team. This allows for real time interactions to address and solve member needs. Case managers have knowledge of and access to community supports and resources. Case managers enable member connections to resources related to specific needs and gaps in care. Examples of these resources include but are not limited to: 1. NowPow; a personalized community referral platform 2. Culture Vision: a personalized platform for culturally appropriate care planning 3. National Alliance for Mental Illness (NAMI); educates, advocates, and leads to improve the lives of people with mental illness. 4. Make It OK; a campaign to reduce the stigma of mental illness. 5. Language Line; telephonic interpreter services 6. Maternal/Child resources - Doulas, Healthy Beginnings, Help Me Grow 7. County Connections 8. Senior Linkage Line, Disability HUB, Veterans Linkage Line, MinnesotaHelp Opportunities for Improvement: Results/Outcomes Complex Case Management The 2022 goal for the complex case management readmission rate was 23.6%. The 2022 measurement period results were 26.4% for members engaged in complex case management. As we didn't achieve our goal, this continues to be an area of focus. All interventions for this initiative h ave been integrated into standard care coordination processes and this initiative will continue in 2023. Disease Case Management The 2022 goal for the disease case management readmission rate was 8.2%. The 2022 measurement period results were 10.3 % for m embers engaged in disease case management. As we didn't achieve our goal, this continues to be an area of focus. All interventions for this initiative have been integrated into standard care coordination processes and this initiative will continue in 2023. 172 Behavioral Health Case Management The 2022 goal for the behavioral health case management readmission rate was 16.1%. The 2022 measurement period results were 16.7% for members engaged in behavioral health case management. As we didn't achieve our goal, this continues to be an area of focus. All interventions for this initiative have been integrated into standard care coordination processes and this initiative will continue in 2023. 2022 CCA Readmission Rates Denominator: Number of admissions for Medical Complex, Behavioral Health Complex, and Core DM patients who were actively managed in the reporting period and had at least 1 admission in the reporting period. Admission information is sourced from paid claims data. Numerator: Number of readmissions for the denominator population. An admission is considered a readmission when the admit date is within 30 days of the discharge date of the previous admission. 173 Compliance Statement: Continuity and Coordination of Medical Care HEDIS Data Tables - Column Titles In 2021, NCQA changed how each year's HEDIS results are labeled. Up until 2020, HEDIS results were labeled in the year the data was collected. In 2021 and continuing into 2022, the labeling indicates the year being measured. At the time this report was written in April 2023, 2022 HEDIS Measurement Year(MY) data was not yet available. 2022 MY data will be reflected in the report written in April 2024.Production Date: April 2023 174 Continuity and Coordination of Medical Ca re Introduction Improving coordination of care is one of HealthPartners' core strategies for delivering on our mission and the Triple Aim of improved health, experience, and affordability. Overall, continuity and coordination of care improvement initiatives promote efficient, effective, and safe care for members when they are transitioning between levels of care or receiving care from multiple providers. More specifically, continuity and coordination of medical care is the facilitation, across transitions and settings of care of: Patients getting the care or services they need, and Practitioners or providers getting the information they need to provide patient care. HealthPartners monitors and takes action, as necessary, to improve continuity and coordination of care across the health care network. During 2022, HealthPartners continued to monitor the following aspects of continuity and coordination of medical care: Monitor 1 All cause readmission rates Movement across settings Monitor 2 Low-intens ity emergency room utilization Movement across settings Monitor 3 Provider satisfaction the timeliness and completeness of patient care information they receive from other types of providers Movement between practitioners Monitor 4 Postpartum visit rate Movement across settings This report describes the relevance of the measure, monitoring methodology, results, analysis, and actions for each monitor. Monitors are applicable to both the Commercial and Marketplace product lines. Monitor 1: Readmissio n ratios (QI 3 A Factor 2) Methodology HealthPartners used the HEDIS inpatient readmission measure as our core metric. This measure is relevant to the HealthPartners population because inpatient readmissions are an indicator of potential gaps in care that surface after discharge. Reduction of hospital readmission rates continues to be a priority for care systems, health plans and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. According to quantitative studies, quality and patient safety are compromised dur ing the vulnerable period when patients transition between different settings because of high rates of medication errors, incomplete or inaccurate information transfer, and lack of appropriate follow -up care. (JAMA Intern Med 2016 May 1). Readmissions may result when patients do not receive needed follow -up care, don't understand self-care after discharge or because primary care providers do not have all the information they need to develop an effective treatment plan to manage the patient's condition. The commercial readmission goal was set based on improving HealthPartners performance to Band 3. Results Production Date: April 2023 175 of this measure over multiple years are noted below in the Results section. Numerator and denominator are not included in the chart as this measure is calc ulated as a ratio instead of as a rate. We use the ratio measure, as it evaluates our performance considering the risk of the measured population. Results have been audited by an NCQA -accredited certification vendor.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, NCQA advises caution when using MY 2021 data. Performance goal HealthPartners historical goal was to achieve band 3 performance and we met goal in 2018 and 2019. Due to the pandemic, benchmark performance was not publicly reported for the 2020 report period. However, 2020 performance as measured by the 2019 HEDIS methodology trended downward, and we would have met goal in 2020 if the benchmarks had remained constant. For 2021 we moved our goal to Band 2 because our performance at Band 3 was stable and we believed we could make further improvements. NCQA published benchmarks for HEDIS MY 2020 and we performed at Band 3 and did not meet our Band 2 goal. Our ratio for MY 2021 increased, but not statistically significantly. HealthPartners MY 2021 performance places us in Band 4. For 2022 we've chosen Band 2 as our goal. We recognize Band 2 is a stretch goal, but it is whe re we want to perform long- term.

There were major changes in the measure specifications for 2020, however, we calculated the rate using both the old and new m ethodology to allow for trending and significance testing. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, NCQA advises caution when using MY 2021 data. Performance goal HealthPartners' historical goal is to attain commercial HEDIS measure band 3 for both the commercial and the marketplace products. Due to the pandemic, NCQA did not publicly report benchmark performance. 2020 performance as measured by the 2019 HEDIS methodology trended downward, and we would have met goal in 2020 if the benchmarks had remained constant. NCQA published benchmarks for HEDIS MY 2020 and we met goal, performing at Band 1. This measure is very volatile due to low membership in the population with just under 4500 members in 2021. Measurement year 2021 performance put us solidly in band 4. F or 2022 we've chosen Band 2 as our goal. Since this product has low membership, we feel it's important to keep the goal similar to our Commercial Product lines. Quantitative Analysis (QI 3 A Factor 3) HealthPartners uses HEDIS readmission rates to asses s potential gaps in coordination of care. As a result of varied strategies deployed to reduce inappropriate readmissions, overall commercial results improved between 2016 and 2019 and we achieved our goal of Band 3 performance in both 2018 and 2019 and would have met goal in 2020 if benchmarks had remained constant. However, MY 2021 band performance places us solidly in Band 4, and HealthPartners appears to be declining on this measure. We have chosen to continue our focus on this measure, with the goal of achieving Band 3 for HEDIS MY 2022. We did not achieve Band 3 performance in 2021 as we did pre -pandemic and see the opportunity to improve our performance. This measure will continue to be monitored in subsequent years. For 2022, we've chosen Band 2 as our goal. We recognize this is a stretch goal, but it's where we'd like to see long- term performance and we continue to see opportunities to improve our performance as we did not achieve Band 3 performance in 2022. Qualitative Analysis (QI 3 A Factor 3) As noted above, quantitative analysis shows that our HEDIS MY 2021 results did not meet goal of Band 3 performance. Reporting conducted by our Comprehensive Care Advocacy (CCA) Production Date: April 2023 177 area helped identify member populations that had the highest readmission levels. These populations include members who participate in the following programs: Complex case management - top opportunity to reduce readmissions Cancer disease management Healthy Pregnancy Transplant patients were also at higher risk of readmission. A subset of these patients also participate in complex case management. Our Comprehensive Care Advocacy (CCA) senior leaders also note discharge planning is critical to optimize patient recovery. HealthPartners Complex Care Advocacy Case Managers support member transitions between facility and home during facility transfers. There are challenges related to the reduction of avoidable hospital readmissions. Examples provided by our CCA leaders include medication adherence and lack of follow through with discharge instructions by patients, patients discharging from inpatient stay against medical advice, health literacy, family/caregiver support, and social determinants of health such as transportation, cultural barriers, access to proper nutrition and communi ty resources. Additionally, discharge registries are not always consistently worked by care delivery due to clinic staffing and competing priorities. Lack of connectivity with other EMRs for both specialists and primary care providers continues to be an issue as it pertains to coordination of care which was noted during our 2022 provider survey. Optimizing EMR's and predictive analytics through home grants will help providers fortify members are receiving appropriate discharge planning during facility t ransfers. Production Date: April 2023 178 Barrier Opportunity Selected for Improvement? Data analysis identifies complex patients as one of the populations at greatest risk for readmission. This population struggles with a variety of different challenges in managing their health. There is significant opportunity with this population and remains a top barrier for our Complex Care Advocacy team. We can improve care coordination between settings by developing and implementing additional care coordination supports that are targeted towar d this high- risk population especially when transitioning between a facility and home. Yes - this remains a top barrier per discussion with the Director of Comprehensive Care Advocacy. HealthPartners 2022 Provider survey identified barriers to coordination of care and lack of connectivity with other EMRs as the top barrier sited by 47% of primary care providers and 25% of specialists (see full report starting on page 19) Improve coordination of care between settings and practitioners by integrating health plan care management resources with the provider care teams. Health plan has a comprehensive picture of all care received (via claims) Yes - this continues to be a top barrier. Production Date: April 2023 179 Actions (QI 3A factor 4) Date Initiated Action Implement ed Barriers Addressed 2015 and ongoing HealthPartners awards annual Health Care Home (HCE) grants select primary care and multispecialty groups to support building capacity for addressing SDOH, improving health equity, providing member - centered support, and improving continuity and coordination of care to improve the health of our members, manage affordability and improve the member experience. For calendar year 2021, HealthPartners granted over $1.5 million to 30+ medical groups. HCH grants support providers in developing and implementing an HCH model that improves member care, increases member satisfaction and delivers DHS -certified HCH care management support services to members. Grants help remove financial barriers to implementing systems, infrastructure and processes that improve continuity and coordination of care which streamline communications and standardize protocols and handoffs between providers to ensure that patients received needed care. Grants directly address provi der concerns regarding lack of connectivity with other EMRs by providing dollars that can be used for EMR enhancements. 2020 Expanded community paramedic program to support patients post - discharge at three key network hospitals. The original diagnoses eligible for referral to the program included CHF, COPD, AMI, pneumonia, and stroke. In 2020, we expanded the program to include patients discharged post -covid hospitalization. During 2020, The Community Paramedic team cared for more than 150 patients with C OVID -19 using an adapted care plan. Support high -risk patients as they transition between a hospital setting to home- based care. Production Date: April 2023 180 Date Initiated Action Implement ed Barriers Addressed 2021 -2022 The complex care pilot kicked off in 2021 and in 2022 the Transitional Care Management (TCM) billing code was implem ented. The TCM billing code reimburses providers for treating patients with complex medical conditions during the 30- day post -discharge period but also enables us to identify and closely follow the members who need additional services. This enhances coordination between HealthPartners care coordinators and network clinic and clinicians for high- risk members. This activity addresses two key issues identified in the barrier analysis. 1. The intervention provides tighter coordination of care between the health plan and the provider by optimizing patient after visit summaries to ensure valuable information is given to members who are at highest risk for readmission during discharge planning. We believe the implementation in the billing code helps address the barrier our CCA team identified when members transition between facility and home during facility transfers and will improve continuity and coordination of care. 2. Provides an opportunity to optimize EMR's and predictive analytics to help identify when a patient is on our health plan or a part of one our risk contracts and could benefit from care coordination. Looking at prior interventions, which include community paramedics and health c are home grants, both are still active and effective in addressing some aspects of the problem. The community paramedic intervention successfully prevents some readmissions, but the population that qualifies for the intervention is fairly small when compar ed to the overall HealthPartners population. This intervention is designed to support select, high- risk members with specific medical conditions. The 2022 Transitional Care Management (TCM) billing code system is an intervention which also targets high- risk members and helps enhance coordination between HealthPartners and network clinics and clinicians which ensures members are receiving enhanced coordination during facility transfers to their home. The Health Care Home grants are a long- standing intervent ion that providers find very helpful in making systemic investments to support continuity and coordination of care. Based on the provider survey results which will be detailed in Monitor 3, we believe the grants are impactful enabling providers to implement improved systems of care. Providers cited the barrier of \"Lack of connectivity to other EMRS\" 52% of the time in 2018 and continues to remain low at 38% in 2022. Production Date: April 2023 181 Monitor 2: Low Intensity Emergency room utilization (QI 3 A Factor 2) Methodology The goal of this intervention is to reduce unnecessary or low intensity emergency department visits because they may cause fragmented care and gaps in continuity and coordination of care. In many cases, patients would be better served by receiving care from their primary care clinic which would have their complete medical history and be able to offer needed routine and preventive care services at the same time as taking care of an acute condition. This measure is relevant to our population because emergency room vis its rank fourth among the top 10 service categories for 2022 which is consistent with its 2021 spot. This data reflects the combined utilization of both our commercial and marketplace members. Production Date: April 2023 182 Additionally, unnecessary and preventable ED visits mak e up more than 31 percent of all emergency department utilization. This represents a significant opportunity to redirect care to the appropriate place of service so that the member's complete health care needs can be assessed and provided. We believe this measure may be especially relevant for our marketplace population because the State of Minnesota has written language requiring plans meet emergency department utilization targets for our medical assistance and MinnesotaCare enrollees. Addressing this issue in the Marketplace population supports meeting our targets because Marketplace members may drop off commercial insurance and enroll in medical assistance if their income declines. This performance target has been mandated since January 1, 2012 (Minnesota Statute 256B.69) and has no end date. HealthPartners obtained the New York University (NYU) algorithm that identifies potentially avoidable emergency room visits. As cited in an article by Rutgers University \"According to the NYU algorithm, almost one hal f (47%) of all ED visits without admission are potentially avoidable with improved access to primary care (i.e., these visits are classified as non- Production Date: April 2023 183 emergent, emergent but primary care treatable, or emergent/ED care needed/preventable avoidable). ED patient s most likely to have their visits (without admission) classified as potentially avoidable include children ages 4 and under and traditionally underserved populations - i.e., charity care, self -pay, Medicaid, non- Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics. Nevertheles s, these patient groups do not account for the majority of potentially avoidable ED visits. Because they account for a larger share of hospital utilization overall, patients who are adults, privately insured, and non- Hispanic white account for the largest shares of potentially avoidable ED visits without admission.\" This definition of an avoidable ED visit is broader than other definitions that may only account for services that could easily be treated in a primary care setting such as sore throats and ear infections. It encompasses urgent ED care that was needed yet could have been prevented through appropriate treatment in another setting. It also includes patients with complex, chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes and COPD where timely care in other settings may have prevented an ED visit. We calculated the rate of non- emergent emergency room visits for our Commercial and Marketplace members. Commercial Results 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Indicator title Non-emergent Visits & Results HealthPartners used the Chi -square test to determine if rates change significantly from year to year. The 2016/2017 as well as the 2020 and 2021 changes were statistically significant, other changes are not. Our goal is to not exceed a rate of 25%. The rate change from 2021 to 2022 was statistically significant but stil l remains under the goal of not exceeding 25%.

This measure is very volatile due to low membership with just over 3,000 members in 2020. Our goal is to not exceed a rate of 25%. We met goal in 2021. The change in rates between 2021 and 2022 were not statistically significant. Rate remains under the goal of not exceeding 25%. HealthPartners discontinued monitoring the rate of emergency room utilization using the standard HEDIS measure b ecause NCQA retired the measure in 2020. However, we have included historical performance below as we transition from the HEDIS measure to the non- emergent ED measure. Commercial Results (historical) 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Indicator title Emergency Department Visits - commercial & Results HealthPartners used the Chi -square test to determine if rates change significantly from year to year.

The population is too small to reliably test and the rate is quite volatile. Performance goal 140.20 or less (goal met in 2019) Production Date: April 2023 185 Quantitative Analysis (QI 3 A Factor 3) HealthPartners uses non- emergent Emergency Department Visit rates to assess for potential gaps and opportunities to improve continuity and coordination of care. From 2017 through 2021, commercial non- emergent emergency room visits trended downward; although the year over year changes were not statistically significant until 2020. Historical emergency room HEDIS rates for the commercial population have not shown consistent performance over time. The rate change from 2 021 to 2022 for the commercial population was statistically significant, but we still met our goal. There is variability in our commercial performance and significant volatility in our Marketplace results. We met goal for the Marketplace population, but t he rate change from 2021 to 2022 was not statistically significant. Preliminary 2023 data from January and February suggest the rate of non- emergent Emergency Department Visits is remaining stable with our current percentage, although it is too early to understand if this trend will continue into the rest of 2023. Quantitative Analysis (QI 3 A Factor 3) While our quantitative analysis shows we are meeting our goal of less than 25% non- emergent visits to the emergency room, over 30% of all emergency room uti lization is unnecessary and increased from the previous year. Our Complex Care Advocacy (CCA) senior leaders indicated that lack knowledge for the member as well as lack of primary care/urgent care access are primary barriers to appropriate emergency room utilization. To address this trend, our Marketing team created a campaign targeting the populations below to receive education about how to prevent unnecessary emergency room use: Newly enrolled and unattributed adult members Policyholders with at least one child on their contract Members who likely have a telemed- eligible need in the next two months and currently use urgent care. Members likely to have a non- emergent care need in the next two months and currently use the emergency room. Members wit h back or joint pain Members taking multiple medicines who have one or more risk factors. Barrier Opportunity Selected for Improvement? Our CCA senior leaders noted that lack of knowledge for the member on appropriate utilization Provide education to memb ers explaining what alternatives are available to receive care instead of the emergency room. Yes Lack of primary care or urgent care access is another barrier noted by our CCA senior leaders. Help members select a primary care/pediatric care provider and provide education around why it's important. Yes Production Date: April 2023 186 Action (QI 3 A factor 5) Date Initiated Action Implemented Barriers Addressed 2012 and ongoing HealthPartners continues to administer total cost of care (TCOC) payment arrangements with contracted provider groups providing care for more than 85% of our membership. The TCOC payment strategy continues to evolve as we continually seek to better align incentives. Traditional reimbursement models do not reward or incent providers to improve coordination of care and improve the flow of communication between providers. HealthPartners TCOC methodology supports important provider initiatives to streamline communications and enhance continuity and coordination of care. 2020 HealthPartners implemented a COVID - 19 Advanced care process to help clinicians identify their high- risk patients, facilitate a discussion regarding an advanced directive and document the patient's wishes where it can easily be found Improve continuity of care between primary care and hospitals by increasing the number of members who have an advance care plan and moving the ACP to t he front page of the member's EPIC medical record for easy reference. 2021 Comprehensive care advocacy team is conducting intentional, targeted outreach to high- risk commercial and Marketplace members encouraging members to schedule COVID vaccines and offering education surrounding COVID. This includes care navigation to assist the member in finding a provider that is offering vaccinations. Health plan clinical staff routinely monitor complex cases to identify risks, communicates to the member's care team uses integrated EHR functions and connects the member with health plan and care delivery services designed to prevent exacerbations and prevent ED visits. Prevent ED visits associated with COVID infections among the most vulnerable members. Improve connectivity and flow of key information between the member, the plan and the member's care team to ensure optimal plan of care. 2022 HealthPartners Marketing team deployed a communications campaign to educate members about the available The appropriate site of care campaign addresses the appropriate utilization barrier as it sent out educational materials to the targeted members on what Production Date: April 2023 187 Date Initiated Action Implemented Barriers Addressed alternatives to the e mergency room when care is needed. \"Appropriate Site of Care\" campaign matched new members who haven't used telemedicine and are predicted to have a have a care need in the next two months and who currently use urgent care, members likely to have a non- emergent care need in the next two months and currently use the emergency room, and members with back or joint pain with Telemedicine options and compare and cost options between the different sites of care. Educational materials were promoted via email, web, website push notifications and provided as Member Services talking points. alternative care opti ons are available and the cost comparisons between them. By educating members about additional care options for their conditions it will improve coordination of care by reducing unnecessary emergency room utilization and ensuring members get care at the appropriate site of care. 2022 A second campaign also coordinated by the HealthPartners Marketing team, with support from our CCA team educated members on the available alternatives to the emergency room when care is needed. \"Visit The Doctor\" campaign matched the following newly enroll ed unattributed adult members and policyholders with at least on child on their contract to assist them in getting matched with a doctor for primary care/pediatric needs. Educational materials were sent out via email and web flyers. This campaign address es the lack of knowledge barrier by reaching out to unattributed members who don't currently have a primary clinic by assisting them in matching with a primary care/pediatric care provider. Linking members to a primary care provider improves continuity and coordination of care by enabling members to get the care they need in the setting that helps them manage their care. The 2020 and 2021 previous interventions were primarily related to the COVID -19 Pandemic. As the cases for COVID -19 are no longer spik ing the concerns are no longer relevant to our current barriers, the data shows there is still a need for primary care access and education to prevent unnecessary emergency room utilization. HealthPartners feels our marketing campaigns to educate members on the importance of selecting a primary care provider and Production Date: April 2023 188 appropriate site of care will improve continuity and coordination and reduce unnecessary emergency room utilization. Monitor 3: Provider satisfaction with the quality of information they receive f rom other types of providers. (QI 3 A Factor 1) Methodology To support our goal of improving continuity and coordination of care, HealthPartners tracks provider satisfaction with the completeness and timeliness of information they receive regarding their patients from other practitioners. This information is relevant to our commercial and marketplace products because the direct provider feedback enables us to identify gaps and opportunities across all product types and between different types of facilities and practitioners so that we can implement targeted actions that improve providers getting timely and complete information to care for their patients. Although performance is improving, we have never met goal across all the survey measures which indicates the measure continues to be relevant to our plan and demonstrates an ongoing opportunity to improve the availability of timely and accurate information so that providers can provide optimal patient care. The 2022 Provider Survey was mailed in May 2022 to a total of 1,086 providers and their office managers. To ensure all providers in the survey interacted with HealthPartners members we selected the survey pool from those providers who had requested two or more authorizations from the health plan during the last 15- month period. Previous surveys showed a declining response rate. To address this issue, we increased the number of providers who were mailed the survey. We survey all psychiatrists who have submitted a PA in the past 15 months. Between 2019 and 2022, fewer psychiatrists met this criteria. Surveys were received through August 12th. HealthPartners received a total of 72 completed surveys; 53 sur veys were returned unanswered due to bad addresses. The adjusted response rate was 7%; similar to 2021 but noticeably lower than 2019's 11% response. The 2022 aggregate results have a margin of error of +9 percentage points with a 90 percent confidence int erval. 2018 sample size 2019 sample size 2021 sample size 2022 sample size Primary care 300 500 492 500 Specialty care 300 500 500 500 Psychiatrists 140 125 114 86 Production Date: April 2023 189 There is overlap in the providers who participate in our commercial network and our Exchange network. As such, we did not field separate surveys for each population. 2022 WI Atlas Network Providers Type of provider Total sample WI Atlas providers % of sample Primary care providers 500 397 79.4% Specialty care providers 500 390 78.0% Psychiatry 86 75 87.2% We have not attempted to segment the results by product due to the relatively low response rate and the high degree of overlap between our commercial and Exchange networks. Results The results of the survey are reported bel ow. We did not report satisfaction levels of psychiatrists separately due to the small number respondents. There were only 3 respondents in 2022, too few to reliably conduct tests of statistical significance and to report some questions. Production Date: April 2023 190 Analysis (QI 3 A Factor 3) HealthPartners met goal on all but seven measures, timely communication from Emergency Rooms (ER), timely communication from behavioral health providers, timely communication from MTM pharmacist, timely and complete information f rom skilled nursing facilities and timely and complete information from urgent care centers. HealthPartners has initiatives that address continuity and coordination of care with behavioral health providers and these interventions are detailed in a separate report (QI 4 Continuity and Coordination between Medical and Behavioral Healthcare). The results do not suggest opportunities to improve timely or complete communication between specific types of medical practitioners. However, as in past years, practitioners continue to note that \"Lack of connectivity with other EMRs\" is the biggest barrier to continuity and coordination of care. The second most frequently cited barrier is \"Lack of designated staff to coordinate care\". Additionally, we received reports f rom multiple care delivery systems that low staffing remains an issue to providing continuity and coordination. Since the survey measures related to movement between practitioners met goal, we analyzed member complaints to our Member Services department to identify those related to continuity of care issues to see if this data revealed different patterns. This global analysis was inclusive of all HealthPartners products and membership including commercial and marketplace. In 2021 and 2022 the level of complaints regarding continuity and coordination of care indicated similar levels. The report findings were reviewed at the Quality Review Committee which monitors member complaints against network providers and the committee found the coordination of care trend unremarkable. Previous Primary Care Clinic Nursing Supervisor at Stillwater Medical Group (part of HealthPartners' care group), Courtney McElfresh, indicated a shortage of staffing in care delivery systems for nurses and medical assistants is a big c oncern for continuity and coordination of care. Clinics and Hospitals are having a hard time finding staffing to fill their open positions. This affects their ability to provide appropriate continuity of care between care settings. Specifically, when a practitioner doesn't have enough nurses or medical assistants to assist with pre- visit planning. This directly effects continuity of care for the patient because they are unable to obtain medical records from an outside facility, reach out to the patient for unknown visits to other practitioners, or complete specialty referrals in a timely manner. Production Date: April 2023 191 Courtney also noted an additional barrier to coordination of care for urgent care facilities is also due to staffing. If members are unable to get in to see their primary care practitioner, they will be more willing to seek out an urgent care facility. An urgent care will likely only focus on the member's current issue and not the patient as a whole. This creates delays in the member's coordination of care, es pecially if the urgent care is not in the same care system as the member's primary. Based on the barrier analysis previously described, HealthPartners identified the following: Barrier Opportunity Selected for Improvement? Reporting from multiple care groups indicates that lack of available staff is a barrier to providing appropriate continuity and coordination of care. There is an overwhelming need for additional staffing in all areas of healthcare, but especially effects coordination of care when staffing for nurses and medical assistants is low. No Lack of designated staff to coordinate care and lack of standard processes (e.g. defined roles, methods, etc.) to ensure smooth transitions. ACO models of care improve continuity and coordination of care. Under an ACO model, the care system implements standardized processes and programs to support their patients. Yes Poor coordinati on between primary care, including providers that are not affiliated with the same ACO. Focus on collaboration and improving coordination of care between primary care providers inside and outside the ACO with emphasis on SNF or urgent care facilities since these providers had the lowest scores in the continuity and coordination of care survey. Yes Lack of connectivity to other EMRs This is the top barrier that provider cite to strong continuity and coordination of care. Yes Production Date: April 2023 192 Action (QI 3 A factor 6) Date Initiated Action Implemented Barriers Addressed 2020 HealthPartners developed an online Patient Management Application to support clinicians in managing high risk patients. The tool identifies high risk patients that could benefit from HealthPartner s's disease & Case management programs; pre- visit, planning and visit summary support. The tool also creates transparency by identifying the clinics and physicians that are treating the patients identified in the tool so that the clinic has visibility int o the patient's overall care plan, can conduct proactive patient outreach and enhance patient care. Some patients seek care between practitioners and across various health care settings. The Patient Management Application improves continuity and coordination of care in two ways: 1. By giving clinicians information about where their patient is seeking care, clinicians can develop strategies to better manage patient care. 2. The tool includes a function to refer the patient into HealthPartners Disease and Case Management programs. These programs support the clinician's plan of care by coordinating member care across settings including skilled nursing facilities. In 2020, gaps in care registries were built into the PMA tool. This will assist clinicians in providing the care their patients need by moving the registry tool from its current secure site on HealthPartners.com to the tool. This will consolidate necessary information to successfully manage patient care into one tool with one sign on. 2015 and ongoing In 2022, HealthPartners recognized 60 organizations that have been certified by the Minnesota Department of Health as a Health Care Home (300 clinics in total) with financial grants to support health care homes. Grant dollars may be used for: Care Coordinator salaries Data Systems including EMR enhancements Redesign and deploy care processes that are aligned with their patient populations Grants help remove financial barriers to implementing systems, infrastructure and processes that improve continuity and coordination of care which streamline communications and standardize protocols and handoffs between providers to ensure that patients received needed care. Grants directly address provider concerns regarding lack of connectivity with other EMRs by Production Date: April 2023 193 Date Initiated Action Implemented Barriers Addressed across the care delivery system providing dollars that can be used for EMR enhancements. Additionally, HealthPartners participates actively in the Minnesota Electronic Health Records Consortium, which is a collaborative effort among Minnesota health systems and other organizations to leverage clinical data to assist in care coordination which helps practitioners in getting the information they need to provide patient care and addresses the barrier for lack of connectivity to EMRs and will improve coor dination of care between settings. 2022 In 2022, the HealthPartners Institute partnered with the Minnesota Department of Health and Minnesota Community measurement to initiate a research project that compares the effectiveness of different models of care coordination. Current evidence about care coordination in primary care suggests it can be effective in improving the quality of care. The first phase of the study is to gather data from 23,000 care coordination patients receiving care coordination in 322 clinics across 42 health care system in Minnesota. In 2023 they will be analyzing the data and providing recommendations on how the findings can be practically implemented. The research will assist HealthPartners in determining which models of care coordination are most effective. This directly speaks to the poor coordination between primary care barrier as many different providers were included in this study. Additionally, the analyzed data that comes out of the study will be helpful in providing practical ideas on how to improve coordination of care for our members. We believe our previous intervention, developing the online Patient Management Application (PMA) tool to support clinicians in managing his risk patients has continued to help impr ove continuity and coordination of care. We also will continue to provide grants to help remove Production Date: April 2023 194 financial barriers and assist providers with funding for EMR enhancements and connecting with the Minnesota Electronic Health Records Consortium. Monitor 4: Ti meliness of Postpartum Care Methodology Timely postpartum care is critical to supporting the health of both women and their infants. According to the American College of Gynecology, all women should have a comprehensive postpartum visit no later than 12 weeks after birth. The comprehensive postpartum visit should include a full assessment of physical, social, and psychological well -being, including the following domains: mood and emotional well -being; infant care and feeding; sexuality, contraception, and birth spacing; sleep and fatigue; physical recovery from birth; chronic disease management; and health maintenance. The comprehensive nature of this assessment supports continuity and coordination of care by ensuring that any issues concerning the women's health are identified and appropriate follow -up care is coordinated. Nationally, there have been gaps identified based on race/ethnicity and the delivery of comprehensive, high quality, patient -centered pre- and postpartum pregnancy care. The US has some of the highest maternal and infant mortality rates among comparable developed countries.\u00b9 Racial disparities exist. Black infants in America are now more than twice as likely to die as white infants. 9 Black women are three to four times as likely to die from pregnancy -related causes as their white counterparts regardless of education and income.10 HealthPartners collected data for the patients who receive care in our care delivery system and identified statistically significant disparities in post -partum visit rates within our commercial population between white women and black women born in the US and black women born outside the US. HealthPartners Board of Directors reviewed the analysis, agreed that it was relevant to the HealthPartners population and provided feedback in setting improvement goals. The Board set the goal of eliminating the disparity. The HEDIS/CMS Stars Steering Committee also reviews health plan performance and has set an overall goal for HEDIS performance to achieve top decile results (Band 1). Reducing the disparity in post -partum visit rates will improve continuity and coordination of care because the visit supports transition of the woman's care from obstetrics/gynecology or midwifery to primary care by identifying health concerns like post - partum depression that are commonly treated in a primary care setting or behavioral health. 9 Infant Mortality | Maternal and Infant Health | Reproductive Health | CDC 10Infant Mortality | Maternal and Infant Health | Reproductive Health | CDC Production Date: April 2023 195 Commercial Results 2018 (hybrid rate; 2017 DOS) 2019 (hybrid rate; 2018 DOS) 2019 (admin rate; 2018 DOS) 2020 Old Methodology (admin rate; 2019 DOS) 2020 New Methodology (hybrid rate; 2019 DOS) HEDIS MY 2020 (2020 DOS) HEDIS MY 2021 (2021 DOS) Indicator title HEDIS Postpartum Care Numerator 352 180 4,097 3,523 411 381 116 Denominator 411 219 7,574 92.7% 86.60% Statistical Significance Test & Results There were major changes in the measure specifications for HEDIS 2020.

Our goal for 2022 is to stay at Band 1 Production Date: April 2023 196 Quantitative Analysis Since 2017, HealthPartners commercial postpartum care rates have fluctuated significantly, although part of this is due to changes in the specification. We have consistently performed at Band 2 until 2019 when we dropped to Band 3. M Y 2020 was the first year we met goal for the commercial population, and we did not meet goal for the Marketplace population. This year we achieved Band 3 for the Commercial population. Wisconsin Exchange achieved in Band 1 although the denominator was very small. We also stratify this HEDIS measure to identify subpopulations where performance lags. Based on this analysis and the relevancy to our commercial and marketplace populations, the Board has chosen to make pre- and post -partum visits a key measur e for our organization- wide Partners for Better Health 2025 initiative. The most recent Partners for Better Health Postpartum Care rates continue to show a disparity between our white population and patients of color.

This data indicates we continue to have an opportunity to improve our performance on this measure. Multiple areas across the HealthPartners organization have the opportunity to impact performance on this measure. This includes our Complex Care Advocacy (CCA) which offers a pregnancy condition management program and our Health Equity Sponsor Group which provides strategic oversight to our work to improve disparities in maternal child health. These areas analyze performance and identify opportunities to improve. Our CCA area noted that women who participate in our Healthy Pregnancy condition management program and the digital myPregnancy program, have higher post - partum visit rates than women who do not participate. They identi fied an opportunity to support a larger population of women. Work to implement a digital condition management program began in 2019 and was fully implemented in 2021. The Board of Directors also supported work to implement best practice bundles of care that promote evidence -based care to all our members and patients regardless of color or income status. Additionally, leaders in CCA noted some of the biggest challenges for new moms is knowledge and access about post -partum care, mothers tend to focus primar ily on their baby and neglect their own care, they have limited time and resources to access said care, the appointment times available might not work with their schedule. Production Date: April 2023 197 Barrier Opportunity Selected for Improvement in 2022? Our Complex Care Advocacy (CCA) team identified knowledge and access to be the primary barrier for not receiving care. Specifically, members tend to focus on the baby and deprioritize their own care. Access to their care is also challenging as they may be unable to go to the available appointment times due to limited time and resources, or additional children. The opportunity to provide education and care coordination for post -partum mothers is still significant. Yes There remains a large disparity gap between white women and women of color for post -partum visits. Women who engage in our myPregnancy condition management program have higher post-partum visit rates. Data shows we have an opportunity to improve program participation rate among members of color. Connect ing with women of color and encouraging post -partum visits in a culturally sensitive way. Yes Actions The HealthPartners Board of Directors has approved multiple interventions designed to improve pre-and post -partum visit rates and reduce the disparity between white patients and patients of color. Per the ACOG guideline, the post -partum visit facilitates continuity and coordination of care because the visit enables early diagnosis of health concerns and referral to appropriate ongoing care in a primary or specialty care setting. Production Date: April 2023 198 Date Initiated Action Implemented Barriers Addressed 2019 Implementing standard work protocols and safety bundles. Simplify scheduling for prenatal and postnatal visits. We added an option for online scheduling. Interventions began in 2018 and continued into 2019. Standardized care and safety protocols reduce disparities by ensuring that all patients are treated using best practice, evidence- based guidelines. Simplifying scheduling by adding an online option helps reduce barriers to scheduling postpartum care. 2020 Pilot program designed to support women with low/moderate risk during their pregnancy and in the post - partum period. Promote post -partum visits through an updated, digital pregnancy condition management platform designed to address the factors that have the largest impact on outcomes including post - partum care. High-risk members are eligible for an interactive program with a nurse who will assist with appointment scheduling. Nurses use culturally -relevant resources and referral to community resources to support women of color. Timely postpartum care is also reinforced in the myPregnancy emails and communications. 2021 Incorporate culturally relevant resources and education designed to reduce the disparity in post -partum visit rates between patients of color and the white population. During 2022 we will enhance the program to offer culturally relevant resources to people of color. Content will be surfaced based on the member's race, language, and ethnicity. Production Date: April 2023 199 Date Initiated Action Implemented Barriers Addressed 2022 Health Pregnancy program is a condition management support program that was enhanced in 2022. All CCA nurses completed call quality training to help engage further with enrolled members and assist with making post -partum appointments that work with the members availability or ensuring they connected with the clinic and made an appointment. This directly addresses the barrier and improves continuity and coordination of care as it helps to ensure members are connected directly with the clinic and have access to make an appointment for their post -partum visit. By also engaging with members, nurses can provide knowledge and resources around post -partum care. 2022 To better support our diverse membership, we tailored the algorithms used to identify members for our Health Pregnancy program. Members also receive support from the same nurse throughout their pregnancy and post -partum period. In addition, we provided outreach to high risk Indigenous pregnant women. The outreach happened pre-natal, but once members were connected and engaged in the program it included post -partum support. Our My Pregnancy digital experience delivers online education and support via our authenticated website. It supplements the Health Pregnancy program but is also available to all members regardless of their participation in the more intensive Healthy Pregnancy Program. Resources are personalized based on member's race and ethnicity, preference identified in the assessment and their location in Minnesota. Examples include information about nutrition, breastfeeding, newborn care, mental Both actions implemented directly address the barrier that persons of color have a hi gher participation rate when they engage in our programs: By enhancing our identification algorithm in 2022, it increases the likelihood of identifying the highest risk women, better address health equity and support members continuity of care by the same nurse supporting them throughout their pregnancy to help improve coordination of care with their practitioner. Production Date: April 2023 200 Date Initiated Action Implemented Barriers Addressed health and well -being, and pregnancy complications like preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. 2022 HealthPartners filmed a video in 2022 highlighting the support Doulas provide such as one- on-one physical, emotional and informational supp ort before, during, and after the baby is born. In 2023, we are planning to launch a communications campaign promoting Doulas with a blog page and social media advertising. This action addresses three of our barriers: 1. Members focusing primarily on their baby because a Doula provides whole family support for the entire process from pregnancy through post -partum. 2. Access to care because Doulas provide post -partum support for both the baby and mom and typically visit in -home and will encourage members to get their post-partum clinic visit and provide education on the importance of a timely post - partum visit which also improves continuity and coordination of care. As a follow up to last year's intervention to offer culturally relevant resources to people of color for the myPregnancy program. The data collected shows the program successfully engages members from diverse backgrounds. Overall, members spend an average of 31.27 minutes per visit to the site; specifically, 42.75 minutes spent by Indigenous and 34.49 minutes for Black members. We believe our efforts to provide culturally relevant materials is driving this engagement and will hopefully drive higher post -partum rates. HealthPartners met goal for Marketplace but not for Commercial. While we slightly reduced the disparity gap the difference is not statistically significant and we did not fully eliminate the disparity gap. Providing targeted outreach to the indigenous populations and having culturally appropriate digital resources for all has helped bring awareness to our different populations about the importance of post -partum care and worked towards our goal. Another way we have worked to eliminate the disparity gap is through our Doula video. Doulas provide one- on-one physical, emotional and informational support before, during, and after the baby is born. Studies have shown that women of color in the United States, particularly, Black women, have higher risk of pregnancy complications than White women. Women of color are also less likely to receive all of the care they need from their care team and working with a Doula during and after pregnancy can help offset these factors as Doula's will provide education Production Date: April 2023 201 on the importance of timely post -partum clinic visits and encourage members to make their appointment. We will enhance this campaign further in 2023. HealthPartners implemented and received NCQA Health Equity Accreditation in March of 2023. We are using the post-partum HEDIS measure as a way to continue assess the quality of our programs and has increased focus on this monitor and our goal to completely eliminate the gap between white and persons of color post -partum visit rate.

Data Collection 1. Exchange of Information HealthPartners surveys primary care and specialty providers, including psychiatrists, through the QI/UM Provider Survey to understand their experience with continuity and coordination of care, particularly the timeliness and completeness of patient communication between providers. The 2021 QI/UM Provider Survey was mailed to 1106 providers and their office managers who requested authorizations in the last 15- months. The majority of the 492 primary care physicians, 500 specialists and 114 psychiatrists surveyed had two or more authorizations. HealthPartners received a total of 77 completed surveys; 25 surveys were returned unanswered due to bad addresses. The adjusted response rate was 7%; noticeably lower than 2019's 11% response rate. The 2021 aggregate results have a margin of error of +/ - 9 percentage points with a 90 percent confidence interval. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the survey was not conducted in 2020. The survey's care coordination section was modified in 2018 to measure both timeliness and completeness of patient communication. While the nature of the content for both topics is like past surveys, trending for the care coordination measures prior to 2018 is not recommended due to different response sets. Measure Goal 2018 2019 2021 Timely Communication of Patient Care From: Behavioral health providers (% Excellent+ Average) 80% 77% 96% 97% Complete Communication of Patient providers (% Excellent+ Average) 80% 85% Conclusion: Timely Communication: Goal Met Both behavioral health and primary care providers exceeded the goal satisfaction rate of 80% at 85% and 97% respectively and both satisfaction rates for 2021 increased from previous years. Complete Communication: Goal Met Both behavioral health and primary care providers exceeded the goal satisfaction rate of 80% at 92% and 98% respectively. The 2021 rate for behavioral health providers increased from previous years and the rate for primary care providers increased from 2018 and only decreased slightly from 2019. 2. Diagnoses, Treatment, and Referral of Behavioral Disorders Commonly Seen in Primary Care Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is often treated with medication. While medication for ADHD is often prescribed by behavioral health providers, it is not uncommon for it to be prescribed by a primary care provider. HealthPartners data in 2020 revealed that primary care for ADHD medication m anagement is utilized at higher rates than specialty care (i.e., care provided by a behavioral health provider), which is assumed to be due to the accessibility of primary care as compared to behavioral health care. In efforts to support primary care provi ders' oversight and management of ADHD in patients, HealthPartners educates and encourages patients/caregivers to attend recommended follow -up appointments with providers, as measured by the HEDIS rate Follow -Up Care for Children Prescribed ADHD Medication (ADD). Table : Commercial HEDIS results for ADD Conclusion : Goal not met GOAL 2021 2020 2019 Commercial Initiation Phase 48.7% Continuation Phase 59.3% 43.0% 45% 49.1% Table : Marketplace Follow -up Care for Children Prescribed ADHD Conclusion: Goal met GOAL 2021 2020 2019 48.7% 1/3 Based on HEDIS ADD measure. Denominator too small to be statistically significant to provide a rate. Production Date: August 2022 204 HealthPartners ADD rate for the initiation phase, which measures the percentage of members 6-12 years old newly prescribed ADHD medication who had a foll ow-up care visit within 30 days of when the medication was dispensed, was 37.2%, which was below the goal rate of 48.7%. Additionally, the HealthPartners rate for the continuation phase, which measures the percentage of members who had two additional visits within 270 days/9 months after the initial phase, was 43.0%, which was also below the goal rate of 59.3%. These rates have remained below goal for 3 consecutive years and, therefore, remain an opportunity for improvement. 3. Appropriate Use of Psychotropic Medications Antidepressant medication, while widely prescribed and often effective at treating depression, can take time, up to several weeks, to relieve depressive symptoms. For these reasons, it's important that patients adhere to antidepressant medications as they are prescribed and that physicians follow prescribing guidelines and provide oversight to patients for possible non - adherence and/or side effects, particularly in physically -vulnerable or high risk patients (NCBI, 2011) . To monitor such adherence, H ealthPartners measures Antidepressant Medication Management (HEDIS AMM) for both the Commercial and WI Marketplace populations. Table : HEDIS Antidepressant Medication Management (AMM) Effective Acute Phase Goal 2021 2020 2019 Not Met AMM rates for Commercial members have remained below the goal rate of 85% in recent years but have been steadily improving from 80.4% in 2019 to 81.7% in 2020 to 84.6% in 2021. Despite these rates falling below the goal rate, they are trending positively. WI Marketplace: Goal Met AMM rates for WI Marketplace members exceeded the goal of 85% in 2021 at 88.2%. This is the first rate in the past several years that this rate has met the goal. It should be noted that denominators for Marketplace rates have consistently been 50 or less in 2019 and 2020. In 2021, the denominator was 68. 4. Management of Treatment Access & Follow -Up for Members with Co- Existing Medical and Behavioral D isorders HealthPartners measures treatment access and follow -up for members who have chronic medical conditions and a co- existing diagnosis of depression to determine the effectiveness of treatment across medical and behavioral health care, as well as to inform methods of identification, outreach, and engagement in HealthPartners Case and Disease Management programs to better support members' needs around coordination of care. This is accomplished by identifying through claims data members with chronic conditions of CAD, Diabetes and/or CHF and, of those members, those with depression. These members are then further examined Production Date: August 2022 205 to see how many of them had a visit with a behavioral health provider and how many engaged in case management. Table : 2021 Chronic Medical Conditions with Co -morbid Depression Analysis for Commercial and Marketplace Conclusion: 12 of the 14 goals were met.

Preventative Behavioral Healthcare Program Implementation Suicide prediction models predicting when a person may attempt suicide have, for many years, been elusive. In efforts to address the gap of predicting suicide attempts and completions, HealthPartners participated in a large, multi -site study in 2015 to develop a prediction model using health records and claims data. Influenced by these res earch efforts, HealthPartners health plan and care delivery leaders collaborated throughout 2018 to develop and implement consistent practices around assessing patients' risk of suicide, and in early 2019, the Columbia Suicide severity risk scale was ident ified to be used across the health plan and care delivery settings. Additionally, in August 2019, a suicide prediction model was incorporated into the health plan's Behavioral Health Case Management protocols that identified members at risk for suicide who would be outreached to by case managers and screened for suicide using the Columbia risk scale. Outcomes of these screenings could then be shared with care delivery providers to determine appropriate care and resources to address members' needs and risk. Production Date: August 2022 207 Table : Completed Columbia Suicide screenings Conclusion: Goal met Goal 2021 2020 2019 % of identified members who had Columbia screenings completed 40% 46% 49% 35% Upon implementation in 2019, the goal was set to engage and complete Columbia screenings with 40% of members identified by the prediction model and outreached by case management. Data of Columbia screening completion rates revealed that 35% of members identified as at -risk for suicide by the prediction model completed the screening with Behavioral Health Case Management staff between August -December 2019. That rate improved to 49% throughout 2020 and, although decreased slightly, remained above goal at 46% throughout 2021. Additionally, this data includes both Commercial and Marketplace members. 6. Special Needs of Members with Severe and Persistent Mental Illness Severe and persistent mental illness can be treated throughout a variety of interventions, a prominent one being medication. To ensure medication is effective as possible at t reating the condition or symptoms, it is vital for the individual prescribed the medication to be adherent to it and to follow the recommendations of the prescriber. There are many reasons individuals may not be adherent to their medications, such as side effects, difficulty remembering when and what medication to take, or financial challenges that make affording medication difficult, among others. Nonadherence to medication and related recommendations for any of these reasons can lead to poor health outcomes, increased emergency department visits, hospitalizations, suicide rates, and mortality. For these reasons, HealthPartners monitors members' adherence to medication and related recommendations, as indicated through the following data. Commercial Adherence to medication management recommendations is important for anyone diagnosed with mental illness who is prescribed medication as part of their treatment, including children and adolescents. Because mental illness, even severe mental illness, can start ear ly in a person's life, it is not uncommon for adolescents and young adults to be prescribed antipsychotic medication to help manage their symptoms. Antipsychotic medication, though, can lead to various side effects such as rapid weight gain, induction of diabetes, and increased cholesterol making individuals who take antipsychotics more susceptible to metabolic syndrome. Because of this, HealthPartners works to help children and adolescents prescribed antipsychotics follow -up with healthcare providers to c omplete metabolic monitoring - blood glucose and cholesterol testing, as measured by the HEDIS rate APM. Table : Commercial HEDIS Metabolic Monitoring for Children and Adolescents on Antipsychotics (APM) Goal 2021 2020 2019 % of Members Monitoring 42.2% 35.5% 40.6% Production not met Commercial APM rates have fluctuated throughout the past several years but did show an increase from 35.4% in 2020 to 42.2% in 2021. Rates in recent years have fallen below the goal of 60%, implying opportunities remain to further support members in completing metabolic monitoring. WI Marketplace Enrollment or coverage changes in this population can be common and can create benefit - related confusion, which can impact adherence to treatment recommendations, including medication. When this occurs, medication adherence can be reduced. Table : WI Marketplace Adherence to Prescribed Medication Goal 2021 2020 2019 % of Members who measure. Denominator too small to be statistically significant to provide a rate. Conclusion: Goal met WI Marketplace medication adherence rates for individuals with severe and/or persistent mental illness have been nonexistent throughout recent years as no members have met criteria for such measure. Collaborative Act ivities 1. Collaboration with Behavioral Health Care Practitioners The following workgroups are facilitated by HealthPartners Behavioral Health to provide forums for primary care providers, behavioral health care providers, and health plan personnel to analyz e clinical data, detect trends and barriers, and identify opportunities for improved continuity of care. The HEDIS Behavioral Health Committee involves actively practicing primary care physicians, psychiatrists, and behavioral health therapists, along with the health plan Behavioral Health Disease and Case Management programs and Health Informatics. This group meets regularly throughout the year to review data, conduct barrier analyses, and create work plans. The Member -Focused Behavioral Health Workgroup involves behavioral health professionals from HealthPartners Case Management and Utilization Management, HealthPartners Contracting, HealthPart ners Government Programs, HealthPartners care delivery, and clinical leaders from high -volume contracted behavioral health care systems. This groups meets, at least, quarterly to review quality and performance data and to identify opportunities for improvement around health plan initiatives, policies, procedures, and expectations of providers. Production Date: August 2022 209 2. Quantitative and Causal Analysis of Data to Identify Improvement Opportunities Quantitative analysis of the data in Element E, Factors 1- 6 reveals unmet goals in the areas of diagnosis, treatment, and referral of behavioral disorders commonly seen in primary care; use of psychotropic medication; and special needs of members with severe and persistent mental illness as evidenced by Commercial HEDIS rates that fell below goal for the ADD, AMM, and APM measures. Causal analysis revealed the following potential contributors to these unmet rates and opportunities for improvement: Social Determinants of Health Each of the measures - ADD, AMM, and APM - require patients to attend appointments and/or adhere to medication. While for some patients these tasks may be simple or even routine, they may be challenging for other patients due to factors such as time and cost. To attend appointments, patients may need to find time outs ide of work or school, may need to commute to the clinic or arrange for telehealth access, and may have resulting insurance costs. Similar factors apply to medication - patients may need to plan for trips to the pharmacy and may be faced with copays. Communication of treatment expectations Throughout analysis of the ADD HEDIS measure by the HEDIS Behavioral Health Committee, it was identified that patients/caregivers are not inherently familiar with the standards of care for ADHD regarding the recommended frequency of or timing for follow -up appointments. In addition to this, it was also identified that verbiage used by clinicians regarding wh en patients should plan to attend follow -up appointments may not be clear enough for patients to attend their appointment within the timeframe required by HEDIS. For instance, providers may be using verbiage such as \"follow -up in one month,\" whereas \"withi n 3 weeks\" or \"by {date}\" could give patients/caregivers a clearer indication of when they should plan to attend their next appointment by and could help them complete the appointment within recommended timeframes. Because of this, it is beneficial to clearly educate and remind patients/caregivers about the recommended timeframes for scheduling and attending follow -up appointments to support their adherence to them. Access to Care The HEDIS Behavioral Health Committee and the Member -Focused Behavioral H ealth Workgroup have anecdotally reported that behavioral health care providers have experienced higher utilization of care and lower no- show rates by patients, particularly with the implementation of telehealth, likely due to individuals are experiencing higher stress or exacerbation of mental health symptoms since the onset of COVID. This higher utilization has, in turn, reduced the availability of providers and appointments, challenging patients to attend follow -up appointments within preferred or recomm ended timeframes, potentially impacting not only HEDIS rates but, more importantly, patients' receipt of medication and other necessary care for their condition. This decrease in the availability of care impacts the ADD, AMM, and APM measures. For ADD, the measure Production Date: August 2022 210 requires patients to attend multiple appointments within designated timeframes, some that providers may or may not be able to accommodate depending on their availability. For AMM, patients may need appointments with their prescriber to follow -up on the medication and receive refills that would allow them to meet the measure. And for APM, patients need to complete lab work, care that is required in- person, eliminating the option for telehealth that may be more viable for certain patients. 3. Opportunity #1 for Improvement from Element A One opportunity identified from the barriers impacting the ADD, AMM, and APM HEDIS measures is to help members address issues or impacts that stem from social determinants of health. By lessening barriers patients may face when seeking recommended care, they may be more inclined to complete appointments timely and better adhere to treatment. However, providers likely have increasingly limited capacity to focus on and support members with such needs that stretch beyond t he members' presenting condition or treatment plan. With this, there's benefit in Behavioral Health Case Management being available for providers to refer patients to and for those case managers to collaborate with providers to help address patients' socia l determinant of health needs that may be contributing to and/or impacted by behavioral health conditions or affecting patients' adherence to treatment. For this to be effective, providers need to remain informed of the Behavioral Health Case Management pr ogram, particularly its criteria and referral process to refer patients with HealthPartners insurance and severe mental health needs could benefit from additional support. By reminding providers of the case management support available to members/patients through the health plan and the referral process, it is the hope that more providers will refer eligible members to case management to address, more holistically, the needs of the member. 4. Opportunity #2 for Improvement from Element A Another opportunity identified from the barriers impacting ADD, AMM, and APM was for the health plan to support patients/caregivers in their understanding of treatment recommendations and requirements by providing them with clear information around appointments and medication that indicates specific, individualized information, such as dates they should attend follow -up appointments by or instructions on how to follow -up with their provider/clinic as needed. In addition to providing such information to patients, it's also beneficial for providers to have knowledge of the messaging their patients are receiving so they can reinforce it. To do this, there is opportunity for the health plan to send digital or mailed communications to members to provide them with education on their condition and/or medication, instructions for attending follow -up appointments, and reminders for refilling medication and to include their provider in the communication to share information among everyone involved. 5. Collaborative Action #1 to Address Oppor tunities from Element A To increase providers' knowledge of Behavioral Health Case Management as a resource for patients with mental health conditions who may have corresponding needs around social determinants of health, particularly those members who could potentially meet requirements for ADD, AMM or APM, HealthPartners Behavioral Health Case Management leaders and staff presented on the Behavioral Health Case Management program to various primary care network providers and clinics. Throughout these pres entations, providers were educated on and Production Date: August 2022 211 reminded of the nature of the HealthPartners Behavioral Health Case Management Program, including efforts Behavioral Health Case Managers make to collaborate with and facilitate communication between behavioral health and primary care providers of members engaged in the program, and how providers can refer members for Behavioral Health Case Management. 6. Collaborative Action #2 to Address Opportunities from Element A To support patients in understanding and rememberi ng treatment recommendations and requirements, such as appointments and medication refills, that support HEDIS measures, HealthPartners sends patients with designated mental health conditions who are prescribed certain psychotropic medications appointment and refill reminders. Members who are newly prescribed ADHD medication (who may qualify for ADD), members who are prescribed antidepressant medication (who may qualify for AMM), and children/adolescents who are prescribed antipsychotic medications (who may qualify for APM) are identified for mailed or digital communications reminding them of recommended appointments and refills. Measuring Effectiveness 1. Effectiveness of Improvement Action #1 from Element B Through presentations on HealthPartners Behavioral Health Case Management program to primary care providers, it was desired for providers to have an improved understanding of how the Behavioral Health Case Management program benefits patients who are also members of HealthPartners who have severe mental health conditions and other needs, how Behavioral Health Case Management works in collaboration with providers, and how to refer members into the program. Review of the referrals of members, including Commercial and WI Marketplace members who may have been eligible to meet the ADD, AMM, and APM measures, from providers into Behavioral Health Case Management revealed the following number of referrals over the past three years: Table : Provider referrals to HealthPartners Behavioral Health Case Management 2021 2020 2019 36 23 45 Conclusion: Referrals from providers into Behavioral Health Case Management improved from 2020 to 2021, potentially in response to education and reminders on the Behavioral Health Case Management program presented to providers, however the number of these referrals remains less than 50 per year for Commercial and WI Marketplace members which may have potential to increase with ongoing communication and collaboration with care delivery partners. 2. Effectiveness of Improvement Action #2 from Element B HealthPartners mailed newsletters, appointment reminders, and/or medication refill reminders to Commercial and WI Marketplace members who were newly prescribed ADHD medication (who qualified for ADD), members who were prescribed antidepressant medication (who qualified for AMM), and children/adolescents who were prescribed antipsychotic medications (who qualified Production Date: August 2022 212 for APM). Despite these communications, rates of ADD, AMM, and APM continued to fall below goal throughout 2021. As a result of these rates remaining below goal f or several years now, the HEDIS Behavioral Health Committee and additional care delivery primary and specialty providers have collaborated and will continue to collaborate to review the letters for improvements around factors such as verbiage, clarity of i nformation, timing, and how they're being provided to members (digitally vs. standard mail). While some changes in these ways have occurred, others are still being prioritized, leaving opportunity to evaluate the changes in relation to future HEDIS rates. 213 Experience Service Initiatives Accountable Owner Member Services - Michelle Anderson Riverview Member Services - Alison Renneke, Kate Sahnow Market Insights - Kody Donahue Member Populations Targeted x Commercial x Medicare Advantage/Cost/PDP x Medicaid x MSHO x HPUPH x WI Marketplace Description HealthPartners deploys multiple initiatives designed to improve member satisfaction with the plan and deliver an exceptional experience that customers want and deserve at an affordable cost.

Created a financial hub that streamlines and brings better visibility to our cost tools for our members. 2. Launched Phase 2 of the transparency in coverage regulation, providing member plan and provider -specific out of pocket cost estimates for 500 services and procedures. 3. Promoted use of medical and pharmacy cost estimator tools to members through all member mailer 4. Implemented get connected campaigns for four commercial groups to encourage members to create an online account and go paperless. 215 5. Implemented quarterly get connected campaigns for Medicaid members without web accounts, usi ng department of human services enrollment file, to create online account and go paperless. 6. Added go paperless soft alert in Living Well experience to encourage members logging in via Living Well to change their settings to paperless. 7. Specialty coupon opti mizer program (Variable Copay) continues and expanded to include additional specialty medications. 8. Implemented a soft -steerage campaign related to place of service, moving members from high- cost infusion clinics to home infusion. 9. Implemented a soft -steerage campaign related to providers, moving members from higher cost to lower cost home infusion providers. 10. Expanded our medical injectable site of care program to include some oncology drugs. 11. Implemented dynamic refill too soon pharmacy processing. Refill too soon limitations are intended to limit stockpiling and waste. The intent is to ensure members are taking medications correctly and as intended by their prescribing physician. The refill too soon edits in our system control excess fills by members who continuously refill medications early. The system calculates at the member and medication level based on the member's history of accumulation for each medication. The pharmacy sees a point -of- sale (POS) message when a claim rejects for refill too soon. The message includes the date the medication can be refilled, which is based on the member's fill history. 12. Riverview implemented a process to avoid unnecessary Medicaid appeals when providers mistakenly bill members provider write -off amounts, providing members a better experience while reducing time- consuming appeals work for staff. These cases now appear in data as oral complaints instead of appeals. Provider billing complaints from Medicaid members in the first half of 2022 more than doubled from the same period in 2021. 13. Implemented enhanced oncology utilization management through a vendor partner, OncoHealt h, improving affordability of oncology medications by ensuring appropriate utilization through expert oncologist prior authorization reviews. Help: 1. Updated our Plan Directory to add ability to search for nursing facilities and surgical centers (instead of just filters), filters for race/ethnicity for doctors, information on language services and added in -network/cost level status plus link to benefits in results list. 2. Implemented mental health hub to promote our mental health resources and help members understand the resources available. 3. Added public facing page with information on how to submit claims. 216 4. Updated navigation and a new landing page to assist members in how to find different types of care. 5. Updated navigation and a new pharmacy landing page that explains what pharmacy features are available. 6. Added personalized resources within My Pregnancy experience based on member's race, ethnicity, language and/or insurance product. 7. Continued implementing new member engagement touch points: onboarding, personal ized outreach, health and well -being engagement, blog, and digital content. 8. Continued improvement efforts with our mail order vendor including implementation of an auto- refill program for our Medicare Advantage members. 9. Implemented the Harper - Digital Ch at Assistant experience when members initiate a chat with member services. This chat feature is available 24/7 to members when they are logged into their myHealthPartners account. Harper attempts to assist with various simple and complex questions depending on what the member sends as their chat message. 10. Phone line changes: improved access to specialized representatives who can assist members with premium questions. 11. Overall web experience improvements 12. Preventive coverage blogs/public site messaging improvem ents 13. Provider portal enhancements regarding dental coverage and provider appeals information. 14. Created online submission process for over the counter COVID -19 tests 15. WellDyne normally requires a credit card number even if there is no cost for the purchase. This is a barrier for some members, so we've asked them to turn off this requirement for MSHO members. 16. MNsure Pay Now service implemented - Pay Now redirects enrollees from MNsure to the health plan to immediately make their initial premium payment after enrolling. This involves less work tracking, canceling and reinstating coverage if the first premium payment is not made in time, and provides an improved applicant experience. Value: 1. Created online COVID test reimbursement form for eligible members and regularly updated public facing web information with most current details on testing, vaccines, therapeutics, coverage and more. 217 2. Added information about Careline+ for members that have this benefit explaining what is available through this program. 3. Launched new personalized campaigns connecting members to NowPow and other social drivers of health resources for those who indicated a need via the health assessment. 4. Launched pilot with N1 targeting SNBC members to encourage them to complete a health risk assessm ent and enroll in care coordination, which increased rates of both. 5. To reduce administrative burden, over 6,000 prescription prior authorizations were grandfathered to allow continued fills. 6. Implemented an automated pharmacy prior authorization process, reducing processing time from 10- 20 minutes to less than 20 seconds per case. This auto approval process currently accounts for about 5- 10% of the prior authorization volume. Within the next year, roughly 50 additional drugs will be added to this initiative. 7. Created redirect from MNSure site to healthpartners.com that allows members to make first premium payment at time of enrollment with MNSure. 8. HealthPartners is the only full Medicare Advantage plan in Minnesota to earn a 5- star ranking from CMS this year. 9. Beginning in 2022, we used an external vendor (Bolger) to coordinate the order and issuance process for MSHO supplemental benefit items. Members received an order form early in 2022 that inc luded the member's name and ID number. This process eliminated the need for members to call member services to order. Barrier Analysis Our causal analysis of barriers to improving member satisfaction and member experience shows the barriers remain relat ively stable from one year to the next. Key barriers in 2022 were: 1. COVID implications: 2022 saw continued need for COVID vaccines, testing and treatment as waves of the virus came and went impacting availability of clinic and hospital resources. 2. Staffing shortages: The healthcare industry continued to be plagued by staffing shortages that began with the pandemic. 3. Access to care: The lingering impact of the COVID pandemic along with staffing shortages and clinic availability continued to impact consumers ability to receive primary and specialty care services as soon as needed. 4. Cost : Consumers continue to desire better access and more transparency when it comes to health care cost information, especially out -of-pocket costs before receiving care. This barri er is greatest for commercial members, especially those on high deductible plans, however Medicare and Medicaid members are also impacted. 218 5. Member knowledge: The complexity around healthcare and coverage is a barrier to member satisfaction. Members from al l products desire information and tools to help them more fully understand their benefits, coverage, and in- network provider options. Members who do not fully understand their benefits and coverage often have trouble seeing the value of their plan. Results and Outcomes After two years of modified survey protocols and reporting due to the COVID -19 pandemic, CAHPS, JD Power and HealthPartners' own member experience survey were back to the standard administration schedules, protocols, and reporting. For overall member satisfaction, HealthPartners had the highest member satisfaction among commercial health plans in MN and WI, outscoring other plans in our region for the CAHPS Health Plan Rating for the 15th year in a row. HealthPartners also continues to surpas s the national average for customer service. 2022 showed incremental improvement across many measures in our member experience surveys that had experienced declines in the previous year. This includes improvement for key metrics like net promoter score where both commercial and Medicare Advantage surpassed their 2022 goals. This steady incremental improvement is attributed to an organization- wide focus on experience and service. The areas of greatest opportunity based on key driver analysis across measurem ent tools continue to be access to out -of-pocket cost information before receiving care or filling a prescription and understanding your health plan and how to use it. Access to cost information continues to be a priority for members and an area of focus internally. While progress was made with the healthpartners.com cost hub, phase 2 of the transparency in coverage regulation and member communications around cost to build awareness, we will continue to refine and evolve the cost information available to members while monitoring key metrics through JD Power and our member experience survey to evaluate our progress. In order for members to see value in their health plan and feel they have coverage when they need it, they need to have a fuller understanding of their plan. Understanding how your plan works and how to use it are continual areas for improvement. We remain focused on providing members timely, relevant, personalized information via our member communications. These communications target key points in the member journey (i.e., onboarding, preventive care milestones, etc.) as well as create awareness for new services or resources that are available to members. Results from those campaigns in the past year continue to show promise: Engagement across member email communications was strong and increased from 2021. In 2022, we sent 3.8 million email outreaches and had a 55% open rate and 7% click through rate. Both are well above the industry average (22% open, 2 -3% click through). Additionally, those who engaged with our outreach took the recommended action 25% more often than those who didn't open or click through the communication. 219 New and enhanced targeted communications were launched to: o Remind members and patients to get important preventive care, such as mammograms and colorectal cancer screenings. o Encourage members to use valuable health plan programs and tools when needed, including their employee assistance plan, Iris digital cancer management program, and our cost transparency tools when they need care. o Support members in getting information about community and state services related to housing and food instability, transportation access, and other social drivers of health. o Educate and guide parents of young members and parents about COVID- 19 vaccines and booster doses, important follow up after ADHD prescriptions, and well child and teen checkups. MSHO supplemental benefits are provided free of charge to members to support good health and safety outside of their standard benefit set. Examples of 2023 MSHO supplemental benefits include: 1. Health and wellbeing benefits: coverage of one activity tracker per member per year (Electronic device to track steps and calculate calories burned), a Pedaler, access to the SilverSneakers Program and Weight Management Program 2. Dental: additional exam, fluoride, molar root canals & crowns up to $2,500, and a electric toothbrush. 3. Animatronic Support Pet - coverage of one animatronic support pet per member per year. Life- like pet provides companionship, re duces isolation, and can improve wellbeing and emotional function. 4. Family Caregiver Services - services provided to caregivers includes training, education, coaching, counseling, psychotherapy for caregivers, and family memory care (FMC) program for caregivers living with the member. FMC improves the caregiver's ability to manage the challenges of caregiving and provide social support. 5. Nutritional Services: home delivery meals immediately following surgery, or an inpatient hospital stay, fresh produce box through FarmboxRx, and PowerUp cooking classes. 6. In-home Bathroom Safety - up to $1000 coverage for assessment, devices and installation of permanent devices based on individual need. 7. Independent Living Skills - services to develop, maintain and improve a m ember's community living skills including communication, mobility, interpersonal skills, and self - care to keep the member living independently longer and in a safer environment. 8. Personal Emergency Response System - coverage for one in- home device used to notify appropriate personnel of an emergency and/or monthly device maintenance fee if the member received a device in a previous year. 220 9. Respite Care - short -term services to members with dementia when the primary care giver is absent or needs relief. 10. Virtuwe ll - unlimited virtual care visits through virtuwell. Overall, CAHPS performance for state public programs is consistent with state averages. This includes Families & Children (F&C -MA), MNCare, MSC+ and SNBC. There were only two statistically significant d ifferences compared to the state averages. The score for F&C -MA, Getting Care Quickly is significantly lower than the state average. The score for MNCare, Getting Needed Care is significantly lower than the state average. Year -over-year comparison of scores show the following directional changes (change of +/ - 5% or more) across plans: F&C-MA - declines in the rating of specialists seen most often, rating of the health plan and getting care quickly. MNCare - declines in the rating of all health care, getting needed care, getting care quickly, and coordination of care. MSC+ - increase in coordination of care and a decline in the rating of all health care. SNBC - declines in rating of all health care, getting needed care, getting care quickly, and coordination of care. 221 Complaints, Grievances and Appeals Accountable Owner Member Services - Michelle Anderson Riverview Member Services - Kate Sahnow Member Populations Targeted x Commercial x Medicare Advantage/Cost/PDP x Medicaid x MSHO x HPUPH x WI Marketplace Description Member Services works with members to answer their inquiries and resolve their complaints, grievances, and appeals. All member contacts are documented in our customer service system. From here, reports are created for the organization to identify opportunities and make improvements. Individual departments receive system -generated reports with complaint detail pertaining to their areas on a daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly basis. The data is reviewed for trends, follow - up, and service recovery opportunities. Year -end report summaries with trends and analysis are presented to the Health Plan Service Quality Council and the Experience Council. The data is used by these groups in the development of their annual plans. The following data is used to create specific member experience improvement initiatives and analysis. Results here are also used with other information in creation of the Service Initiatives report. Results and Outcomes Commercial Complaint and Appeal Results Calls Answered per 1,000 Verbal Complaints per 1,000 1st Level Appeals per 1,000 2020 this now includes Behavioral Health Navigator and Nurse Navigator data. 222 Trends and Analysis of Commercial Complaint and Appeal Data 1. Calls answered reflect an increase because as of 1/1/2022, data for Behavioral Health Navigator and Nurse Navigator calls is being included. The Commercial member complaints received per thousand decreased from 2021. Appeals received and appeals per thousand members saw just a slight increase from 2021. 2. The percent of first level appeals that become second level appeal requests increased from 9.7% in 2021 to 11.8% in 2022. 3. Non-clinical appeals increased in 2022 by 9%, due to an increase in network -related requests for members on a large employer group's focused network plan. 4. The volume of clinical appeal requests held steady, including for procedures and investigational services. 5. Pharmacy remained the highest volume of clinical appeals. More pharmacy requests are being resolved via the reconsideration process and don't require the full appeal process. a. Biologics for auto- immune disorders are 40% of Pharmacy appeals. b. 28% of Pharmacy appeals are expedited or 3- day. c. 60% of all expedited appeals are for clinical Pharmacy. 6. Ongoing appeal trends: a. The volume of appeals for behavioral health care remains very low. b. Genetic testing and pharmacogenetic testing appeals holding steady as a percent of all investigational appeals. c. More third -party appeals (drug manufacturers, specialty labs). d. Assumptions about what is covered as preventive. e. Cost and quality of care. 7. New appeal trends: a. Network -related appeals from members on our largest commercial employer group. We continue to work closely with the employer and have enhanced our communication to these members to help them stay within their plan network. b. More appeals for specialty medic ations, weight loss and migraine drugs. We continue to help members and providers know which medications are covered, and review requests for formulary exceptions. 223 Non- Clinical Appeals (N=1,296) No Medical Decision Required Clinical Appeals (N=1,288) Medical Judgment Required 224 Verbal complaint trends are similar to the above appeals trends with the addition of: o Network wrong clinic usage complaints were the highest complaint for 2022. With the trend of smaller narrow networks continuing, members struggle to understand how to use their network. The member education on these network changes varies by employer so some members understand the change while others do not and may use a clinic not in their plan network. The decision to remove our ability to make customer service adjustments by one of our largest plan sponsors when their members used a wrong clinic also contributed to a higher volume of complaints. o Other insurance information moved from the top complaint in 2021 to #2 in 2022. In September 2022, a new COB member campaign was launched, and after a few months of running the campaign, we are seeing results of a 26% increase in COB responses from September to December 2022 compared to the same period of 2021 (with comparable COB -eligible claims). Additional segments have been identified to potentially expand the reach of the COB campaign, so we are hopeful that as 2023 unfolds, we will see the complaint rate for this topic continue to decline. o Benef it complaints related to preventive and non -preventive services as well as copay/coinsurance disputes remain in our top five complaints. Members struggle to understand the difference between these services, and the movement to have our coverage more align ed with ACA has also brought member dissatisfaction. We continue to enhance our talking points for educating members related to preventive services definitions, guidelines, and recommendations. Blog posts on preventive coverage and cancer screenings launched in early February 2023, with planned links to this information as appropriate when the new My Dashboard launches on the www.healthpartners.com authenticated member website. This will also be the focus topic for the Winter 2023 all member mailer to be s ent in April 2023. o CDHP: Members' main frustration continued in 2022 to be FSA substantiation requests, and use of debit card in 2022 for 2021 expenses. Members are surprised we require substantiation/enforce deadlines after letting them use the debit car d for an ineligible expense. We continue to look for ways to educate members. Substantiation request letters are sent when a debit card transaction needs to be verified as eligible. The first request is sent shortly after the transaction, with follow up 30 days later indicating that after an additional 30 days with no response, the card would be suspended. Additionally, a Year End statement is sent around October to let account holders know of the current election, balance, remaining amount in the account , as well as any grace period and/or runout date that applies. 225 Medicare, Medicaid, and WI Marketplace Complaint and Appeal Results Calls Answered per 1,000 Oral Complaints per 1,000 1st Level Appeal and Written Grievances per 1,000 2020 1,813 6.4 Trends and Analysis of Government Plans Complaint and Appeal Data: Number of calls answered was higher than in 2021, and members expressed dissatisfaction verbally in 2022 at higher rates per 1,000 members. o Although the oral complaint rate increased, the rate of written appeals and grievances decreased in 2022. This indi cates members were satisfied enough with oral resolutions to not pursue the issue further into an appeal or written grievance. 226 Trends in 2022 Medicare oral complaints: Total grievances increased from 2021 to 2022 in all 6 top categories. The three lar gest increases were: Pharmacy Benefits, Premium Issues, and Provider Billing. o Pharmacy complaints continued to include dissatisfaction about plan cost sharing, Part D vaccine coverage, and WellDyne. In fall of 2022, WellDyne experienced delays and long hold times due to Hurricane Ian. WellDyne also experienced a cyber security event in May of 2022. Letters were mailed to members on June 20, 2022. In addition to recurring themes, we received increased complaints regarding Over -the-Counter pharmacy coverage, including our NationsOTC vendor. o Premium complaints related to incidents throughout the year. Members reported receiving Social Security Withhold letters in error, affecting 444 members. We transitioned to a different bank and banking platform which impac ted our telephonic bill pay system as well as caused premium processing delays, and a courier issue resulted in late delivery of paper premium statements in August 2022. o Provider Billing complaints include situations such as providers asking members to submit their own claims to insurance, members receiving a bill for non -covered services, or providers billing members for the provider write- off amount in error. Total grievances decreased in some lower volume categories such as website, office visit benefits, and quality of care. o The total number of Website complaints from Medicare members in 2022 was 498; down from 560 in 2021 and 633 in 2020. Website related grievances remain out of the top six complaint categories. 020040060080010001200 Customer ServicePharmacy BenefitsNetwork 2020 2021 2022227 Trends in 2022 Medicaid complaints: Total grievances increased from 2021 to 2022 in all six top categories. The three largest increases were: provider billing, network, and network customer service. o Provider billing complaints include situations such as members receiving a bill for non-covered services, or providers billing members for the provider write- off amount in error. This category also includes situations where an unnecessary appeal was prevented. Riverview Member Services implemented a process to avoid unnecessary Medicaid appeals when providers mistakenly bill members provider write -off amounts, providing members a better experience while reducing time- consuming appeals work for staff. These cases now appear in data as oral complaints instead of appeals - Provider Billing complaints from Medicaid members in the first half of 2022 more than doubled from the same period in 2021. This shows the new process is working as designed. o The increase in Network Customer Service (provider) complaints may be related to continued staffing and access related pressures faced by providers throughout 2022. Trends in 2022 Wisconsin Marketplace complaints: Total grievances increased from 2021 to 2022 in all s ix top categories. The two largest increases were premiums issues and pharmacy benefits. 020406080100120140160180200 312177 35 24 2064 44Number Marketplace Oral Complaints by Category 2020 2021 2022228 o Premium -related complaints included notable dissatisfaction about our transition to a new bank to manage plan premium payments. New bank implementation impacted elockbox payments, P.O. box changes, IVR phone systems, and couriers. In addition to transitioning to a new bank, a paper premium invoice delay occurred in 2022 due to a third- party vendor issue. Both events drove increased premium -related complaints in 2022. o Pharmacy benefit complaints included dissatisfaction about cost -sharing, prior authorization requirements/process, and formulary options. As drug costs rise nationwide, members with deductibles and cost sharing may not understand what the experience will be until they have claims and may struggle to afford high- cost medications. A continued theme for WI Marketplace members' complaints is related to scenarios where HealthPartners does not manage the issue. In these cases (enrollments, disenrollments, demographic changes and tax credit determinations) we must divert the member to the Federally Facilitated Exchange for resolution. Members are dissatisfied when HealthPartners cannot resolve their complaint directly. o Implementation of the W3LL platform may encourage reduction of complaints for these reasons in 2023. Top Medicare Written Grievance and Appeals by Category *Data includes Cost, 2022229 Medicare Trends 1. In 2022, 65% of Medicare appeals had a resolution time frame of 14 calendar days or less. These include Part D appeals and expedited requests. 2. Pharmacy appeals continue to be our largest category of appeals. 62% of all Medicare appeals were related to drug requests. a. 30% of Part D appeals were approved. The most common approval reason is that information provided during the appeal demonstrates the member now meets criteria. b. 22% of the Part D requests were for CMS excluded drugs. Excluded drugs are classes o f drugs not covered by Part D and are therefore ineligible for coverage. c. We had 12 requests for Part B drugs. We approved 7, in most cases we received additional information that the member now met criteria. d. We had 88 requests for tiering exceptions. Thes e requests can only be approved if there is no other brand drug on a lower cost -sharing tier approved for treating the same condition. 3. We continue to see an increase in requests for coverage of genetic testing across all our products, due to new technology on the market. 4. The highest number of dental appeals were related to preventive visits and TMJ/TMD. 5. Medicare grievance trends included grievances regarding general benefits, provider billing, premiums, and quality of care. 267 27 16363 40 26374 69 48 0100200300400 Pharmacy Medical Coverage CriteriaDentalTop Medicare Appeals 2020 2021 2022230 Top Medicaid Written Grievance and Appeal Categories Medicaid Trends 1.

Dental appeals have gone down from 2021 however, they are still our largest category. 45% of our dental appeals are for orthodontia. 3. In 2022, we had 566 Medicaid pharmacy appeal requests. Of these, 355 were resolved through the pharmacy hand off process and 211 were resolved through the appeal process. We saw an increase in requests for certain drugs, including Botox, Nurtec ODT, Ozempic and Skyrizi. In most cases, these requests were denied because the member did not meet criteria. 57 108 4 1611 6 289 0414 7 1711 0 0246810121416Medicaid Written Grievance Categories 2020 2021 2022 115 114 103 96 55 56 47147 95292 54 59 6744211 72276 169 6646 43 050100150200250300350 Medical Coverage CriteriaDental In Network Benefit RequestsLab Restricted RecipientBH/CHTop Medicaid Appeals 2020 2021 2022231 a. The pharmacy handoff process is a pharmacist outreach and review process for our Medicaid members (except MSHO Part D). The pharmacist working on these requests reaches out to the provider to ensure we have all the necessary information. If additional information is received that changes the decision, the pharmacist can approve the request and the request is not considered an appeal. If the request cannot be approved, the request is sent back to Member Rights & Benefits to go through the appeal process. In most cases, the appeal is denied because if criteria had been met, it would have been approved during the handoff process. In 2022, 93% of pharmacy appeals were upheld. 4. In network benefit requests increased significantly. 88% of the requests were for services at Mayo. 5. Medicaid grievances for 2022 included members concerns with their experiences with Ridecare, clinic networks or experience with clinics, coordination with other insurance, provider billing, general benefit concerns and quality of care. WI Marketplace First Level A ppeals and Written Grievances Total WI Marketplace Appeals and Written Grievance by Category WI Marketplace trends: In 2022, we had 29 WI Marketplace appeals and 6 grievances. o The highest numbers of appeals (11) were requests for drug coverage. o The mos t common grievances (4) were related to enrollment and premiums. The numbers are low on this product and difficult to identify any trends. However, the types of complaints received are those that are commonly requested such as receiving in-network benefits from an out of network provider. 18 029 1 0 012 15 41 0 026 04 5 0 0 051015202530WI Marketplace Appeals and Written Grievances 2020 2021 2022232 Monitoring the Utilization Management Program Processes and Staffing HealthPartners Utilization Management (UM) Program activities and initiatives encompass medical, pharmacy, and behavioral health services. Components fall within five major categories: 1. Improving systems of care (e.g. networks and approaches to delivery of care) 2. Providing decision- making support 3. Supporting utilization management at a member -specific or population- specific level 4. Measuring and analyzing performance 5. Implementing specific initiatives that are designed and developed to improve performance results Licensed nurses, behavioral health pr ofessionals, and registered pharmacists work under the supervision of board- certified physicians for all case decisions involving medical necessity. Associate Medical Directors review coverage requests for medical necessity and make adverse determinations for lack of medical necessity, when appropriate. They consult with external specialty physicians as appropriate. When required, a physician with the same or similar specialty as a practitioner that typically treats or manages the condition for which the health care service is being requested, is used to make adverse medical necessity determinations, when the member does not appear to meet coverage criteria. The Medical Directors, Associate Medical Directors, the Directors of Comprehensive Care Advocacy, Pharmacy, and Utilization Management are collaboratively responsible for the development of new programs, initiatives, and the ongoing oversight of the day -to-day operations. HealthPartners has implemented a formal process to ensure consistency of decision- making for coverage of medical and behavioral health treatments, procedures, and services, new and existing technologies, devices, and pharmaceuticals. Medical Coverage Criteria are used for prior authorization decisions, and disputed benefit interpretations and are also published on HealthPartners.com for transparency to members and providers. The processes include continuously updating the basis of decision- making with evidenced -based information regarding current best practices (e.g., practice guidelines , technology assessments) and cost -benefit considerations. This includes research of the reliable scientific literature, including articles in peer reviewed literature, recommendations and consensus statements from professional societies, technology assess ments, and other available resources to determine safety, efficacy of the treatment/technology/device/drug, and effect on health care outcomes. The process for newly developed or revised criteria includes obtaining expert opinion from our network primary care physicians and/or specialists to ensure criteria input regarding community standards of practice. When appropriate, recommendations are made to modify contract language regarding benefit coverage determinations. Coverage criteria utilized as part of the UM program are reviewed, on an annual basis, updated as needed, and approved through the Medical Directors Committee or the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. Newly developed or revised criteria are also reviewed by network primary care physicians and/or specialists to ensure criteria input regarding community standards of practice. All other coverage criteria are reviewed and 233 approved on a periodic review cycle. The Medical Coverage Policy staff, Medical Directors Committee, and Pharmacy and Therape utics Committee are responsible for the medical coverage criteria development and implementation processes. The Coverage Criteria Policies are used for making medical necessity determinations for items and services on HealthPartners's Prior Authorization List. State and federal laws, rules and regulatory requirements, criteria and coverage guidelines for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and for the Minnesota Department of Human Services are incorporated into the development of the HealthPartners Coverage Criteria. Inter -rater Reliability Testing We conduct inter -rater reliability evaluations annually for all Utilization Management review staff to ensure consistent application of coverage criteria and benefits. In 2022 we surveyed: Staff type Number of hypothetical cases Non-physician medical & behavioral health reviewer (38) 10 Physician reviewers (3*) *2 physician reviewers were being on -boarded during the testing and did not participate. 6- Medical 10- Pharmacy Non-physician pharmacy reviewer (27) 10 Area Survey response rate Consistency rate Follow -up Actions UM 97% 92% Reviewed cases that had any variance in responses during team meetings to support staff alignment. Pharmacy 92% (24/26) *One PCSA is in training and did not take the survey and another PCSA was out on leave an did not take the survey. 80% Reviewed cases that had any variance in responses during team meetings to support staff alignment. Audit pharmacy reviewers monthly to ensure decisions are criteria based and that the review process follows all applicable policies and procedures. 234 Satisfaction with the Utilization Management Process Annually, HealthPartners collects and evaluates data on member and provider experience with Utilization Management (UM) processes and acts when appropriate. Monitoring metrics include the annual Provider Satisfaction Survey, HEDIS/CAHPS 5.0H survey results, and member complaint and appeal data. 2022 Goals Easy to understand denial letters: Sustain a \"Strongly Agree\", \"Agree\", or \"Neither Agree nor Disagree\" response rate of 75% or greater by continuing to develop plain language resources as achieved in the 2019 Provider Survey. A bility to find criteria online: Increase 2022 response rate of Agree\", \"Agree\", or \"Neither Agree nor Disagree\" to 65% with expansion of new Verify Prior Auth tool and continuing to evaluate options to deliver easy to use online criteria. Continue to evaluate, update, and develop coverage criteria policies with input from providers and evidence -based medicine to support safe and effective care for our patients and members. Continue to monitor, evaluate, and institute appropriate actions to address member and practitioner experience with the UM process, as needed. Assessment of Effectiveness Provider Experience with the UM process We mailed the Provider Survey in May 2022 to 1,086 providers and their office managers who had requested prior authorizations in the past 15- month period. The number of completed surveys was 72. Progress Towards Goals It is difficult to assess progress towards goals due to a historically low response rate. Compared to 2021, the 2022 results remain stable despite the challenges healthcare providers are facing, especially related to staff ing. Quantitative Analysis Measure 2021 2022 Goal Met?

In 2021, it was expanded to include pharmacy and behavioral health services. Tool expansion continued in 2022. The Utilization Management departments continue to improve use of plain language to ensure content is easily understandable for the member and balance that with clinical validity for the practitioner. Member Experience with the UM process HealthPartners conducts an annual assessment of member satisfaction to support continuous improvement in member experience with utilization review activities across medical, behavioral health, and pharmacy programs . Member experience measures used are those suggested by NCQA. HealthPartners Market Insights and Medical Policy Departments compared key questions from the CAHPS and MA -PD CAPHS surveys. SPH Analytics conducted the Commercial CAHPS 2022 survey, which was administered between February and May 2022. SPH Analytics conducted the MA -PD CAPHS 2022 survey, which was administered between March and June 2022. In 2022, Minnesota DHS conducted the Medicaid CAHPS survey between January and March. These results are compared to the state's benchmark for each enrollee type. We do continue to see impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic in our CAHPS results across products. 236 Commercial Products: 2022 UM Member Satisfaction Results Administered by HealthPartners Questions th at measure UM satisfaction levels for: Group Commercial HealthPartners National Average 2020 2021 2022 2022 How often get appointment to see a specialist as soon as needed?

Access to care, tests and treatment is above the National Average and consistent with 2021. HealthPartners Medicare plans consistently outscore the National Average for access to care, tests or treatment. 2022 scores for access to special ty appointments are consistent with the National Average or slightly above across HealthPartners Medicare plans. HealthPartners Medicaid plans 2022 scores come in below the State Average on access to specialty appointments. Except for MSC+, HealthPartners Medicaid plans scores are slightly below the state average on access to care, tests, and treatment. o Minnesota Care (MNCare) stands below the State Average on both measures, following decreases compared to last year. o F&C-MA stands below the state average on access to specialty appointments following a decrease compared to prior years. F&C -MA score on access to care, tests, and treatment is slightly below the State Average despite a slight increase over last year's score. o Scores for Special Needs Basic Care (SNBC) are slightly below the State Average for both measures. The Access to specialty appointments measure decreased substantially compared to last year, while access to care, tests, and treatments decreased slightly. o Minnesota Senior Care Plus (MSC+) is slightly above the State Average on access to care, tests, and treatments, but falls below the State Average on access to specialty appointments. The scores for both measures increased compared to 2021. Analysis Access to Care There is little indication that HealthPartners members are experiencing specific plan- related barriers for getting care, although the erosion of commercial group members' score warrants monitoring and is likely related to health care affordability rather than specific HealthPartners utilization policy changes. Specialty Access HealthPartners recognizes that specialty appointment demand in Minnesota is robust, and our own care groups and contracted clinics have taken steps to improve specialty scheduling and patient flow through continued development and enhancement of online scheduling systems. Referrals Referrals to specialists are not required for most of our products. HealthPartners' comprehensive networks ensure that our members can receive the c are they need within their designated network. On the few occasions when this is not possible, our utilization management and customer service teams work with the referring provider and member to find a specialty provider that meets the member's specific health care needs. Focused Network Access Management 239 The In- Network Benefit Request coverage policy addresses requests for reimbursement of out - of-network care at in- network benefit levels. To be considered for this level of reimbursement, a clinician wit h knowledge of the member's current clinical condition and care needs will submit sufficient documentation for the plan to determine whether treatment for the member's current condition is available within the member's plan network. Appeals Pharmacy There were 606 commercial Pharmacy Appeals in 2022. Top medications are reviewed each quarter, and coverage issues are reported back to the Pharmacy Review Committee. See Appendix 3 for detailed breakdown of pharmacy appeals. A large volume of pharmacy denials that are overturned are due to additional information. This has led to increased provider outreach for complete information with the initial request. Investigational Services See Appendix 3 for detailed breakdown of appeals for investigational services. Per analysis of data contained in Appendix 3, significant trends in appeals associated with investigational services are most likely due to a continued high volume of requests for genetic testing. In addition to aggressively pursuing direct -to-member marketing and directly initiating appeals, developer/manufacturers are also providing standardized appeal templates to service providers and encouraging them to submit appeals on the behalf of the member. Genetic Testing Given the rapidly expanding genetic testing market, growth in direct to consumer (DTC) marketing of genetic tests, and our organization's multiple efforts to ensure appropriate use, genetic testing continues to be a high- volume category of appeals. HealthPartners continues to address coverage of genetic testing by developing coverage criteria policies that support safe, effective, and evidence- based use of these tests. Increasingly, developers/manufacturers are aggressively pursuing direct -to-member marketing and are initiating a high volume of appeals on behalf of the member. Online Access to Criteria The low performance results specific to provider satisfaction with online access to criteria is likely because the criteria are not available within the Electronic Medical Record but instead are available on our website, and providers may not know where to find it. We believe our implementation and expansion of the verify PA tool with the addition of review -specific fillable PA forms linked in the criteria will help improve this satisfaction. Barri er Analysis Provider Survey: In 2021, HealthPartners resumed fielding the annual Provider Satisfaction Survey. Shortly after the surveys were distributed, we experienced back -to-back COVID -19 surges. As a result, we saw a historically low response rate. As care delivery systems continue to struggle with staffing and patient volume, 2022's survey response rate remained low. New Technology Direct to Member Marketing: 240 As new technologies are striving to increase market share, we see an impact on member request s for specific services, increased expectations of coverage, and third- party vendors appealing on the member's behalf. We expect this will always be a dynamic within the healthcare market, especially as we strive to ensure evidence- based coverage, as vendo rs are often marketing new technologies once they receive FDA approval, but before the quality evidence regarding effectiveness, safety, and effect on health outcomes is available. Impact of Triple Aim strategies: As we strive to improve health, experience, and affordability some of our initiatives can initially meet provider and member resistance as we are attempting to influence patterns of care and use of specific services. Effective utilization management spans the continuum of care and services, and we use it at selected leverage points to improve the safety, quality, value, and/or utilization of care. It may involve either or both consumer and provider engagement support services. Systems and processes for bot h operational and administrative functions are designed and continuously improved to support effective and appropriate care delivery and utilization management initiatives. Identified Opportunities for Improvement/Actions In 2022, HealthPartners continued and enhanced our strategies and initiatives to support and improve member and provider experience. Ease of use of online criteria: In May of 2020, we introduced a new Prior Auth Verification Tool, which simplifies the process of determining when a prior auth is required. All the provider needs to determine if a PA is required are the service codes (CPT/Dx). It also directs the provider to the appropriate medical coverage policy. If the service/item does require a PA, a link to the resource to begin the PA request process is provided. Electronic authorization function: Utilization of the online prior authorization application for submi ssion of medical PA continues to increase. This method ensures only minimally necessary information is collected to make a coverage decision and hopefully saves provider office time in collecting pertinent clinical information to submit a request. We hav e also enhanced our standard forms for those providers who prefer to submit via fax. Pharmacy E -Prior Authorization: HealthPartners continues to work with our vendors to support ePA. As of March 2019, we were receiving over 70% of prior authorization requ ests via ePA, and four years later, we have continued to receive 75% of pharmacy benefit requests via ePA. EMR vendors are continuing to make enhancements to their system functionality for providers to take advantage of this capability with seamless integr ation into provider workflows. In addition, HealthPartners has worked on creating question sets or decision trees that are specific to the drug being requested. For over 75% of ePA requests, providers will be sent a question 241 set that is specific to the drug being requested. The questions will ask for all the pertinent information necessary to make a decision, and it ensures that decisions are rendered similarly across different users. We are also expanding our work on auto -adjudication of requests (i.e., eliminate manual intervention). For certain medications, electronic submissions that meet defined criteria will be automatically processed, further reducing turnaround time. In March 2020, we piloted automatic adjudication for two drugs and have since expanded to over 140 drugs. As of March 2023, approximately 17% of prior authorization requests are automatically processed with approval decisions communicated to providers within approximately 10 seconds after submitting the request. In 2019, we also rolled out Real Time Pharmacy Benefit Check (also known as RTPB or RTBC), which provides more specific Formulary coverage information within the electronic medical record. The Real Time Pharmacy Benefit Check may also display alternative medications that do not require prior authorization for the provider to select if they wish to avoid the prior authorization process. 2023 Goals Easy to understand denial letters: Sustain a \"Strongly Agree\", \"Agree\", or \"Neither Agree nor Disagree\" response rate of 75% or greater by continuing to develop plain language resources. A bility to find criteria online : Increase 2022 response rate of \"Strongly Agree\", \"Agree\", or \"Neither Agree nor Disagree\" to 65% with continued expansion of the Verify Prior Auth tool and continuing to evaluate options to deliver easy to use online criteria. Continue to evaluate, update, and develop coverage criteria policies with input from providers and evidence -based medicine to support safe and effective care for our patients and members. Continue to monitor, evaluate, and institute appropriate actions to address member and practitioner experience with the UM process, as needed. 242 Health Equity Health Disparities Description As an organization dedicated to the health and well -being of every person, we have the responsibility and opportunity to help build a stronger organization and community where racism and inequity have no place. HealthPartners has a long history of addressi ng structural racism and health equity; grounded in the mission, vision and values established by our consumer - elected board of directors. Our mission is to improve health and well -being in partnership with our members, patients, and the community. Our Par tners for Better Health Goals 2025 reflects this mission. We seek to deliver outstanding care and service that is safe, timely, effective, equitable, efficient and patient/member/family centered. We have been an industry leader in creating health and well -being programs aimed at reducing disparities in care, increasing diversity within our workplaces, and honoring the communities we serve. This focus is embedded in everything we do, and we partner meaningfully in our communities to address social determinants of health and act as an anchor tenant to improve health and economic development. Achieving health equity requires addressing disparate health outcomes and recognizing its relationship to structural racism and racial bias. Goals Our goal is to eliminate health disparities among our members and patients to improve their health and experience. We seek to develop community partnerships to support social, economic, and environmental health and well -being for our patients and members and to decrease the gaps in socioeconomic and physical environmental health determinants. Initiatives/Interventions HealthPartners has a longstanding commitment to improve the health of the diverse communities we serve. We've been recognized for outstanding care outcomes and performance, and we continue to partner with our communities to eliminate disparities. Our Equity, Inclusion and Anti -Racism Cabinet provides strategic leadership in planning and executing activities aimed at improving racial equity and health equity through reducing health care disparities, improving access, and supporting an inclusive culture. Our strong leadership in this area is reflected in the awards and recognitions we've received for these efforts: 1.

Equity, Inclusion and Anti -Racism Cabinet In 2020, HealthPartners established the Equity, Inclusion, and Anti -Racism Cabinet to aggressively accelerate our efforts to advance racial equity and health equity. The cabinet provides strategic leadership in planning and executing activities aimed at improving racial equity and health equity through reducing health care disparities, improving access, and supporting an inclusive culture. The cabinet aligns racial equity and health equity activities across the organization through inclusion in annual plans and supports tracking, monitoring, and measuring progress. The cabinet: 1. Provides an organization -wide approach to measure and reduce heal th care disparities. 2. Supports workforce development initiatives that reinforce cultural humility and respect. 3. Improves care for members with limited English proficiency and who are hearing impaired. 4. Involves members in planning and implementing racial equity and health equity approaches. 5. Engages with communities across the seven- county metropolitan area in partnerships to promote racial equity and health equity. 6. Provides direction for data collection, analysis, and reporting across the organization. 7. Communicates progress on initiatives across the organization, and externally as appropriate. The Equity, Inclusion and Anti -Racism Cabinet provides leadership, direction, and oversight through four cornerstones to accelerate the pace of our work and cultivate al ignment and partnership across the organization. 246 The image below illustrates the four cornerstones' approach of the Health Equity, Inclusion, and Anti-Racism Cabinet. Community collaboration to gain insights and engage community We have built a culture of health equity in our organization through partnerships with community organizations. In our 2021 Community Health Needs Assessments and Plans, conducted by each of our hospitals, priority needs were reviewed within the contextual factors of structural racism and COVID -19. During that process, we engaged community members, public health, and our own clinicians to more deeply understand how we might impact the health of our community. Community partnership development is a core strategy in our work to promote and make change towards health equity. We invest in six general areas: healthy children, mental health, nutrition and fitness, health equity, wellness and prevention and research and education. We also have larger, multi -year partnerships and campaigns with community -based organizations to impact and improve community health including the MakeItOK campaign, PowerUp and Little Moments Count. Examples of partners include organizations such as the Keystone Community Services, Open Arms Minnesota, Reach Out and Read MN, American Red Cross Blood Services, Northside Achievement Zone (NAZ), the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), St. Paul Bookmobile, over 60 schools throughout the region, Hunger Solutions, and many others. Healthy Children and Maternal Health 1. Little Moments Count: LMC is a growing social movement seeking to increase awareness of the importance and increase parent and caregiver behaviors of talking, playing, reading, singing and storytelling with children, in the first 1000 days of life (0- 3 years old). LMC achieves this through collective impact partnership with over 70 cross - sector organizations, including early childhood, healthcare, non- profit community and cultural, faith community, media, governmental and other private sector organizations. LMC partners work together to magnify key family support resources and opportunities, as well as identify gaps to address through collective impact strategies . In 2022, LMC reached Minnesota and Wisconsin families and professionals through: 247 a. Over 14 million MN Public Radio (MPR) radio and digital public service announcements (PSAs). b. Over 90,000 prints, 525,000 radio and 182,000 digital cultural community media impressions within Latinx, Hmong, Somali, African American and indigenous communiti es through strategic trusted community media and social media partnerships. c. Reaching approximately 22,000 community event impressions through large events like the MN State Fair and smaller community outreach efforts, like the Ramsey County Mother's First Community Baby Shower. d. Over 1000 views of the LMC Annual Conference featuring keynote speaker, Dr. Rosemarie Allen, MEd, \"Racism and the Developing Brain.\" e. 150,000 families receiving Reach Out & Read early brain development education and over 214,000 children's books at well child visits across 10 health care systems. f. Over 1100 family LMC LEARN Survey responses from African American, Latinx, Hmong, Somali, Indigenous and Medicaid- insured communities - showing community -specific assets and needs to help guide LMC strategy in the future. g. Over 5000 families reached through a new family birth center pilot introducing LMC resources to new parents delivering at 5 MN family birth centers. h. In partnership with The Itasca Project, new and enhanced employer commu nication campaign and family support best practices and policy examples tools. 2. Children's Health Council: It's clear that there is a strong link between health and well - being early in life, and health and well -being later in life. HealthPartners is working to improve the health and well -being of children and their families by concentrating on areas of focus known as our Children's Health Council (previously known as Initiative). The four main guiding principles of the initiative are: promoting early brain development, providing family centered care, strengthening our communities and eliminate disparities in maternal, infant and pediatric health. In 2022, our areas of focus include: early brain development, adolescent health, pediatric, adolescent, and maternal mental health access and outcomes, healthy beginnings (maternal and newborn care), and lactation. Through this investment, we're helping lay a foundation that will benefit generations to come. 3. R each Out and Read and early brain development messaging: Reach Out and Read reaches children from 6 months to age five. At the beginning of every visit, a child's healthcare provider will give the child an age and language appropriate book to share with their family. The provider uses this opportunity to gauge the child's early development and give the parents or caregivers guidance on how language- rich interactions, such as reading, singing, and playing together, help a child learn and grow healthily. In efforts to start this messaging early on, we added a black and white book to the 32- week prenatal visit and explain to families that there are benefits of talking, reading, and singing to their baby still in the womb. Each year, this program hands out 248 approximately 95,000 books between our well child checks and prenatal visits and offers books in over 12 different languages. 4. Well Child and Childhood Immunization Outreach: During the pandemic, we saw declines in many preventive care measures including well child visits and childhood immunizations. Delays in immunizations put children at increased risk for many preventable diseases, and lack of well care can delay identification of developmental delays or other health concerns. Our Medicaid membership had the lowest utilization of these health care services across our membership. HealthPartners utilized information from our care group and claims to identify 10,000 members up to 18 years old who needed immunizations, well -child care or both. We worked with WellShare International, a local Community Health Worker organization, to conduct outreach to these members to educate on the importance of preventive care, encourage visits to their clinician and help in scheduling these visits. WellShare has a roster of community health workers (CHW) from the community and were able to make calls in members' native languages when possible or utilize an interpreter when needed. Calls were made to members beginning in October and continue into 2023. As of the end of 2022, 5479 (55%) of the members on the list had been contacted at least once. CHWs were able to successfully engage 26% of the members they reached out to. Reasons for not reaching included disconnected or wrong phone numbers, messages left but not returned, and members who declined the intervention. CHWs were able to educate 1556 families on the importance of getting up to date on immunizations and well child exams and assisted 104 to schedule the appointment. In addition to this outreach, we worked with the other MN Medicaid plans and the Minnesota Council of Health Plans to create a blog post about the importance of getting caught back up on immunizations and well visits. The blog is available in written and audio form and is being translated to Spanish, Somali and Hmong for access to those communities. 5. T hink Small Positive Parent Texting program: This easy, free program provides fun facts and easy tips each week with ideas on how parents/caregivers can promote their child's learning. Research shows when parents participate in this program their children are more prepared for kindergarten. In 2021, we included a Little Moments Count bookmark, which promotes Think Small, to our 32-week prenatal visit and 1 month well child check. This bookmark is offered in English, Spanish and Somali and we continue to use this bookmark throughout those respective visits. 6. P owerUp Teen Leadership Council: In 2020, the Children's Health Council (CHC) started to partner with PowerUp's Teen Council to provide feedback on care for teens. In the first year, they provided feedback on our adolescent questionnaire to ensure we are asking relevant questions, which we were then able to update. In 2021, CHC chairs were added to the advisory committee to help enhance their engagement through the program and into the community. Through 2022, the teen council provided feedback on relevant 249 topics to ensure clinicians covered important topics with teens. In 2023, HealthPartners is dedicated to a refresh training on adolescent health where the council will play an integral part in content developed to ensure relevancy during well child visits. 7. St. Paul Promise Neighborhood (SPPN): The Promise Neighborhood (Wilder Foundation, Ramsey County, and St. Paul Public Schools) is a community -wide initiative to provide academic, social and health support that children need to succeed in school and life. The focus is on families with children birth to age 5. HealthPartners is a partner on the advisory council. 8. P enumbra Theater: HealthPartners partners with Penumbra Theater, a local theater company that creates professional productions focused on the African American experience. Penumbra has evolved into a Center for Racial Healing that nurtures black artists, advances equity, and facilitates wellness for individuals and community. HealthPartners began a partnership with Penumbra to support the commissioning and development of a new play written by Harrison David Rivers as a response to the growing awareness of racial disparities in maternal health. While it could not be performed on the stage in 2021 due to COVID, Penumbra performed excerpts of Weathering in a virtual reading format for HealthPartners employees who serve on our pregnancy council, health equity and children's health initiative cabinet. The session was recorded and continues to be used for training across our organization. Weathering was brought to the stage in 2022 with rave reviews. Weathering puts a human face on those staggering statistics that black infants are more than twice as likely to die as white infants and lets us experience the tragedy of one family, as well as the healing that can happen within a community. 9. The Black Pregnancy and Post -Birth Journey: In 2021, with support from the Park Nicollet Foundation, HealthPartners & Park Nicollet partnered with a consulting agency, Heart of the Customer, to improve outcomes for Black expectant mothers by capturing their experiences during and after pregnancy to build empathy, undermine systemic racism, and improve outcomes for them and their babies. Black expectant and post -birth patients face far worse health and mortality outcomes that their white counterparts both in Minnesota and nationally. Studies show Black patients are less satisfied with their care and use fewer healthcare services. As a system, we want to build trust with our Black patients and their partners to provide timely and culturally competent care. As a result of our journey mapping inquiry with Heart of the Customer and our community consultants, a top identified program strategy was to offer a perinatal concierge that would stay connected to Black patients throughout their pregnancy care. 10. H ealthy Black Pregnancies (formally known as ICHRP): To better serve our African American patient population, HealthPartners has partnered with Healthy Black Pregnancies. This group provides professional expertise; knowledge of prenatal African American maternal and child health issues; knowledge of the African American community; and connections to local, national, and international resources and colleagues. In 2021, our care group piloted referring our patients to their program. In 250 partnership with Healthy Black Pregnancies, we continue to work through some barriers with this referral process. Our Healthy Pregnancy care coordinators and staff from our clinics make referrals to their DIVA Moms program and other support services. In 2022, HP gifted Healthy Black Pregnancies a $50,000 grant to support the formalization of their structure as a 501c3 and to increase access to their support services. 11. Healthy Beginnings: This program helps women achieve a healthy pregnancy and birth by providing comprehensive screening and support to pregnant patients who are experiencing substance use issues, mental health struggles, homelessness, poverty, domestic violence, and/or other complex psychosocial issues. This evidence- based program reduces preterm births, and low birthweights. More than 10,000 pregnant patients per year receive screening and are eligible for support with these challenging life circumstances. Partnerships with the community: a. Cradle of Hope - Apply for portable cribs, provide safe sleep education, and distribute cribs to patients. b. Bundles of Love Charity - Distribution partner for the charity (bundles have handmade baby clothes, blankets, and baby care items) c. Everyday Miracles - Provide grant -funded scholarships for childbirth prep, breastfeeding, and newborn care classes; refer patients for doula services, car seat and breast pump distribution. d. Participation in Scott Co. Early Childhood Multidisciplinary Team (case consultation meetings with child protection and other community child welfare agencies) e. Ongoing referrals to WIC, MVNA and other county family home- visiting programs, Portico Healthnet, Hennepin County Project Child, HousingLink, Diaper Bank of Minnesota, Minnesota Day One Crisis Hotline, local food shelves and many other resources and supports. 12. Everyday Miracles: Through grant support, women seeking prenatal care through a HealthPartners clinic can seek support from Everyday Miracles and we will help fund the cost of the classes. Everyday Miracles is committe d to improving maternal health, and specifically to reducing health disparities in communities at risk for poor outcomes. They strive to provide compassionate, culturally aware support and a nonjudgmental, welcoming community. 13. Lac tation Caf\u00e9: With support from a grant, Park Nicollet was able to expand their Lactation Caf\u00e9 at Methodist Hospital (previously Mom & Baby Caf\u00e9) to four ambulatory clinics. This free Caf\u00e9 provides support, camaraderie, and lactation support for mothers postpartum. Lactation also partnered with the interpreter services department to provide interpreters at known, diverse clinics to assist patients who are English language learners. In 2023, there is a plan to expand partnership with Hennepin County WIC to 251 assist with the Cafes to help provide more culturally congruent care and help connect patients to community resources. 14. Doula Services: HealthPartners is pleased to note we are committed to expanding and funding doula services. Research shows that doulas can improve outcomes for both mother and baby. For example, studies show that doulas help reduce the rate of caesarean surgeries, which is higher among black women than other racial groups, and other costly interventions. Doulas also increase the rate of breastfeeding, which improves the health of new moms and babies and is less common among black or low - income women. Many people in the community are unfamiliar with doulas and how they can provide support to birthing people. HealthPartners created a video explaining what a doula is, the value they bring to the birth experience and how pregnant people can be connected with a doula. This video has been translated with sub -titles into Spanish, Somali and Hmong and will be shared widely to promote the use of doulas for families in the community. As vo iced by the Ramsey County Birth Equity Community Council (BECC), the community has expressed a desire for more doula support that \"looks like them.\" Through conversations with community doula programs and other community representatives, it has been identified that capacity is an issue, especially for women of color. HealthPartners has an ongoing relationship with Everyday Miracles as our primary doula provider for our Medicaid members. Everyday Miracles is committed to improving maternal health, and specifically to reducing health disparities in communities at risk for poor outcomes. They strive to provide compassionate, culturally aware support and a nonjudgmental, welcoming community. In 2021, along with another MN Medicaid health plan, HealthPartners funded the training and certification costs for additional doulas of color to serve Medicaid members. Since that time, Everyday Miracles roster of Doulas of color went from 40% of their doulas to 70% of their doulas identifying as people of color. We gifted Everyday Miracles a $50,000 grant in 2022 to further aid their work in providing support to the community. We are also engaged with a group of community members and organizations to encourage the state to update the allowable doula certifications to include culturally congruent trainings relevant for Black and Indigenous pregnant people. In 2022, the health department established a process for additional certifying agencies to become Medicaid eligible providers. We have been working with Division of Indian Work (DIW) to support their Ninde Doula program. Previously their program was funded by grants which couldn't fully fulfill the needs of the community for services. We have been working with them to become Medicaid billable to increase their funding capacity. In 2022, we provided a $50,000 grant to DIW to support the services and to formalize processes to be able to contract with them. 252 15. Referral partners: We continue to expand our collaboration with community partners to further support our most vulnerable patients and members. We work to identify and refer our eligible mothers who are patients or members to family home visiting and other county public health nurse home visiting programs and community -based programs to support diverse communities including doulas and other maternal health supports. We refer pregnant members on Medicaid to county home visiting for support and resources at the local level. 16. P erinatal Measurements: In November 2021, HealthPartners began participating in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Perinatal Improvement Collaborative, a large- scale, data- driven collaborative of 200+ leading hospitals caring for diverse populations in all 50 states. The collaborative is overseen by the HHS Office on Women's Health (OWH), using relevant data, analytics, and performance improvement methodologies from Premier Inc. The HHS Perinatal Improvement Collaborative will be testing interventions and protocols to reduce preventable deaths and complications among mothers and their babies. Using Premier's comprehensive and standardized data collection system, the program will be able to quickly generate solutions for safer obstetric and neonatal care that can be implemented nationwide. The effort is guided by an external advisory panel comprising more than 20 expert clinicians, leaders, and patient partners from MoMMA's Voices, a coalition of advocacy organizations focused on leading causes of maternal mortality and morbidity. 17. Postpartum Hemorrhage and Hypertension in Pregnancy Safety Bundle: In June 2021, all 8 inpatient hospital birth center leaders, providers, nurse educators, quality improvement specialist, pharmacy, lab and Epic builders collaborated to roll out a robust program to improve maternal morbidity and mortality related to postpartum hemorrhage and hypertension in pregnancy. More than 1000 perinatal clinical providers completed education and training aimed at standardizing care of patients experiencing these obstetric emergencies. Standardization included policies, protocols, tools, order sets, medications, education, simulation, measurement, and monitoring. This work will impact over 9000 deliveries across the HealthPartners family of care hospital birth centers. Mental Health Partnership with NAMI Minnesota: HealthPartners has had a mutually beneficial 16- year partnership with the Minnesota chapter of NAMI, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the lives of children and adults with mental illnesses and their families (namimn.org). HealthPartners has continuously been a sponsor of the NAMIWalks since 2007. HealthPartners continues to sponsor and participate in the NAMIWalks annually, on an organization- wide level, helping to raise funds and promote the walk. In 2022, our team was back in person at Minnehaha Park and raised over $18,000 for NAMI. We have collaborated with NAMI on the Make It OK anti -stigma campaign (described below), in which NAMI is a committed and expert organization that has pledged to help change hearts and minds about the misperceptions of mental illnesses by encouraging open conversations and education on mental illness. 253 Make It Ok: Make It OK is a community campaign to reduce stigma by increasing understanding and creating caring conversations about mental illness. Make It OK is celebrating 10 years of progress in helping to stop the stigma of mental illnesses. Launched in collaboration with HealthPartners, Regions Hospital, the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), and other partners, the campaign works through community engagement, trained ambassadors, partners, online resources and more to mobilize and share Make It OK throughout communities. By creating open and caring conversations and helping to change attitudes about mental health and illnesses, Make It OK is increasing understanding and reducing the stigma so those living with a mental illness get the care and support they deserve. Read more in the 10 -year report, linked here. 2022 Make it Ok Highlights: o In 2022, Make It Ok continued to expand reach and engagement: o 209 Ambassadors trained through 17 virtual trainings. o 533 Reached through 32 virtual presentations. o 2,175 Engaged in Make It OK with a full return to community events. o Launched resources to promote mental well -being and resiliency, reduce stigma of substance use disorder, and equip adults to effectively support youth mental health. Science Museum of Minnesota: Since 2018, HealthPartners supported the Sc ience Museum of Minnesota's development of the Mental Health: Mind Matters exhibit. This exhibit was originally developed in Finland but did not use culturally appropriate language or approaches for the United States, as well as did not provide culturally relevant resources. HealthPartners provided important financial support and subject matter expertise and content on resources, including creation of a dedicated resource area for adults and children. This resource area included culturally relevant resources in many languages and included dedicated pieces for perinatal psychiatric disorders as well as African American, recent refugee immigrant, Somali and Latin American communities. https://www.smm.org/t oolkit/mindmatters Nutrition and Fitness PowerUp: The PowerUp initiative makes it easy and fun for everyone to eat better, move more and live healthier lives. We do this important work in partnership with our members, patients, colleagues and communities through programs, tools and resources that support and inspire change. PowerUp has a special focus on kids and families because childhood overweight and obesity tripled in the past 30 years and remains a critical issue for the future of children's health. Research shows that today, kids are expected to live shorter, less healthy lives than their parents for the first time. Research also shows that it takes a multi -level approach, including schools, organizations and the entire community working together to change these trends. 254 In 2022, the PowerUp community health initiative continued to inspire and support kids and families to eat better, move more and feel good, while increasing focus and commitment to equity and the numerous factors that influence health and well -being in children. New resources were created to expand resources focused on 'feeling good\" with ways to relax and recharge, and resources were translated into three additional languages: Spanish, Hmong, and Somali. Community outreach was robust, both virtual and in person, and in 2022, PowerUp reached 64,686+ virtually, through classes, website, and e- newsletters, and 805 kids and families at 50 community events. PowerUp School Challenge: The School Challenge is an innovative program focused on encouraging elementary - aged students to get curious and excited to try fruits and veggies and move their bodies in fun, new ways. In 2022, schools told us it is a priority to help students feel good and recharge their bodies and brains. Therefore, \"feel good\" was added as a key focus alongside \"eat better\" and \"move more,\" helping kids explore the mind- body connection and ways to relax and recharge. The School Challenge pivoted to increase flexibility and adaptability for any learning platform, whether inside a classroom or virtually from home. The challenge offers easy modules with digital tools, resources, and lesson plans, allowing teachers to choose when, where, and how to use them with their class. Teachers can now participate as an individual classroom or as part of an overall school program. This program is provided at no cost to schools or youth organizations. By participating, teachers and youth leaders: o Choose when, where and how to implement the challenge. o Support and encourage students to eat better, move more and feel good. o Earn classroom incentives to further promote student well -being. o Receive fun and engaging PowerUp resources to share with students and families, available in multiple languages o Are guided through the challenge with weekly program communications. o Prioritize student wellness and do what's best for kids! Now going into its tenth year, the classroom -based program includes more than 50 schools and on average, reaches more than 19,000 students throughout the region. As a result of participating in the challenge, 83% of staff and 74% of families reported posit ive changes in the eating habits, observing kids eating more fruits and vegetables. Power Up School Challenge and Health Equity: PowerUp is actively trying to reach and recruit more vulnerable communities to participate in the School Challenge. Using the Center for Disease Control's Social Vulnerability Index, which uses census variables to identify communities that need extra support, we reassessed our recruitment strategy to target socially vulnerable districts and zips codes through partnerships, outreach, and social media ads. 255 With our increased focus on social needs and health equity, PowerUp convened the newly formed Community Health Education Advisory Council at HealthPartners to review and advise on the PowerUp Family Magazine, distributed to kids and families during the School Challenge. The group provided their perspectives and insights, keeping in mind inclusiveness, cultural relevance, health literacy, physical abilities, body sizes, and social needs. Hunger Solutions: Through our partnership with Hunger Solutions Minnesota (a nonprofit organization in Minnesota committed to ending hunger in MN), members/patients who screen positive for food insecurity are referred to the Minnesota Food Helpline. Hunger Solutions also helps screen for other needs the person may have such as housing or transportation. This partnership started as a pilot program with three HealthPartners clinics in 2017 and expanded to the health plan in early 2020. Electronic referral to Hunger Solutions continued to expand through 2022. S uperShelf: HealthPartners and Lakeview Hospital are founding partners of SuperShelf, an innovative project to transform food shelves by offering a positive, grocery store- like experience for members to access healthy and appealing foods. SuperShelf uses behavioral economics to make the healthiest choice the easiest choice while respecting individual preferences. There are now 40 SuperShelf sites across Minnesota who provide a welcoming and dignified experience for community members who are food insecure to access appealing, healthy food. https://www.supershelfmn.org/ Unlockit : A program developed by Cycle Health and now integrated into the YMCA programming, is a map based outdoor scavenger hunt set at a variety of parks. HealthPartners is proud to be a sponsor in 2021 which tested the initial program. Programming expanded in 2022 including 16 parks. Participants may go anytime the park is open. Participants download the map, follow the clues, and unlock letters that, when unscrambled, form a keyword. They then submit that keyword to be entered to win fun prizes. https://www.ymcanorth.org/sites/default/files/Y -A dventure- Lab-UnLockIt -St- Croix.pdf?openyts=1675275840248 Health Equity 1. TPT: Racism Unveiled: HealthPartners is the sponsor of the new Twin Cities P ublic Television production, \"Racism Unveiled.\" The project is a collaboration with community members and leaders that examines the impact of systemic racism on Black, Indigenous and communities of color in Minnesota. https://www.tptoriginals.org/projects/racismunveiled/ 2. Higher Ground Academy: A K-12 grade charter school located in Saint Paul, MN that serves primarily children of East African immigrants from Somalia and Ethiopia. Annually, Higher Ground Academy plans a career fair for their junior and senior high students. HealthPartners has recruited volunteers to participate since 2015. In 2022, six HealthPartners colleagues participated in reaching about 95 students. 256 3. Habitat for Humanity: Stable housing impacts educational achievement and a families' overall health. When HealthPartners and Park Nicollet combined in 2012, our organizations used volunteerism to learn about each other and share our values. According to The Positive Impacts of Affordable Housing on Health A Research Summary , when families pay excessive amounts of their income for housing, often they have insufficient funds remaining to meet other essential needs, including food, medical insurance, and health care. In 2022, HealthPartners sponsored 2 builds. 72 volunteers participated providing 576 volunteer hours. 4. P ride Festival: For 24 years, HealthPartners has participated in the Pride Festival and over 5 years in the parade. In honor of the 50th Year Anniversary of Pride in the Twin Cities, the HealthPartners booth at Pride hosted a polling question and distributed a charity gift of $5000 among three nonprofit charities based on participant's voting percentage. We asked, what is your biggest barrier to care? And we heard the following responses: Cost of care/insurance Finding an LGBTQ+ friendly clinician (17%) Transportation/Locat ion (9%) I do not currently experience any barriers to care (29%) Our charity gift was then distributed to these local nonprofits who support the LGBTQ+ community: Reclaim; Twin Cities Open Arms MN 5. Early Risers Podcast: HealthPartners is a proud ongoing sponsor of this impactful series and collaborates with Little Moments Count, Minnesota Public Radio and Think Small on this important anti -racism and anti -bias parenting and early childhood project. Each season of Early Risers features 6- episodes, released bi -weekly, in a podcast mini -series exploring talking with our youngest children about race and racism. Short, sweet, sometimes funny and always relatable, each episode runs between 20 -30 minutes and helps parents, caretakers and educators tackle this big topic with their little ones. As of December 2022, the Early Risers podcast has been downloaded over 58,000 times, received nearly 175,000 impressions across social media pages, and was ranked 13th in the parenting category for Apple podcasts. Additionally, there have been almost 1,300 community downloads of episode discussion guides. https://www.littlemomentscount.org/earlyriserspodcast 6. Gender Services Navigator: Supported by the Park Nicollet Foundation, Park Nicollet Gender Services Department funds a gender services navigator role to build trust and help patients navigate often complicated care situations across our system. Examples include planning for gender affirmation surgery, connecting to transgender care, self - injection education, care coordination, and legal issues including name and gender marker changes. Since the start of the role in 2019, the Care Navigator has met with over 400 unique patients. 257 7. Saint Paul Public Library Bookmobile: Since 2014, HealthPartners has sponsored the Saint Paul Public Library Bookmobile, which is one of the last urban bookmobiles still in operation. The book mobile visits 45- 50 sites on a regular basis in a two- week cycle reaching about 120,000 people per year. The Bookmobile ensures that the library is accessible to communities that face barriers in using the library's fixed facility due to transportation, cultural, language or other barriers. In addition to a financial contribution, HealthPartners also volunteers helping the bookmobile at local events. The bookmobile continued to operate in 2021 following COVID masking and distancing guidelines. And with additional grants, the bookmobile also expanded their wi -fi services for patrons. This was especially helpful when the fixed libraries were closed. In 2022, the bookmobile served over 1,500 children and families each week! https://sppl.org/bookmobile/ 8. Twin Cities 32nd Annual MLK Holiday Breakfast: We sponsored the breakfast by purchasing steaming links to watch the virtual breakfast and distributed the links for colleagues to watch from their locations. we sponsored one in-person table at this annual event to celebrate Dr. King's legacy of service. In addition to sponsoring the breakfast, we encourage our colleagues to commit acts of service in the community and we provide community resources for colleagues to connect with in honor of Dr. King's legacy. Wellness and Prevention 1. Diabetes and Hypertension outreach: In partnership with our care group, we identified Medicaid members who have diabetes and hypertension and created a program to get home blood pressure monitors out to these members. In total, we sent 3,143 monitors to members on our Medicaid products. The mailing included instructions on how to take a blood pressure reading at home and how to inform your care provider of the results. Our care group continues to work to engage with members whose blood pressure is outside of the recommended range. 2. B reast Cancer GAPS Project: HealthPartners care group participated in the Breast Cancer GAPS project which is focused on reducing disparities for Black breast cancer scree ning. This project heard from community members about why they are reluctant to get screened, then is using principles of community co- design to create solutions for these barriers. The project has created videos emphasizing that \"We Matter\" to encourage women of color to get screened. HealthPartners is working on how we will integrate those videos into our outreach on an ongoing basis. 3. O ther targeted outreach: In partnership with CHW Solutions, HealthPartners implemented targeted outreach to our diverse MSHO membership to encourage them to receive breast cancer screening. As trusted members of the community, CHW Solutions staff were able to reach out to our members to remind them of important cancer screenings. They reached out to members in their native language when possible and utilized interpreters when needed. Languages included in the outreach list included English, Spanish, Hmong, Karen, Oromo, Russian, Romanian, Somali, Swahili, and Vietnamese. Of the 163 members identified, CHW Solutions was able to engage with 83 258 members, for a 51% engagement rate (61% if bad phone numbers are removed from the total). Members widely reported appreciating the outreach. Members who spoke English accepted help scheduling an appointment at a rate of 21% and those who spoke a language other than English accept assistance making an appointment with their clinic 17% of the time. Even for people who do not have a language barrier, engaging with the health care system can be intimidating. The support of a CHW helped to break down barriers to care for these members. In addition to this outreach, our breast cancer screening reminder campaign was translated into Somali, Spanish, and Vietnamese to increase access to this information for more of our members. 4. Keystone Community Services: For over 80 years, Keystone Community Services has been serving Ramsey County with senior care, enrichment for children, basic needs, and crisis assistance. Keystone began as a small neighborhood community center. Today, Keystone reaches more than 40,000 people, and we share many patients and members. Keystone currently operates two food shelves Rice Street Food Shelf and Midway Food Shelf. And when HealthPartners was piloting our SuperShelf initiative, the Rice S treet Food Shelf was a pilot! Our 3- year commitment made in 2022 has been used to support the expansion of their new warehouse and food mobile providing better access to neighborhoods with barriers. Keystone food shelves and food mobile provide quality, healthy food for the community, helping them be self -sufficient, stable, and successful. Express Bike is a social enterprise of Keystone Community Services. Express Bike is a full -service bike shop specializing in refurbished bicycles and a nonprofit youth employment program - all rolled into one!

S piritual Care in Methodist Hospital . Park Nicollet Foundation provides funding to ensure patient services are available in all religious faiths. 7. T he Grove: Park Nicollet Foundation and Methodist Hospital created an intentional outdoor space of healing with trees, paths and sitting places convenient to hospital patients, families and staff to meditate, reflect and promote mental health. 8. H ospice program for veterans: Park Nicollet Foundation provides funding to our hospice programs to provide care and special needs items and supports to veterans in hospice. In 2022, over 436 veterans have been served through this program. 264 9. Diabetes health literacy: Park Nicollet Foundation provided funding for our diabetes program to support the creation of a set of special illustrations for patients with low -vision and or low -literacy, related to diabetes care to use in education and care materials. A set of those tools focus on describing hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia to low -literacy audiences or those who speak English as a second language by using primarily quality illustrations that depict symptoms of both conditions. 10. D iabetes disparities: Park Nicollet Foundation has been providing funding for, and in partnership with the Internal Diabetes Center and the Park Nicollet Brookdale Clinic to conduct a series of targeted patient care programs with research to address/improve outcomes for diabetic patients of color. 11. G eorge Floyd Global Memorial Art & Offerings Exhibit: Methodist Hospital, supported by Park Nicollet Foundation, began planning and partnering with the George Floyd Global Memorial Foundation to bring a 100 -piece exhibit of community expressions to the hospital public spaces during January -March of 2023. Planning began in September 2022 and is expressly designed to promote healing, acceptance, and equity in care. 12. I tasca Project: We continue our work with the Itasca Project. This is an employer -led alliance to address regional issues that affect our future competitiveness and quality of life. A major focus of the Itasca Project is closing the gap on socioeconomic disparities in the region through collective action by businesses. The Itasca Project, a cross -sector alliance of employers, launched the First 1,000 Days initiative to help raise awareness among employers of the lifelong impact of early experiences prenatal to age 3. Our Little Moments Count collaborative helped to create the employee toolkit: https://www.littlemomentscount.org/employer -tool-kit 13. Rondo Neighborhood: HealthPartners is a proud sponsor of the Rondo Commemorative Plaza. In the 1930s, the Rondo neighborhood was a thriving and vibrant community. By the 1950s, about 85% of Saint Paul's African American population lived in the neighborhood. The community bond was strong, local businesses were thriving, and residents were gaining financial stability that comes with home ownership. In the 1960's, however, the neighborhood of Rondo was removed from the map for the construction of Interstate 94. 600 families lost their homes along with numerous businesses and institutions. The Rondo Commemorative Plaza was installed to capture the history of loss endured, lessons learned and the will to reconnect. In 2022, we participated in Rondo Juneteenth festival sharing health education and blood pressure checks. 14. O ne Campaign: The One Campaign is HealthPartners' biggest campaign for internal team member support of our hospitals' foundations and community nonprofits. The campaign was a success and $642,362 was raised supporting patient care and community programs and organizations. 265 Collection and Use of Data on Race, Ethnicity and Language Preferences 1. HealthPartners systematically collects data on race, ethnicity, language and country of origin directly from patients and members in a variety of ways, all of them voluntary. These data collection sources include healthpartners.com, online through our health assessment, and the electronic medical record in our care delivery system and in our dental group. We've found that collecting this information face- to-face from patients at the point of care or health plan contact is an effective data collection method. Across our care delivery system, we have collected race and language information for over 90% of our patients, with language and race collection rates at our hospitals exceeding 97% in 2022. In addition, we receive data from the Minnesot a Department of Human Services, Minnesota Community Measurement, and Minnesota Immunization Information Connection (MIIC) for our members covered by Minnesota Health Care Programs. When we combine all these data sources, we have this information documented for over 97% of our Medicaid members under age 65. 2. We use this data to monitor the quality of care delivered and patient/member experience by race, ethnicity, and language. We also use the data to identify strategies to reduce health disparities in treat ment, outcomes, and service. 3. We include race, ethnicity, and language data on the member registries we make available to network providers so they can identify and address disparities among their patients. 4. Where data is voluntarily available on provider race, ethnicity, language and/or country of origin, we use that data as a resource to respond to patient/member requests. Some of this data is available in the provider directories as well. 5. Hospital equity alignment: Using recently published hospital heal th equity standards from the Minnesota Hospital Association, Joint Commission, and CMS Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program (HIQRP), we set out to document progress towards meeting the standards across all hospitals in our care system, identify gaps, and set clear goals to close these gaps. a. Cross -walked equity standards to understand requirements. i. Key elements across the standards include: ii. Health Equity as a strategic priority and an organizational culture & structure to advance the work. iii. Valid and reliable data collection and the ability to stratify key measures to identify disparities and address health- related social needs. iv. Documented work to address identified disparities and health -related social needs. v. Regular communication to and eng agement of key stakeholders. b. Documented system level work being done to meet standards and shared with all hospitals. 266 c. Set 2023 hospital system equity goals to address identified gaps, building on work already in progress. i. Valid and reliable data collection: 1. Standardize and train on data collection best practices across all hospitals. ii. Addressing patient's social needs: iii. Standardize collection of SDoH data and use of UniteUs to address social needs with a focus on transportation, food, and housing. d. Quality i mprovement work to eliminate disparities: i. Continue work with Premier Perinatal Collaborative. Target improvements in emergency treatment of hypertension. ii. Bring disparity data to the Hospital Quality Steering Committee for prioritization to the appropriat e committee. iii. Continue to build capacity and commitment at the local level. e. Routine communication to stakeholders: i. Annual reporting (minimum of 1x per year): 1. Hospital Board of Directors 2. Patient Family Advisory Committee (PFAC) 3. Medical Executive Committee 4. Patient Care Committee ii. Additional quarterly reporting through: 1. HP Health Equity & Eliminating Disparities Cornerstone 2. Joint meetings of Methodist and Regions HEC 6. Health Equity Accreditation: Starting in 2022, HealthPartners implemented NCQA Health Equity accreditation standards for our Medicaid products. According to NCQA, this accreditation program focuses on the foundation of health equity work and supports health care organizations in evaluating and elevating the health of the populations they serve. Specific focus areas include building an internal culture that supports the organization's external health equity work; collecting data that helps the organization create and offer language services and provider networks that are mindful of individual s' cultural and linguistic needs; identifying opportunities to reduce health inequities and improve care. HealthPartners will formally apply for this accreditation in January 2023. 7. MN Community Measurement (MNCM): A collaborative HealthPartners is part of to improve health by publicly reporting health care information. The 2022 MNCM Health Care Disparities Report includes 8 publicly reported measures. Language Assistance 1. We provide interpreter services in all key languages spoken by patients and have acce ss to over 200 languages through telephone and the use of video remote interpretation. We consistently provide high quality face- to-face (including dedicated staff 267 in high- volume locations), telephone and video remote interpreter services to our patients i n their preferred language for health care. 2. 100% of employed interpreters at HealthPartners have a minimum of 40 hours of professional training. 71% of HealthPartners employed interpreters hold national medical interpreting certification. 3. Updated annuall y, our Language Assistance Plan sets organizational best practices and expectations and is accompanied by the practical Your Guide to Interpreter Services. Your Guide provides answers to questions such as how to access an interpreter and how to talk with patients who wish to rely on family members to interpret. Training is conducted on these tools to support continued improvement in health and experience outcomes. Most recently, it has been further updated to reflect the most current federal government guid ance on notification to members and patients on their right to language services (ACA 1557), updated data to reflect our membership, and updated organization structure information. 4. HealthPartners Interpreter Services leaders meet with all contracted agenci es as needed to ensure they are meeting service standards and to engage them in improvement activities that support the Triple Aim. 5. Vocera units have been activated and dual handset phones are available at our largest hospital to support improved access t o and use of telephonic language services. Several clinic sites also made improvements to their infrastructure and workflow to offer improved telephonic language services, and video remote services are available widely throughout our hospitals and clinics. 6. HealthPartners Interpreter Services facilitates the Interpreter Services Leadership Group, a Minnesota- based group of health care interpreter services leaders who meet to share best practices and work towards common goals related to service delivery, quality improvement, education, and affordability of language access services. 7. Interpreter awareness education continues to be offered in multiple new employee settings as a regular part of the agenda, including provider NEO at HealthPartners, HSC NEW, Regi ons NEO, and New Resident Orientation. HealthPartners member services, sales, case management and other representatives also are trained in how to use telephonic interpreter services. HealthPartners also sponsors several interpreter continuing education wo rkshops each year for both employed and contracted interpreters. In 2022, workshops were offered on (1) building an LGBTQ+ inclusive environment and (2) best practices for health care remote interpreting. 8. HealthPartners interpreters were involved in several activities that benefit our patients, members and community. In 2022, these activities included: Participating in community benefit activities, including: 268 Translating health and financial education materials into Hmong, Spanish, Oromo, Somali and Vietnamese. Providing training to interpreters through two continuing education events. Providing translation and voicemail interpretation services to Diamondhead Clinic, a free school -based program. Making outreach calls to select Somali -speaking patients who are overdue for a mammogram. Providing Spanish interpretation services to patients attending Lactation Caf\u00e9s at several Park Nicollet clinics and Methodist Hospital. Three student interns from Century College were trained by our staff in 2022. Students were also invited to attend our continuing education events. 9. HealthPartners Government Programs provides an annual virtual interpreter training for contracted interpreters. The training topic for 2022 was \"Hospital to Home: Safe Discharge Planning.\" The presenters for the training were Sue Oestreich, RN, BSN/PHN, CCM: Director - Care Florence Okoampa, LGSW, CCM: MSHO/MSC+ Program Advocacy; and Thomas von Sternberg, MD: HealthPartners Associate Medical Director. Participants for the training were eligible to receive 0.15 CEUs through the International Medical Interpreters Association. The training generated good discussions between the participants and presenters. 10. NCQA Health Equity Accreditation: As part of implementing NCQA Health Equity Accreditation standards, HealthPartners deployed surveys to gather information on member and staff experiences with language services. HealthPartners also surveyed network practitioners on providing culturally responsive care; this survey included questions about practitioner comfort and experience with providing language services to members. Based on results from the staff survey, we developed a guide to assist health plan staff process requests for written translations, including decision support tips and a step- by-step guide on working with our written translation vendor. Member -facing departments also identified high -value member- facing documents and completed translation of approximately 38 member -facing documents in 2022. Member experience with language surveys are sent only to Medicaid members, but results are shared with business areas that serve all members so insights can be applied broadly. These surveys assess experience during both health plan and health care encounters at our own care group and beyond. Practitioner cultural responsiveness survey goes to network practitioners that may provide services to members with any form of HealthPartners coverage. In 2022, survey results provided insights into the need to provide more resources to practitioners on providing culturally responsive care, which led to HealthPartners issuing a Health Equity edition of Fast Facts (a newsletter available to all network 269 practitioners). We also collaborated with UCare and Stratis Health to create a website with resources to help providers advance culturally responsive care in their practices. https://culturecareconnection.org/cultural -responsiveness/ . Staff and member survey results are shared with the enterprise Interpreter Services Workgroup who will continue to assess trends and implement changes around our language services on an as needed based on year -over-year data. 11. After -visit summary translation: Our static after -visit summary (AVS) content is now available in both Spanish and Vietnamese. We deployed this functionality in emergency centers across our system effective August 2021 and in the inpatient setting on February 22, 2023. We continue to collect user feedback as we move forward for deployment in other settings in 2023. 12. P atient instructions : Through our partnership with Healthwise, more than 3,600 Patient Instructions are now available in Epic in English and Spanish. These instructions can be added to the after -visit summary/discharge instructions and printed for patients. 13. P atient education: Park Nicollet Foundation funded the production of low -literacy versions of patient education content on recognition and management of high and low blood glucose. We received federal funding to translate a variety of preventive services and disease management patient education documents in multiple languages, including Spanish, Somali, Vietnamese and Hmong. In 2023, we plan to translate our colonoscopy prep content, heart failure and Ramadan- focused nutrition patient education content, among a host of others that we hope will advance health equity. Member Materials & Communications 1. Member materials are created using a consumer -friendly checklist to ensure that communications are understandable, conversational, and consistent. 2. The MSHO summary of benefit is available in Spanish, Hmong and Somali, or other languages as needed, upon request. In addition to the summary of benefits, we can translate most materials upon request and in languages other than Spanish, Hmong, and Somali. We also translate some member outreach for preventive health services into Spanish, Hmong, Somali and Vietnamese. 3. Promotional materials, websites, and blog posts reflect the demographics that exist in the population, making photos racially, ethnically, ability, and age divers e. 4. Custom communications developed for some employer groups have been translated to better serve our Spanish and Somali speaking members. 5. Open enrollment materials for commercial products are available in Spanish and English. 6. HealthPartners Minnesota Health Care Programs and MSHO: The required DHS Language Block (LB) must be included with all member communications and materials. For small -sized materials, a condensed version of the language block is permissible. Additionally, materials that cover the following topics must include the DHS required Civil Rights Complaint Block (CB). 270 Determine eligibility for programs. Require information needed for program eligibility. Inform members that their benefits have been increased, decreased terminated or denied. Include important information about the member's rights and responsibilities. The DHS Civil Rights Complaint Block contains information about member civil rights and how a member can file a complaint if they believe they have been discriminated against. 7. The Minnesota Health Care Programs materials are translated upon request, including the Medicaid/MSHO/SNBC and welcome letter. 8. The MSHO sales cover letter is translated in Spanish, Hmong, Korean, Vietnamese, Russian, and other languages upon request. 9. The Multi -Language Insert (MLI) is a standalone document that must be included with all CMS required materials for Medicare individual and group plans. The MLI is a standar dized notification that informs the reader that interpreter services are available in 15 of the most common non- English languages in the United States. 10. The Affordable Care Act Section 1557 Non- Discrimination Notice and Taglines are provided to all members . This occurs in our annually mandated information mailing in June. 11. Created advertising on local radio stations and/or in diverse community publications for Somali, Hmong, Native American, African American, and Hispanic populations. 12. Development and promot ion of unique supplemental benefits for MSHO members address social determinants of health and support members with chronic conditions, including benefits such as FarmboxRx fresh produce delivery, animatronic support pets, caregiver support, and tablets wi th education and wellness tools. 13. Pregnant members in the Healthy Pregnancy program have access to personalized digital support through the My Pregnancy experience when they log into healthpartners.com. This includes personalized resources based on the pregnant person's race, ethnicity, language and insurance product. For example, D.I.V.A. Moms is surfaced as a resource for Black pregnant members. It is an African American led program designed for pregnant and postpartum Black women. Similarly, members on a Medicaid product receive personalized information about unique benefits such as covered Doula support. 271 Building an Effective Workforce to Support Health Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion 1. Twin Cities Pride Festival and March: 115 colleagues volunteered at the festival and walked in the Pride march that was held in- person for the first time since 2019. HealthPartners donated $5,000 to three LGBTQ+ organizations in the community. 2. C ontinuous updating of the internal Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) website: As a part of the organization- wide effort to migrate two different internal platforms into one, the DE&I internal website is continuously updated with relevant and timely DEI related information. 3. D iversity, Equity and Inclusion Dashboard: Created and shared first ever colleague diversity dashboard that shared the racial experiences of colleagues within the organization and specific organizations. Met with all senior leaders and direct reports to share their dashboard with them. Trained HR colleagues on usage of, creation of, and understanding of data behind demographic data. Leaders utilize the findings in the dashboard to create annual plans and DEI goals. 4. I nclusive Leader Workshop: a 4-part module offered to leaders builds tools to create an inclusive workplace for their teams and the community we serve. Leaders develop skills to have coaching conversations with their teams, learn how to use the equity lens toolkit to bring equity to policies, practices and procedures, and build a DEI strategy for their respective teams. In 2023, we had 14 cohorts complete the training (130 leaders), 50 different applications of the equity framework, and 15 DEI plans created. 5. U nconscious Bias Training: A training offered to all colleagues. This 4- part module deepens our understanding of how unconscious bias can impact others and the work that we do. Colleagues learn to identify bias, mitigate bias and how to move beyond bias to actionable anti -racist results. In 2022, there were 38 facilitated sessions (926 colleagues completed 1 session and 113 completed all 4 sessions). Post surveys show significant increase in understanding and confidence explaining bias to others. 6. LG BTQ+ Training: Revised available training for colleagues on LGBTQ+ using updated language and more inclusive examples in collaboration with the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion department and the LGBTQ+ colleague resource group. 7. C olleague Resource Groups: are voluntary, employee -led groups organized around shared underrepresented identities throughout HealthPartners, such as race, gender, age, sexuality, veteran status, and disabilities. Additionally, groups may be organized around shared interests that affirm diversity and inclusion throughout the organization. They help us serve the diverse and individual needs of patients, members and customers, as well as strengthen respect and inclusion in our workplace. In 2022, we had three active groups: Black and African American, LGBTQ+ and leaders of color resource group. 272 8. Clinician Affinity Groups: similar in nature to colleague resource groups, clinician affinity groups are voluntary, clinician lead groups organized around areas of identities and areas of collective interests. 9. D EI Simulations: In efforts to create an anti -racism workplace, HealthPartners pulled together colleagues from Clinical Simulation, Diversity & Inclusion and Nursing Education to create scenarios rooted in bias, many created off actual colleague experiences, to help others understand how to respond and what to do next in bias situations. 10. Li stening Sessions: HealthPartners offered quarterly listening sessions to our staff with a panel discussion around areas of diversity. In 2022 we held four listening sessions that reflected different dimensions of diversity, including ageism, disability, LGBTQ+ and being a racial ally. 11. G ender Care Coordination: The Gender Services team has been leading efforts to coordinate patient access and consistent, quality care and experience across the organization, which has included collaborating with clinicians and teams across multiple departments and locations who provide gender care to patients. This collaboration has focused on multiple areas of gender care and created standards of care, patient education materials, and clinician trainings and resources to support quality care. 12. C ulture Roots: We have extensive internal communications to build staff understanding and capabilities in cultural humility. The bimonthly \"Culture Roots\" newsletter continues to be an organization -wide educational tool. The Culture Roots subscriber list is currently at 841. Topics for 2022 included addressing breastfeeding disparities, partnering to advance health literacy, eliminating disparities in childhood immunizations, ageism in health care, and improving accessibility to advance health equity. 13. Health Equity Champions: The HealthPartners Health Equity Champions program continued in 2022. The champions are staff members and providers who receive expert training so they can become advocates and serve as local resources for their colleagues in caring for patients from diverse cultures and those with limited English proficiency. a. Nearly 338 Champions were participating by end of 2022; we had 52 new Champions join us this year. b. In addition to producing Culture Roots, the Health Equity Champions team distributed announcements to help increase Champions' awareness of and participation of various health- equity -related events and activities. c. We continue to use our Teams channel to communicate in real time to share insights, news and announcements. Champions opt -in to this dedicated Teams space. Currently, 113 members stay connected through this channel. d. Our 2022 annual event was held virtually in October. The topic was on ageism. Our presenter was Dr. Rajean Moone, Associate Director of Education at the Center for Healthy Aging & Innovation at the University of Minnesota. Dr. Moone's presentation included an age- friendly organization assessment tool that 273 we can use to address ageism in our organization's c ulture, practices and policies. e. The Health Equity Champions program held several additional virtual events in 2022. The presentations were well -attended and generated positive feedback. i. We held four quarterly Teams presentations in 2022 to help Champions stay updated on health equity activities, programs and initiatives happening across our system. Each presentation focused on initiatives cascading up to the \"eliminating disparities\" cornerstone of our organization's equity, inclusion, and anti -racism work. Topics included health equity research updates, the HealthPartners Children's H ealth Council, using our organization's framework for designing for equity, and our Addressing Health Disparities Maintenance of Certification (MOC) project. ii. We held two \"community organization spotlights,\" designed to highlight organizations that had vol unteer opportunities and whose mission aligned with our vision to advance equity and inclusion and eliminate racism. f. Champions continued to have opportunities this year to participate in small -group feedback sessions or pilot trainings to lend a diversity lens to various projects we have happening across the organization. i. Early in 2022, we sent out a survey to Champions asking them about the organizations they volunteer with. This was in partnership with Community Relations. We evaluated the responses to inform how we might proceed with our Volunteer Spotlight presentations done throughout 2022. ii. We sent out an invitation in October for Champions to participate in focus groups to discuss member communication for Indigenous populations. Equity, Diversity a nd Anti -racism website: This is a landing page for our Cabinet and links to our Cornerstone work. The site helps provide structure to our work, easily shares information about that work, resources, and calls out ways colleagues can get engaged. 274 Assessment of Effectiveness We routinely review and analyze race and ethnicity data to identify, test and implement strategies to reduce disparities in treatment outcomes and service. We have found that developing consistent workflows that help caregivers ident ify and offer needed services to all patients \u2014and then customizing those services based on cultural, linguistic, socioeconomic, or other differences, helps reduce health disparities. Our approach is to continually improve our performance. The following are examples of disparity -reduction initiatives that we continued to refine and improve in 2022. Example #1: Mammography Screening Improvement Accountable owner Paula Indehar - Improvement Specialist Member Populations Targeted x Commercial x Medicare Freedom (Cost) x Medicaid x MSHO x HPUPH x WI Marketplace Description In 2007, we identified disparities in mammography screening rates between patients of color and white patients and between government programs patients and other patients . Since then, we have conducted many interventions to continually improve our performance. Interventions included culturally humble scripting on preventive services, same- day mammograms, and telephone outreach to patients of color and government program po pulations of women ages 50 to 75 who were not up- to-date on a mammogram. We implement focused interventions with consultant support at clinics with the greatest opportunities. For 2020, we continued to work across all families of care with an additional f ocus of delivering screening mammograms safely within a pandemic. We have 27 locations with onsite mammography and almost all sites offer 3D technology. We have extended hours at our locations to include weekends and some evenings to accommodate patient needs. Mammo- a Go-Go truck has added two additional HealthPartners sites to their list of locations they travel to. We had to adjust some of our processes for same day mammography to allow for a safer environment for our patients for screenings. Same day mammograms started back up in September of 2020. Breast cancer screening registry outreach was put on hold for a few months but was resumed in October of 2020 and revised the communication we provided sharing the steps we have taken to make it safe to come i n for screenings. In 2021 we began our focus around access, innovation and communication. We partnered with the Health Equity Saint Paul Anchor strategy cornerstone on building trust with our patients and communities. All this to 275 increase screenings and decrease our disparity rates for patients of color and government program patients. We continue to learn about how we can best reach our patients and get them in for the screening tests they need. The goals for mammography screening rates are to increase rates for all women and to decrease the disparity in rates between patients of color and white patients (as well as between government program patients and other -insured patients). For 2023 our focus continues to be on our disparity gaps between p atients of color and white patients as well as our disparity gaps in our commercial payors and government plans. We currently are having staffing challenges which is contributing to our access and availability on weekends and evenings. Our radiology groups have been actively recruiting and working with schools seeking candidates. We are continuing to offer same day and walk in availability at our sites and working towards a 10% increase from the 2022 totals. We are seeing success in our current outreach to our patients when using the channels of a direct email, text, or letter. Goals Our main objective is to close the disparity gaps we are seeing in our women of color vs white women. We will see the impact of this work by seeing a decrease in the gap over the year. We are focusing on women who are 52- 74 years and who have had a mammogram in the last twenty -seven months. We exclude women who have a bilateral mastectomy, are deceased, are frail, are a permanent nursing home resident, orthose that are curr ently enrolled in hospice. As of January 2023, in our care group we have 117,878 eligible women and 81.59% of those women have been screened for breast cancer. Patients of color account for 14.1% of the eligible population at a screening rate of 72.08%. White women account for 84.1% with a screening rate of 83.66%. The remaining 1.7% have an unknown race and are screening at a rate of 58.49%. For our disparity gap between commercial payors and government payors, our care group is at a rate of 65.43%. O ur commercial payor patients are 91.3% of the eligible population and our government programs patients are 8.7% of the eligible population. Initiatives/Interventions This year our initiatives will be focused on recruitment for staffing, offering of the A ddressing Health Disparities MOC using breast cancer screening for a measure clinicians can make improvements on. We worked with the Breast Gap project to produce videos for patients of color on why they matter and what to expect when having a mammogram. W e hope to add these into our clinical reminders campaign. We continue to monitor the clinical reminders campaign and look for ways we can optimize the success of the campaign. At the end of 2022 we had an overall conversion rate of 28.6%, our email convers ion rate was 31.5%, text conversion rate was 12.7% and the U.S. mail conversion rate was 17.8% We are in the process of translating materials and investigating the opportunity to add QR codes to some of our patient education material for breast cancer scr eening. 276 Barrier Analysis Member/patient barriers include cultural perceptions about health and medical care, role of the individual in health and decision making, socioeconomic factors, language, access to care, lack of understanding of the health care s ystem, and limited health literacy. Staff and provider barriers include not understanding cultural beliefs and approaches of patients and members, comfort with using interpreters and translated information, sufficiency of translated information in needed languages, and time to spend on increasing knowledge and using equitable care resources. Organization and system barriers include the many competing priorities that are part of a changing health care system, keeping up with best practices, and keeping care and service affordable. We continue to have residual pandemic barriers which include delay in care due to patient fear of being exposed to COVID/illnesses when in the clinic for mammogram. We also have staffing challenges causing a decrease in access and availability of appointments during the week, especially during evenings and weekends. Gaps in Care Staffing issues have caused us to not be able to offer mammograms in the evening and weekends and contributes to the decrease in capacity of the Mammo A Go Go truck to 65%. Staffing constraints have also limited the number of community events that we can participate in. 277 Opportunities for Improvement: Results/Outcomes Breast Cancer Screening by Race Breast Cancer Screening by Payor 278 Example #2: Colorectal Cancer Screening Improvement Accountable owner Greg Fedio, Clinical Project manager Member Populations Targeted X Commercial X Medicare Freedom (Cost) X Medicaid X MSHO X HPUPH X WI Marketplace Description Our goal is to increase colorectal cancer screening rates in patients to at least 80 percent, while also bringing race and payer rates into alignment with the overall population. To achieve this goal, we have developed a care model process that allows us t o initiate the process easily and effectively, while also taking into account disparities in colorectal screenings and making proactive strides to reduce this gap. Goals Decrease disparity gaps in colorectal cancer screening between patients of color and white patients. Decrease disparity gaps in colorectal cancer screening between patients with government insurance and patients with commercial insurance. Increase understanding of community needs for colorectal cancer screening. Expand projects that focus on closing disparity gaps. Improve colorectal cancer screening outreach and access. Improve processes related to the electronic medical record. Initiatives/Interventions 1. Increasing visibility and stressing the importance of colorectal cancer scr eenings in patients. A health maintenance modifier is added to a patient's record once they reach the age in which they should begin regular screenings. In 2021, this modifier was updated to reflect the changes in colorectal cancer screening recommendations from the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). It is now active for all patients between the ages of 45 and 75. 2. While completing pre- visit planning in the electronic medical record, nursing staff are automatically prompted when a patient is due for a colorectal cancer screening. 3. During the rooming process, our staff use pre- approved scripting to inquire as to whether the patient has had screenings, and to offer education on the importance of colorectal screenings as well as how the process works. 279 4. Other tactics we utilize to increase awareness and education for patients include social media postings and advertising on our waiting room monitors in March for Colon Cancer Awareness Month; letter reminders sent to patients that are due for sc reenings; and by developing education materials in six different languages to reach a broader patient base. 5. Approximately 8,500 Fecal Immunochemical Tests (FIT) were sent to patients that have never been screened for colorectal cancer, along with informati on about the importance of screening. This is a useful tactic in helping increase screening rates while offering patients a non- invasive screening option. 6. Twenty -nine clinicians took part in a 6- month long Maintenance of Certification (MOC) project that focused on closing disparity gaps in colorectal cancer screening rates between white patients and patients of color. The project showed success as all screening rates increased and the cohort of participating clinicians were able to increase their screeni ng rates of patients of color at a higher rate than their screening rates of white patients. 7. While these systems have proven effective, we have an expert panel of senior leaders, doctors and researchers that meets twice a year to review evidence and set goals related to colorectal cancer screening. Additionally, we have a multi -disciplinary team that meets monthly to review data and discuss strategies, to continue our progress without stagnation. Barrier Analysis Often there are misconceptions about the s creening process, and we work to make patients feel comfortable. We demonstrate at -home screening kits, known as FIT (fecal immunochemical test) kits, provide in- room educational materials, and answer questions about colonoscopy and FIT screening options. When the patient agrees to the services, our staff orders the screening. If they do not agree to the screening, the clinician will re- affirm the importance of colorectal screenings. If the FIT test is the screening method chosen, and a patient completes the test, the patient will be automatically mailed a follow up kit in a year. In addition, a letter will be sent to the patient after the kit has been mailed, if they have not returned the kit within 2 weeks. Gaps in Care As a result of the efforts mentioned, colorectal screening percentage for patients of color at HealthPartners Medical Group has gone from 43% in 2009, to 61.7% percent by end of 2022. These rates increased from 2020 to 2021, despite the continued pandemic. This data speaks to the fact that our systems are making an impact on improving the number of screenings. 280 Opportunities for Improvement -Results/Outcomes Colorectal Cancer Screening by Race Definition: All patients: Percent patients who have been screened for colorectal cancer by Colonoscopy in the last 10 years, Flexible Sigmoidoscopy in the last 5 years, and/or Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT) or Fecal Colorectal Screening (FIT) in the last 12 months. Patients of color: Eligible patients of color, African Americans and Native Americans age 46 -75, who have been screened for colorectal cancer by Colonoscopy in the last 10 years, Flex Sig in the last 5 years, or FOBT/FIT in the last 12 months. 69.2%75.2% 43.0%61.7% 0.0%20.0%40.0%60.0%80.0%100.0% 1st Qtr 2009 4th Qtr 2022Patients white Patients of colorGap is 26.2%Gap is 13.5% 281 Example #3: Addressing Health Disparities Maintenance of Certification (MOC) Project Accountable owner Greg Fedio, Clinical Project manager Member Populations Targeted X Commercial X Medicare Freedom (Cost) X Medicaid X MSHO X HPUPH X WI Marketplace Description Maintenance of Certification (MOC) projects have proven to be effective tools to help improve quality metrics while enabling clinicians to meet their ongoing specialty board requirements. In 2021, HealthPartners launched a new MOC project focused on closing health disparity gaps between patients of color and white patients. Goals Define the role bias management, cultural humility, and social determinants of health play in reducing health disparities in personal practice. Analyze and identify health disparities that exist within personal practice. Adopt strategies, tools and resources to close health equity gaps in selected focus areas of practice. Report an increase in health equity by reducing health disparities in selected focus areas. (Asthma, Breast cancer screening, Colorectal canc er screening or Child Immunizations) Initiatives/Interventions Participating clinicians were provided with educational videos to enhance their knowledge and enhance their ability to close health disparity gaps. Video subject matter included: o Information on health disparities and health disparity work at HealthPartners o Social Determinants of HealthPartners o Three modules on bias o Specific information related to their measure of choice (asthma, breast cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening or child im munizations) Participants were provided with lists of eligible patients of color and monthly updates on their metric(s). Based upon the curricula and the patient lists, providers had the freedom to implement interventions of their choice to help close disparity gaps. 282 Barrier Analysis There continues to be substantial barriers to the work to close health disparity gaps. Clinicians brought up well -known existing barriers such as time, resources, and insurance. Clinicians also were able to utilize their learnings from the project to identify other barriers such as systemic racism, language proficiency, their own biases, and social determinants of health. Gaps in Care Clinician feedback suggested that without improvements to social determinants of health, gap closure was difficult to obtain. Through this pilot other opportunities that have been identified are: The importance of learning the patient's story Involving the whole team (rooming staff, care coordinator, medication therapy management) is vital to make progress. Clinician confidence in overcoming barriers to close disparity gaps fluctuates and varies. Opportunities for Improvement -Results/Outcomes Overall, the MOC is a tangible way to connect the dots between equity work and quality. This is evidenced by: Disparity gap closure in breast cancer screening and colorectal cancer screening metrics Clinicians improved their ability to identify barriers and apply resources. Clinicians improved their knowledge of equity and bias related topics. Most clinicians reported making changes to their practice because of the project. Most clinicians feel they can sustain progress. 283 284 Example #4: Immunization Disparities Improvement Accountable owner Alison Salita, Quality and Measurement Member Populations Targeted x Commercial Medicare Freedom (Cost) x Medicaid MSHO HPUPH WI Marketplace Description The primary functions of the Immunization Disparities Workgroup are to (1) increase and maintain vaccination completion rates of childhood immunizations and adolescent immunizations, and (2) reduce disparities in our vaccination completion rates, for race and payor, across all families of care including the HP Health Plan, which include HPMG, Hutchinson, Olivia, Park Nicollet, and t he Valley/Western Wisconsin. Goals Goals are still being determined for 2023. We believe there will be an overall goal for the total population, in addition to a gap closure goal. Interventions for reducing disparities with immunizations include: Coordinat ion of existing work across the organization that is focused on improving vaccination rates. o Continued education on best practice check list for immunizations and well child visits. o Make clinician and staff education available around vaccine hesitancy. o Participation in the MDH Childhood Immunization Workgroup specifically focusing on health disparities in childhood immunizations. o Participation in No Shots No School campaign for the 25th year. o Partnering with the Health Plan on immunization campaigns includi ng Medicaid outreach for overdue well child checks and immunizations. o Translation of immunization materials into top 4 languages. o Partnership with obstetrics on educating mom prenatally about the importance of immunizing infants. Immunization and Well Chil d Outreach Registries o Continue to produce overdue immunization and well child lists for sites to review and do additional outreach. 285 o Clinical reminders team outreach for all ages for overdue well child visits started in September 2022 (email, text). Translations and a 3rd option for outreach happening in 2023. o Clinical reminders for immunizations will happen in 2023. o Participating in the MDH overdue immunization texting program. Maintenance of Certification/CME opportunities: o Offered Addressing Health Disparities MoC - Childhood Immunization Track - did not see the results we had hoped for with regards to closing the disparity gaps in this cohort. o Offered MoC for improvement of overall rates for Combo 10 and Combo 2 vaccines, although there was a slight decline in overall rates during the project, the decreases happened at a much smaller rate than overall clinician population and we saw decreases in 3 out of 4 disparity gaps with the MoC cohort. Barrier Analysis Member and patient barriers may include: Cultural perceptions or misconceptions around vaccines. There can be cultural differences that make it more challenging to complete the course of certain vaccines, such as MMR and HPV. Anti-vaccine movements exist in pockets. In these cases, families are choosing not to vaccinate their children at all. Confusion and myths related to COVID vaccine in children have increased vaccine hesitancy with all childhood immunizations. Anticipation of COVID vaccines for children has led to delaying other routine vaccinations. Access to care. Staff and provider barriers include: Standard rooming is not standard within families of care or across the organization. Consequently, standard rooming audits have revealed that health maintenance alerts are not always being reviewed and/or offered at the appropriate times. Variation can occur in the way providers or staff introduce vaccines to the patient and the family, allowing the family to think certain vaccines are considered \"optional\". For instance, some clinicians may simply be omitting the non- school required vaccines in the discussion. Opportunities for Improvement: Results/Outcomes While we saw a decrease in rates for both childhood and adolescent immunizations in the first half of 2022 (national and statewide trend), because of these efforts we saw our rates start to rebound in August of 2022, and we have continued to increase and maintain those rates throughout the remainder of 2022. We believe this rebound is multifactorial. This is probably the result of children under 2 years catching up on well child visits and immunizations. We 286 continue to have access issues due to staffing which could be contributing to slow rebound. Prevalent and early influenza season in 2022 could explain the higher rate of influenza vaccination in our younger population. We decreased both race and payor gaps over the course of 2022. We surpassed our goal for race in childhood immunizations and made progress in our payor gap to goal as well. Community needs and community partnerships: Minnesota school project, review, learn, expand - work with school districts on vaccine clinics - like Moundsview did for COVID vacci ne, expand to other vaccines as well. \"Catch Up\" clinic opportunities - can we focus on areas where we see the most disparities in outcomes and create pop up clinics to provide vaccine services - resource dependent, may need to partner with the State of County to achieve. Pediatric social work partnership - understanding from those doing the work where the biggest gaps with the community are. Dental partnership around HPV to reduce oropharyngeal cancers. IHI project with Somali community coming in 2023. Improving Immunization outreach Work with the digital products team to shift and expand outreach to clinical reminders team. Immunizations coming in 2023. Encourage sites to utilize the overdue immunization site lists for phone outreach when other methods hav e not worked. Continue MDH partnership for overdue immunization texting. Projects focused on increasing overall rates and decreasing disparity gaps Work to improve and expand \"Addressing Health Disparities\" MOC project for childhood immunizations will be available in 2023. Combo 2 and Combo 10 MoC projects will be available in 2023. Vaccinate children at every opportunity (well child checks, acute visits, urgent care). Continued work with dental partners on HPV vaccination. Leverage best practice check list to increase provider measures. Starting work on Rise to Immunize - adult vaccinations. Improving data and Epic related processes Simplification of HMA with new ACIP recommendations. Simplification of contraindications screening questionnaire in EPIC. Leverage Quick Schedule for efficient and accurate follow -up for delayed or series - based vaccinations. New immunizations analysis will transition to PowerBI in 2023 - will enable us to analyze data in different ways, much more robust than the current HBI highlight. 287 288 289 290 Enhancing Network Responsiveness HealthPartners 2022 Provider/Member Race, Language and Country Survey Health Plan Membership and Physicians by Race Medicaid Product July 2022 membership as of August 15th, 2022 If Department of Human Services data exists for a member, HealthPartners gold standard method of data is used. *Midlands providers excluded.

This information will also appear in directories. Because this is a recent update, there is not any data to report currently. Language Analysis: HealthPartners uses a variety of methods to collect language data from members and providers. Because providers and members provide language information on a voluntary basis, the tables above do not represent 100% of the populations. In general, members are much more likely to provide language information than providers, which is done through their DHS Medicaid enrollment application. Based on the data collected, there is strong alignment between the language needs of our members and the provider's ability to speak the language. The table above lists the top ten languages spoken for both members and providers. o 83.15% of members and 100% of providers speak English.2.60% of members and 21.66% of providers speak Spanish. 302 HE 4B, Factor 2: Analysis of Practitioner Availability to Meet Member Needs for Culturally Appropriate Care Health Plan Members and Network Physicians by Country of Origin - Top 10 responses Medicaid Products July 2022 membership as of August 15th, 2022 COUNTRY MEMBER COUNT % COUNTRY PHYSICIAN COUNT % USA 101,643 45.59% USA 5,628 1,002 0.45 93 Mexico 988 0.44 Korea, South 84 0.390117 Kenya 817 0.37 Nigeria 76 0.352963 Laos 777 0.35 Germany 70 0.325098 Thailand 693 0.31 China 65 0.301876 Burma 668 0.30 Data Collected 121,997 Data Collected 7,615 35.4% Collected 100,968 Data Not Collected 13,905 64.6% Country of Origin Analysis: Country of origin data is collected in the same manner as language data and is subject to the same limitations. As noted above, members are much more likely to provide this information than providers. Based on the data collected, there is strong alignment between the country of origin noted by our members and provider's country of origin. 45.59% of members and 26.13% of providers reported the United States as their country of origin, 303 Race Health Plan Members and Network Physicians by Race - Top 10 responses Medicaid Products July 2022 membership as of August 15th, 2022 RACE MEMBER COUNT % RACE PHYSICIAN COUNT % White 105,305 47.22% White 6,321 29.35% Black or African American 62,768 28.15% Choose not to answer 2,696 12.52% Asian or Pacific Islander 25,600 11.48% Asian or Pacific Islander 415 1.92% Hispanic or Latino 12,840 5.75% Other Race 288 1.33% Other Race 6,195 2.77% Black or African American 253 1.174% American Indian or Alaskan Native 3,891 1.74% Hispanic or Latino 0 0.00% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander 586 0.26% American Indian or Alaskan Native 62 0.28% Choose not to answer 0 0.00% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander 6 0.02% Data Collected 217,185 97.4% Data Collected 10,041 46.6% Collected 5,780 2.6% Data Not Collected 11,491 53.4% ANALYSIS Data is collected in the same manner as language and country of origin data and is subject to the same limitations. As noted above, members are much more likely to provide this information compared to providers. Overall, there is a strong correlation between the race reported by members and providers. 47.22% of members and 29.35% of providers reported their race as white. HE 4B, Factors 1 and 2: Practitioner Cultural Responsiveness Survey HealthPartners conducted a survey of network practitioners to analyze the capacity of our practitioner network to meet the needs of members for culturally appropriate care. The survey was deployed in July 2022. The survey was administered electronically with a link sent to administrative clinic contacts requesting that they distribute it to their providers. Information 304 about the survey, along with a link, was also published in a July 2022 provider newsletter. 78 practitioners responded from the following ty pes of care: Type of Care Percent of Respondents Primary Care 31% Specialty Care 42% Mental health care 15% Other 13% The following questions were answered on a 7 -point scale, with 1 being not at all confident/comfortable and 7 being extremely confident/comfortable. The mean score for each question is displayed in the chart below. Because this is the first year that we deployed this survey, the results will be used as our baseline for future year analysis with a goal to meet or exceed the rates from this initial survey. Question Mean Score How confident are you in your ability to identify opportunities to provide culturally responsive care to your patients? 5.17 How comfortable are you tailoring your communications and recommendations to support patients who come from different cultures? 5.18 How confident are you in your ability to identify barriers to health equity among patients? 5.27 How comfortable are you taking action to address barriers to health equity among patients? 4.94 An additional question was asked regarding familiarity and access to resources. Question I'm aware of resources and have access to them I'm aware of resources but don't have good access to them I'm not aware of any resources Which of the following best describe your familiarity and access to resources to help provide culturally informed care or address barriers to health equity among patient s? 38% 40% 22% 305 62% of providers said they either did not have good access to or were not aware of resources to provide culturally informed care/address barriers to health equity among patients. This response indicates an opportunity to increase provider awareness of and access to these resources. Based on this opportunity, we have identified a goal to increase the percentage of providers who are aware of and have access to resources by 5% in the 2023 survey. The survey also assessed provider experience wi th language services. 94% of respondents reported having worked with an interpreter before and over 90% reported being aware of interpreter services. The following questions were answered on a 7 -point scale, with 1 being not at all confident/comfortable an d 7 being extremely confident/comfortable. The mean score for each question is displayed in the charts below. Question Mean Score Thinking specifically about language assistance services. How confident are you in your ability to identify when a patient could benefit from an interpreter or other language assistance services? 6.10 How comfortable are you using interpreter services with patients? 5.94 ANALYSIS Overall, respondents reported high rates of confidence in identifying opportunities to provide culturally responsive care and comfort tailoring their own communications to support patients. Respondents also indicated high confidence in identifying when patients could benefit from interpreter services. Respondents indicated more confidence in their ability to identify barriers to health equity for patients than their comfort with taking action to address these barriers. Most respondents reported having worked with an interpreter before and reported high comfort with doing so. While the majorit y (78%) of providers are aware of resources to help provide culturally responsive care or address barriers to health equity, 40% report not having good access to them. 22% of respondents reported not having awareness of these resources at all. o Based on these results, the main opportunity identified by the survey is the need to increase provider awareness of and access to resources to support their work with patients. CONCLUSION Availability of Providers Related to Language, Country of Origin and Race: HealthPartners anticipates and meets the linguistic and ethnic needs of our members by gathering language, country of origin and race data from both members and providers. To continually ensure our members have access to the care they need, including provi ders of a certain race or country of origin or providers who speak a certain language, many steps are taken. HealthPartners conducts member satisfaction surveys, reviews member complaints to 306 evaluate patterns and trends regarding access and availability of care and invites members to participate in focus groups to gain insight into what they are looking for when choosing health care. Specifically, we continually monitor language line usage and member complaints regarding access to care or barriers to providers who share a member's language, country of origin or race. There have been no complaints regarding network access based on language, country of origin or race. We believe the strategies HealthPartners has implemented to meet members' needs for a diverse clinician care experience contribute to the low level of complaints. HealthPartners has a robust network. We hold contracts with nearly 100% of the providers in Minnesota and contract with new providers as we become aware of them. The state of Minnesota m andates health care practitioners offer interpreter services upon patient request across all settings of care. We participate in The Exchange, a collaborative of Minnesota health- related organizations, whose members share their translated health materials. The Exchange also disseminates information on issues of literacy, class, culture, race, and spirituality as they affect health disparities. We provide services for members to help them with language assistance including: o FindCare, a searchable online tool where members can search for providers by specialty, gender, and language spoken (other than English) in addition to other search options. Members without online access can receive the same information by calling member services. o Several member services s taff are bilingual and available to assist members in navigating care. If we do not have staff who speak the requested language, we use the Language Line service which translates more than 200 languages. o We have a diverse work force throughout the organization who come from a range of countries and races who speak a variety of languages. o We hold contracts with interpreter services agencies who support all key languages spoken by our members. HealthPartners also works to build a culture that supports the needs of a diverse member population. For example: HealthPartners Equitable Care Champions program is one of multiple strategies in the equitable care initiative to reduce health disparities and improve satisfaction of diverse communities. The champions are s taff members and providers who receive expert training to become advocates and serve as local resources for their colleagues in caring for patients from diverse cultures and those with limited English proficiency. HealthPartners sponsors and is a key partner in Make It. MSP., an initiative to make our region a top performer in attracting and retaining talented professionals. Part of this 307 initiative focuses on recruiting and retaining people of color and connecting professionals of color as they grow and thrive in our community. By supporting a more diverse professional community, HealthPartners strives to meet the needs of our increasingly diverse member population. HE 4B, Factors 3 and 4 - Opportunities and Actions HealthPartners provider's language, race, and country of origin strongly correlate to our members. There were no complaints from members related to lack of access to providers due to language, race, or country of origin. No new opportunities were identified to improve access to providers based on language, race, and country of origin. Therefore, no action was taken to improve our networks. We found that providers are overall less likely to report information about their race, ethnicity, and language than members. An opportunity was identified to increase the volume of providers who share this information with HealthPartners. Action taken: o To encourage contracted groups to give us information about their providers regarding race, ethnicity, and language, in September 2022 we began an incentive program. The program pays a set amount for each provider who provides us with race, ethnicity and language information. We are hopeful this will help us in obtaining more information about our providers. Survey results indicate an opportunity to improve provider awareness of and access to resources to support culturally informed care and/or address barriers to health equity for patients. Actions taken: o Issued a provider newsletter focusing on health equity topics and resources in July 2022. o In collaboration with UCare, a local health plan, we developed a webpage (https://culturecareconnection.org/cultural -responsiveness/ ) that offers cultural and linguistic resources for providers. This was launched September 2022 and providers were notified of this resource via our provider newsletter. 308 HE 6: Reducing Healthcare Disparities Introduction Inequities in the quality of health, health care, and health outcomes experienced by groups based on social, racial, ethnic, economic, and environmental characteristics persist across the United States11. The American Hospital Association (AHA) identified that data collection, stratificati on, and use is essential to developing initiatives to eliminate disparities in health outcomes12. Unless measured, healthcare systems lack awareness of specific disparities in health and healthcare impacting the populations they serve. A 2020 report by Advancing Health Equity notes that to reduce disparities across groups, healthcare organizations must first understand where disparities exist and why 13. HealthPartners takes multiple approaches to identify and address health disparities and ensure we are providing culturally and linguistically appropriate services (CLAS) to members. This report provides a comprehensive review of HealthPartners efforts to identify and reduce healthcare disparities in 2022. It includes quantitative results for data to assess disparities and CLAS (sources listed below), comparison of results to a benchmark or goal, and an interpretation of the results. Data to assess disparities: 1. HEDIS measures of clinical performance 2. CAHPS results Data to monitor and assess culturally and linguistically appropriate services: 3. Utilization of language services for organization functions 4. Survey of individual experience with language services for organization functions and during healthcare encounters 5. Survey of staff experience with language services for organization functions Based on the results of our analysis, HealthPartners has identified opportunities for improvement and selected opportunities to reduce healthcare disparities and improve CLAS. 11 https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/health- disparities - 202020.pdf 309 HE 6B, Factors 1- 3 Monitor 1: Use of HEDIS Data to Assess Disparities by race, ethnicity, language, and gender Methodology During 2021, HealthPartners analyzed the HEDIS measure initiation and engagement of alcohol and other drug abuse or dependence treatment (IET) by race, ethnicity, preferred language, and gender for all Medicaid members. The IET measures assess adults and adolescents 13 years of age and older with a new episode of alcohol or other drug (AOD) dependence who received the following: Initiation of AOD treatment: adolescents and adul ts who initiated treatment through an inpatient AOD admission, outpatient visit, intensive outpatient encounter or partial hospitalization, telehealth, or medication- assisted treatment (MAT) within 14 days of diagnosis. Engagement of AOD treatment: adolesc ents and adults who initiated treatment and had two or more additional AOD services or MAT within 34 days of the initiation visit. In the charts below, the overall numerator/denominator totals for race/ethnicity vary from those for gender as not all subgroups are included in our data when stratified by race due to small denominators (<10). HealthPartners used this measure due to several factors. Nationally, nearly 12 percent of Medicaid members have a substance use diagnosis 14. Research has found racial dis parities in rates of receiving substance use treatment15 and NCQA notes that less than 20% of individuals with substance use disorders receive treatment. Further, a 2020 report16 on drug and alcohol abuse in Minnesota identified multiple data points that highlight the relevance of this clinical measure for our Minnesota Medicaid population: 5.5% of adults in Minnesota met the criteria for having an alcohol use disorder. Men are more likely than women to meet the criteria for an alcohol use disorder as are American Indians compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Those without health insurance were substantially more likely to have an alcohol use disorder (12.9%) than those with health insurance (5.1%). About 5.7% of Minnesota adults needed treatment for alcohol use disorders and about 2.1% needed treatment for drug use disorders. Overall, only 7.4% of those with substance use disorders received treatment. While about twice as many of those with drug use disorders received treatment (13.7%) than did those with alcohol use disorders (6.8%), still more than 9 out of 10 adults with a substance use disorder did not receive any treatment. To analyze data for each subgroup, we used the following benchmark goals: IET Initiation (total) - 41.1% IET Engagement (total) - 16.17% These goals represent the average IET rates for Medicaid products across multiple Minnesota health plans. Results are reviewed in the Medicaid QUI group and brought to the Government Programs Quality and Utilization Committee (G PQUI) on an annual basis. The HealthPartners Quality Council reviews GPQUI meeting minutes quarterly. IET - Race/Ethnicity 2021 IET Initiation 41.1% (600/4431) N Analysis All racial/ethnic groups fell below goal on IET initiation except for \"unknown, which exceeded the regional benchmark by nearly 3 percentage points. The \"other race\" group nearly met goal with a rate of 40.35. The Hispanic/Latino group had the lowest rate at 32.68%. All other groups had similar rates, ranging from 35.65% (Black/African American) to 36.75% (American Indian/Alaskan Native). 311 No groups met goal for IET engagement. The lowest -scoring groups were followed by Hispanic/Latino IET - Preferred Language17 7.69% (1/13) N N/A N/A Analysis Most groups did not meet goal for IET Initiation. All non- English groups had relatively low denominators which can cause considerable variation in rates. Vietnamese was the lowest scoring group (7.69%), while Somali was the highest (57.14%) and the only gr oup to meet goal. However, both groups had low denominators (Vietnamese had a total pool of 13 and Somali had a total pool of 7). English had the second- highest rate of 36.15%. Somali also met goal on IET engagement with a score of 42.86%. All other groups fell below goal, with the lowest being Spanish at12.5%. 17 There were no eligible members on these measures for the following languages: Amharic, Arabic, Hmong, Khmer, Mandarin, Nepali. 312 IET - Gender 2021 IET Initiation Goal: 41.1% Goal N 12.47% (389/3120) N Analysis Neither group met goal on IET initiation or engagement. Males had higher rates than females on both measures and had a higher denominator. Males fell below goal on IET initiation by nearly 3 percentage points, while females fell nearly 8 percentage points below goal. On IET engagement, males only fell about two percentage points below goal while females fell about four percentage points below goal. HE 6B, Factor 4 Monitor 2: Use of CAHPS data to assess disparities Methodology HealthPartners decided to analyze member experience around access to interpreters by race and or ethnicity to assess for any disparities. In 2021, 9.5% of Medicaid members spoke a language other than English. A 2015 report from the Minnesota Department of Health also reported that nearly eleven percent of Minnesotans aged 5 and older speak a language other than English at home. Research shows that high- quality health care interpreter services improve health outcomes for limited English proficiency (LEP) patients 18. HealthPartners analyzed the following CAHPS measure in 2021: \"An interpreter is someone who repeats or signs what one person says in a language used by another person. In the last 6 months, when you needed an interpreter to help you speak with doctors or other health providers, how often did you get one?\" As this is the first year HealthPartners is analyzing this CAHPS measure, we will use the 2021 rates below as benchmark goals for future years. 18 https://www.leg.mn.gov/docs/2015/mandated/150235.pdf 313 Results are reviewed with the Government Programs Quality and Utilization Committee (GPQUI) on an annual basis. The HealthPartners Quality Council reviews GPQUI meeting minutes quarterly. Results 2021 Race/ Ethnicity % Responding Always & Usually (N) % Responding \"I have never needed to use an interpreter\" Analysis Most respondents indicated they have never needed to use an interpreter. White and multi - racial respondents had the highest rates for this response, with 80% and 79% never needing an interpreter, respectively. Hispanic and \"other\" respondents had lower rat es for this response with only 46% and 35% never needing an interpreter, respectively. Of those who did need an interpreter, 43% of Hispanic respondents and 53% of \"other\" respondents said they always or usually get one when needed. Only 8% of White respondents said they always or usually get an interpreter, followed by multi -racial respondents (21%) and Black respondents (27%). There was a significant gap (45 percentage points) between always or usually ratings of the highest (\"other\") and lowest (White) groups. There was a 16- percentage point gap between always or usually ratings of Black respondents and \"other\" respondents. All groups had relatively low ratings of being always or usually able to get an interpreter when needed, with none except \"other\" exceeding 50%. HE 6C, Factor 1 Monitor 3: Utilization of language services for organization functions Methodology Annually, HealthPartners reviews Medicaid member utilization of oral interpreter services through our vendor LanguageLine and internal bilingual Spanish line as well as utilization of written translation services through our vendor TransPerfect. The intern al Spanish line is only 314 available for calls to our Member Services department, while Language Line and TransPerfect are available to all member -facing departments. Utilization data is analyzed against Medicaid member language data to help with identificati on of gaps and/or trends. The utilization data below is based on unique calls. We do not track utilization by individual members. As such, the total calls could include multiple calls from the same member over the year. The NCQA quality team identified a f uture opportunity to enhance the data by completing system enhancements that would allow staff to note in the member record whenever a language service was utilized. Case Management utilization data is only available as an aggregate for all members across all products. We applied the average percentage of Medicaid members engaged in case management programs (Disease Management - 20%, Case Management - 24%, Behavioral Health - 47%) to estimate the total Medicaid member calls using a language service in 2021. Our utilization management (UM) and claims departments do not have any member -facing staff and as a result they are not included in the utilization data below. Results 2021 Medicaid Member Language Data Language Count % of Total Medicaid Membership English 170,172 84% Non-English 19,195 9.5% Unknown 12,803 Total 202,171 100% 2021 Top 5 Non -English Languages Spoken by Medicaid members % of Members 2021 Top 5 Languages on LanguageLine Report % of Total Calls Spanish 2.6% Spanish 34.57% Somali 1.5% Somali Karen 4.27% 315 Language Service Type Total 2021 Calls with Medicaid Members % of 2021 Calls Using Language Service (N) Bilingual Staff - Member Services 126,235 calls >1% (64) LanguageLine - Case Management 29,348 calls 10% (2988) See note above regarding data limitations LanguageLine - Member Services 126,235 calls 1.1% (1379) 3% (5114) 2021 TransPerfect Written Translation Utilization Translation Language Count English > Spanish 6 English > Hmong 4 English > Somali 3 English > Korean 1 English > Russian 1 English > Vietnamese 1 Total 16 Analysis In 2021, 9.5% of Medicaid members spoke a language other than English. There were 5114 Medicaid member calls using language services in member services, case management, and Ridecare, which represents about 3% of total calls across these departments. Just over one percent of all Riverview Member Services calls used LanguageLine and less than one percent used bilingual staff. Nearly six percent of Ridecare calls and ten percent of case management calls used LanguageLine. There were only 16 written translati ons completed across all member -facing health plan departments in 2021. The percentage of total calls utilizing language services in 2021 (3%) is below the total percentage of Medicaid members who speak a language other than English (9.5%). The top 4 languages utilized via LanguageLine and the bilingual staff line align with the top 4 languages spoken by our Medicaid membership. Karen was the fifth- highest language utilized, while Oromo is the fifth- highest language spoken by Medicaid members in 2021. In 2021, 0.1% of 316 HealthPartners Medicaid members spoke Karen. It is important to note that language was unknown for 6.2% of Medicaid members in 2021, which can impact top language ratings. All in all, we have adequate capacity to support members who do not spe ak English and our language service utilization aligns with languages spoken by our members. The proportion of calls using language services are generally in line with the rate of members who speak a language other than English. Case management does appear to have a higher language service utilization than other departments (10%), but as noted above, the number of calls had to be estimated due to system limitations and thus it is difficult to draw conclusions about trends. The relatively low rate of languag e service utilization (ranging from 1% to 10%) compared to the number of Medicaid members who speak a language other than English (9.5% or 19,195 total members) does raise questions about whether non- English speaking members are aware of available telephonic language services and whether additional communication/education is needed to encourage all members to contact HealthPartners as needed. HE 6C, Factors 2 & 4 Monitor 4: Individual experience with language services for organization functions and during health care encounters (2 surveys) Methodology Annually, HealthPartners conducts two member surveys to evaluate members' experience with language services at both the health plan and care delivery levels. The HealthPartners Center for Evaluation and Survey Research uses member lists provided by health informatics (described below), sends written surveys and performs follow up phone calls (using either a bilingual staff or a LanguageLine interpreter) to orally offer the survey to identified members. Both surveys are deployed at the same time. This year, surveys were mailed to members on August 3, 2022. Mailed materials included an English and translated version of the survey. Phone follow -ups began on August 18, 2022, and the survey closed on September 3, 2022. Members are identified by health informatics based on the following details: Survey 1, Health Plan: Medicaid members who have been in contact with a member -facing staff within the past month and speak one of our top three languages of Spanish, Somali, and Vietnamese. These members were surveyed regarding our plan language services. Survey 2, Health Care Encounter: Medicaid members who have had a health care encounter with any provider within the past month and speak one of our top three languages of Spanish, Somali, and Vietnamese. These members were surveyed about their experience during their health care encounter. The health plan experience survey results are broken down by language assistance used, member language and language of survey completion. The health care encounter experience 317 survey is broken down by language assistance used, in- person vs. virtual, patient language, and language of survey completion. Survey results are shared with the project work group and NCQA Health Equity Accreditation Steering Committee for review and discussion.

More respondents spoke Spanish (44%) than Somali or Vietnamese (28% each). A large majority of respondents used some type of language service (75%); none of the respondents used a family or friend to translate. 25% of respondents did not receive any language assistance during their call. Overall, respondents indicated that the language assistance provided was easy to use, with 76% indicating assistance was very easy to use. Respondents also indicated that language assistance was overall very helpful (90%). Just over half of health plan survey respondents said they always rec eive language assistance when they need it, while 9% said never. Neither response met goal which indicates an opportunity to explore barriers to health plan members being offered language assistance services during their calls with the health plan. Another opportunity indicated by health plan survey responses, is regarding translated materials. 38% of respondents said they have not received translated materials (goal is not to exceed 35%). Of those that have received written translations, most (48%) report being very satisfied with them. Increasing staff awareness of how to access and request written translations of member materials was selected as an intervention to improve culturally and linguistically appropriate services and is described later in this r eport. 320 Survey 2 - Individual experience with language services during a health care encounter Table 1: Total Respondents Total Respondents Response Rate 62 32% Table 2: Patient Language Patient Language Percentage (n) Spanish 32% (20) Somali 34% (21) Vietnamese 34% (21) Table 3: Survey Completion Language Survey Language Percentage (n) English 31% (19) Non-English 69% (43) Table 4: Utilization During your most recent visit to a clinic or hospital for your own care, which language assistance did you receive?

(n=53) Analysis - Individual experience with language services during a health care encounter The majority (69%) of patient survey respondents completed the survey in a non- English language. Respondent languages were evenly distributed across Spanish (32%), Somal i (34%), and Vietnamese (34%). A large majority of respondents used interpreter services (82%);5% used a family or friend to translate and 8% of respondents did not receive any language assistance on their recent call. Overall, respondents indicated that t he language assistance provided was very easy to use (85%), which exceeds goal by 10 percent. Respondents also indicated that language assistance was overall very helpful (95%) which exceeds goal by 5 percent. Two- thirds of patient respondents say they alw ays receive language assistance when they need it and only 3% say never; both responses met goal. 60% of patients received language assistance in person, while 40% received assistance via video or phone. Patient respondents report higher rates of receiving written translations than health plan respondents and higher satisfaction with materials (57% very satisfied vs. 48% very satisfied for health plan respondents). Overall ratings of language assistance ease, helpfulness and availability were higher for patient respondents than for health plan respondents, reinforcing the opportunities identified in the analysis of the health plan survey. 323 HE 6C, Factor 3 Monitor 5: Staff experience with language services for organization functions Annually, HealthPartner s conducts a survey of member -facing staff to evaluate the following: (1) staff understanding of how to access language services, (2) staff ability to access language services when needed, and (3) when staff can access relevant language services, how satis fied they are with them. Methodology The electronic survey link is distributed to managers of member -facing departments 19 (see table below); managers are asked to distribute to staff and send a reminder one week before the survey closes.

Staff overall report high rates of ease of use with only 3 percent indicating it is not easy. 38 percent of respondents said they were extremely satisfied with LanguageLine, which fell below goal of 40%. Some staff reported difficulty getting an interpreter for some languages, including Oromo, Somali, Karen, and Tigrinya. The least frequently accessed language service is written translation through TransPerfect. Only 3 percent of respondents used this service. Of those who had used TransPerfect, the majority (78 percent) say they are always able to access translated materials when needed, which exceeds the goal of 75%. Satisfaction rates are similar to the LanguageLine, with 33 percent of respondents being extremely satisfied. 15 percent of respondents had experience with assistance from a bilingual staff member. Of these respondents, two- thirds received help from a staff member other than themselves. Spanish is t he most common language spoken by bilingual staff members, followed by Somali and Hmong. Access rates for this service were lower than for LanguageLine and TransPerfect, with only 18% of respondents saying they could always access a bilingual staff member. Satisfaction rates for this service were similar, with 32 percent of respondents being extremely satisfied. No language service met the \"extremely satisfied\" goal of 40%. A key finding of this survey is the low utilization rate of our written translation vendor TransPerfect. Only 3 percent of respondents had used TransPerfect. Of these respondents, ease and satisfaction rates were high. This is a positive finding and indicates that this service is useful, but the low utilization rate indicates staff are unaware of how to access it. Increasing staff awareness and use of how to work with TransPerfect was identified as an intervention to improve culturally and linguistically appropriate services and is described later in this report. We have identified a goal to increase staff utilization of TransPerfect by 50% at next survey (4.5%). Another key finding is in accessing bilingual staff; only 18% of staff say they are always able to access assistance from a bilingual staff member. These results indicate there may be opportunities to further explore the process for accessing bilingual staff and their availability. HE 6D, Factors 1- 2 Opportunities HealthPartners utilized the data described in the monitors above, as well as collaboration with departments across the enterprise, to identify opportunities to reduce healthcare disparities and improve culturally and linguistically appropriate services (CLAS). The HealthPartners quality team deployed a staff survey to identify opportunities to reduce healthcare disparities and improve culturally and linguistically appropriate services. This survey was sent to the following departments in October 2021. We received 8 responses which are reflected in the opportunities table below. Department Government Programs 327 Health Informatics Marketing E-Commerce Provider Relations Network Management Riverview Member Services Quality Improvement and Compliance Worksite Health and Population Wellbeing Improvement & Integration Comprehensive C are Advocacy Pharmacy Administration Medical Director In 2022, we instituted a health equity policy evaluation to our annual policy review process which generated additional opportunities. As described in the methodologies above, all data results are reviewed and analyzed by groups of key stakeholders. These groups participate in barrier analysis and opportunity identification. The HealthPartners quality team compiled and assessed all ident ified opportunities. We used the factors below to prioritize and make recommendations for interventions to reduce health care disparities and improve CLAS: 1. Evidence of disparities and/or CLAS service gaps observed in data (i.e., HEDIS, CAHPS, surveys) 2. Lack of strong interventions designed to improve performance. 3. Resources available to implement needed improvements. 4. Strong alignment with key organizational priorities to support our members. The opportunities selected for intervention were then presented to the NCQA Health Equity Implementation Steering Committee for endorsement. Any opportunities not selected for intervention this year are being tracked and monitored for possible intervention in the future. Topic Barrier Opportunity Selected for Intervention? Priority Language services The staff survey revealed that only 9 out of 375 member facing staff responded to the question; \"How often are you able to have written materials translated through TransPerfect when you need them?\" Response rates were low because staff had not utilized written translation services. Increase staff awareness of written translation services Yes. This intervention was selected to improve CLAS (HE 6D, Factor 4). High 328 Topic Barrier Opportunity Selected for Intervention? Priority Healthcare disparities Native American population has the greatest rate of disparity on HEDIS prenatal and postpartum care measure. Increase the rate of post-partum appointments for the Medicaid Native American population. Yes. This intervention was selected to reduce a healthcare disparity (HE 6D, Factor 3). High Member Communications Many existing member communications across departments (i.e., CCA, CEM) are only available in English. Translate high - priority member communications into languages spoken by HealthPartners member population. Yes High Healthcare Access HealthPartners data show s increased percentages of members in rural areas have highest inpatient utilization and readmissions. There is a known lack of providers in rural areas (i.e., 2- 3% of oncologists practice in rural areas while 20% of oncology care patients live in rural areas). Mobile healthcare options in rural or urban areas where healthcare is not easily accessible.

Plan administration The plan is beginning to evaluate their polices through an equity lens, however a significant majority of policy owners and reviewers are white women. With a gap in diverse experiences and perspectives reviewing the policies there is a higher likelihood of missing an improvement opportunity. Increase the participation of diverse staff within the healthcare and medical management annual policy reviews. TBD Medium Culturally responsive training for staff Member -facing areas across the plan do not have a consistent training resource for working with members who are LGBTQ+ and/or gender diverse. Not all areas provide training to staff on working with these members. This can lead to members having different experiences with different areas. Staff may also not be aware of best practices on supporting these members. Create a centralized health plan resource guide for supporting members who are LGBTQ+ and/or gender diverse.

Yes High 335 HE 6D, Factor 3 Intervention 1: Address a Disparity Overview HealthPartners NCQA Health Equity Core Team staff completed an S -B-A-R process to identify and select an initiative to address a disparity. This process identified that Indigenous populations had the l argest gaps across multiple HEDIS measures compared to Whites and other groups, particularly prenatal and postpartum care. Additionally, HealthPartners saw a decrease in prenatal and postpartum care rates across all racial and ethnic groups. HealthPartners chose to align our selected intervention with the broader health plan and care group equity initiative around child and maternal health, which also supports the disparities seen in our HEDIS data. Given the significant disparity in prenatal and postpartum care rates for the Medicaid Indigenous population, we identified a goal to increase the rate of post -partum appointments for this group and to close the gap by at least 5%. For this intervention, we have chosen to compare HEDIS PPC performance for Indigenous women against the aggregate rate because the White population does not have the highest level of performance on this measure. The following actions are being taken to achieve this goal: 1. Partner with Division of Indian Work (DIW) to obtain certification of doula curriculum specific to the Native American population and obtain Medicaid reimbursement. DIW offers the Ninde (My Heart) Doula program to Indigenous women in the Twin Cities community. Some of the doulas are certified by a mainstream doula program, but DIW would like to utilize a traditional Native curriculum called Zaagi'idiwin. This curriculum is not currently approved by the state for doulas who can bill Medicaid. HealthPartners is working with DIW and other community groups to expand the roster of doula curriculums to include additional culturally specific doula training, including Zaagi'idiwin. 2. Offer culturally relevant resources as part of the My Pregnancy platform. When HealthPartners has race and language information on members who access the My Pregnancy online prenatal education platform, relevant culturally specific information is presented to them as additional resources. 3. Develop a video highlighting the support that doulas provide. In Minnesota, doulas are a covered benefit for Medicaid members. Most people are not familiar with doulas and how support from a doula could benefit them. HealthPartners is creating a video in 2022 explaining what a doula is, the types of support they provide, the benefits seen and how to access a doula, if desired. This will be member -focused but will also be shared with our network providers to educate them as well. 4. Update healthy pregnancy outreach algorithms to target Native American members who are pregnant regardless of risk profile. When HealthPartners identifies a member as pregnant, we send a letter inviting them to access our pregnancy program and online resources. If a member is identi fied as high risk, an outreach specialist reaches out to 336 the member by phone to do a screening and determine if they are eligible for one- on-one nurse support. For Indigenous women, rather than having that outreach done by a paraprofessional, an RN reaches out directly to better engage the member and provide more streamlined access to our programs.

Q3 2023 Forthcoming HE 6D, Factor 4 Intervention 2: Improve CLAS Overview HealthPartners NCQA core team interviewed member -facing departments on their current practices for obtaining written translations of materials for members. The results of these interviews, combined with feedback on the staff language survey (monitor 5), and the written translation utilization report (monitor 3), showed that HealthPartners is inconsistently and underutilizing this service. Additionally, many member -facing departments and staff are not aware of our vendor TransPerfect or how to obtain written translations. 338 We identified an opportunity to increase staff awareness of the process for requesting written translations as this is an important aspect of delivering culturally and linguistically appropriate services for our members . Our goal is to increase the number and percentage of staff who request written translation services by 50% as evidenced by data from the annual staff experience with language services survey. The following actions are being taken to achieve this goal: 1. Interview departmental leaders for awareness of HealthPartners designated translation vendor 2. Develop a work aid that describes how to access written translation services and distribute to staff; this work aid was developed with input from departmental leaders as well as our interpreter services team. 3. Re-survey staff to assess the impact of work ai d on awareness. 4. Annually evaluate TransPerfect utilization for the health plan Additionally, we are collaborating with member -facing departments to identify documents that offer high value for members to translate into some of our top languages so that mor e member materials are already available as written translations.

Q3 2023 Forthcoming 341 Affordability Affordability Initiativ es Description HealthPartners Triple Aim affordability approach is built on a strong foundation of activities designed to reduce overuse and misuse of resources and to improve the value of services provided to our members. We systematically identify new opportunities and enhance our programs to capture cost savings. In 2022, we identified 37 different affordability strategies encompassing administration, health and care engagement, products and benefits, pharmacy and provider relations. At the end of the year, 25 of these strategies were on track to meet their affordability targets and progress was made on an additional 8 strategies. Goal In 2022, we established an affordability target based upon a projection of the upcoming year's claims to reduce the expec ted Total Cost of Care (TCOC) by 1 - 2 percent and we were able to achieve a projecting savings of 2.21%. Initiatives/Interventions The Affordability Council meets bi -monthly to accelerate activities to achieve our affordability goals using the framework below: 1. Establish organization- wide affordability goals and measures 2. Generate potential affordability ideas and concepts in partnership with other functions in the organization 3. Ensure the number and scope of affordability initiatives are sufficiently broad to inform decisions on resource allocations to support affordability 4. Evaluate and select affordability drivers with the highest potential cost reduction impacts 5. Lead priority setting and allocate resources to support success 6. Track progress on affordability initiatives across the enterprise 7. Leverage enterprise collaboration in achieving these affordability goals 8. Link the work of this council to other affordability initiatives and work streams across the organization Affordability Initiative Identification Process HealthPartners has developed a multi -disciplinary affordability council and trend management team to systematically identify short and long -term opportunit ies and implement strategies for claims cost savings. Each year, this team develops an annual plan that outlines new claims trend management focus areas. Concurrently, they continually identify and evaluate new opportunities. The team has implemented a \"Phase Gate\" approach, which incorporates SBARs (scope and situation, potential claims cost savings opportunity, and potential strategy options) to assure an efficient process to support execution of ideas to generate intended results. Initiatives are closely monitored, including ongoing barrier analysis. Initiative leads create an overall timeline for each phase through feasibility and monitor progress to the timeline. 342 Examples of key affordability focus areas include: Health plan administration - through the implementation of claims system enhancements including out -of-network claims management Pharmacy program - through improvements in pharmacy rebates, supporting appropriate site of care for injectable medications and targeting to better manage specialty pharmaceuticals. Health and Care Engagement initiatives - focus on supporting provider collaboration, member activation, improving systems of quality, effectiveness, and safety Products and benefits - implement value- based network design, infertility benefit redesign, implement \"paperless\" products and digital condition management solutions. Gaps in Care The Health and Care Engagement division, which administers many of our population management programs, has developed a systematic process for affordabilit y ideation. Quarterly updates are provided based on competitor analysis, purchasers, and consultants, contracted vendors, trend management, leader insights from conferences and CMS webinars. We also monitor, review, and compile national best practices wor k to ensure a shared understanding of innovative work that is occurring across the country. Results/Outcomes HealthPartners successfully identified and implemented new affordability strategies in 2022. We exceeded the 2022 savings goal by realizing nearly $84 million in saving. Examples of achieved results reflect a strong focus on population health management and include the following: Understanding and addressing social determinants of health at the individual level and addressing home and workplace envi ronmental factors. Ongoing initiatives include: o Contracting with CHW Solutions to provide community health worker services to our members at a sustainable rate o Implementing, Now Pow a third party managed and updated community resource directory that will enable member facing teams to make referrals with higher likelihood of member follow -through, replacing less robust in- house maintained directory o Reducing clinical quality disparities - key measures include Antidepressant Medication Continuation and Follow -up after MI admission Member engagement and activation These initiatives create value for both purchasers and members by: Reducing readmission rates result in lower total costs and a faster return to work for employees. Gap in care closure translates to better employee/dependent outcomes potentially preventing future complications and resulting in higher rates of productivity. Increased health and well -being engagement results in improved productivity and lower costs for employers. 343 Providing alternative channels and/or access to best -in-class solutions to support employee health goals contributes to a competitive and appealing benefit set and employee retention. Initiatives to reduce readmission rates include: Comprehensive Care Advocacy prov ides members with holistic support and supports care transitions through integrated access to the care group's EMR system Implementing targeted outreach to high -risk members Reimplementing in -person complex care navigation support for high risk member transitions Initiatives to improve member health and well -being Living Well programs include: App enhancements including engagement reminders and program completion reminders Proactive communication to Medicaid members with triggering behaviors (i.e. no PCP , ER visit,) MyStrength Implementation to support members dealing with behavioral health concerns Support digital channels for engagement in comprehensive care advocacy services: Better engage members in condition support by connecting members to available online resources for condition management and network navigation, and to close targeted gaps in care (aligned with HEDIS) in Core DM programs. Launch Omada condition management program Redesign the Healthy Pregnancy program to enhance member engagement and support. Improve management of high cost cases by enhancing our ability to support members in their cancer journey through the OncoHealth pilot partnership (Iris Oncology) and through our evolving partnership with our internal pharmacy admin team 344 Medical Coverage Policy Development Description Medical Coverage Policy develops written coverage criteria to provide consistent information, clinical criteria, and interpretation of coverage. These criteria serve as the basis for authorization decisions to determine the medical necessity and clinical appropriateness of certain medical procedures, behavioral health services, pharmaceuticals, devices, and other benefits, including items on the prior authorization list. New and emerging technologies are also evaluated for appropriateness and effectiveness. Goal Promote best care, affordability and experience while reducing overuse and misuse of health care services. Ensure members have equitable access to care that is safe, effective and has been proven to have a positive effect on health outcomes. Ensure coverage policies support integrity of coverage and authorization program decisions, including aligning with the most current reliable scientific evidence and consideration of scientific advances, expert opinion, or changes in current standards of medical practice. Initiatives/Interventions Implement strategies to support best care, affordability, and experience: 1. Routine monitoring of literature and horizon scanning is performed to identify new or updated evidence on key topics. 2. The New Technology Committee assesses new technologies to determine if they are investigational/experimental and forwards their consensus recommendation to the Medical Director Committee or its policy development subgroup for coverage consideration and to applicable business units (e.g., Provider Relations and Network Management or prior authorization program) for strategy development. 3. New or revised policies are approved by the Medical Director Committee and brought to the coding committee for implementation and alignment of claims edits. This includes incorporating analysis of new technology and new applications of existing technologies. 4. Implementation of coverage policies in collaboration with medical directors, quality and utilization improvement, contracting, claims, member services, product, and benefits with a specific focus on alignment with coding and claims payment. 5. Focus on strategic topics such as orthopedic (spine, hips, knees), site of service, genetic testing/genetic therapies, mental health parity and investigational services. 6. Collaboration with a contracted vendor to provide us with market analytics consultation for genetic testing. Routinely conduct comprehensive analyses of claims data to provide 345 us with current actionable opportunities in medical coverage policy, reimbursement, payment integrity, and laboratory contracting. 7. Collaboration with the Provider Relations and Net work Management department related to genetic testing laboratory contracts to ensure cost -effective and consistent pricing for covered tests. We work to identify opportunities for enhancement of our contracted network through developing new relationships w ith select high- value laboratory partners. This contracted network allows us greater control over our resources, while providing access to the genetic tests our members and patients need. 8. Annual or periodic review is performed on all coverage policies. Barrier Analysis 1. Rapidly emerging new technologies and FDA approvals. 2. Genetic testing rapid pace of new tests, growth of large scale/panel tests, limited clinical evidence, coding and payment challenges. 3. Absence of sufficient evidence on some topics to mak e an adequate determination. 4. Absence of sound and/or varying understanding of codes and inconsistent and variable coding practices among providers (e.g., genetic testing). 5. Managing the interaction and interpretation of coverage for multiple product lines concurrently. 6. Multiple competing priorities of policy development to meet requirements for new technologies, Medicare and Medicaid policies, revision of policies, affordability topics and changes to policies to better support prior authorization programs. 7. Complexity of managing multiple communication channels to ensure consistent messaging regarding complex coverage policies and criteria. 8. Payment liability for non- covered claims (provider versus member). Typically, unless the coverage policy requires prior authorization or is investigational/experimental, the claim is denied to member liability, resulting in a dissatisfying member experience. Opportunities for improvement: 1. Routinely assess for and implement policy development process redesign to be maximall y efficient, credible, and scalable. 2. Facilitate improvement of the claims edit implementation process to ensure accurate edits that support current coverage policy determinations and align with policy effective dates. 3. Ensure accurate and consistent billing practices for genetic and molecular testing services. 346 4. Identifying opportunities to enter into contract agreements with additional specialized genetics laboratories to ensure alignment with market rates and a diverse and comprehensive portfolio of laborat ory partners to serve our patients and members. 5. Continuously maintaining medical coverage policies and developing medical management strategies to ensure we are covering evidence- based applications. 6. Ongoing assessment of system needs for accurate and effic ient coverage policy implementation. 7. Identify opportunities to address complexity of verbiage within key medical coverage policies. 8. Continuous focus on new and emerging technologies and changes in medical practice to ensure accurate coverage policy positions and attention to affordability opportunities. Results/Outcomes New Technology Committee: 1. The committee continues to improve the timing of topics moving through the committee so that they can be appropriately addressed via policy and/or the clai ms process, thus ensuring correct medical management and claims payment/non- payment. This is evidenced by the number of topics which have been added to either the Investigational Services -List of Non- Covered Services policy, another existing policy, or closed for review. 2. In 2022, the New Technology Committee reviewed topics originating from a wide scope of sources including horizon scanning, local providers, and HP internal departments. A total of 79 topics were reviewed: This included three new topics, two watch list items and 74 items on the Investigational Services -List of Non- Covered Services policy. Of these, three topics were added to the Investigative List of Non- Covered Services policy. The horizon scanning process has allowed the committee to be more proactive in terms of identifying and evaluating new technology. No topics were moved forward to the Medical Director's Committee this year for policy development. 3. The committee maintained its process efficiencies via use of the Fast Track evaluation and voting process to reach consensus without the need for a formal meeting when indicated. This helps support stewardship and green initiatives by conducting paperless or electronic meetings. 4. The c ommittee continues to prioritize topics for which there remains current, evolving literature. 5. New Technology Committee utilizes a dedicated email address to help streamline communication with the New Technology Committee. Both internal and external custo mers can use this address to submit questions regarding a specific new technology topic. 347 Coverage Policy: 1. A total of 21 new clinical coverage criteria policies were developed including two new genetic testing policies, surgical treatments for lipedema and lymphedema, hip and knee surgeries and several policies that support differences in Medicaid and Medicare coverage. 2. Ongoing evaluation of policies to determine the relevance to current standard of care, evidence, cost, and claims history, resulted in thr ee policies being retired. Content found in other policies was transitioned to benefit coverage documents to provide clearer connections in member materials. 3. Annual review was performed on 393 coverage policies resulting in revising coverage criteria for 85 policies. 4. Continued partnership with sales to develop coverage specific needs of employer groups such as gender confirmation surgery and infertility and fertility services. 5. Implemented claims strategies to ensure accurate claims processing and payment to align with coverage criteria, maintaining clinical appropriateness and cost effectiveness. 6. Continued partnerships with behavioral health, pharmacy, and utilization management to ensure we align workflows for coverage criteria that intersects multiple areas. 7. Addressed complexity of verbiage within all coverage policies by adding clear language in common terms within the list of definitions. 8. Partnered with Contracts and Benefits to deliver content within benefit contracts that aligns with coverage policy. 9. Continued partnership with Provider and Network management to optimize the contracted network of genetic testing laboratories and continued contract relationship with a claims data analysis vendor to identify trends in claims data and opportunities f or strengthening coverage criteria and payment strategies. 348 Provider Support Practitioner Credentialing Description HealthPartners reviews and evaluates the qualifications of licensed independent practitioners to help assure that care and services are provided to enrollees by competent professional staff . 2019 2020 2021 2022 processed 3126 2825 3233 3618* Percent 38% 29% 32% 99.8% 100% N/A N/A 98.7% 100% Average turn days 39 39 32 34 N/A Recredentialing Applications (all practitioner types) Number processed 6527 100% *Record number of applications goals as of 2022 because of timely credentialing law Previous goal was 30 days from receipt of a clean application. New goal is 45 days from receipt of a complete/clean application or 75 days from receipt of a complete/issue application. 349 Network Initiatives Provider Engagement Description HealthPartners mission is to improve health and well -being in partnership with our members, patients, and community. We work to promote team -based care to achieve best patient outcomes, build systematic links to providers and support best practices within our contracted network partne rs. Goals Our goal is to engage, empower and partner with providers to achieve the best health for our members and to transform care delivery to achieve best care. experience outcomes, and affordable value to our members. Our objectives: o To drive improvement in healthcare quality within care delivery systems and maximize participation of all providers over time. o To take a strategic approach working with network clinics to improve quality measures mutually beneficial for both HealthPartners and our provider partners. o To give priority to topics that, because of their prevalence or severity, have potential for significant impact on our population and are amenable to improvement through focused action. o To assess provider satisfaction with the health plan through periodic satisfaction surveys and feedback from health plan providers. Initiatives/Interventions 1. HealthPartners Network & Quality Contracted Provider Workgroup collaborates on strategies for outreach to contracted clinics. They are also working to establish a communication strategy inclusive of all departments currently doing outreach to contracted clinics. 2. HealthPartners plan Medical Directors, Provider Relations, Integration and Improvement (Quality Improvement and Compliance- QIC) and Health I nformatics staff met with Medicare Advantage (MA) Network Partner Provider groups in the incentive program on focused initiatives throughout the year. 3. The Patient Management Application (PMA) is an excel -based tool that was shared with MA incented network provider partners. This tool includes the attributed membership for all lines of business if appropriate for the network partners. The PMA identifies areas of opportunity in cost, utilization, reconfirmation of chronic conditions, annual wellness visit completion and incented HEDIS\u00ae measures. The details of the QMA (quality results at the patient level) are included in the PMA. 4. The Quality Management Application (QMA) is a monitoring report including performance results for the annual wellness visit and i ncented HEDIS\u00ae measures to 350 identify gaps in preventive care. HealthPartners provides the QMA report in a PDF format to the MA incented network provider partners monthly through our secure FTP transfer process. 5. The Chronic Condition Reconfirmation Rate (C CRR) monitoring report includes providers' performance on closing/documenting chronic condition gaps in the current year and which conditions have an opportunity to be documented, supporting risk and diagnosis accuracy. The CCRR report is shared in a PDF f ormat with the MA incented network provider partners monthly through our secure FTP transfer process. 6. HealthPartners is interested to learn more from providers on how best to share quality and condition gap information in such a way that it can be easily ingested into existing workflows for review, reducing administrative burden on providers. 7. The QMA report is tracked, trended, and shared with MA incented providers at least three times per year and reviewed during scheduled meetings. 8. HealthPartners conti nued the Medicare Advantage incentive program, the annual wellness visit, reconfirmation rate completion, and select HEDIS\u00ae measures in 2022 for twelve providers. Telemedicine continued to be an option for Medicare annual wellness visits in 2022. 9. The MA i ncented network provider partners continued to feel the impact of the pandemic due to pent up demand, members wanting in- person visits, staffing shortages, and staff burnout. The network partners continued to focus on social determinants of health (SDOH) b y identifying food insecurities and transportation barriers for vulnerable populations and strengthening community partnerships to address the needs of the population. 10. HealthPartners offered an 'opt in' Colorectal FIT kit campaign through Virtuwell. This program included attributed Medicare, Medicare Advantage and MSHO members for our network partners. 11. The quality improvement and compliance team sends a monthly list of women with history of a fracture for the osteoporosis management star measure to the MA i ncented network provider partners to provide outreach to those members to close the gap in care as appropriate. Barrier Analysis HealthPartners encounters the following challenges as we evaluate and promote the provider engagement: 1. Identifying ways to involve and engage doctors/clinicians and minimize interruptions and demands that impact patient care. 2. Distribution of QMA reports to appropriate clinic staff to improve quality outcomes including MNCM and HEDIS\u00ae measures. 351 3. Identifying that clinic systems have their \"standardized processes\" and understanding how we can promote collaboration to meet better member/patient quality outcomes. 4. Identifying the network partners individual initiatives at a clinic level and individual provider level to engage all provider s within the group to achieve best care practices. 5. Difficulty scheduling meetings on a regular cadence with incented providers due to competing priorities. 6. Resource constraints noted for gap closure and recommended flat file transfer to reduce administrat ive burden to MA incented network provider partners. 7. Variance in reports received from payers creating difficulty for incented provider to ingest all the data to close the gaps as each payer has a different file format. a. HealthPartners was able to ingest different formats to meet the incented provider group's individual needs. 8. Reluctance by some providers regarding messaging to the members to complete preventive services as the member may have received more than one type of messaging. 9. Member prevent ive care campaigns continued including the promotion of annual wellness visit completion. Opportunities for Improvement: Results/Outcomes Increase utilization of the PMA tool used by providers and QMA within the tool to review quality results at the patient level as an opportunity to address preventive screenings. Create a comprehensive document encompassing HealthPartners reporting capabilities. Partnering with MA incented network provider partners to create flat file transfer in similar formats they already use and streamline the process to ingest provider groups information into the HealthPartners system. Opportunity for future growth in MA incented network provider partners. There were twelve incented network partners in 2022. 352 2022 Annual Wellness Visit Completion Rate Results for Medicare Advantage Incented Providers: Current activities will continue in the next program year with expanded collaboration with provider network and Quality Improvement and Compliance to support and improve provider enga gement. Provider Consultations Description Activities or processes within a health care organization consist of what is done and how it is done. The biggest impact for quality improvement is when both these areas are addressed together. HealthPartners supports quality improvement through partnerships with care delivery systems, national and local group, to improve healthcare quality. HealthPartners collaborates with health care systems through the Partners in Excellence (PIE) Program which recognizes excellence, innovation, and persistent and sustainable change to impact preventive care for the population they serve. Along with the quality awards program, HealthPartners offers consultative services through the Quality Improvement and Compliance (QIC) depa rtment to clinic groups to support their quality improvement initiatives. Clinics may choose technical assistance on clinic processes, or they may benefit from analysis of data specific to their clinic. HealthPartners continued the network partner provider incentive program that included consultation with HealthPartners teams which included, Health Informatics, Provider Relations, Risk Operations, Medical Directors, and Clinical Quality Consultants on selected HEDIS\u00ae measures, annual wellness visit, and reconfirmation rate completion to reduce gaps in Our goal is to motivate better performance of quality measures through continued and enhanced partnering with care delivery systems. Our objectives: Identify opportunities to work with clinic systems to help improve their quality outcomes as defined in HEDIS\u00ae and MNCM through process improvement. Drive improvements in healthcare quality within care delivery systems to maximize participation of all providers over time. Provider engagement is one of the most important factors affecting the success of a quality improvement program. Publicly recognize and award care groups for achieving high levels of performance in the Triple Aim - exceptional clinical quality, patient experience, and affordable care. Reinforce principles of prevention, population- based care, and evidence -based decision making and continuous process improvement. Initiatives/Interventions 1. QIC staff is available to consult with network partners about their quality improvement processes. Further analysis of data provided by HealthPartners is also available through the QIC department. 2. Provider Incentive Program (PIP) and Partners in Excellence (PIE) goals are aligned with plan goals and HED IS\u00ae. 3. HealthPartners collaborates with health care systems through the Partners in Excellence (PIE) Program which recognizes excellence, innovation, and persistent and sustainable change to impact preventive care for the population they serve. As well as r ecognition for medical, specialty or pharmacy groups achieving high levels of performance on: a. Triple Aim Performance i. Clinical Quality ii. Patient Experience iii. Affordability b. Financial rewards are based on medical, specialty or pharmacy group performance as measur ed by Minnesota Community Measurement (MNCM). For those measures that do not have corresponding MNCM measures, we utilize HealthPartners Clinical Indicator measurement set, and HealthPartners Consumer Choice Satisfaction survey. c. For 2022, we had 22 provider groups who were awarded for silver level performance, and 1 provider group who was awarded for gold level performance. 4. Health Informatics monitors provider performance and creates in- depth, actionable quality and total cost of care reporting that enables providers to improve their performance. Providers receive reports on a quarterly basis. 5. HealthPartners currently provides the Patient Management Application (PMA) Tool in which the Quality Management Application (QMA) report is included for the MA incent ed network provider partners on a quarterly basis. These reports are available to be viewed 354 online through a secure login to the Provider Portal. The report includes data on preventive services and chronic disease. The QMA also has quality results at a pat ient level which aligns with measures as defined by HEDIS\u00ae codes. The reports provide aggregated claims information to primary care and specialty providers to support and assist improvement process efforts in care delivery and care coordination with patients. 6. Plan medical directors and quality improvement staff meet with network providers during consultations, round tables, and Quality Connections Forums 7. Quality Connections Forums are held three times per year to engage HealthPartners provider groups in quality initiatives to improve publicly reported measures. This group has grown from 5 provider groups in 2012 to 17 in 2022. The meetings offer clinics a forum to share successes, challenges, and results of QI initiatives. Sharing tested strategies provides opportunities for the provider groups to use tested interventions for quality improvement. The virtual forum continued to have strong attendance. 8. HealthPartners continually shares educational opportunities such as webinars and conferences with qualit y improvement staff who are affiliated with network partners to enhance their knowledge of evidence- based activities and support their QI efforts. Barrier Analysis 1. Clinic systems may feel they \"don't have time\" to participate in awards programs and consul tative meetings that they see as non- clinical activities. Common reasons for this reluctance include: a. Payment system for volume rather than quality of outcomes b. Insufficient resources to support adoption of recommended initiatives or staff training. c. Competing priorities may not align with health plan priorities. d. Clinic systems and practitioners may be unaware of consultant services offered through HealthPartners. e. Tools provided such as the Patient Management Application Tool seems duplicativ e and not value added to reports clinic systems already have in place. f. Variation in reports received from payers creates difficulty for provider groups to ingest all the data to close the gaps as each payer has a different file format. Opportunities for Improvement: Results/Outcomes 1. QIC Quality Consultants are actively partnering with HealthPartners Provider Relations and Network Management to educate network clinics on Quality Consultant services. 2. Continue promotion of the Partners in Excellence Program s to clinics. 3. Continue to expand Quality Connections Forums to encourage continuous quality improvement with our network partners. 4. Identify provider groups that would benefit from the Quality Connections meeting who are not currently attending and/or invi ted. 5. Incorporate the Patient Management Application into a broader support tool to enhance current tools used by provider partners. 355 6. We still want to recognize the ways in which organizations are working to change the way they deliver health care or the ways in which organizations are implementing a novel quality improvement process for patient preventive care screenings that is leading to greater performance. HealthPartners is committed to continuing these efforts to educate clinical systems and providers on the services offered by HealthPartners to promote improving quality outcomes. We will continue to support and engage clinical systems in the Partners in Quality Program to promote innovation, excellence, and sustainable change to impact preventive care for the populations they serve. 356 Centers of Excellence Member Populations Targeted X Commercial X Medicare Freedom (Cost) X Medicaid X MSHO HPUPH WI Marketplace Description HealthPartners operates Centers of Excellence (COE's) on the premise of identifying providers for a specific service who provide exceptionally high- quality care through outcome measurement, demonstration of cost -efficient care, and provide members an exceptional experience. Goals Definition includes: 1. Triple Aim focus: high quality care, cost efficiencies for the procedure and exceptional patient experience. 2. Current COE's: Transplant & Weight Loss Surgery 3. Consistent review of outcomes by all COE participants 4. Medical policies developed to ensure criteria by procedure is met 5. Measurement: a. Weight Loss Surgery: Data compiled from Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) b. Transplant: Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) 6. All Minnesota products included Initiatives/Interventions Transplant: In 2023, we will continue to update our outcome measure summary, sourced from the scientific registry of transplant recipient database, and discuss these results in meetings with our transplant COEs. Weight Loss Surgery: 2023 will have a continued focus on measuring post -operative psychosocial well -being of patients; with results reviewed in our annual roundtable. Barrier Analysis Benefit coverage -Benefit coverage for Weight Loss Surgery continues to be a significant issue facing both members and providers wanting to provide the service when benefit offering is not an option. 357 Systems issues in the organization - Many changes over the last couple years in U M management (prior notification process) for transplant. Co-pay restrictions Problems with provider access - providers requesting to participate as a COE provider when they are not meeting accreditation requirements, volume requirements, and outcome requi rements. Opportunities identified for improvement and recommended interventions to overcome the barriers and issues. o Annual review of COE criteria o Benefits committee to review contract language and benefit coverage options o Continual feedback from providers with operational process Gaps in Care Ongoing analysis of additions to the COE network based on volume, outcomes, and accreditation based on employer and provider requests. Opportunities for Improvement: Results/Outcomes NA 358 High Value Networks Member Populations Targeted X Commercial X Medicare Freedom (Cost) X Medicaid X MSHO HPUPH WI Marketplace Description The goal of high value procedure designations is to help ensure members receive the best value for their health care dollars. Specific high volume and/or high -cost surgical procedures are analyzed to identify variation in cost and quality, to designate fac ilities that are high quality and cost effective at a procedure level. Goals Ensuring members have access to high quality and cost -efficient healthcare. Annual measurement results compiled and shared. The following procedures are evaluated on quality and cost for high value designations: Orthopedic Care Arthroscopic knee surgery Arthroscopic shoulder surgery Back surgery Carpal tunnel surgery Hip replacement surgery & revision Knee replacement & revision Rotator cuff surgery Otolaryngology Tonsil and/or adenoid surgery Hernia repair, inguinal Measurement: Cost: Cost performance is measured in terms of an index, or costs compared to the 13- county metro average, for each procedure. To achieve high value designation for a procedure, facilities must 359 demonstrate cost -effective performance that is better than the 13 -county metro average for the procedure. An index greater than 1.0 reflects cost performance that is worse (or more expensi ve) than the metro average, where an index less than 1.0 reflects cost performance that is better (or less expensive) than the metro average. The facility, provider, and any associated ancillary costs during the procedure episode can impact the procedure -specific total cost index (TCI). Quality: To be designated as high value, hospitals with an overall quality rating must have achieved either a 3- or 4-star overall quality rating in the quality assessment. Please refer to https://www.healthpartners.com/provider -public/ for more information regarding this assessment. Initiatives/Interventions Barrier Analysis NA Gaps in Care NA 360 Opportunities for Improvement: Results/Outcomes See high value network designations on www.HealthPartners.com/provider 361 Partners in Excellence (PIE) Member Populations Targeted X Commercial X Medicare Freedom (Cost) X Medicaid X MSHO HPUPH WI Marketplace Description The Partners in Excellence program forms the basis for HealthPartners' financial and public recognition for medical, specialty or pharmacy groups achieving high levels of performance on the Triple Aim of exceptional clinical quali ty, patient experience, and affordable care. Goals 1. Our goal is to recognize and reward groups who deliver on the Triple Aim. 2. Annual measurement results are compiled and shared. 3. The measurements are grouped in the following clusters: Staying Healthy and Care for Illness, Care for Chronic Conditions, Getting Care and Information, Quality of Communication, and Quality of Care & Service. 4. The following measurement sources are used to determine achievement of the PIE goals: a. Minnesota Community Measurement (MNCM) b. Minnesota Community Measurement Survey c. HPI Specialty Survey Information d. HPI Evidence Based Connect e. HPI Clinical Indicators 5. All Minnesota products are included in each care groups' measurement. Initiativ es/Interventions 1. The following principals are used in the PIE program: 2. Use measures that are relevant and clear to providers and consumers. 3. Use measures that are accurate, valid, reliable, and obtainable. 4. Use established measures, those endorsed nationally or generally accepted national or regional standards. 5. Draw on a range of measures from a variety of sources, where possible, for a robust overall rating methodology. 362 6. Apply consistent measurement approaches and use scoring that avoids or minimizes subjecti vity. 7. Disclose the methodology so it is transparent to providers, consumers, and employers. 8. Silver performance recognizes high quality care delivered in the Health or Patient Experience dimension. 9. Gold performance recognizes high quality care delivered in the Health or Patient Experience dimension and at an affordable total cost. Barrier Analysis Since MNCM discontinued their patient satisfaction survey, HealthPartners has developed and implemented our own patient experience survey for primary and specialty care. This survey will be used to measure patient experience across our network. Gaps in Care None Opportunities for Improvement: Results/Outcomes In 2023, we will continue to refine our measure while making sure to inventory meaningful measures that are in each of our domains. We will use MNCM as our primary source for measurements results. 363 Total Cost of Care (TCOC) Member Populations Targeted X Commercial Medicare Freedom (Cost) Medicaid MSHO X HPUPH X WI Marketplace Description The total cost of care report supports the Triple Aim goals by creating a more complete picture of the drivers of health care costs, which can be used to identify opportunities within individual practices. TCOC is a comprehensive reflection of a provider's resource use, intensity, appropriateness, and efficiency built around the services a provider group's patients receive and the clinics, specialists, and hospitals in which they receive the services. Goals To simultaneously deliver improved health, optimal patient experience, and affordable care and coverage Consider the goals and measures of success from the annual work plan. Individual providers will set a contractual trend target to meet in a calendar year. If that trend target i s met the provider will earn shared savings dollars. Total Cost of Care equation: Currently TCOC is only available and measured for commercial populations. Initiatives/Interventions HealthPartners schedules annual / biannual meetings with TCOC providers to identify potential opportunities where costs and utilization could be reduced. The opportunities are provider specific based on overall population served, cost of services and practice patterns. 364 Barrier Analysis Examples of categories that may create qualitative and/or quantitative barriers. o Organization staffing - Current staffing of organizations may not allow for telehealth and other technological support services. o Systems issues in the organization - TCOC has only been built for commercial populations as it stands today. There is increased interest in getting the data for other patient populations and being able to see different cuts of data based on clinic locations. Opportunities for Improvement: Results/Outcomes 2023 - Finalizing Tableau 2.0 rollout. One platform that will include data for all product types and the provider will get better visual data looks for different cuts. It will also house our other already established tools to help with care coordination and pharmacy costs. 2023 - Adding site of care data at the procedure level will provide information to care systems on what site of care (inpatient, outpatient, clinic, home) a procedure is performed, along with a benchmark that identifies site of care best practice. 365 Monitoring Activities Delegation Description HealthPartners gives other entities the authority to perform certain functions on its behalf.

HEDIS is a tool used by more than 90 percent of America's health plans to measure performance on important dimensions of care and service. The combined results of NCQA Accreditation and HEDIS\u00ae provide the most complete view of health plan quality available. The scope of the NCQA HEDIS Compliance Audit includes the following domains: Effectiveness of Care; Access/Availability of Care; Satisfaction with the Experience of Care; Health Plan Stability; Use of Services; Cost of Care; and Health Plan Descriptive Information. HealthPartners has undergone a full audit. The included HEDIS measu res were deemed reportable according to the NCQA HEDIS Compliance Audit Standards. Measurement Year 2021 was the 28th year of HEDIS\u00ae reporting by HealthPartners. It includes information across our commercial, Medicare, Medicaid and Exchange product lines. HealthPartners presents results for HEDIS\u00ae measures in the prescribed performance areas below: effectiveness of care access/availability of care health plan stability use of services satisfaction with the experience of care This report does not contain our complete set of HEDIS\u00ae scores. However, it does contain some key measures that demonstrate our level of success in quality improvement. For complete commercial results, see NCQA Quality Compass. Assessment of Effectiveness For measurement year 2021 HealthPartners successfully underwent a Full NCQA HEDIS\u00ae Compliance Audit . All measures that were reviewed during this audit were deemed reportable according to the NCQA HEDIS\u00ae Compliance Standards. The HEDIS\u00ae compliance audit evaluates the ability of health plans to process and report information for HEDIS\u00ae. The audit ensures that health plans' HEDIS\u00ae results are comparable. HEDIS\u00ae is a registered trademark of the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA).

PURPOSE HealthPartners maintains and monitors a network of healthcare providers that is sufficient to provide adequate access to covered services and to meet the needs of our population. In addition to monitoring our networks to ensure they meet time and distan ce standards, we also analyze the capacity of our network to meet the language needs of our members and its capacity to provide culturally appropriate care. II. POLICY 34 HealthPartners ensures that all healthcare services are supported by written arrangem ent and are available to our members for all services, including preventive and specialty services. We also ensure that we have employed or contracted with appropriately qualified institutional and individual providers, that these providers have sufficient capacity to make services available to our members, and that their focus is on affordable, quality care. It is very important to provide our members with adequate numbers and types of providers with access to continuous care across the life cycle. It is a lso important to make sure that these providers are conveniently located for our membership and that care is cost effective. We want to ensure that HealthPartners makes available the types of providers that can meet the racial, ethnic, cultural, and lingu istic needs and preferences of the people who represent our membership as well as meet their special medical needs, special risks, or other special circumstances, including the frail or disabled and those near the end of life. III. PROCEDURE(S) Race/Ethnicity and Language(s) Spoken HealthPartners collects information from providers about their race, ethnicity, culture and language spoken to ensure our networks have practitioners that can meet the cultural and linguistic needs of mem bers. The following information is collected: 1. Languages in which a practitioner is fluent when communicating about medical care 2. Language services available through the practice 3. Practitioner race/ethnicity The following information is published: 1. Practitioner languages in physician directories 2. Language services available through practices in physician directories Practitioner race/ethnicity is provided by Member Services when requested by members who call in for assistance finding a practitioner. At least every three years, HealthPartners will: 1. Analyze the capacity of our network to meet the language needs of mem bers. We assess and report on practitioner and bilingual staff language capabilities and determines whether its language services are sufficient to meet the needs of members. Assessment includes: Languages spoken by practitioners. Presence of bilingu al staff in practitioners' offices. Whether practitioners have worked with an interpreter. 35 2. Analyze the capacity of our network to meet the needs of members for culturally appropriate care. We use information about the demographic profile of our members hip and practitioner network to identify potential unmet needs and assess the network's ability to deliver culturally appropriate care to our members. Our assessment may include practitioners': Attitude about working with people from different cultures. Awareness of health beliefs and health -related behaviors among people from prevalent cultures in the service area. Ability to determine language or cultural barriers interfering with commu nication. Skills in assessing patient understanding. Participation in CME cultural humility training. Our report describes practitioner demographics and assessments of identified member needs. 3. Develop a plan to address gaps identified because of t he analysis. 4. Address gaps based on our plan. Time and Distance Standards Network analysis of time and distance standards is done using various methodologies. Using GeoAccess\u00ae software, a zip code mapping analysis and a physician/member ratio analysis are performed annually for all products except our Minnesota Senior Health Options (MSHO) products, which is performed twice annually. HealthPartners complies with the requirements of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Minnesota Departments of Health (MDH) and Human Services (DHS), and the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) in analyzing access through t ime and distance standards. A variety of concurrent monitoring activities are performed. The Provider Relations and Network Management staff review the results to determine whether there are adequate providers in the service area to meet our standards for availability. If the standards are not met, the staff designs an action plan that includes attempting to contract with additional practitioners in the specified deficient areas. More frequent assessments are done if there are deficiencies noted or if cha nges to either the provider network or membership numbers are noted through established concurrent monitoring activities. The Provider Relations and Network Management staff has overall accountability for performing the assessment.

The Provider Relations and Network Management staff leads the analysis of the finished GeoAccess products and the HSD tables to assess performance against the standards listed above. The focus is an \"exception analysis,\" looking at where and why the standards were not met (if applicable). Opportunities to improve availability are noted in the analysis and action plans are developed to address opportunities for improvement. The results of the completed GeoAccess\u00ae analysis are shared with the appropriate Government Programs staff and committees on an annual basis. IV. DEFINITIONS The principal categories of practitioners assessed for availability are defined as follows: Primary Care Providers Primary Care Providers are defined as MDs, DOs, (Doctor of Osteopathy), MBBSs and MBBCH (Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery), NPs (nurse practitioner), PAs (physician assistant) and CNSs (clinical nurse specialist) who provide care in the following practice areas: Family Practice, General Practice, Internal Medicine, and Pediatrics. There are providers in other practice areas that members may use for routine and preventive health care services (i.e. Obstetrics and Gynecology physicians, ) but for this analysis only the listed practice areas were used. Specialty Care Providers Specialty Care Providers are defined as MDs, DOs, (Doctor of Osteopathy), MBBSs and MBBCH (Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery), NPs (nurse practitioner), PAs (physician assistant) , CNSs (clinical nurse specialist), DPM (Doctor of Podiatric medicine) DC (Doctor of Chiropractic) who are not defined as primary care providers. 40 High Volume Specialty Care Providers High Volume Specialty Care providers are specialty care providers not defined as primary care providers but whose specialties provide high volumes of services to our members relative to other specialties. The specialty types that provide high volumes of services are determined by the analysis of the number of units of procedures performed times the RVU for each procedure. This is done by analyzing the \"Units/RVU\" data obtaine d from reports generated by the Health Informatics Department. We then perform GeoAccess\u00ae studies for the specialties that stand out as being higher volume than the others. The high volume specialties identified are Cardiology, Obstetrics & Gynecology, Ort hopedics, and Otolaryngology (ENT). (Note: Regardless of the outcome of the analysis, HealthPartners includes Obstetrics and Gynecology and Behavioral Health as high volume specialists.) High Impact Specialty Care Providers High Impact Specialty Care Providers are specialty care providers not identified as primary care providers but whose specialties provide high impact services to our members relative to other specialties. Oncology is defined as a high impact specialty care provider . Behavioral Healt h Providers Behavioral Health Providers are defined by HealthPartners as Specialty Care Providers, but for the purposes of this assessment, are evaluated for availability as a unique category. For this assessment, Behavioral Health Practitioners are defi ned as Psychiatrists (professional suffix of MD or DO), Licensed Psychologists (professional suffix of LP), Licensed Social Workers (professional suffix of LICSW) and Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists (professional suffix of LMFT.) Chiropractic Providers Chiropractors are defined by HealthPartners as Specialty Care Providers, but for the purposes of this assessment, are evaluated for availability as a unique category. For this assessment, Chiropractors are defined as Doctor of Chiropractic (DC). Hospitals The Hospital category includes HealthPartners contracted hospitals that provide inpatient medical or surgical care and treatment. V. COMPLIANCE Failure to comply with this policy or the procedures may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 41 VI. ATTACHMENTS: None VII.

ENDORSEMENT 42 Methodology Practitioner availability was assessed using geographic standards, provider/member ratio standards, and concurrent monitoring. Geographic Standards Availability was assessed using Quest Analytics Suite software. This process plotted the addresses of our members to the designated sets of HealthPartners network provider types as defined and measured in the \"Network Assessment of Practitioner Availability\" policy - primary care, specialty care, high volume specialty care providers (Cardiology , Obstetrics & Gynecology, Orthopedics, and Otolaryngology (ENT), behavioral health, and hospitals, and chiropractors. In addition, for informational purposes, data is collected on dermatology, gastroenterology and ophthalmology. Due to differences in the distance requirements, service areas, and provider networks, separate analyses were performed for members in Commercial, HealthPartners Care, MSHO, SNBC, HealthPartners UnityPoint Medicare Advantage, Wisconsin Medicare Advantage, Minnesota Medicare Advant age, Medicare Cost products, Wisconsin Exchange and Minnesota Exchange. The analysis points out the overall compliance with standards and produces an exception report that identifies opportunities for improvement. Ratio Standards Availability was assessed by taking the membership count and applying it to the following designated sets of HealthPartners network provider types as defined and measured in the \"Network Assessment of Practitioner Availability\" policy - primary care, specialty care, high vo lume specialty care providers (cardiology, ENT, orthopedics, surgeons), obstetrics and gynecology, behavioral health, chiropractors and hospitals. In addition, for informational purposes, data is collected on Dermatology, Gastroenterology, Ophthalmology an d Surgeons. Concurrent Monitoring Since the HealthPartners network is configured to meet defined standards, monitoring performance is accomplished throughout the year by concurrent monitoring of changes in both the provider network and enrollment. If practitioners are withdrawn (i.e., clinic closure, contract termination), Provider Relations and Network Management staff evaluates the impact of the change against the above noted access standards. Similarly, the network is evaluated prior to a significant increase in membership due to factors such as the addition of a large client. The number and location of primary care clinics that are not accepting new patients are also monitored. Clinics that report they are not accepting new patients are contacted annually to check if there is a change in their status. For 2022, there were three primary care clinics that were not accepting new patients. To determine where improvements are indicated and to ensure that availability standards continue to be met, HealthPa rtners maintains a Service Quality Council and a Quality Council. The Quality Council maintains a dashboard of items that represents a combination of satisfaction indicators as well as process and outcome measures for the Service Quality Council. The two c ouncils monitor the organization's service and the success of improvement initiatives. The goal is to include measurements on the dashboard that are short -term 43 indicators of process measures that are direct drivers of overall member and patient satisfactio n. Short -term indicators are needed in order to make adjustments throughout the year if necessary. The following are some of the items that are presented, reviewed, and acted upon: Member Services Complaint and Appeal Summary specific to \"Availability\" Annual Practitioner Availability Report/Quest Analytics Suite Reports Medicare CAHPS (Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey) and Medicare Disenrollment Reasons Survey (This is a survey of seniors who have voluntarily left their health plan. The survey is conducted quarterly. Specific results of the Disenrollment and surveys are published annually.) CAHPS Commercial (Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey) Survey, including the 2022 HEDIS CAHPS adult commercial results for question # 4: \"When you nee ded care right away for an illness, injury or condition, how often did you get care as soon as you thought you needed? Medicare HSD tables for senior products HealthPartners also uses Census Bureau data on race/ethnicity to create and maintain its practi tioner network. As part of HealthPartners annual provider data audit, we will continue to actively ask our contracted providers for any changes in their medical group. This information is reviewed by contracting staff who determines whether any reported change would warrant new contracts to be extended to enhance our members' access to services. We will continue to ask our primary care providers to routinely notify us of new providers in rural communities. We will evaluate the network to assess whether there are opportunities to enhance our network by including these new providers in our HealthPartners network. We will continue to monitor member complaints regarding access to care and services from enrollees and follow -up as appropriate. We continue to encourage high volume specialty clinics and physicians to provide outreach services in rural communities. Members continue to have the option of going outside of the HealthPartners network and using their traditional Medicare coverage if th ey prefer to go to a provider closer to them. 44 Summary of Analysis and Interventions Geographic Standards - Results HealthPartners Commercial Products 2022 Service Area analysis - Geographic Standards HealthPartners Service Area Analysis - Provider Type Access Standard Total Pop.

HealthPartners ratio standards have been met for the provider types defined in the \"Network Assessment of Practitioner Availa bility\" policy. 217 Concurrent Monitoring -Results Provider Relations and Network Management staff monitors and evaluates the impact of clinic closings, contract terminations, and large membership influx on the designated standards. This process is managed through a work group led by staff from Provider Re lations and Network Management. The network changes to date have not resulted in a deficiency in provider types, numbers, or locations. Only three primary care clinics were not accepting new patients during 2022. To determine where improvements are indic ated and to ensure that availability standards continue to be met, the Senior Director of Provider Relations and Network Management has participated in the monitoring activities listed in Section I which were reviewed in the Service Quality Council. The presentation of information and discussion ensure timely access to service and provider accessibility information. The committee members assess performance against the established standards, identify improvement opportunities, implement improvement strategie s and continue to monitor performance. As referenced in the \"Concurrent Monitoring\" section above, we reviewed the Commercial, HealthPartners Care, and the Medicare CAHPS Survey (Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey). Commercial Group Results We reviewed the 2022 CAHPS results for two measures. 1.

The 2020 United States Census results (most recent available) have been reviewed to assess HealthPartners practitioner network. Analysis of 202 0 race classifications for Minnesota point to a growing diversity, with 82.85% of residents classified as \"White.\" The next largest groups are Black (6.41percent) and Asian (4.82 percent). Net international migration continues to increase. The Census Bure au information gives the following Minnesota State General Profile. People of Hispanic origin can be of any race. Total Population in Minnesota - 5,706,400 (2020 Census figures Estimated data released by US Census) White: 82.85% Black or African American: 1.04% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander: 0.04% Census data reveal that the largest population of these ethnic groups - except for the American Indian/Alaska Native group - lives in the seven county metro areas, where the HealthPartners network has the largest set of culturally competent practitioners. Examples of how HealthPa rtners is taking into consideration ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and other individual needs and preferences of our members are listed below under \"Equitable Care and Diversity\". 220 Equitable Care and Diversity Health Disparities DESCRIPTION As an organization dedicated to the health and well -being of every person, we have the responsibility and opportunity to help build a stronger organization and community where racism and inequity have no place.

The Equity, Inclusion and Anti -Racism Cabinet provides leadership, direction and oversight through four cornerstones to accelerate the pace of our work and cultivate alignment and partnership across the organization. The image below illustrates the four cornerstones' approach of the He alth Equity, Inclusion, and Anti - Racism Cabinet. Community collaboration to gain insights and engage community We have built a culture of health equity in our organization through partnerships with community organizations. In our 2021 Community Health Needs Assessments and Plans, conducted by each of our hospitals, priority needs, were reviewed within the contextual factors of structural racism and COVID -19. During that process, we engaged community members, public health, and our own clinicians to more deeply understand how we might impact the health of our community. Community partnership development is a core strategy in our work to promote and make change towards health equity. We invest in six general areas: healthy children, mental health, nutrition and fitness, health 224 equity, wellness and prevention and research a nd education. We also have larger, multi -year partnerships and campaigns with community -based organizations to impact and improve community health including the MakeItOK campaign, PowerUp and Little Moments Count. Examples of partners include organization s such as the Keystone Community Services, Open Arms Minnesota, Reach Out and Read MN, American Red Cross Blood Services, Northside Achievement Zone (NAZ), the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), St. Paul Bookmobile, over 60 schools throughout the region, Hunger Solutions, and many others. Healthy Children and Maternal Health Little Moments Count : LMC is a growing social movement seeking to increase awareness of the importance and increase parent and caregiver behaviors of talking, playing, readi ng, singing and storytelling with children, in the first 1000 days of life (0 -3 years old). LMC achieves this through collective impact partnership with over 70 cross -sector organizations, including early childhood, healthcare, non -profit community and cul tural, faith community, media, governmental and other private sector organizations. LMC partners work together to magnify key family support resources and opportunities, as well as identify gaps to fill through collective impact strategies. In 2022, LMC reached many Minnesota and WI families and professionals through: o Over 14 million MN Public Radio (MPR) radio and digital public service announcements (PSAs). o Over 90,000 prints, 525,000 radio and 182,000 digital cultural community media impressions withi n Latinx, Hmong, Somali, African American and indigenous communities through strategic trusted community media and social media partnerships. o Reaching approximately 22,000 community event impressions through large events like the MN State Fair, and smalle r community outreach efforts, like the Ramsey County Mother's First Community Baby Shower. o Over 1000 views of the LMC Annual Conference featuring keynote speaker, Dr. Rosemarie Allen, MEd, \"Racism and the Developing Brain.\" o 150,000 families receiving Reach Out & Read early brain development education and over 214,000 children's books at well child visits across 10 health care systems. o Over 1100 family LMC LEARN Survey responses from African American, Latinx, Hmong, Somali, Indigenous and Medicaid -insured communities - showing community -specific assets and needs to help guide LMC strategy in the future. o Over 5000 families reached through a new family birth center pilot introducing LMC resources to new parents delivering at 5 MN family birth centers. o In partnership with The Itasca Project, new and enhanced employer communication campaign and family support best practices and policy examples tools. Children's Health Council : It's clear that there is a strong link between hea lth and well -being early in life, and health and well -being later in life. HealthPartners is working to improve the health and well -being of children and their families by concentrating on areas of focus known as our Children's Health Council (previously k nown as Initiative). The four main guiding principles of the initiative are: promoting early brain development, providing family centered care, strengthening our communities and Eliminate disparities in 225 maternal, infant and pediatric health. In 2022, our areas of focus include: early brain development, adolescent health, pediatric, adolescent, and maternal mental health access and outcomes, healthy beginnings (maternal and newborn care), and lactation. Through this investment, we're helping lay a foundatio n that will benefit generations to come. Reach Out and Read and early brain development messaging : Reach Out and Read reaches children from 6 months to age five. At the beginning of every visit, a child's healthcare provider will give the child an age and language appropriate book to share with their family. The provider uses this opportunity to gauge the child's early development and give the parents or caregivers guidance on how language -rich interactions, such as reading, singing, and playing together, help a child learn and grow healthily. In efforts to start this messaging early on, we added a bla ck and white book to the 32 -week prenatal visit and explain to families that there are benefits of talking, reading and singing to their baby still in the womb. Each year, this program hands out approximately 95,000 books between our well child checks and prenatal visits and offers books in over 12 different languages. Well Child and Childhood Immunization Outreach : During the pandemic, we saw declines in many preventive care measures including well child visits and childhood immunizations. Delays in imm unizations put children at increased risk for many preventable diseases, and lack of well care can delay identification of developmental delays or other health concerns. Our Medicaid membership had the lowest utilization of these health care services acros s our membership. HealthPartners utilized information from our care group and claims to identify 10,000 members up to 18 years old who were in need of immunizations, well child care or both. We worked with WellShare International, a local Community Health Worker organization, to conduct outreach to these members to educate on the importance of preventive care, encourage visits to their clinician and offer assistance in scheduling these visits. WellShare has a roster of CHWs from the community and were able to make calls in members' native languages when possible or utilize an interpreter when needed. Calls were made to members beginning in October and continue into 2023. As of the end of 2022, 5479 (55%) of the members on the list had been contacted at least once. CHWs were able to successfully engage 26% of the members they reached out to. Reasons for not reaching included disconnected or wrong phone numbers, messages left but not returned, and members who declined the intervention. CHWs were able to educa te 1556 families on the importance of getting up to date on immunizations and well child exams and assisted 104 to actually schedule the appointment. In addition to this outreach, we worked with the other MN Medicaid plans and the Minnesota Council of Health Plans to create a blog post about the importance of getting caught back up on immunizations and well visits. The blog is available in written and audio form and is being translated to Spanish, Somali and Hmong for access to those communities. Think Small Positive Parent Texting program : This easy, free program provides fun facts and easy tips each week with ideas on how parents/caregivers can promote their child's learning. Research shows when parents participate in this program their children are more prepared for kindergarten. In 2021, we included 226 a Little Moments Count bookmark, which promotes Think Small, to our 32 -week prenatal visit and 1 month well child check. This bookmark is offered in English, Spanish and Somali and we continue to use this bookmark throughout those respective visits. PowerUp Teen Leadership Council : In 2020, the Children's Health Cou ncil started to partner with PowerUp's Teen Council to provide feedback on care for teens. In the first year, they provided feedback on our adolescent questionnaire to ensure we are asking relevant questions, which we were then able to update. In 2021, CHC chairs were added to the advisory committee to help enhance their engagement through the program and into the community. Through 2022, the teen council provided feedback on relevant topics to ensure clinicians covered important topics with teens. In 2023, HealthPartners is dedicated to a refresh training on adolescent health where the council will play an integral part in content developed to ensure relevancy during well child visits. St. Paul Promise Neighborhood (SPPN) : The Promise Neighborhood (Wilder Foundation, Ramsey County, and St. Paul Public Schools) is a community -wide initiative to provide academic, social and health supports children need to succeed in school and life. The focus is on families with children birth to age 5. HealthPartners is a partner on the Advisory Council. Penumbra Theater : HealthPartners partners with Penumbra Theater, a local theater company that creates professional productions focused on the African American experience. Penumbra has evolved into a Center for Racial Healing that nurtures black artists, advances equity, and facilitates wellness for individuals and community. HealthPartners began a partnership with Penumbra to support the commissioning and development of a new play written by Harrison David Rivers as a re sponse to the growing awareness of racial disparities in maternal health. While it could not be performed on the stage in 2021 due to COVID, Penumbra performed excerpts of Weathering in a virtual reading format for HealthPartners employees who serve on ou r pregnancy council, health equity and children's health initiative cabinet. The session was recorded and continues to be used for training across our organization. Weathering was brought to the stage in 2022 with rave reviews. Weathering puts a human face on those stagging statistics that black infants are more than twice as likely to die as white infants and lets us experience the tragedy of one family, as well as the healing that can happen within a community. The Black Pregn ancy and Post -birth Journey : In 2021, with support from the Park Nicollet Foundation, HealthPartners & Park Nicollet partnered with a consulting agency, Heart of the Customer, to improve outcomes for Black expectant mothers by capturing their experiences during and after pregnancy in order to build empathy, undermine systemic racism, and improve outcomes for them and their babies. Black expectant and post -birth patients face far worse health and mortality outcomes that their white counterparts both in Minn esota and nationally. Studies show Black patients are less satisfied with their care and use fewer healthcare services. As a system, we want to build trust with our Black patients and their partners in order to provide timely and culturally competent care. As a result of our Journey Mapping inquiry with Heart of the Customer and our Community Consultants, a top identified program strategy was to offer a perinatal concierge that would stay connected to Black patients throughout their pregnancy care. 227 Healthy Black Pregnancies (formally known as ICHRP) : To better serve our African American patient population, HealthPartners has partnered with Healthy Black Pregnancies. This group provides professional expertise; knowledge of prenatal African American maternal and child health issues; knowledge of the African American community; and connections to local, national or international resources and colleagues. In 2021, our care group piloted referring our patients to their program. In partnership with Healthy Black Pregnancies, we continue to work through some barriers with this referral process. Our Healthy Pregnancy care coordinators and staff from our clinics make referrals to their DIVA Moms program and other support services. In 2022, HP gifted Healthy Black Preg nancies a $50,000 grant to support the formalization of their structure as a 501c3 and to increase access to their support services. Healthy Beginnings: This program helps women achieve a healthy pregnancy and birth by providing comprehensive screening a nd support to pregnant patients who are experiencing substance use issues, mental health struggles, homelessness, poverty, domestic violence, and/or other complex psychosocial issues. This evidence -based program reduces preterm births, and low birthweights . More than 10,000 pregnant patients per year receive screening and are eligible for support with all these challenging life circumstances. Partnerships with the community: o Cradle of Hope - Apply for portable cribs, provide safe sleep education and distr ibute cribs to patients o Bundles of Love Charity - Distribution partner for the charity (bundles have handmade baby clothes, blankets, and baby care items) o Everyday Miracles - Provide grant -funded scholarships for childbirth prep, breastfeeding and newborn care classes; refer patients for doula services, car seat and breast pump distribution o Participation in Scott Co. Early Childhood Multidisciplinary Team ( case consultation meetings with child protection and other community child welfare agencies) o Ongoing referrals to WIC, MVNA and other county family home -visiting programs, Portico Healthnet, Hennepin County Project Child, HousingLink, Diaper Bank of Minnes ota, Minnesota Day One Crisis Hotline, local food shelves and many other resources and supports. Everyday Miracles : Through grant support, women seeking prenatal care through a HealthPartners clinic can seek support from Everyday Miracles and we will help fund the cost of the classes. Everyday Miracles is committed to improving maternal health, and specifically to reducing health disparities in communities at risk for poor outcomes. They strive to provide compassionate, culturally aware support and a nonjudgmental, welcoming community. Lactation Caf\u00e9 : With support from a grant, Park Nicollet was able to expand upon their Lactation Caf\u00e9 at Methodist Hospital (previously Mom & Baby Caf\u00e9) to four ambulatory clinics. This free Caf\u00e9 provides support, camara derie, and lactation support for mothers postpartum. Lactation also partnered with the interpreter services department to provide interpreters at known, diverse clinics to assist patients who are English language learners. In 2023, there is a plan to expan d partnership with Hennepin County WIC to assist with the Cafes as a way to help provide more culturally congruent care and help connect patients to community resources. 228 Doula Services : HealthPartners is pleased to note we are committed to expanding and f unding doula services. Research shows that doulas can improve outcomes for both mother and baby. For example, studies show that doulas help reduce the rate of caesarean surgeries, which is higher among black women than other racial groups, and other costly interventions. Doulas also increase the rate of breastfeeding, which improves the health of new moms and babies and is less common among black or low -income women. Many people in the community are unfamiliar with doulas and how they can provide support t o birthing people. HealthPartners created a video explaining what a doula is, the value they bring to the birth experience and how pregnant people can be connected with a doula. This video has been translated with sub-titles into Spanish, Somali and Hmong and will be s hared widely to promote the use of doulas for families in the community. As voiced by the Ramsey County Birth Equity Community Council (BECC), the community has expressed a desire for more doula support that \"looks like them.\" Through conversations with community doula programs and other community representatives, it is clear that capacity as an issue, especially for women of color. HealthPartners has an ongoing relationship with Everyday Miracles as our primary doula provider for our Medicaid members. E veryday Miracles is committed to improving maternal health, and specifically to reducing health disparities in communities at risk for poor outcomes. They strive to provide compassionate, culturally aware support and a nonjudgmental, welcoming community. I n 2021, along with another MN Medicaid health plan, funded the training and certification costs for additional doulas of color to serve Medicaid members. Since that time, Everyday Miracles roster of Doulas of color went from 40% of their doulas to 70% of t heir doulas identifying as people of color. We gifted Everyday Miracles a $50,000 grant in 2022 to further support their work to provide supports to the community. We are also engaged with a group of community members and organizations to encourage the st ate to update the allowable doula certifications to include culturally congruent trainings relevant for Black and Indigenous pregnant people. In 2022, the health department established a process for additional certifying agencies to become Medicaid eligibl e providers. We have been working with Division of Indian Work to support their Ninde Doula program. Previously their program was funded by grants which couldn't fully fulfill the needs of the community for services. We have been working with them to beco me Medicaid billable to increase their funding capacity. In 2022, we provided a $50,000 grant to DIW to support the services and to formalize processes to be able to contract with them. Referral partners : We continue to expand our collaboration with commu nity partners to further support our most vulnerable patients and members. We work to identify and refer our eligible mothers who are patients or members to family home visiting and other county public health nurse home visiting programs, and community -based programs to support diverse communities including doulas and other maternal health supports. We refer pregnant members on Medicaid to county home visiting for support and resources at the local level. 229 Perinatal Measurements : In November 2021, HealthPart ners began participating in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Perinatal Improvement Collaborative, a large -scale, data- driven collaborative of 200+ leading hospitals caring for diverse populations in all 50 states. The collaborative is overseen by the HHS Office on Women's Health (OWH), using relevant data, analytics and performance improvement methodologies from Premier Inc. The HHS Perinatal Improvement Collaborative will be testing interventions and protocols to reduce preventable d eaths and complications among mothers and their babies. Using Premier's comprehensive and standardized data collection system, the program will be able to quickly generate solutions for safer obstetric and neonatal care that can be implemented nationwide. The effort is guided by an external advisory panel comprising more than 20 expert clinicians and thought leaders, and patient partners from MoMMA's Voices, a coalition of advocacy organizations focused on leading causes of maternal mortality and morbidity. Postpartum Hemorrhage and Hypertension in Pregnancy Safety Bundle : In June 2021, all 8 inpatient hospital Birth Center leaders, providers, nurse educators, quality improvement specialist, pharmacy, lab and Epic builders collaborated to roll out a robust p rogram to improve maternal morbidity and mortality related to postpartum hemorrhage and hypertension in pregnancy. More than 1000 perinatal clinical providers completed education and training aimed at standardizing care of patients experiencing these obste tric emergencies. Standardization included policies, protocols, tools, order sets, medications, education, simulation, measurement and monitoring. This work will impact over 9000 deliveries across the HealthPartners family of care hospital Birth Centers. Mental Health Partnership with NAMI Minnesota : HealthPartners has had a mutually beneficial 16 -year partnership with the Minnesota chapter of NAMI, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the lives of children and adults with mental illnesses and their families (namimn.org). HealthPartners has continuously been a sponsor of the NAMIWalks since 2007. HealthPartners continues to sponsor and participate in the NAMIWalks annually, on an organization -wide level, helping to raise funds and promote the walk. In 2022, our team was back in person at Minnehaha Park and raised over $18,000 for NAMI. We have collaborated with NAMI on the Make It OK anti -stigma campaign (described below), in which NAMI is a committed and expert organization that has pledged to help change hearts and minds about the misperceptions of mental illnesses by encouraging open conversations and education on mental illness. Make It Ok: Make It OK is a community campaign to reduce stigma by increasing understanding and creating caring conversations about mental illness. Make It OK is celebrating 10 years of progress in helping to stop the stigma of mental illnesses. Launched in colla boration with HealthPartners, Regions Hospital, the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), and other partners, the campaign works through community engagement, trained ambassadors, partners, online resources and more to mobilize and share Make It OK t hroughout communities. By creating open and caring conversations and helping to change attitudes about mental health and illnesses, Make It OK is increasing understanding and reducing the stigma so those living with a mental illness get the care and suppor t they deserve. Read more in the 10 -year report, linked here . 230 2022 Make it Ok Highlights : In 2022, Make It Ok continued to expand reach and engagement: 209 Ambassadors trained through 17 virtual trainings 533 Reached through 32 virtual presentations 2,175 Engaged in Make It OK with a full return to community events Launched resources to promote mental well -being and resiliency, reduce stigma of substan ce use disorder, and equip adults to effectively support youth mental health. Science Museum of Minnesota : Since 2018, HealthPartners supported the Science Museum of Minnesota's development of the Mental Health: Mind Matters exhibit. This exhibit was originally developed in Finland but did not use culturally appropriate language or approaches for the United States, as well as did not provide culturally relevant resources. HealthPartners provided important financial support and subject matter expertise and content on resources, including creation of a dedicated resource area for adults and children. This resource area included culturally relevant resources in many languages and also included dedicated pieces for perinatal psychiatric disorders, and Afr ican American, recent refugee immigrant, Somali and Latin American communities. https://www.smm.org/toolkit/mindmatters Nutrition and Fitness PowerUp : The PowerUp initiative makes it easy and fun for everyone to eat better, move more and live healthier lives. We do this important work in partnership with our members, patients, colleagues and communities through programs, tools and resources that support and inspire change. PowerUp has a special focus on kids and families because childhood overweight and obesity tripled in the past 30 years and remains a critical issue for the future of children's health. Research shows that today, kids are expected to live shorter, less healthy lives than their parents for the first time. Research also shows that it takes a multi -level approach, including schools, organizations and the entire community working together to change these trends. In 2022, the PowerUp community health initiative continued to inspire and support kids and families to eat better, move more and feel good, while increasing focus and commitment to equity and the numerous factors that influence health and well -being in children. New resources were crea ted to expand resources focused on 'feeling good\" with ways to relax and recharge, and resources were translated into three additional languages: Spanish, Hmong, and Somali. Community outreach was robust, both virtual and in person, and in 2022, PowerUp re ached 64,686+ virtually, through classes, website, and e -newsletters, and 805 kids and families at 50 community events. PowerUp School Challenge : The School Challenge is an innovative program focused on encouraging elementary -aged students to get curious and excited to try fruits and veggies and move their bodies in fun, new ways. In 2022, schools told us it is a priority to help students feel good and recharge their bodies and brains. Therefore, \"feel good\" was added as a key focus alongside \"eat better\" and \"move more,\" helping kids explore the mind -body connection and ways to relax and recharge. 231 The School Challenge pivoted to increase flexibili ty and adaptability for any learning platform, whether inside a classroom or virtually from home. The Challenge offers easy modules with digital tools, resources, and lesson plans, allowing teachers to choose when, where, and how to use them with their cla ss. Teachers can now participate as an individual classroom or as part of an overall school program. This program is provided at no cost to schools or youth organizations. By participating, teachers and youth leaders: o Choose when, where and how to implem ent the Challenge o Support and encourage students to eat better, move more and feel good o Earn classroom incentives to further promote student well -being o Receive fun and engaging PowerUp resources to share with students and families, available in mult iple languages o Are guided through the Challenge with weekly program communications o Prioritize student wellness and do what's best for kids! Now going into its tenth year, the classroom -based program includes more than 50 schools and on average, reaches more than 19,000 students throughout the region. As a result of participating in the Challenge, 83% of staff and 74% of families reported posit ive changes in the eating habits, observing kids eating more fruits and vegetables. Power Up School Challenge and Health Equity : PowerUp is actively trying to reach and recruit more vulnerable communities to participate in the School Challenge. Using the Center for Disease Control's Social Vulnerability Index, which uses census variables to identify communities that need extra support, we reassessed our recruitment strategy to target socially vulnerable districts and zips codes through partnerships, o utreach and social media ads. With our increased focus on social needs and health equity, PowerUp convened the newly formed Community Health Education Advisory Council at HealthPartners to review and advise on the PowerUp Family Magazine, distributed to kids and families during the School Challenge. The group provided their perspectives and insights, keeping in mind inclusiveness, cultural relevance, health literacy, physical abilities and body sizes, and social needs. Hunger Solutions : Through our partn ership with Hunger Solutions Minnesota (a nonprofit organization in Minnesota committed to ending hunger in MN), members/patients who screen positive for food insecurity are referred to the Minnesota Food Helpline. Hunger Solutions also helps screen for other needs the person may have such as housing or transportation. This partnership started as a pilot program with three HealthPartners clinics in 2017 and expanded to the health plan in early 2020. Electronic referral to Hunger Solutions continued to e xpand through 2022. SuperShelf : HealthPartners and Lakeview Hospital are founding partners of SuperShelf, an innovative project to transform food shelves by offering a positive, grocery store -like experience for members to access healthy and appealing fo ods. SuperShelf uses behavioral economics to make the healthiest choice the easiest choice while respecting individual preferences. There are now 40 SuperShelf sites across Minnesota who provide a welcoming and dignified experience for community members who are food insecure to access appealing, healthy food. https://www.supershelfmn.org/ 232 Unlockit : A program developed by Cycle Health and now integrated into the YMCA programming, is a map based outdoor scavenger hunt set at a variety of parks. HealthPartners is proud to be a sponsor in 2021 which tested the initial program. Programming expanded in 2022 including 16 parks. Participants may go anytime the park is open. Participants download the map, follow the clues, and unlock letters that, when unscrambled, form a keyword. They then submit that keyword to be entered to win fun prizes. https://www.ymcanorth.org/sites/default/files/Y -Adventure -Lab-UnLockIt -St- Croix.pdf?openyts=1675275840248 Heal th Equity TPT: Racism Unveiled : HealthPartners is the sponsor of the new Twin Cities Public Television production, \"Racism Unveiled.\" The project is a collaboration with community members and leaders that examines the impact of systemic racism on Black, Indigenous and communities of color in Minnesota. https://www.tptoriginals.org/projects/racismunveiled/ Higher Ground Academy : Is a K -12 grade charter school located in Saint Paul that serves primarily children of East African immigrants from Somalia and Ethiopia. Annually, Higher Ground Academy plans a career fair for their junior and senior high students. HealthPartners has recruited volunteers to participate since 2015. In 2022, six HealthPartners colleagues participated and reaching about 95 students. Habitat for Humanity : Stable housing impacts educational achievement and a families' overall health. When HealthPartners a nd Park Nicollet combined in 2012, our organizations used volunteerism as a means to learn about each other and share our values. According to The Positive Impacts of Affordable Housing on Health A Research Summary, when families pay excessive amounts of t heir income for housing often, they have insufficient funds remaining to meet other essential needs, including food, medical insurance and health care. In 2022, HealthPartners sponsored 2 builds. 72 volunteers participated providing 576 volunteer hours. Pride Festival : For 24 years, HealthPartners has participated in the Pride Festival and over 5 years in the parade. In honor of the 50th Year Anniversary of Pride in the Twin Cities, the HealthPartners booth at pride hosted a polling question and distr ibuted a charity gift of $5000 among three nonprofit charities based on participant's voting percentage. We asked, what is your biggest barrier to care? And we heard the following responses: o Cost of care/insurance (45%) o cli nician (17%) o Transportation/Location (9%) o I do not currently experience any barriers to care (29%) Our Charity Gift was then distributed to these local nonprofits who support the GLBTQ+ community: Reclaim; Twin Cities Open Arms MN Early Risers Podcast : HealthPartners is a proud ongoing sponsor of this impactful series and collaborates with Little Moments Count, Minnesota Public Radio and Think Small on this important anti -racism and anti -233 bias parenting and early childhood project. Each s eason of Early Risers features 6 -episodes, released bi - weekly, in a podcast mini -series exploring talking with our youngest children about race and racism. Short, sweet, sometimes funny and always relatable, each episode runs between 20 -30 minutes and he lps parents, caretakers and educators tackle this big topic with their little ones. As of December 2022, the Early Risers podcast has been downloaded over 58,000 times, received nearly 175,000 impressions across social media pages, was ranked 13th in the P arenting Category for Apple Podcasts. Additionally, there have been almost 1300 community downloads of episode discussion guides. https://www.littlemomentscount.org/earlyriserspodcast Gender Services Navigator : Supported by the Park Nicollet Foundation, Park Nicollet Gender Services Department funds a gender services navigator role to build trust and help patients navigate often complicated care situat ions across our system. Examples include: planning for gender affirmation surgery, connecting to transgender care, self -injection education, care coordination, and legal issues including name and gender marker changes. Since the start of the role in 2019, the Care Navigator has met with over 400 unique patients. Saint Paul Public Library Bookmobile : Since 2014, HealthPartners has sponsored the Saint Paul Public Library Bookmobile, which is one of the last urban bookmobiles still in operation. The book mobi le visits 45 -50 sites on a regular basis in a two -week cycle reaching about 120,000 people per year. The Bookmobile ensures that the library is accessible to communities that face barriers in using the library's fixed facility due to transportation, cultu ral, language or other barriers. In addition to a financial contribution, HealthPartners also volunteers helping the Bookmobile at local events. The bookmobile continued to operate in 2021 following COVID masking and distancing guidelines. And with addi tional grants, the bookmobile also expanded their wi -fi services for patrons. This was especially helpful when the fixed libraries were closed. In 2022, the bookmobile served over 1,500 children and families each week! https://sppl.org/bookmobile/ Twin Cities 32nd Annual MLK Holiday Breakfast: we sponsored the breakfast by purchasing steaming links to watch the virtual breakfast and distributed the links for colleagues to watch from their locations. We sponsored one in -person table at this annual event to celebrate Dr. King's legacy of service. In addition to sponsoring the breakfast, we encourage our colleagues to commit acts of service in the community and we provide community resources for colleagues to connect with in honor of Dr. King's legacy. Wellness and Prevention Diabetes and Hypertension outreach : In partnership with our care group, we identified Medicaid members who have diabetes an d hypertension and created a program to get home blood pressure monitors out to these members. In total, we sent 3143 monitors to members on our Medicaid products. The mailing included instructions on how to take a blood pressure reading at home and how t o inform your care provider of the results. Our care group continues to work to engage with members whose blood pressure is outside of the recommended range. Breast Cancer GAPS Project : HealthPartners care group participated in the Breast Cancer GAPS proje ct which is focused on reducing disparities for Black breast cancer screening. This project heard from community members about why they are reluctant to get screened, then is using principles of community 234 co-design to create solutions for these barriers. T he project has created videos emphasizing that \" We Matter \" to encourage women of color to get screened. HealthPartners is working on how we will integrate those videos into our outreach on an ongoing basis. Other targeted outreach : In partnership with CHW Solutions, HealthPart ners implemented targeted outreach to our diverse MSHO membership to encourage them to receive breast cancer screening. As trusted members of the community, CHW Solutions staff were able to reach out to our members to remind them of important cancer scree nings. They reached out to members in their native language when possible and utilized interpreters when needed. Languages included in the outreach list included English, Spanish, Hmong, Karen, Oromo, Russian, Romanian, Somali, Swahili and Vietnamese. Of the 163 members identified, CHW Solutions was able to engage with 83 members, for a 51% engagement rate (61% if bad phone numbers are removed from the total). Members widely reported appreciating the outreach. Members who spoke English accepted help sche duling an appointment at a rate of 21% and those who spoke a language other than English accept assistance making an appointment with their clinic 17% of the time. Even for people who do not have a language barrier, engaging with the health care system can be intimidating. The support of a CHW helped to break down barriers to care for these members. In addition to this outreach, our Breast Cancer Screening reminder campaign was translated into Somali, Spanish and Vietnamese to increase access to this information for more of our members. Keystone Community Services : For over 80 years, Keystone Community Services has been serving Ramsey County with senior care, enrichment for children, basic needs and crisis assistance. Keystone began as a small neighborhood community center. Today, Keystone reaches more than 40,000 people, and we share many patients and members. Keystone currently operates tw o food shelves Rice Street Food Shelf and Midway Food Shelf. And when HealthPartners was piloting our SuperShelf initiative, the Rice Street Food Shelf was a pilot! Our 3 year commitment made in 2022 has been used to support the expansion of their new warehouse and food mobile providing better ac cess to neighborhoods with barriers. Keystone food shelves and foodmobile provide quality, healthy food for the community, helping them be self -sufficient, stable and successful. o Express Bike is a social enterprise of Keystone Community Services. Expre ss Bike is a full -service bike shop specializing in refurbished bicycles and a nonprofit youth employment program - all rolled into one! In April of 2022, we hosted bicycle drives at four HealthPartners locations collecting 136 bicycles to support this pr ogram.

MSP People of Color Cohort, which is focu sing on recruiting and retaining people of color to positions in the region and (2) the enterprise talent team, which focuses on recruitment into the region. Shadow Program with Roosevelt High School : For the past 4 years, Park Nicollet has partnered with Minneapolis Roosevelt High School's Health Careers Program to offer mentorship opportunities for career exploration in the health care setting. Due to COVID -19, the structure had to change so there were no student shadowing opportunities, but Park Nicolle t leaders still participated in the board and job fair. This will resume in 2023 with 15 students mentoring in February and March 2023. Patient Care Assistant Apprenticeship : This program seeks to provide individuals with a place to begin a career in healthcare by providing them with the training needed to work in patient care. It also offers a career path for current employees in more entry level environmental services roles.

In the 1930s, the Rondo neighbo rhood was a thriving and vibrant community. By the 1950s, about 85% of Saint Paul's African American population lived in the neighborhood. The community bond was strong, local businesses were thriving, and residents were gaining financial stability that comes with home ownership. In the 1960's, however, the neighborhood of Rondo was removed from the map for the construction of Interstate 94. 600 families lost their homes along with numerous businesses and institutions. The Rondo Commemorative Plaza was installed to capture the history of loss endured, lessons learned and the will to reconnect. In 2022, we participated in Rondo Juneteenth festival sharing health education and blood pressure checks. One Campaign: The One Campaign is HealthPartners' bi ggest campaign for internal team member support of our hospitals' foundations and community nonprofits. The campaign was a success and $642,362 was raised supporting patient care and community programs and organizations. Collection and Use of Data on Race, Ethnicity and Language Preferences HealthPartners systematically collects data on race, ethnicity, language and country of origin directly from patients and members in a variety of ways, all of them voluntary. These data collection sources include healthpartners.com, online through our heal th assessment, and the electronic medical record in our care delivery system and in our dental group. We've found that collecting this information face -to-face from patients at the point of care or health plan contact is an effective data collection method . Across our care delivery system, we have collected race and language information for over 90% of our patients, with language and race collection rates at our hospitals exceeding 97% in 2022. In addition, we receive data from the Minnesota Department of H uman Services, Minnesota Community Measurement, and Minnesota Immunization Information Connection (MIIC) for our members covered by Minnesota Health Care Programs. When we combine all these data sources, we have this information documented for over 97% of our Medicaid members under age 65. 241 We use these data to monitor the quality of care delivered and patient/member experience by race, ethnicity and language. We also use the data to identify strategies to reduce health disparities in treatment, outcomes a nd service. We include race, ethnicity and language data on the member registries we make available to network providers, so they can identify and address disparities among their patients. Where data are voluntarily available on provider race, ethnicit y, language and/or country of origin, we use those data as a resource to respond to patient/member requests. Some of this data is available in the provider directories as well. Hospital equity alignment: Using recently published hospital health equity st andards from the Minnesota Hospital Association, Joint Commission, and CMS Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program (HIQRP), we set out to document progress towards meeting the standards across all hospitals in our care system, identify gaps, and set c lear goals to close these gaps. o Cross -walked equity standards to understand requirements Key elements across the standards include: 1. Health Equity as a strategic priority and an organizational culture & structure to advance the work 2. Valid and reliable dat a collection and the ability to stratify key measures to identify disparities and address health -related social needs. 3. Documented work to address identified disparities and health -related social needs. 4. Regular communication to and engagement of key stakeho lders o Documented system level work being done to meet standards and shared with all hospitals. o Set 2023 hospital system equity goals to address identified gaps, building on work in progress. Valid and reliable data collection: Standardize and train on data collection best practices across all hospitals. Addressing patient's social needs: Standardize collection of SDoH data and use of Unite Us to address social needs with a focus on transportation, food, and housing. Quality improvement work to eliminate disparities: Continue work with Premier Perinatal Collaborative. Target improvements in emergency treatment of hypertension. Bring disparity data to the Hospital Quality Steering Co mmittee for prioritization to the appropriate committee . Continue to build capacity and commitment at the local level Routine communication to stakeholders: Annual reporting (minimum of 1x per year): o Hospital Board of Directors o Patient Family Advisory Com mittee (PFAC) o Medical Executive Committee 242 o Patient Care Committee Additional quarterly reporting through: o HP Health Equity & Eliminating Disparities Cornerstone o Joint meetings of Methodist and Regions HEC Health Equity Accreditation : Starting in 2022, HealthPartners implemented NCQA Health Equity accreditation standards for our Medicaid products. According to NCQA, this accreditation program focuses on the foundation of health equity work and supports health care organizations in evaluating and elevatin g the health of the populations they serve. Specific focus areas include building an internal culture that supports the organization's external health equity work; collecting data that help the organization create and offer language services and provider n etworks mindful of individuals' cultural and linguistic needs; identifying opportunities to reduce health inequities and improve care. HealthPartners will formally apply for this accreditation in January 2023. MN Community Measurement (MNCM): is a collaborative HealthPartners is part of to improve health by publicly reporting health care information. The 2022 MNCM Health Care Disparities Report includes 8 publicly reported measures. Language Assistance We provide interpreter services in al l key languages spoken by patients and have access to over 200 languages through telephone and the use of video remote interpretation. We consistently provide high quality face -to-face (including dedicated staff in high -volume locations), telephone and vid eo remote interpreter services to our patients in their preferred language for health care. 100% of employed interpreters at HealthPartners have a minimum of 40 hours of professional training. 71% of HealthPartners employed interpreters hold national medi cal interpreting certification. Updated annually, our Language Assistance Plan sets organizational best practices and expectations and is accompanied by the practical Your Guide to Interpreter Services. Your Guide provides answers to questions such as how to access an interpreter and how to talk with patients who wish to rely on family members to interpret. Training is conducted on these tools to support continued improvement in health and experience outcomes. Most recently, it has been further updated to reflect the most current federal government guidance on notification to members and patients on their right to language services (ACA 1557), updated data to reflect our membership, and updated organization structure information. HealthPartners Interpreter Services leaders meet with all contracted agencies as needed to ensure they are meeting service standards and to engage them in improvement activities that support the Triple Aim. Vocera units have been activated and dual handset phones are available at o ur largest hospital to support improved access to and use of telephonic language services. Several clinic sites also made improvements to their infrastructure and workflow to offer improved telephonic language services, and video remote services are available widely throughout our hospitals and clinics. HealthPartners Interpreter Services facilitates the Interpreter Services Leadership Group, a Minnesota - based group of health care interpreter services leaders who meet to share best practices and work towards 243 common goals related to service delivery, quality improvement, education, and affordability of language access services. Interpreter awareness education continues to be offered in multiple new employee settings as a regular part of the agenda, includi ng provider NEO at HealthPartners, HSC NEW, Regions NEO, and New Resident Orientation. HealthPartners member services, sales, case management and other representatives also are trained in how to use telephonic interpreter services. HealthPartners also spon sors several interpreter continuing education workshops each year for both employed and contracted interpreters. In 2022, workshops were offered on (1) building an LGBTQ+ inclusive environment and (2) best practices for health care remote interpreting. HealthPartners interpreters were involved in a number of activities that benefit our patients, members and community. In 2022, these activities included: Participating in community benefit activities, including: o Translating health and financial education materials into Hmong, Spanish, Oromo, Somali and Vietnamese o Providing training to interpreters through two continuing education events o Providing translation and voicemail interpretation services to Diamondhead Clinic, a free school - based program o Making outreach calls to select Somali -speaking patients who are overdue for a mammogram o Providing Spanish interpretation services to patients attending Lactation Caf\u00e9s at several Park Nicollet clinics and Methodist Hospital o Three student interns from Ce ntury College were trained by our staff in 2022. Students were also invited to attend our continuing education events. HealthPartners Government Programs provides an annual virtual interpreter training for contracted interpreters. The training topic for 2 022 was \"Hospital to Home: Safe Discharge Planning.\" The presenters for the training were Sue Oestreich, RN, BSN/PHN, CCM: Director - Care Florence Okoampa, LGSW, CCM: MSHO/MSC+ Program Man ager, Care Advocacy; and Thomas von Sternberg, MD: HealthPartners Associate Medical Director. Participants for the training were eligible to receive 0.15 CEUs through the International Medical Interpreters Association. The tra ining generated good discussions between the participants and presenters. NCQA Health Equity Accreditation: As part of implementing NCQA Health Equity Accreditation standards, HealthPartners deployed surveys to gather information on member and staff exper iences with language services. HealthPartners also surveyed network practitioners on providing culturally responsive care; this survey included questions about practitioner comfort and experience with providing language services to members. o Based on resul ts from the staff survey, we developed a guide to assist health plan staff process requests for written translations, including decision support tips and a step -by-step guide on working with our written translation vendor. Member -facing departments also id entified high -value member - facing documents and completed translated approximately 38 member -facing documents in 2022. o Member experience with language surveys are sent only to Medicaid members, but results are shared with business areas that serve all memb ers so insights can be applied broadly. These surveys 244 assess experience during both health plan and health care encounters at our own care group and beyond. o Practitioner cultural responsiveness survey goes to network practitioners that may provide services to members with any form of HealthPartners coverage. In 2022, survey results provided insights into the need to provide more resources to practitioners on providing culturally responsive care, which led to HP issuing a Health Equity edition of Fast Facts (a newsletter available to all network practitioners). We also collaborated with UCare and Stratis Health to create a website with resources to help providers advance culturally responsive care in their practices: https://culturecareconnection.org/cultural -responsiveness/ . o Staff and member survey results are shared with the enterprise Interpreter Services Workgroup who will continue to assess trends and implement changes around our language services as needed based on year -over -year data. After -visit summary translation: Our static after -visit summary (AVS) content is now available in both Spanish and Vietnamese. We deployed this functionality in Emergency Centers across our system effective August 2021 and in the inpatient setting on February 22, 2023. We continue to col lect user feedback as we move forward for deployment in other settings in 2023. Patient instructions: Through our partnership with Healthwise, more than 3,600 Patient Instructions are now available in Epic in English and Spanish. These instructions can be added to the After Visit Summary/Discharge Instructions and printed for patients. Patient education: Park Nicollet Foundation funded the production of low -literacy versions of patient education content on recognition and management of high and low blood glucose. We received federal funding to translate a variety of preventive services and disease managem ent patient education documents in multiple languages, including Spanish, Somali, Vietnamese and Hmong. In 2023, we plan to translate our colonoscopy prep content, heart failure and Ramadan -focused nutrition patient education content, among a host of other s that we hope will advance health equity. Member Materials & Communications Member materials are created using a consumer -friendly checklist to ensure that communications are understandable, conversational and consistent. The MSHO Summary of Benefit is available in Spanish, Hmong and Somali, or other languages as needed, upon req uest. In addition to the Summary of Benefits, we can translate most materials upon request and in languages other than Spanish, Hmong, and Somali. We also translate some member outreach for preventive health services into Spanish, Hmong, Somali and Vietnam ese. Promotional materials, websites, and blog posts reflect the demographics that exist in the population, making photos racially, ethnically, ability and age diverse. Custom communications developed for some employer groups have been translated to bette r serve our Spanish and Somali speaking members. 245 Open enrollment materials for commercial products are available in Spanish and English. HealthPartners Minnesota Health Care Programs and MSHO: The required DHS Language Block (LB) must be included with a ll member communications and materials.

It is an African American led program designed for pregnant and postpartum Black women. Similarly, members on a Medicaid product receive personalized information about unique benefits such as covered Doula support. 246 Building an Effective Workforce to Support Health Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Twin Cities Pride Festival and March : 115 colleagues volunteered at the festival and walked in the Pride march that was held in -person for the first time since 2019. HealthP artners donated $5,000 to three LGBTQ organizations in the community. Continuous updating of the internal Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) website : As a part of the organization -wide effort to migrate two different internal platforms into one, the DE&I internal website is continuously updated with relevant and timely DEI related information. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Dashboard: Created and shared first ever colleague diversity dashboard that shared the racial experiences of colleagues withi n the organization and specific organizations. Met with all senior leaders and direct reports to share their dashboard with them. Trained HR colleagues on usage of, creation of and understanding of data behind demographic data. Leaders utilize the findings in the dashboard to create annual plans and DEI goals. Inclusive Leader Workshop : a 4 part module offered to leaders build tools to create an inclusive workplace for their teams and the community were serve. Leaders develop skills to have coaching conversations with their teams, learn how to use the equity lens toolkit to bring equity to policies, practices and procedures, and build a DEI strategy for their respective teams. In 2023, we had 14 cohorts complete the training (130 leaders), 50 different app lications of the equity framework, and 15 DEI plans created. Unconscious Bias Training : is offered to all colleagues. This 4 part module deepens our understanding of how unconscious bias can impact others and the work that we do. Colleagues learn to iden tify bias, mitigate bias and how to move beyond bias to actionable anti -racist results. In 2022, there were 38 facilitated sessions (926 colleagues completed 1 session and 113 completed all 4 sessions). Post surveys show significant increase in understandi ng and confidence explaining bias to others. LGBTQ+ Training: Revised available training for colleagues on LGBTQ+ using updated language and more inclusive examples in collaboration with the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion department and the LGBTQ+ colle ague resource group. Colleague Resource Groups: are voluntary, employee -led groups organized around shared underrepresented identities throughout HealthPartners, such as race, gender, age, sexuality, veteran status, and disabilities. Additionally, groups may be organized around shared interests that af firm diversity and inclusion throughout the organization. They help us serve the diverse and individual needs of patients, members and customers, as well as strengthen respect and inclusion in our workplace. In 2022, we had three active groups: Black and African American, LGBTQ+ and leaders of color resource group. Clinician Affinity Groups: similar in nature to colleague resource groups, clinician affinity groups are voluntary, clinician lead groups organized around areas of identities and areas of coll ective interests. DEI Simulations: In efforts to create an anti -racism workplace, HealthPartners pulled together colleagues from Clinical Simulation, Diversity & Inclusion and Nursing education to create scenarios rooted in bias, 247 many created off of actua l colleague experiences, to help others understand how to respond and what to do next in bias situations. Listening Sessions: HealthPartners offered quarterly listening sessions to our staff a panel discussion around areas of diversity. 2022 we held four listening sessions that reflected different dimensions of diversity, including ageism, disability, LGBTQ and being a racial ally. Gender Care Coordination: The Gender Services team has been leading efforts to coordinate patient access and consistent, q uality care and experience across the organization, which has included collaborating with clinicians and teams across multiple departments and locations who provide gender care to patients. This collaboration has focused on multiple areas of gender care a nd created standards of care, patient education materials, and clinician trainings and resources to support quality care. Culture Roots: We have extensive internal communications to build staff understanding and capabilities in cultural humility. The bim onthly \"Culture Roots\" newsletter continues to be an organization -wide educational tool. The Culture Roots subscriber list is currently at 841. Topics for 2022 included addressing breastfeeding disparities, partnering to advance health literacy, eliminating disparities in childhood immunizations, ageism in health care, and improving accessibility to advance health equity. Health Equity Champions: The HealthPartners Health Equity Champions program continued in 2022. The champions are staff members and providers who receive expert training so they can become advocates and serve as local resources for their colleagues in caring for patients from dive rse cultures and those with limited English proficiency. o Nearly 338 Champions were participating by end of 2022; we had 52 new Champions join us this year. o In addition to producing Culture Roots, the Health Equity Champions team distributed announcemen ts to help increase Champions' awareness of and participation of various health -equity - related events and activities. o We continue to use our Teams channel to communicate in real time to share insights, news and announcements. Champions opt -in to this dedi cated Teams space. Currently, 113 members stay connected through this channel. o Our 2022 annual event was held virtually in October. The topic was on ageism. Our presenter was Dr. Rajean Moone, Associate Director of Education at the Center for Healthy Agin g & Innovation at the University of Minnesota. Dr. Moone's presentation included an age -friendly organization assessment tool that we can use to address ageism in our organization's culture, practices and policies. o The Health Equity Champions program held several additional virtual events in 2022. The presentations were well -attended and generated positive feedback. We held four quarterly Teams presentations in 2022 to help Champions stay updated on health equity activities, programs and initiatives happen ing across our system. Each 248 presentation focused on initiatives cascading up to the \"eliminating disparities\" cornerstone of our organization's equity, inclusion and anti -racism work. Topics included health equity research updates, the HealthPartners Child ren's Health Council, using our organization's framework for designing for equity, and our Addressing Health Disparities Maintenance of Certification (MOC) project. We held two \"community organization spotlights,\" designed to highlight organizations that had volunteer opportunities and whose mission aligned with our vision to advance equity and inclusion and eliminate racism. o Champions continued to have opportunities this year to participate in small -group feedback sessions or pilot trainings to lend a diversity lens to various projects we have happening across the organization. Early in 2022, we sent out a survey to Champions asking them about the organizations they volunteer with. This was in partnership with Community Relations. We evaluated the responses to inform how we might proceed with our Volunteer Spotlight presentations done throughout 2022. We sent out an invitatio n in October for Champions to participate in focus groups to discuss member communication for Indigenous populations. Equity, Diversity and Anti -racism website: This is a landing page for our Cabinet and links to our Cornerstone work. The site helps prov ide structure to our work, easily shares information about that work, resources and calls out ways colleagues can get engaged. 249 Assessment of Effectiveness We routinely review and analyze race and ethnicity data to identify, test and implement strategies to reduce disparities in treatment outcomes and service. We have found that developing consistent workflows that help caregivers identify and offer needed services to all patients \u2014and then customizing those services based on cultural, linguistic, socioeconomic or other differences \u2014helps reduce health disparities. Our approach is to continually improve our performance. Following are examples of disparities -reduction initiatives that we continued to refine and improve in 2022. Example #1: Mammography Screening Improvement Accountable owner Paula Indehar - Improvement Specialist Member Populations Targeted x Commercial x Medicare Freedom (Cost) x Medicaid x MSHO x HPUPH x WI Marketplace Description In 2007, we identified disparities in mammography screening rates between patients of color and white patients and between government programs patients and other patients. Since then, we have conducted many interventions to continually improve our performa nce. Interventions included culturally humble scripting on preventive services, same- day mammograms, and telephone outreach to patients of color and government program populations of women ages 50 to 75 who were not up -to-date on a mammogram. We implement focused interventions with consultant support at clinics with the greatest opportunities. For 2020, we continued to work across all families of care with an additional focus of delivering screening mammograms safely within a pandemic. We have 27 location s with onsite mammography and almost all sites offer 3D Technology. We have extended hours at our locations to include weekends and some evenings to accommodate patients' needs. Mammo - a Go -Go truck has added two additional HealthPartners sites to their list of locations they travel to. We had to adjust some of our processes for same day mammography to allow for a safer environment for our patients for screenings. Same day mammograms started back up in September of 2020. Breast Cancer screening Registry out reach was put on hold for a few months but was resumes in October of 2020 and revised the communication we provided sharing the steps we have taken to make it safe to come in for screenings. 250 Our focus for 2021 will be around Access, Innovation and Communication. We want to partner with the Health Equity Saint Paul Anchor strategy cornerstone on building trust with our patients and communities. All this to increase screenings and decrease our d isparity rates for patients of color and government program patients. We continue to learn about how we can best reach our patients and get them in for the screening tests they need. The goals for mammography screening rates are to increase rates for all women and to decrease the disparity in rates between patients of color and white patients (as well as between government program patients and other -insured patients). For 2022, we are continuing to attempt to decrease our disparity gaps between patients o f color and white patients as well as between commercial payor and government plans. We had some challenges with staffing issues as well as women fearing exposure to COVID while visiting our locations for their mammogram. For 2023 our focus continues to be on our disparity gaps between patients of color and white patients as well as our disparity gaps in our commercial payors and government plans. We currently are having staffing challenges which is contributing to our access and availability on weekend s and evenings. Our radiology groups have been actively recruiting and working with schools seeking candidates. We are continuing to offer same day and walk in availability at our sites and working towards a 10% increase from the 2022 totals. We are see ing success in our current outreach to our patients when using the channels of a direct email, text, or letter. Goals Main objective is to close the disparity gaps we are seeing in our women of color vs white women. We will see the impact of this work by seeing a decrease in the gap over the year. We are focusing on women who are 52 -74 years and who have had a mammogram in the last twenty- seven months. We exclude women who have a bilateral mastectomy, deceased, Frail, permanent nursing home resident, an d those currently enrolled in Hospice. As of January 2022, in our care group we have 116,465 eligible women and 78.02% of those women have been screened for Breast Cancer. Patients of color account for 13.5% of the eligible population at a screening rat e of 67.39%. White women account for 85% with a screening rate of 80.02%. The remaining 1.5% have an identified race and are screening at a 57.92% As of January 2023, in our care group has in our care group we have 117,878 eligible women and 81.59% o f those women have been screened for Breast Cancer. Patients of color account for 14.1% of the eligible population at a screening rate of 72.08%. White women account for 84.1% with a screening rate of 83.66%. The remaining 1.7% have an unknown race and are screening at a 58.49%. For our disparity gap between commercial payors and government payors our care group is at a 65.43%. Our commercial payor patients are 91.3% of the eligible population and our government programs patients are 8.7% of the eligibl e population. Initiatives/Interventions This year our initiatives will be focused on recruitment for staffing, offering of the Addressing Health Disparities MOC using Breast Cancer screening for a measure clinician can make improvements to. We worked with the 251 Breast Gap project to produce videos for patients of color on why they matter and what to expect when having a mammogram. We hope to add these into our clinical reminders campaign. We continue to monitor the clinical reminders campaign and look for ways we can optimize the success of the campaign. At the end of 2022 we had an overall conversion rate of 28.6%, our email conversion rate was 31.5%, text conversion rate was 12.7% and the us mail conversion rate was 17.8% We are in the process of translating materials and investigating the oppor tunity to add QR codes to some of our patient education material for breast cancer screening. Barrier Analysis Member/patient barriers include cultural perceptions about health and medical care, role of the individual in health and decision making, socioeconomic factors, language, access to care, lack of understanding of the health care system, and limited health l iteracy. Staff and provider barriers include not understanding cultural beliefs and approaches of patients and members, comfort with using interpreters and translated information, sufficiency of translated information in needed languages, and time to spen d on increasing knowledge and using equitable care resources. Organization and system barriers include: the many competing priorities that are part of a changing health care system, keeping up with best practices, and keeping care and service affordable . I believe we still have some residue with the pandemic barriers which include patients fear of being exposed to COVID/illnesses when in the clinic for mammogram which contributes to delay in care. We have staffing challenges causing a decrease in acces s and availability during the week (evenings and weekends) to mammograms. Gaps in Care Staffing issues that caused us to not offer mammograms in the evening and weekends and contributes to the decrease in capacity of the Mammo A Go Go truck to 65% and the events we can do out in the community. 252 Opportunities for Improvement: Results/Outcomes Breast Cancer Screening by Race Breast Cancer Screening by Payor 253 Example #2: Colorectal Cancer Screening Improvement Accountable owner Greg Fedio, Clinical Project manager Member Populations Targeted X Commercial X Medicare Freedom (Cost) X Medicaid X MSHO X HPUPH X WI Marketplace Description Our goal is to increase colorectal cancer screening rates in patients to at least 80 percent, while also bringing race and payer rates into alignment with the overall population. In order to achieve this goal, we have developed a care model process that allows us to easily and effectively initiate the process, while also taking into accoun t disparities in colorectal screenings and making proactive strides to reduce this gap. Goals Decrease disparity gaps in colorectal cancer screening between patients of color and white patients Decrease disparity gaps in colorectal cancer screening between patients with government insurance and patients with commercial insurance Increase understanding of community needs for colorectal cancer screening Expand projects that focus on closing disparity gaps Improve colorectal cancer screening o utreach and access Improve processes related to electronic medical record Initiatives/Interventions Increasing visibility and stressing the importance of colorectal screenings in patients. A health maintenance modifier is added to a patient's record once they reach the age in which they should begin regular screenings. In 2021, this modifier was updated to reflect the changes in colorectal cancer screening recommendations from the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). It is now active for all patients between the ages of 45 and 75. While completing pre -visit planning nursing staff are pr ompted when a patient is due for a colorectal cancer screening. 254 During the rooming process, our staff use pre -approved scripting to inquire as to whether or not the patient has had screenings, and to offer education on the importance of colorectal screenin gs as well as how the process works. Other tactics we utilize to increase awareness and education for patients include social media postings and advertising on our waiting room monitors in March for Colon Cancer Awareness Month; letter reminders sent to p atients that are due for screenings; and by developing education materials in six different languages to reach a broader patient base. Approximately 8,500 Fecal Immunochemical Tests (FIT) were sent to patients that have never been screened for colorectal c ancer, along with information about the importance of screening. This is a useful tactic in helping increase screening rates while offering patients a non -invasive screening option. Twentynine clinicians took part in a 6 -month long Maintenance of Certifi cation (MOC) project that focused on closing disparity gaps in colorectal cancer screening rates between white patients and patients of color. The project showed success as all screening rates increased and the cohort of participating clinicians was able to increase their screening rates of patients of color at a higher rate than their screening rates of white patients. While these systems have proven effective, we have an expert panel of senior leaders, doctors and researchers that meets twice a year to review evidence and set goals related to colorectal cancer screening. Additionally, we have a multi -disciplinary team that meets on a monthly basis to review data and discuss strategies, in order to continue our progress without stagnating. Barrier Anal ysis Often there are misconceptions about the screening process, and we work to make patients feel comfortable. We demonstrate at -home screening kits, known as FIT (fecal immunochemical test) kits, provide in -room educational materials, and answer questi ons about colonoscopy and FIT screening options. When the patient agrees to the services, our staff orders the screening. If they do not agree to the screening, the clinician will re - affirm the importance of colorectal screenings. If the FIT test is the sc reening method chosen, and a patient completes the test, the patient will be automatically mailed a follow up kit in a year. In addition, a letter will be sent to the patient after the kit has been mailed, if they have not returned the kit within 2 weeks. Gaps in Care As a result of the efforts mentioned, colorectal screening percentage for patients of color at HealthPartners Medical Group has gone from 43% in 2009, to 61.7% percent by end of 2022. These rates increased from 2020 to 2021, despite the continued pandemic. This data speaks to the fact that our systems are making an impact on improving the number of screenings. 255 Opportunities for Improvement -Results/Outcomes Colorectal Cancer Screening by Race Definition: All patients: Percent patients who have been screened for colorectal cancer by Colonoscopy in the last 10 years, Flexible Sigmoidoscopy in the last 5 years, and/or Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT) or Fecal Colorectal Screening (FIT) in the last 12 months. Patients of color: Eligible patients of color, African Americans and Native Americans age 46- 75, who have been screened for colorectal cancer by Colonoscopy in the last 10 years, Flex Sig in the last 5 years, or FOBT/FIT in the last 12 months. 69.2%75.2% 43.0%61.7% 0.0%20.0%40.0%60.0%80.0%100.0% 1st Qtr 2009 4th Qtr 2022 Patients are white Patients of colorGap is 26.2%Gap is 13.5% 256 Example #3: Addressing Health Disparities Maintenance of Certification (MOC) Project Accountable owner Greg Fedio, Clinical Project manager Member Populations Targeted X Commercial X Medicare Freedom (Cost) X Medicaid X MSHO X HPUPH X WI Marketplace Description Maintenance of Certification (MOC) projects have proven to be effective tools to help improve quality metrics while enabling clinicians to meet their ongoing specialty board requirements. In 2021, HealthPartners launched a new MOC project focused on closi ng health disparity gaps between patients of color and white patients. Goals Define the role bias management, cultural humility, and social determinants of health play in reducing health disparities in personal practice. Analyze and identify health disp arities that exist within personal practice. Adopt strategies, tools and resources to close health equity gaps in selected focus areas of practice. Report an increase in health equity by reducing health disparities in selected focus areas. (Asthma, Brea st cancer screening, Colorectal cancer screening or Child Immunizations) Initiatives/Interventions Participating clinicians were provided with educational videos to enhance their knowledge and enhance their ability to close health disparity gaps. Video subject matter included: o Information on Health disparities and health disparity work at HealthPartne rs o Social Determinants of HealthPartners o Three modules on Bias o Specific information related to their measure of choice (Asthma, Breast cancer screening, Colorectal cancer screening or Child Immunizations) Participants were provided with lists of eligible patients of color and monthly updates on their metric(s). Based upon the curricula and the patient lists, providers had the freedom to implement interventions of their choice to help close disparity gaps. 257 Barrier Analysis There continues to be substantial barriers to the work to close health disparity gaps. Clinicians brought up well - known existing barriers such as time, resources, and insurance. Clinicians also were able to utilize their learnings from the project to ide ntify other barriers such as systemic racism, language proficiency, their own biases, and social determinants of health. Gaps in Care Clinician feedback suggested that without improvements to social determinants of health, gap closure was difficult to o btain. Through this pilot other opportunities that have been identified are: The importance of learning the patient's story Involving the whole team (hall nurse, care coordinator, MTM) is vital to make progress Clinician confidence in overcoming barriers to close disparity gaps fluctuates and varies. Opportunities for Improvement -Results/Outcomes Overall, the MOC is a tangible way to connect the dots between equity work and quality. This is evidenced by: Disparity gap closure in breast cancer screening and colorectal cancer screening metrics Clinicians improved their ability to identify barriers and apply resources Clinicians improved their knowledge of equity and bias related topics Most clinicians reported making changes to their practice as a result of the project Most clinicians feel they can sustain progress 258 259 Example #4: Immunization Disparities Improvement Accountable owner Alison Salita, Quality and Measurement Member Populations Targeted X Commercial Medicare Freedom (Cost) X Medicaid MSHO HPUPH WI Marketplace Description The primary functions of the Immunization Disparities Workgroup are to (1) increase and maintain vaccination completion rates of childhood immunizations and adolescent immunizations, and (2) reduce disparities in our vaccination completion rates, for Race and Payor, across all Familie s of Care including the HP Health Plan, which include HPMG, Hutchinson, Olivia, Park Nicollet and the Valley/Western Wisconsin. Goals Goals are still being determined for 2022. We believe there will be an overall goal for the total population and a gap c losure goal in addition. Interventions for reducing disparities with immunizations include: Coordination of existing work across the organization that is focused on improving vaccination rates. o Continued education on best practice check list for immuniza tions and well child visits o Clinician and staff education available around vaccine hesitancy, o Participation in the MDH Childhood Immunization Workgroup specifically focusing on health disparities in childhood immunizations o Participation in No Shots No School campaign, 25th year o Partnering with the Health Plan on immunization campaigns including Medicaid outreach for Overdue Well Child and immunizations o Translation of Immunization materials into top 4 languages o Partnership with OB on educating mom prenat ally about the importance of immunizing infants Immunization and Well Child Outreach Registries o Continue to produce overdue immunization and well child lists for sites to review and do additional outreach 260 o Clinical reminders team outreach for all ages for overdue well child visits started in September 2022 (email, text) translations and 3rd option for outreach happening in 2023 o Clinical reminders for immunizations will happen in 2023 o Participating in the MDH overdue immunization texting program Maintenance of Certification/CME opportunities: o Offered Addressing Health Disparities MoC - Childhood Immunization Track - did not see the results we had hoped for with regards to closing the disparity gaps in this cohort. o Offered MoC for improvement of ov erall rates for Combo 10 and Combo 2 vaccines, although there was a slight decline in overall rates during the project, the decreases happened at a much smaller rate than overall clinician population and we saw decreases in 3 out of 4 disparity gaps with t he MoC cohort. Barrier Analysis Member and patient barriers may include: Cultural perceptions or misconceptions around vaccines. There can be cultural differences that make it more challenging to complete the course of certain vaccines, such as MMR and HPV. Anti-vaccine movements exist in pockets. In these cases, families are choosing not to vaccinate their children at all Confusion and myths related to COVID vaccine in children have increased vaccine hesitancy with all childhood immunizations. Antic ipation of COVID vaccines for children has led to delaying other routine vaccinations. Access Staff and provider barriers include: Standard rooming is not standard within families of care or across the organization. Consequently, standard rooming audits have revealed that HMAs are not always being reviewed and/or offered at the appropriate times. Variation can occur in the way providers or staff introduce vaccines to the patient and the family, allowing the family to think certain vaccines are cons idered \"optional.\" (For instance, some clinicians may simply be omitting the non -school required vaccines in the discussion.) 261 Opportunities for Improvement: Results/Outcomes While we saw a decrease in rates for both childhood and adolescent immunizations in the first half of 2022 (national and statewide trend), as a result of these efforts we saw our rates start to rebound in August of 2022, and we have continued to increase a nd maintain those rates throughout the remainder of 2022. We believe this rebound in multifactorial. This is probably the result of children under 2 years catching up on well child visits and immunizations. We continue to have access issues due to staff ing which could be contributing to slow rebound. Prevalent and early influenza season in 2022 could explain the higher rate of influenza vaccination in younger population. We decreased both Race and Payor gaps over the course of 2022. We surpassed our goal for race in childhood imms and made progress in our payor gap to goal as well. Community needs and community partnerships: Minnesota school project, review, learn, expand - work with school districts on vaccine clinics - like Moundsview did for COVID vaccine, expand to other vaccines as well \"Catch Up\" clinic opportunities - can we focus on areas where we see the most disparities in outcomes and create pop up clinics to provide vaccine services - resource dependent, may need to partner with the S tate of County to achieve Peds SW partnership - understanding from those doing the work where the biggest gaps with the community are Dental partnership around HPV to reduce oropharyngeal cancers IHI project with Somali community coming in 2023 Improving Immunization outreach Work with the digital products team to shift and expand outreach to clinical reminders team, Imms coming in 2023 Encourage sites to utilize the Overdue Immunization site lists for phone outreach when other methods have not worked Continue MDH partnership for overdue immunization texting Projects focused on increasing overall rates and decreasing disparity gaps Work to improve and expand \"Addressing Health Disparities\" MOC Project for childhood immunizations will be ava ilable in 2023 Combo 2 and Combo 10 MoC projects will be available in 2023 Vaccinate children at every opportunity (WCC, acute visits, UC) Continued work with Dental on HPV vaccination Leverage Best Practice check list to increase your measure Starting wo rk on Rise to Immunize - adult vaccinations 262 Improving data and Epic related processes Simplification of HMA with new ACIP recommendations Simplification of contraindications screening questionnaire in EPIC Leverage Quick Schedule for efficient and accurat e follow -up for delayed or series based vaccinations New Immunizations Analysis will transition to PowerBI in 2023 - will enable us to slice and dice data in different ways, much more robust than the current HBI highlight 263 264 265 Appendix 5: Access Assessment - Medical 266 2022 Access Assessment Medical Care Background To ensure timely access to care, HealthPartners establishes standards, collects data and assesses performance against the standards, identifies improvement opportunities, implements improvement strategies and monitors performance annually. HealthPartners is committed to ensuring services are available in a timely manner. This assessment includes both commercial and marketplace (Wisconsin). Analysis of Performance against Standards 1. Routine, Non- Urgent , Symptomatic Appointments Standard: As soon as members want Goal: 88% of members report they always or usually received access as soon as they wanted (90th percentile for commercial) Dates of Service: 2019 -2021 Measurement Dates: 2020 -2022 Methodology: CAHPS 5.1 Survey Analysis: Striving to meet goal The goal decreased two points from 90% to 88% for 2022 which is equivalent to 90th percentile performance nationally in the Commercial CAHPS survey. Although Commercial performance increased three percent it is still performing slightly below the goal. The Marketplace performance declined slightly from 82% to 79% also putting it you got appointment for a check -up or routine care at a doctor's office or clinic as soon as you wanted Marketplace Commercial267 Barriers: The COVID -19 pandemic continued to burden care systems network wide in 2022. Staffing challenges created substantial constraints around access to care for all systems and members of all products. In 2022 as COVID positivity rates declined patients began r esuming preventive care schedules and catching up on care that had previously been delayed or deferred. An annual review of the Practitioner Availability Report indicates that our primary care network meets availability standards, assessed using distance t o a provider, for commercial and Marketplace. As a result, we would conclude that practitioner availability is not a barrier to access to specialty care. However, it appears appointment availability is not meeting member expectations. The CAHPS question wording asks about access to appointments 'as soon as wanted/needed' The subjective nature of the wording leaves it open to individual interpretation which varies from person to person and makes it difficult to quantify from a system perspective. 2. Urgent Car e Office Visits Standard: As soon as members want Goal: 92% of members report they always or usually received access as soon as they wanted (90th percentile for commercial) Dates of Service: 2019 -2021 Measurement Dates: 2020 -2022 Methodology: CAHPS 5.1 Survey Analysis: Striving to meet goal The goal for 2022 decreased two percent to 92% in 2022 which is equivalent to the 90th percentile nationally in the Commercial CAHPS survey. Neither Commercial nor Marketplace met the goal. Though still below goal, Commercial performance continues to trend in the right direction, increasing one percent from 88% in you got care as soon as needed when you need care right away Marketplace Commercial268 After a decline in 2021 Marketplace performance saw a slight increase improving one percent and going from 78% in 2021 to 79% in 2022. The gap between Marketplace and Commercial remains at 10% as it was in 2021. Barriers: The burden placed on care systems by the COVID -19 pandemic applies to urgent care as much as it does routine care when it comes to capacity and staffing. While video visits are an option in some urgent care settings, they are not as prevalent as video visit options for routine care. Even when members have options for getting care right away, some members may not be inclined to use a new service or even seek care at a different clinic. Members who do not like or do not feel that video visits adequately address their needs for care may choose to wait a few extra days or a week for an in- person visit. Staffing challenges lead to changing hours and in some cases availability of urgent care locations which often result in significant wait times for patients. 3. After -Hours Care Standard: As soon as members want Goal: 70% of members report they always or usually were able to get advice or care after regular clinic hours as soon as you needed Dates of Service: 2019 -2021 Measurement Dates: 2020 -2022 Methodology: CAHPS 5.1 Survey (custom question) Analysis: Striving to meet goal At 65% Commercial still falls below the goal of 70% but has increased two percent over the 2021 score. This measure is from a custom question in the Commercial CAHPS survey and parallels you got advice or care after regular clinic hours (Commercial only)269 CAHPS questions that assess access to routine care and urgent car e. This question is not included in the Marketplace or QHP CAHPS survey. Barriers: There is no national benchmark, such as from CAHPS, to help establish the goal for access to after-hours care. The HealthPartners CareLine operates 24/7 and is available to all members. CareLine nurses help callers choose the most appropriate care option, whether it's an Urgent Care clinic, Emergency Room or a scheduled appointment with a doctor. The registered nurses also consult on- call physicians. To ensure that they obtained care and to offer them further assistance, follow -up calls are made to patient s who have been directed to an Urgent Care or Emergency Room. In addition to the CareLine, members also have plan- wide access to Urgent Care clinics. Member awareness of the CareLine, as well as preferences or habits about where to seek advice after clinic hours is a potential barrier. Members using contracted clinics may be more likely to call their medical group's after -hours service. Those services may be more difficult to reach or more likely to use answering services than the CareLine, which could infl uence member satisfaction with availability. 4. Access to Primary Care Standard: Access when needed Goal: N/A Dates Patient Experience Digital Survey 270 Analysis: As a supplement to our CAHPS surveys, we continue to monitor access to care for our network through the HealthPartners Patient Experience Digital Survey which gathers member feedback related to the following question: \"Were you able to get an appointment at this provider's office when you needed it?\" In addition to being a closer look at access for key in- network care systems, this question also informs our annual cost and quality assessment that awards a star rating based on provider performance. Many of our provider contracts have incentive programs to maintain a high star rating. We also track whether providers are accepting new patients. Both the star rating and \"accepting new patients\" st atus is available to members when they search our Find Care network directory online. A review of the results of the Patient Experience Digital survey shows that top box scores range from 77% -96% in 2022 which is down from 2021 where scores on the access measure ranged from 88%-100%. Of the 19 care systems reported in 2022, 9 have bottom box scores of 0%. For the other ten, bottom box scores range from 1- 6% of respondents indicate they were not able to get an appointment. No negative trends were identified at the group level with any individual group, so no further follow - up is needed at the practice level. The Patient Experience Digital Survey continues to show a more positive view of access to care than the CAHPS survey results. This is likely due in part to the timing of the survey (closer to the appointment than CAHPS) and also the link to a specific appointment rather than access to care more generally as asked in the CAHPS PALAKEVIEW CLINIC, LTDNORTH MEMORIAL HEALTH CARE2022 Patient Experience Digital Survey Were you able to get an appointment at this provider's office when you needed it? % Yes, Definitely % Yes, Somewhat % No271 Plan for Improvement In addition to continuing to monitor, analyze and interpret member satisfaction and complaints to understand trends and member expectations and to evaluate the impact of improvement activities, the following have also been identified as plans for improvement. Support For Virtual Care Channels Continue to offer and promote virtual options beyond the pandemic to maximize access to care and minimize barriers to care. Support members who've developed a preference for virtual care channels. Clarify language about virtual care in member materials and on the website to reflect the prominence of these care modalities. Personalization Campaigns Use segmentation and personalization to simplify care and coverage and encourage members to stay up to date on their care. This includes the My Pregnancy digital experience for members who ar e pregnant, campaigns to encourage members to get routine preventive care as well as campaigns that proactively identify members at increased risk of chronic conditions to help them make decisions about where to go when care needs occur. And to educate mem bers who've used the ER when they could have gone to Urgent Care about the care needs that can be treated at urgent care, so they select the most appropriate site of care in the future. Through marketing and member communications, build member awareness of CareLine nurse triage program as a 24/7 service. Online Accounts & Tools Development of next available appointment scheduling capabilities beginning with colon cancer screenings and primary care appointments Ongoing optimization to the online scheduling experience including rolling out additional specialties. Continued roll out of quick scheduling and quick referral scheduling options. Actions Taken 1. In an effort to create flexibility for members and patients and to alleviate call volume from clinics and t he appointment center, the HealthPartners Web & Mobile team improved ease of use within the Find Care and scheduling functions and expanded the access to online scheduling through HealthPartners.com. a. Increased member communication and education related to finding in- network care. b. Filters have been added to the Find Care tool on HealthPartners.com for race/ethnicity for doctors, information on language services and added in- network/cost level status plus link to benefits in results list. c. Continue enhancements to the Find Care experience as well as efforts around online account creation and increase member awareness and use of myHealthPartners, our mobile app, and HealthPartners.com to search for care locations, schedule appointments and check urgent care wait times. d. Ensure information about appointment availability on the web site is accurate and consistent. 2. The Patient Access team regularly reviews scheduling templates to maximize appointment availability and adjust hours within the HealthPartners family of care. Key actions taken as a result of these reviews in 2022 that will carry over into 2023 include: 272 a. Urgent access strategies which are used to assess care demand within a week and build capacity for ease of scheduling. b. Dedicated specialty scheduling and a single scheduling phone number c. E-consults, an internal pathway that allows patients to receive timely specialist recommendations for lower complexity care needs. d. Emergency Department/Hospital Discharge scheduling to as sist patients at the point of discharge with scheduling for follow -up care needs. e. Triage consult and follow -up care for non- urgent care needs. 273 Appendix 6: Access Assessment - Telephone 274 2022 Member Services Telephone Access Assessment Accountable Ow ner Member Services - Michelle Anderson Riverview Member Services - Kate Sahnow Member Populations Targeted X Commercial Medicare Advantage/Cost/PDP Medicaid MSHO X HPUPH X WI Marketplace Background To ensure timely member access to care and service, HealthPartners establishes standards, collects data and assesses performance against the standards, identifies improvement opportunities, implements improvement strategies and monitors performance annuall y. HealthPartners is committed to ensuring services are available in a timely manner. This report is focused on our commercial, HPUPH and marketplace business. Analysis of Performance Against Standards Table 1 Telephone Service Goal: Average speed of answer 30 seconds or less Abandonment rate 3.0% or less for calls Dates of Service: CentreVu Call Management System Table 2 Data Commercial including Marketplace Year Call volume* Average speed of answer for member calls Member abandonment rate 2020 923,867 86 seconds 4% 2021 132 seconds *Call volumes include both member and provider calls received; starting in 2022, this also includes calls to our Behavioral Health Navigators. Analysis: Results include all our commercial business including Marketplace. 275 Call volumes increased in 2022 ac ross all lines of business. The average speed of answer and abandonment rates continued to increase. The goals for speed of answer and abandonment rate for member calls were not met for commercial and marketplace. Barriers: 1. The COVID -19 pandemic continued to have several impacts on our service level. 2. The time to handle a call increased due to both complexity and staff tenure impacts, with average hold timeincreasing by 20 seconds from 2021 to 2022. 3. Members were impacted by l imited access to providers for their care, as well as having difficulty being able to reach their providers to address other concerns. This resulted in more complexity in the calls Member Services received, as we sought to remove members from the middle. However, providers offices with reduced staff made for very long hold times pulling team members off incoming calls to resolve member concerns. 4. While ongoing efforts are being made to reduce the amount of provider calls coming into our contact centers, these calls continue to be a high percentage of all calls received in member services. Provider calls still accounted for 25% of total calls received in 2022. 5. COVID- 19 brought calls related to testing, the vaccine, submitting out of network claims as well as over-the-counter test reimbursements. 6. Throughout the year various organizational challenges caused unexpected increases in member calls, including but not limited to, claim adjustment projects, mismailed documents, system down time, and premium relat ed complaints with the transition to a new bank which impacted many departments in addition to Riverview Member Services. 7. There were more unplanned absences among representatives than anticipated. 8. Chat interactions continue to be popular with members, and is the most resource intensive communication channel. To provide needed support to our phone lines, the option to chat was strategically shut down at times, however, the automated chatbot \"Harper\" (launched 7/19/22) was still available to address basic member chat inquiries. 9. Overall Commercial Member Services email volumes increased by 18% and Riverview Member Services email volumes increased by 34% from 2021 to 2022, creating the need to pull additional staff from answering calls, to shift to respondi ng to emails. 10. We continue to experience high turnover and we are challenged by the employment market and the difficulty in finding people to hire andretain. 11. There is a significant lead time and learning curve to get new employees up to speed, having a direct impact on our average handle time. At the end of 2022, Commercial Member Services had over 34% and Riverview Member Services had 57% of their representatives with less than one year of tenure. Initiatives/Interventions: 276 1. New retention strategies impl emented in 2022 for Riverview Member Services, related to the mentor program to provide additional support to the new employees. Commercial Member Services is currently piloting similar strategy changes in 2023. 2. While Riverview Member Services converted to 100% remote team members since 2020, Commercial Member Services now offers fully -remote work from day 1 for new hires as of July 2022. 3. Offered overtime to contact center representatives to provide additional phone staffing. 4. Strategically closed chat at times in effort to improve phone service levels. 5. Ongoing cross -functional workgroup to improve digital adoption and reduce inbound phone calls from providers. 6. Continued utilization of a work queue for outbound calls to providers, allowing off -phone team members to multitask while waiting on hold. 7. Compensation adjustment introduced in May 2022 as retention strategy, as well as recognition of the importance and complexity of the work . 8. Ongoing analysis of phone statistical data, leveraging phone technology and making adjustments as needed to impact service levels. 9. Continue working to enhance the web to promote member self -service. We recognize the resulting impact could be that the interactions the contact centers receive will be more complex in nature (sinc e members would be able to self -serve on the \"simple things\"), resulting in an increased average handle time for calls. 277 Appendix 7: Assessment of Behavioral Health Access 278 Assessment of Behavioral Health Access Report Date: November 2022 Analysis Date: 2021 Accountable Owner: Mary Holland, Behavioral HealthPartners Member Populations Targeted: Commercial & WI Marketplace Data Collection HealthPartners measures the adequacy of access to behavioral health care through a member satisfaction survey as well as through an analysis of complaints regarding behavioral health services. These approaches explore access to the following care: 1. Care for a non -life-threatening emergency w ithin 6 hours. 2. Urgent care within 48 hours. 3. Initial visits for routine care within 10 business days. 4. Follow -up routine care. Behavioral Health Access Survey The HealthPartners Behavioral Health Access survey is conducted annually and alternates between s urveying adult members and surveying child/ adolescent members each year. For each survey, a random stratified sample is drawn from the pool of members who had two consecutive outpatient behavioral health appointments at the same clinic system in the 12- month measurement period. The sample size is selected with a goal to achieve a 95% confidence interval with plus or minus 5 percentage points of error. In 2021, the survey focused on behavioral health care for adults and surveys were sent to eligible adult members. 2021 was the third year (2019 and 2017) survey data has been gathered on the satisfaction of access to behavioral health care for adults. Results were by type of care - emergency, urgent, and routine, -as well as by type of provider - prescriber vs. non- prescriber. Complaints regarding Behavioral Healthcare HealthPartners also conducts an analysis of complaints received from members, including complaints that are specific to behavioral health. Complaints are gathered and reviewed annually to identify issues or improvement opportunities regarding behavioral health. Quantitative Analysis Behavioral Health Access Survey Quantitative analysis of member satisfaction rates (percentage of members who responded \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\") by type of care - emergency, urgent, and routine - gathered through the 2021 Behavioral Health Access survey revealed the following outcomes and conclusions: Table 1: Care within 6 hours in a non- life-threatening emergency Provider Goal 2021 2019 2017 Prescribers 85% 70.6 55.6 279 Non-Prescribers 85% 46.9 55.6 55.3 Conclusion: Goal Not Met for both Prescribers and Non- Prescribers - In 2021, 62.5% of survey respondents were satisfied with the ability to get care from prescribers and 46.9% of respondents were satisfied with the ability to get care from non- prescribers within 6 hours in a non- life-threatening emergency. These rates w ere both lower than they were in 2019 and both fell below the goal of 85%. Table 2: Care within 48 hours when there was an urgent need Provider Goal 2021 2019 Prescribers and Non- Prescribers - In 2021, 60.7% of survey respondents were satisfied with the ability to get care from prescribers and 54.9% of respondents were satisfied with the ability to get care from non- prescribers within 48 hours when there was an urgent need. These rates were both lower than they were in 2019 and both fell below the goal of 85%. Table 3: Appointments within 10 days Provider Goal Non- Prescribers - In 2021, 76.9% of survey respondents were satisfied with the availability of convenient appointments with prescribers and nearly 78.9% of respondents were satisfied with the availability of convenient appointments for non - prescribers. These rates were b oth lower than they were in 2019 and both fell below the goal of 85%. Table 4: Length of time between scheduling and the day of an initial appointment Provider Goal 2021 2019 and Non- Prescribers - In 2021, 66.7% of survey respondents were satisfied with the length of wait time between scheduling the initial appointment and the day of the visit for care with prescribers and 65.4% of respondents were satisfied with this wait time 280 for non- prescribers. These rates were both lower than they were in 2019 and both fell below the goal of 85%. Table 5: Length of time between scheduling and the day of follow -up appointments Provider Goal and Non -Prescribers - In 2021, 72.9% of survey respondents were satisfied with the length of wait time between scheduling ongoing appointments and the day of the visit for care for prescribers and 76.5% of respondents were satisfied with this wait time for non- prescribers. Thes e rates were both lower than they were in 2019 and both fell below the goal of 85%. Additional quantitative analysis of member satisfaction by type of provider also revealed the following: Prescribers o Appointments within 10 days was the type of care/survey area of highest satisfaction in 2021. o Urgent care was the type of care/survey area of lowest member satisfaction in 2021. o Whereas members' satisfaction for nearly all types of care/survey areas for prescribers increased from 2017 to 2019, all areas decreased in satisfaction from 2019 to 2021. Non-Prescribers o Appointments within 10 days was the type of care/survey area of highest satisfaction in 2021. o Non-life-threatening emergency care was the type of care/survey area of lowest member satisfa ction for non- prescribers in 2021. o Whereas members' satisfaction for nearly all types of care/survey areas for prescribers increased from 2017 to 2019, all areas decreased in satisfaction from 2019 to 2021. Complaints regarding Behavioral Healthcare In 2021, HealthPartners received 550 complaints from members regarding behavioral health care and benefits. Majority of these complaints were not regarding access to behavioral health care but rather were regarding benefits, coverage, and billing of behavioral health care. Of the total volume of complaints, 60 were regarding access to behavioral health care, such as the availability of providers or wait time to get into a behavioral health appointment. To understand the access issues being reported through compl aints, an analysis of those 60 complaints was completed at the practitioner level to determine the volume of complaints by clinic systems. 23 of the 60 complaints revealed dissatisfaction toward a particular clinic system whereas the remaining complaints w ere not directed at a particular clinic system but revealed general dissatisfaction and difficulty identifying and accessing behavioral health care. The breakdown of the 23 complaints that did identify a clinic system revealed the following volumes: 281 Table 6: Behavioral Health Access Complaints per Clinic System Clinic Systems # of Access Complaints Allina 1 Fairview 0 HealthPartners 9 Nystrom & Associates 2 Park Nicollet 2 Other Direct Access Network in Twin Cities metro area 9 Other Direct Access Network in MN, excluding the groups above 0 Conclusions: Majority of the complaints received regarding access to behavioral health care pertained to the HealthPartners clinic system, with only a few complaints directed at other major clinic systems such as Allina, Nystrom & Associates, and Park Nicollet. Other complaints directed at smaller metro clinics were found to be limited to 1 per clinic. These clinics were categorized as \"Other Direct Access Network in Twin Cities metro area.\" No complaints were found to be directed at Minnesota clinic systems outside of the metro. o The complaints directed at HealthPartners centered around: o Wait times to see a provider o Protocols around inability to schedule an appointment due to missing previous appointments Qualitative Analysis Behavioral Health Access survey results and complaint trends were reviewed by the following HealthPartners' committees to analyze issues, barriers, and potential opportunities for improvement: HealthPartners' Member Focused Behavioral Health Group which includes representatives of major behavioral health care delivery systems in Minnesota, including Park Nicollet, Associated Clinics of Psychology, and Minnesota Mental Health Clinics who are licensed mental health professionals. HealthPartners Behavioral Health Quality, Utilization, and Improvement Strategic Oversight Committee, a team composed of leaders throughout HealthPartners including Behavioral Health Case Management; Utilization Management; Provider Relations and Netw ork Management; Care Delivery and Medical Directors. Issues/Barriers Emergency and Urgent Care Patients' definition and perception of an emergent or urgent behavioral health need may not only differ from what providers would determine to be emergent or urgent but may also have changed or increased in recent years with stressors related to COVID, racial injustice, and politics. 282 While clinics may have staffing to field calls in real time, they may not have a practitioner available to field patient calls that are more urgent in nature, leaving members feeling as though care is not readily available to them through their preferred/established clinic for more immediate needs. Clinics work to get members into appointments as soon as possible and some have a small number of reserved appointments for patients with emergency needs, but many clinics are not set -up for members to attend appointments on a walk -in/as needed or emergency basis. Therefore, patients with urgent/emergent needs are deferred to the hospital where capacity may also be limited. Routine Care Providers' - both prescribers and non- prescribers - availability for initial and follow -up appointments has decreased as more people are seeking and utilizing behavioral health care and as patients are utilizing care more frequently due to increased needs and acuity. Provider availability has also been impacted by workforce volumes. With increased utilization, providers are experiencing fatigue or burnout, leading to reductions/changes in practitioners' hours or changes in jobs. Additionally, the number of new practitioners may be changing/reduced as qualified professionals are recruited into other roles where pay, work hours, and training requirements are more accommodating. Opportunities Review and revise payment models to better align with treatment approaches to adequately address complex conditions such as trauma, psychosis, and autism spectrum disorders that require more extensive and intensive training, experience, and provision of care by providers and that may lead to a need for more immediate care when symptoms arise. Embed social work or care coordination support within clinics or streamline referral processes to care coordination services that will allow providers to focus on treatment while also ensuring corresponding needs of patients can also be appropriately addressed. Explore and train scheduling staff on how to best access appointment availability through websites and search engines, as it is available. Gain further insight into survey respondent from new, various perspectives, such as patient vs. members or by care group as survey responses and comments imply that respondents may be confused about the orientation of the survey (plan vs. provider) and res ponses are currently unable to determine satisfaction and dissatisfaction rates by clinic system. Integrate behavioral health care with primary care to address health in a holistic manner and keep care as available as possible to patients. 283 Appendix 8: Assessment of New Member Understanding 284 New Member Understanding Assessment Production Date: March 28, 2023 Background HealthPartners is committed to ensuring members have a positive experience. To complement the CAHPS survey, we conduct a Mem ber Experience Survey to obtain more detailed feedback about members' experience with: Understanding of coverage and benefit information Using Member Services Getting prescription drugs Understanding claims information and statements The above measures are central to all members' experience with the plan. These measures may be even more important to new members. To conduct this survey, a random sample is generated of adult commercial members who have recently called Member Services, f illed a prescription, or received an explanation of benefits (EOB). Members who have been enrolled in the plan for a minimum of six months without these experiences are also included. The sample frame includes NCQA -accredited products and contains roughl y 160,000 members. A nine- minute phone survey is fielded and a minimum of 950 members, including 300 new members, are surveyed twice a year except for 2020 where members were only surveyed once due to the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic. New members are s egmented to follow their experience and for comparison to returning members' experience. This analysis is supplemented with a review of a smaller set of responses from Marketplace members (minimum of 30 responses annually). Our measurement of new member understanding of the plan encompasses four main dimensions: 1) understanding information about coverage and benefits 2) understanding the amount needed to pay out -of- pocket before getting care 3) understanding coverage for preventive care and 4) understandi ng information about pharmacy benefits. HealthPartners monitors performance against standards, identifies improvement opportunities, implements improvement strategies, and monitors performance quarterly. HealthPartners is committed to ensuring its new members understand their coverage and know how to use the fundamental services of their plan. An annual analysis of the results follows. Analysis of Performance I. Understanding information about coverage and benefits Standard Plan information for new members is easy to understand. Goal 85% of new members agree that plan information is very easy + somewhat easy to understand. Dates of Service 2020 - 2022 Dates of Measurement 2020 - 2022 Methodology HealthPartners Member Experience Survey 285 *Note, low sample size for Marketplace Analysis: Exceeded Goal Ninety percent of commercial members find it easy to understand their coverage and benefit information. Scores for the last three years show slow but steady positive progress. All marketplace members surveyed find it easy to understand coverage and benefit information. HealthPartners continues to promote the advantages of registering for an online account to new members. In 2022 the percentage of Commercial group members who said they have an online account in our Member Experience Survey increased significantly and is now more than seven in ten respondents. 52% of new members have an online account. Barriers: As employers seek solutions to help address the high cost of health care, many look to high- deductible plans and or health plans paired with a health savings or health reimbursement account as a means of managing costs. While these plans can yield savings, they often require an increased level of engagement from consumers because of the increased complexity associated with them. Plans with high deductibles and those with accounts (FSA, HRA, HSA), require consumers to understand what a deductible, out -of-pocket maximum, annual maximum, and co- insurance are, as well as how t hey work together. HealthPartners isn't always able to provide new members with consumer -friendly communication materials since some employers and/or brokers provide plan materials to the employees directly. II. Understanding the amount needed to pay out-of-pocket for care, before getting care Standard Out-of-pocket costs for care are easy for new members to understand, before getting care. Goal 85% of new members agree that is very easy + somewhat easy to understand the amount needed to pay out -of-pocket for care, before getting care Dates of Service 2020 - 2022 Dates of Measurement 2020 - 2022 Methodology it to understand the information from HealthPartners about your coverage and benefits? Commercial Marketplace286 *Note, low sample size for Marketplace Analysis: Striving to Meet Goal After increasing in 2021, scores for Commercial members remained steady in 2022. Results for Marketplace members continue to surpass those of commercial members at 100% for 2022. New members outscore continuing members by 10% when it comes to understandi ng the amount they will need to pay before receiving care. Barriers: Consumer awareness of the ability to access cost information from the plan and where to find it is low. Cost information available to consumers is often reported as an estimate or is too high- level to be meaningful to consumers. Consumers desire personalized, out -of-pocket cost information. Limited provider awareness of and access to cost information. Lack of cost information at point -of-service (clinic, hospital, etc.). HealthPartner s centralized consumer cost tools and resources on the financial hub of HealthPartners.com in late 2022, making this information more accessible to consumers. III. Understanding coverage for preventive care Standard Preventive care information for new me mbers is easy to understand. Goal 85% of new members agree that preventive care information is very easy + somewhat easy to understand Dates of Service 2020 - 2022 Dates of Measurement 2020 - 2022 Methodology is it to understand the amount you will need to pay for care, before going for care? Commercial Marketplace287 *Note, low sample size for Marketplace Analysis: Exceeded Goal 91% of Commercial members find it very or somewhat easy to understand their preventive care coverage. Results for Commercial members continue to exceed the goal and show a slight improvement over 2021. 2022 results for Marketplace members also exceed the goal and remain stable for understanding preventive care. The difference in results between Commercial and Marketplace members is not statistically significant. The score for new m embers is comparable with that of returning members. Much of the consistency in scores across new and continuing members is attributed to the plan's continued efforts to register new members for an online HealthPartners account, where specific, personalized coverage information is easily accessed. Barriers: Differences between industry -definition of preventive screenings and consumers' impressions of what should be included under the umbrella of 'preventive' cause confusion. Members are surprised and diss atisfied when they seek care for something they believe to be preventive, and feel should be covered as preventive but are not. Benefits paid can vary depending upon medical history and the actual procedures/services provided during the office visit. Confusion related to preventive services is particularly challenging for members with high deductible plans who are responsible for the non- preventive services costs until their deductible is met. IV. Understanding the amount needed to pay for covered medici nes. Standard The amount to pay for covered medicines is easy to understand. Goal 85% of new members agree that the amount to pay for covered medicines is very easy + somewhat easy to understand Dates of Service 2020 - 2022 Dates of Measurement 2020 - 2022 Methodology understand coverage for preventive care? Commercial Marketplace288 *Note, low sample size for Marketplace Analysis: Exceeded Goal Nearly 9 in 10 Commercial members new to HealthPartners find it very or somewhat easy to understand the amount they need to pay for covered medicines. Scores for Commercial members show a positive trend. All Marketplace members surveyed for 2021 say it is very or somewhat easy to understand what they'll pay for prescriptions. Though there is a sizeable gap between Commercial members and Marketplace members, it is not statistically significant due to low sample size. New members outscore continuing members 12% on ease of understanding the amount you need to pay for medicines that are covered. Barriers: Pharmacy benefits and coverage is complex. Consumer awareness and use of cost tools related to prescription drug coverage is low. Formularies and authorization rules vary between different health plans and even between products and can change. Formularies change during the year which can impact a member's responsibility. Employers may choose to change pharmacy coverage when switching insurers and these changes can take members by surprise. Plan for Improving New Member Understanding: In addition to existing s trategies to engage new members and monitor their experience, HealthPartners has placed a renewed focus on the onboarding process for members in the last couple of years, particularly around understanding their coverage and benefits and knowing how to use their plan. Overall Coverage and Benefit Information 1. Continue to monitor experience of new members through the Member Experience Survey, online member panel and tracking Member Services complaints to help gauge members' understanding. 2. Enhanced the web & mobile log in experience to simplify the experience, highlight key features and deepen relationships with customers. Specific items related to coverage and benefits include: a.

Continue to monitor Member Services complaints and appeals data though review and discussion at Service Quality Council. 3. Assess success of campaigns and programs that provide members with more personalized coverage information. 291 Appendix 9: Recognitions & Awards 292 Recognitions and Awards HealthPartners is proud to be a leading health plan provider in the region. True to our values of excellence, compassion, partnership, and integrity, we are committed to providing members with the tools they need to take care of their health. As shown below, we are frequently rated near or at the top of the industry in measures related to quality of care, affordability, and overall member satisfaction. NCQA's health plan ratings HealthPartners has once again been recognized by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) as one of the top- rated health plans in Minnesota and among the highest -rated plans in the nation. We earned a rating of 4.5 out of 5, according to the NCQA's commercial Health Plan Ratings for 2022. This is the 18th year in a row that NCQA recognized us as the highest or one of the highest performing plans in the state. Despite t he challenges presented by COVID -19, we still had a strong performance that shows our team's dedication to providing excellent care, service and support to members and patients. Each year, the NCQA rates health plans based on key measures, including health prevention and treatment, member satisfaction and NCQA accreditation scores. The ratings are an important reflection on plan performance, and consumers use this information to compare health plans. For clinical quality measures, Healthcare Effectiveness D ata and Information Set (HEDIS) measures are analyzed and converted into a score by the NCQA. Member -satisfaction scores are determined based on Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) scores. The work involved to achieve these meas ures closely aligns with our work in the areas of care measured by Minnesota Community Measurement. These ratings are a perfect example of how working together and living our values helps us deliver better care and exceptional service for members and patie nts. To learn more or see the complete NCQA ratings, visit ncqa.org/ratings. NCQA accreditation The NCQA awarded HealthPartners \"excellent\" accreditation status for its health maintenance organization (HMO), point -of-service (POS) and preferred provider or ganization (PPO) commercial plans in April 2020. In September 2020, NCQA transitioned to a new scoring system and HealthPartners NCQA accreditation was updated to \"Accredited\" which is the highest accreditation level that NCQA now designates. NCQA reserve s its Accredited status for health plans that demonstrate levels of service and quality that meet or exceed its most stringent requirements for consumer protection and quality improvement. We share this information with consumers so they can compare health plans and choose the one that best fits their needs. Exceptional care - HEDIS\u00ae This year, 62% of our commercial HEDIS measures are in the top 25% in the nation, with 31% in the top 10%. This outscores our local competitors.

Compared to all Minnesota health plans, HealthPartners has received the highest overall plan rating from members every year since 2007. Medicare stars rating The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) publishes Star Ratings each year to measure the quality of health and pharmacy services for Medicare enrollees and rate plan performance between 1 and 5 stars. A 5 -star rating is considered excellent. It scores a series of clinical and performance m easures including quality of care, member experience, health plan administration and customer service. Medicare consumers can use Star Ratings when shopping for a plan during the Annual Enrollment Period (AEP) or when they become eligible for Medicare coverage. All HealthPartners Medicare plans were awarded an overall 5 out of 5- Star Rating from the CMS for 2022. These strong results mean all HealthPartners Medicare members across the health plan's six -state service area - Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota - were enrolled in a 5- star plan for 2022. Plans that earned a 5 -star rating include: HealthPartners\u00ae Journey (PPO) and HealthPartners\u00ae Robin (PPO) Medicare Advantage HealthPartners UnityPoint Health (PPO ) Medicare Advantage HealthPartners\u00ae Freedom Minnesota Senior Health Options (MSHO) (HMO SNP) HealthPartners\u00ae Retiree National Choice Prescription Drug Plan The overall Star Rating focuses on the quality of care and member experience.
