The most commonly sought method to treat these diseases is allopathically, either through medication or surgery. Although the use of complementary and alternative methods of medicine (CAM), as well as adopting a vegetarian diet, is growing in popularity, under 40 percent of individuals seek it out as an alternative method of treatment. All individuals seeking medical advice should have information regarding CAM relayed to them so that they can make their own informed decision regarding disease treatment. Prevention methods can include adopting a vegetarian diet as well as incorporating herbal support for enhanced health benefits. When disease is already present, seeking out complementary and alternative methods of medicine can be beneficial in alleviating symptoms, the possible lengthening of lifespan as well as increasing overall wellness. Allopathic methods are most commonly sought in treating disease but by incorporating CAM as well can increase one's success rate in disease treatment. As more allopathic practitioners become more familiar with and better educated on CAM treatments, each patient has an improved chance of survival and an increased quality of life. CAM USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE 3 Introduction The use of CAM in the treatment of disease is currently an under sought method amongst disease patients, however, with proper information and education provided to these individuals it could increase in popularity. Currently in the U.S., there are millions of individuals suffering from disease but only 38% of those seek out alternative methods of medicine for treatment and alleviation of symptoms (CDC, 2015). Of those individuals, a large percentage merely seek out CAM, such as massage therapy, for dealing with stress or depression that commonly accompanies disease. The overwhelming majority of disease patients obtain allopathic methods to treat disease and this is largely due in part to being misinformed or entirely uninformed about alternative methods of treatment. CAM support for disease prevention and treatment include a vast number of options including vegetarianism (nutritional support), botanical medicine, acupuncture and massage therapy. These methods are not only affordable for most but largely available statewide. Patients can seek information regarding these options via naturopathic doctors, nutritionists, therapists, acupuncturists and by conducting their own research via books and reliable internet sources (which include published research studies available to the public). This paper will focus mainly on nutritional and herbal protocols in chronic disease treatment. The selected diseases being covered are those that have been both a part of personal experience as well as the importance of the necessity of information regarding them because of the prevalence of these diseases amongst the current population. Methods CAM USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE 4 All data and information provided has been sought using books, textbooks and via reliable internet sources including LIRN, PubMed, Google Scholar and peer-reviewed journals such as the Journal of Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Boolean methods of research included searches for CAM and disease treatment as well as individualized diseases to be covered: cancer and CAM, infertility in women and CAM, diabetes and CAM, HIV/AIDS and CAM, Parkinson's disease and CAM and much more. Results evaluated the prevalence of CAM use in each particular topic, the reasons cited for its use, the different available modalities, and the reported outcomes. Results were narrowed down to studies, journal articles and entries which were pertinent and informative to the topic. Results The use of CAM in the treatment of disease has been shown through multiple studies to be most beneficial. Many studies have taken place in both short and long term timespans to show results in a vast number of diseases. Particular diseases and their corresponding research studies are broken down into the following sections: Cancer There are a vast number of cancers that can afflict the human body. In this research analysis, breast and colon (colorectal) cancer are studied. The results of one such study regarding breast cancer (Nahleh & Tabbarah, 2003) included that the use of CAM in breast cancer patients ranges between 48% and 70% in the United States. The most commonly used CAM modalities include dietary supplements, mind-body approaches, and acupuncture. The reasons cited for using CAM were to boost the immune system, improve the quality of life, prevent recurrence of cancer, provide control over life, and treat breast cancer and the side CAM USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE 5 effects of allopathic treatment such as chemotherapy. Several studies reported favorable results including improved survival, better pain control, reduced anxiety, improvement in coping strategies and significant efficacy in treating nausea and vomiting. A colon cancer study reviewed by Dr. David Hodges (2007) states: multivariate analysis adjusted for age, gender, economic status and body mass index found a statistically significant inverse association between colorectal cancer and lifelong vegetarianism (odds ratio 0.71). \"This study proves that lifelong vegetarianism prevents colorectal cancer,\" Dr. [Yogesh Shastri] said. Diabetes Multiple studies regarding diabetes and diet have been researched. Some of the most noteworthy studies included the observation of the vegetarian diet in conjunction with the prevalence of diabetes. In one such study, researchers Vang, et al. (2008) noted the following: subjects who were weekly consumers of all meats were 29% more likely to develop diabetes. Subjects who consumed any processed meats (salted fish and frankfurters) were 38% more likely to develop diabetes. Long-term adherence (over a 17-year interval) to a diet that included at least weekly meat intake was associated with a 74% increase in odds of diabetes relative to long-term adherence to a vegetarian diet (zero meat intake). Further analyses indicated that some of this risk may be attributable to obesity and/or weight gain - both of which were strong risk factors in this cohort. It is noteworthy that even after control for weight and weight change, weekly meat intake remained an important risk factor. Parkinson's disease Within the several articles reviewed in regards to PD and the use of CAM, there were many similarities. These included similar research methods, sample sizes and outcomes. Most CAM USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE 6 research was conducted via questionnaire and the participants were mostly over fifty years of age currently undergoing conventional medical treatment (L-dopa). A research study conducted in Birmingham, UK in 2002 explored the use of CAM among PD patients and their opinions on it. (Ferry et al., 2002). Of the 80 patients studied, 54% reported the use of at least one form of complimentary therapy either for the treatment of PD or for some other indication. Out of that group, 39% reported the use of at least one form of complementary therapy for PD specifically. Among the results, the most dominant therapy used by patients was massage (16%), closely followed by aromatherapy (14%) and the most dominant non-prescription medication used were simple analgesics (15%). A Korean research study looked at 123 patients with PD using a semi-structured questionnaire regarding the use of CAM (Kim et al., 2009). 76% had used CAM, most with positive results. Thirty-seven patients (41.6%) of the 89 CAM users who answered the question about the effects of CAM reported improvement in their PD symptoms with CAM use, particularly with pain and muscle stiffness. Over 57.4% of patients planned to continue their use of CAM after the interview. Several nutritional and herbal protocols to benefit those with Parkinson's disease were found via online journal articles and nutrition books and textbooks and will be covered in the discussion portion of this paper. HIV/AIDS A Buenos Aires study was performed on 43 patients, 19 HIV+ and 24 AIDS patients, between 26 and 44 years of age, from low and medium socioeconomic status, with access to health care services; 35 patients were under highly active antiretroviral therapy, HAART, treatment (Stambulliam et al., 2007). Body weight and height were determined, and the body mass index calculated. Blood samples were collected from fasting patients. Plasma cholesterol total, HDL and LDL, triacylglycerol, total protein, apolipoproteins A-I and B, albumin, CAM USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE 7 transthyretin, retinol binding protein, and ceruloplasmin concentrations, zinc, copper, and selenium were determined. The purpose of the study was to measure the importance in nutritional support for patients in stages of both HIV positive infection and AIDS. AIDS patients showed changes in biochemical parameters, particularly an increase in fibrinogen and a trend to decreased transthyretin levels. These findings stress the importance of the inclusion of functional biochemical parameters in the periodic evaluation of these patients. Researchers state that this would allow an early assessment of the need for appropriate nutritional support, implemented along with the specific retroviral treatment which would aim at delaying the progression of the disease, and might improve the prospects of survival and quality of life. Another study conducted to measure the importance of nutritional support in those with HIV/AIDS beginning HAART treatment evaluated the efficacy of dietary intervention on blood lipids (Lazzaretti et al., 2012). Eighty-three HIV-1-infected patients, naive from HAART, were randomly assigned to HAART with dietary intervention (diet group, n = 43) or HAART without dietary intervention (control group, n = 40) for 12 months. Researchers found that those in the diet group had a lower percentage of fat intake and plasma triglycerides while those in the control group had elevated levels of plasma cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and plasma triglycerides. After 1-year follow-up, 21% of patients who received diet had lipid profile compatible with dyslipidemia compared with 68% of controls, showing the importance of nutritional support for those with HIV/AIDS. As HIV/AIDS suppresses the immune system, the body is not only prone to infections but absorption of vitamins and minerals is limited. Vitamin and mineral replenishment is of utmost importance in maintaining balance in health. A double-blind placebo controlled study involving 1,078 pregnant Tanzanian women infected by HIV CAM USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE 8 reported that taking vitamin A and a low-cost multivitamin resulted in a delayed progression to AIDS as well as a delay in the requirement to initiate antiretroviral therapy (Conroy et al., 2013). Disorders of the female reproductive system Endometriosis is a condition resulting from the appearance of endometrial tissue outside the uterus which causes pelvic pain. There is no one specific reason why one develops endometriosis but hormonal imbalance is commonly involved. As there is no known cure for endometriosis, many women seek herbal and nutritional protocols to deal with the symptoms. The initial symptomatic approach in the treatment of endometriosis may be superseded by plants that exert an influence over endocrine action, particularly those that regulate reproductive function. Author Yaso Shan summarizes beneficial treatment protocols for endometriosis in his 2006 study. He states, an important focus is to examine how effectively the body is eliminating and to assess regulatory functions. This is partly a naturopathic philosophy. Another crucial aspect is circulation; part of the analgesic approach is to administer herbs that influence circulation in the pelvic region. In this respect, herbs such as Crataegus (hawthorn), Zingiber (ginger) or Capsicum (cayenne) can all be helpful. There is a suggestion that thyroid antibodies are implicated in cases of endometriosis. Many of the herbs that influence immune function are also anti-inflammatory. Echinacea will modulate immune function whereas Glycyrrhiza (licorice) will directly influence the adrenal glands while stimulating the immune responses that result from the augmentation of inflammatory processes. Equally, treatment outcomes should be measured in the context of other medical or health problems with a view to modifying treatment strategies that prioritizes more pressing concerns (Shan, 2006). Hormonal imbalances in endometriosis can be addressed on a nutritional level, and controlling estrogen is essentially a nutritional process. Very low intakes of certain vitamins and minerals CAM USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE 9 may limit the degradation of estrogen, and preventing its accumulation is essentially the treatment strategy, particularly as its build up through poor elimination is responsible for cell proliferation. Furthermore, the control of estrogen concentration is disturbed significantly by excess sugar levels, insufficient protein and is almost incapacitated by a lack of the B vitamins, choline and inositol. Vitamin B6 encourages production of progesterone to help rebalance the two main sex hormones (SHE Trust 2005). Infertility and pain are two major symptoms that can be effectively addressed through diet. Certain nutrients possess analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties which correspond to orthodox medicines without the side effects. Essential fatty acids such as fish oils, evening primrose oil (EPO), starflower oil, borage oil and linseed oils metabolize within the body to form anti-inflammatory prostaglandins (PGE1) which help reduce pain and inflammation. Moreover, fish oil supplementation has been shown to significantly reduce the size of endometrial deposits. A balance between animal, vegetable and fish oil intake is necessary to avoid the production of certain prostaglandins that trigger inflammation (The SHE Trust 2005). Discussion As the prevalence of disease in the U.S. (and worldwide) is rapidly rising, having a variety of treatment options available to the afflicted individual is of utmost importance. Allopathic methods are still the most sought after form of treatment but the use of CAM is gaining popularity. Many find great benefits in both alleviation of symptoms as well as the delay in the progression of certain diseases. Cancer CAM USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE 10 It is estimated that one in every eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer sometime during her life (National Cancer Institute, 2010). Unfortunately, standard treatment including radiation, chemotherapy and surgery often cause serious side effects, including gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, pain, skin disorders and infections. CAM approaches for treating cancer include nutritional support, botanical medicine, acupuncture, massage therapy and more. One of the criticisms of conventional medicine in preventing and treating cancer is that diet, lifestyle, stress and the ability to rid the body of environmental toxins are rarely addressed in a comprehensive fashion; yet these factors are both most influential and most controllable in the prevention of cancer and they play important roles in the recovery from cancer. To reduce the risk of developing cancer, one must reduce free radical formation in the body, limit exposure to dietary and environmental sources of free radicals and increase one's intake of antioxidant nutrients (Balch et al., 2011). As breast cancer is commonly caused genetically, it is a more difficult cancer to prevent. One prevention method to undertake would be the cessation of cigarette smoking. Smoking is a viable factor in the development of breast cancer, so cessation is necessary. Nutrition plays a key role in both the prevention and treatment of cancer and a healthy diet that includes whole foods should be incorporated early in life. Adopting a diet that includes an abundance of darky leafy green vegetables, brightly colored vegetables and fruits, whole grains, nuts and seeds and soy has shown beneficial success in treating cancer. These foods are all rich in anti-oxidants which are the key player in fighting free radicals. When a body presents high levels of toxins, cancer cells can not only strengthen but can multiply. Glutathione, a compound involved as a coenzyme in oxidation-reduction reactions in cells, is the most important anti-oxidant defense in the human body. Foods such as asparagus, avocados, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage and walnuts are all excellent sources of CAM USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE 11 glutathione and should be incorporated into the diet daily. Raw fruits and vegetables, which are high in fiber, help to flush toxins from the body. When eaten raw, these foods retain their natural enzymes which aid in digestion and the absorption of the maximum amount of nutrients. As the liver is the main organ that processes toxins in the body, eating foods (and avoiding others) that boost liver function should be consumed daily. These include garlic, onions and legumes. Author Murray (2013) states that an onion extract was found to by cytotoxic to tumor cells in vitro and to arrest tumor growth when tumor cells were implanted in rats. The onion extract was shown to be unusually nontoxic, because a dose as high as 40 times that of the cytotoxic dose for the tumor cells had no adverse effect on the host. Cancer fighting phytonutrients such as lignans should also be incorporated into the diet. Lignans are present in flaxseed and those with cancer could take up to four tablespoons of ground flaxseed daily. Of course, drinking plenty of clean, fresh water with this as well as throughout the day is highly recommended. To both prevent and treat cancer nutritionally, all processed foods, refined sugars and white flour, and saturated fats should be avoided. Saturated, hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated fats are linked to most degenerative disorders and cancer is no exception (Balch et al., 2011). High consumption of these fats (as opposed to essential fatty acids found in cold-pressed oils) has been strongly linked to several types of cancer including breast, prostate and colorectal cancers. Red meat, butter, margarine, shortening and processed meats such as hot dogs and deli meats all contain these harmful fats and should be eliminated from the diet. Cases of colon and colo-rectal cancers have risen prominently in the U.S., many of which can be associated with diet. Researcher Hodges (2007) has found \"a statistically significant inverse association between colorectal cancer and lifelong vegetarianism\". His study includes CAM USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE 12 preliminary data presented at the DDW meeting suggesting lifelong vegetarianism may prevent approximately one-third of colorectal cancers. An evaluated study included one conducted in India. The study prospectively evaluated 8,877 patients treated for various cancers at a single center in Mumbai, India, between 2000 and 2005. Results showed that individuals who practiced a vegetarian diet from birth had a 29% lower risk of colorectal cancer than their non-vegetarian counterparts. The incidence of colorectal cancer in Australia, North America and the United Kingdom ranges from 40 to 50 per 100,000, compared with rates of less than five per 100,000 in countries such as Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. To estimate the association between vegetarianism and colorectal cancer risk in his current study, an analysis was performed in which all 796 colorectal cancer patients were assigned to a case group and then compared with three different control groups. These included 7,273 non-colorectal cancer patients, 1,844 patients with non-colorectal and tobacco-related cancers and 74 patients with benign disorders. A vegetarian diet started very early in life may reduce colorectal cancer risk later in life by preventing early events such as mutation or deletion of the tumor-suppressing adenomatous polyposis coli gene in colonocytes (Hodges, 2007). Dietary suggestions for those with either colon or colo-rectal cancer are similar to those suggested previously for breast cancer. Elimination of free radicals is the most important factor in the diet so consuming plenty of raw greens, vegetable and fruits is recommended. For those with colon and colo-rectal cancer that have eaten a diet that included meat, a substitution of soy products such as tofu and edamame can be incorporated. This lean protein is void of the toxins found in meat and can be a sufficient substitute for protein consumption along with the addition of beans and legumes. Herbal protocol recommendations for cancer patients includes the following: CAM USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE 13 Melatonin Shown in several studies to be helpful as an adjunctive therapy for certain types of cancer. Activates immune cells and improves the action of chemotherapy drugs and radiation Milk Thistle (Silybum marianum) Protects liver during chemotherapy and radiation Rosemary Contains a substance called carnosol, which has been found to inhibit cancer in laboratory animals Fennel Known to reduce symptoms such as nausea in those undergoing radiation and chemotherapy Garlic (Allium sativum) Boosts and strengthens the immune system Cat's Claw (U\u00f1a de gato) Stimulates the activity High potency immune system enhancer Echinacea Recognized for immune-boosting properties Peppermint and Ginger To soothe the stomach from nausea caused by chemotherapy Adapted from Balch, J., Stengler, M. & Young-Balch, R. (2011). Cancer. In Prescription for natural cures, (Rev. Ed.). Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Diabetes In the United States there is a health epidemic in that many are unhealthy, obese and eat a poor diet. The unfortunate result of this is type 2 diabetes. This disease has become an epidemic in the U.S. as it afflicts millions of individuals. As of 2012, twenty-one million Americans were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (ADA, 2012). In 1997, that number was approximately five million. Several million more are most likely living with the disease but have not been diagnosed. The majority of these individuals develop type 2 diabetes in their adult years by poor diet and lack of exercise. These people are all most likely predisposed genetically to becoming diabetic and that poor health has caused the onset of the disease. In some cases, this can be reversed by a change in diet, weight loss and increased physical activities. In other cases, type 2 diabetics can improve their quality and length of life through the use of blood glucose sustaining medication in addition to diet change and adopting a regular physical exercise routine. CAM USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE 14 Further studies have tracked those that are pre-diabetic and methods used to prevent the onset of the disease. Programs such as the National Diabetes Prevention Program, sponsored by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, help to not only educate the population on diabetes but to provide one on one interaction with pre-diabetics involving a diet and exercise routine (CDC, 2013). The program encourages collaboration among federal agencies, community-based organizations, employers, insurers, health care professionals, academia, and other stakeholders to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes (CDC, 2013). This program includes the following evidence-based lifestyle changes in preventing type 2 diabetes: It can help people cut their risk of developing type 2 diabetes in half The Diabetes Prevention Program research study showed that making modest behavior changes helped participants lose 5% to 7% of their body weight\u2014that is 10 to 14 pounds for a 200-pound person These lifestyle changes reduced the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58% in people with prediabetes Participants work with a lifestyle coach in a group setting to receive a 1-year lifestyle change program that includes 16 core sessions, usually 1 per week, and 6 post-core sessions, 1 per month (CDC, 2013. About the Program, par. 3). Programs such as this are not only rising in popularity, and necessity, in the U.S. but in countries abroad as well. In Finland, the Diabetes Prevention Study was conducted on approximately 523 participants were monitored over a six year period. These individuals were placed in either a control group or an intervention group, in a randomized control trial. Those in CAM USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE 15 the control group were given oral and pamphlet information regarding recommended diet and exercise programs to follow to prevent type 2 diabetes without one on one monitoring, except for a baseline and annual visit (Tuomilehto, et al., 2001). No specific individualized programs were offered to them. The subjects in the intervention group were given detailed advice about how to achieve the goals of the intervention, which included weight reduction, decreased fat intake, increased fiber intake and a regimen of moderate exercise (Tuomilehto, et al., 2001). Subjects kept records of their progress and consulted with a nutritionist. Nutrient intakes for both groups were computed with the use of a program developed at the National Public Health Institute (Tuomilehto, et al., 2001). At the conclusion of the six year study, those in the intervention group showed a decrease in the onset of type 2 diabetes than those in the control group. All in all the cumulative incidence of diabetes was 58 percent lower in the intervention group than in the control group (Tuomilehto, et al., 2001). These studies show the importance of preventative methods, diet and exercise, to help prevent type 2 diabetes from occurring. Once an individual has been diagnosed, it is difficult to reverse the disease but not entirely impossible. Factors such as length of time with the disease come into play; those that have had the disease for more than six years have a more difficult time reversing it (ADA, 2014). CAM treatments, such as acupuncture, herbal remedies, massage therapy and yoga have proven beneficial for those already diagnosed with type 2 diabetes as well as those that are pre-diabetic. Diabetics are often prone to edema and neuropathy in their extremities (ADA, 2011, p.248). Massage therapy is a wonderfully successful tool in relieving edema and even sometimes successfully reversing neuropathy (Braun & Simonson, 2005, p.327). Massage techniques such as Swedish, help to stimulate the circulatory system; a necessity for diabetics. Other techniques such as lymphatic drainage help to move the fluid in the body, which CAM USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE 16 is quite effective in helping edema (Braun & Simonson, 2005, p.430). Acupuncture is also a wonderful technique to open the meridian lines of the body to help the flow of lymph and to stimulate circulation. A diet low in sugar, processed foods and animal fat with an increased intake of healthy carbohydrates, whole foods and vegetables is essential. Additionally, supplying the body with supplemented nutrients is beneficial as well. Nutrients such as chromium picolinate, L-Carnitine and L-glutamine help improve the efficiency of insulin as well as reduce sugar cravings (Balch & Balch, 1997). Spirulina helps stabilize blood sugar levels as do foods such as fish, kelp, berries and soybeans. Herbal supplements such as bilberry, buchu, dandelion root and uva ursi are beneficial for diabetes (Balch & Balch, 1997). Parkinson's disease Nutritional, supplemental and herbal therapy has been proven quite beneficial in treating PD symptoms. Gastrointestinal problems, specifically constipation, are common in PD patients. Eating a diet high in fiber with raw foods such as dark leafy greens, fruits, nuts and seeds can assist in relieving constipation as well as provide antioxidants to help fight free radical damage. It has been shown that an overabundance of protein in the diet can impede muscle control and coordination (Balch et al., 2011). Avoiding animal meat but consuming some protein from beans, legumes and soy may help this. Amino acids compete with levodopa for transport across the blood-brain barrier so it has been postulated that low protein diets might improve medication uptake and enhance mobility in patients taking levodopa who had severe medication-induced fluctuations in mobility (Cushing et al., 2002). Many patients, however, should avoid a continuous low-protein diet as implications such as promotion of wasting may occur. Rather than restricting protein, these patients should be advised to redistribute their protein throughout the day, avoid large amounts of protein at one time, and avoid taking high protein foods in CAM USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE 17 conjunction with their levodopa doses (Cushing et al., 2002). These patients need to be made aware that adequate protein intake is necessary to maintain optimal health. Additionally, avoiding processed foods, refined sugars, artificial sweeteners, alcohol and caffeine can improve neurological function (Balch et al., 2011). Herbal and supplemental support include the following: Coenzyme Q10: 1,200 mg taken daily. CoQ10 is an antioxidant that has been shown in one preliminary study to reduce the progression of early-stage Parkinson's disease Vitamin C: 750 mg taken four times daily. Vitamin C is an important antioxidant that prevents free radical damage Vitamin E-complex: 800 IU taken four times daily. Vitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols) is an important antioxidant that prevents free radical damage Greens formula: An organic formula taken daily that contains one of more of the super green foods, such as spirulina, chlorella, or wheatgrass. This helps support detoxification Essential Fatty Acids: A fish oil product that provides at least one gram of DHA and EPA taken daily. Flaxseed oil and evening primrose oil are additional options Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH): 5 mg taken twice daily. Preliminary research has found that this supplement improves brain function and reduces symptoms in those with Parkinson's disease N-acetylcysteine (NAC): 500 mg taken three times daily. NAC increases levels of glutathione, an important antioxidant Reproduced with permission from Balch, J., Stengler, M. & Young-Balch, R. (2011). Prescription for natural cures, (Rev. Ed.). Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Additionally, the herb gingko biloba was used in an animal study for its effect on PD with promising results (Rojas et al., 2012). Researchers state that gingko biloba (EGb761) can provide a neuroprotective/neurorecovery effect against the damage to midbrain DA neurons in an animal model of PD. EGb 761 also has been found to lessen the impairment of locomotion, correlating with an increase of DA and other morphologic and biochemical parameters related to CAM USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE 18 its antioxidant effect in an animal model of PD. These studies suggest it as an alternative in the future treatment of PD. HIV/AIDS As HIV/AIDS suppresses the immune system, the prevalence of \"wasting syndrome\", an extreme amount of weight loss, is most common and leads to a malnourished state. With this syndrome, many develop bacterial infections, extreme nausea, mouth sores and food aversion. It is of utmost importance for those infected to start naturopathic nutritional, herbal and supplemental protocols before this point. This will aid in vitamin and mineral absorption as well as help to boost the immune system to fight infection. Even if the patient is already experiencing these symptoms, a nutritional protocol is in order. According to Campa, et al. (2015), poor nutritional status impairs immune function either directly or indirectly: directly, nutritional deficiency can interfere with the primary activity of the lymphoid system such as during immune cell triggering, interaction and differentiation; indirectly, it can affect other metabolic and cellular processes needed for immune regulation. Vitamin and mineral absorption is key and the following table lists these essential elements needed for HIV/AIDS patients: Vitamin A (15,000-30,000 IU taken with food): slows progression to AIDS, decreases mortality, decreases stunting associated with chronic diarrhea and prevents GI deterioration in mothers and infants. Copper (2 mg): can inhibit HIV protease and viral replication Beta-carotene taken increases CD4+ total lymphocyte count and decreased mortality Magnesium (300 mg): deficiency is commonly found in AIDS patients Folate (400mcg): normalizes cell differentiation; deficiency is most likely due to malabsorption Selenium (400 mcg): to suppress the progression of HIV-1, viral burden and provide indirect improvement of CD4 count Vitamin B1 (50 mg): replenishment is associated with increased survival in HIV+ patients and decreased progression to AIDS Zinc (15 mg): has been found to decrease frequency of OIs; deficiency is noted in all HIV+ patients progressing to AIDS CAM USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE 19 Vitamin B6 (50 mg): is essential in nucleic acid and protein metabolism and cellular and hormonal responses Acetyl-L-Carnitine (2-6 g): essential for proper energy supply as well as critical metabolic functions. Reduction in serum triglycerides, decreased risk of wasting, increase in CD4 cells, reduced apoptosis and treatment of peripheral neuropathy Vitamin B12 (1,000 mcg best taken via intramuscular injection 3 times a week): is important in several parameters of immune function, proper cell differentiation and nerve function, and in decreasing homocysteine levels. Repletion can improve lymphocyte counts, CD4/CD8 ratios, and NK cell activity. Supplementation has also been found to reverse AIDS dementia complex when associated with low levels DHEA (15-50 mg taken with food): repletion helps to increase CD4 count, stimulate immune function and improve quality of life Vitamin D (5,000 IU): undetectable levels correlated with more advanced HIV infection, lower CD4 count and higher levels of TNF-alpha Testosterone (intramuscular weekly injections): is indicated if serum levels are low in order to decrease loss of lean body and muscle mass Vitamin E (800 IU daily taken with food): indicated to decrease lipid peroxidation, protects against AZT-induced oxidative damage to cardiac mitochondria, normalizes immune function and slows progression to AIDS Glutathione/GSH (increased through selenium and N-acetyl-cysteine or whey powder): has been found to decrease disease progress and mortality Reproduced with permission from Conroy, K., & Milkis, S. (2013). HIV/AIDS: Naturopathic medical principles and practice. In J.Pizzorno & M. Murray (Eds.), Textbook of natural medicine (4th, pp. 1431-1437). St. Louis, MO: Elsevier Churchill Livingston Recommended essential nutrients that have been found to replace or reduce other nutrient deficiencies in HIV patients include silybum marianum/milk thistle (300 mg), NAC (2-8 mg), CoQ10 (100-300 vitamin C (2-6 g), alpha-lipoic acid (600 mg), L-arginine (7.4 g), EFAs (5 g), and L-Methionine (1,000 mg); most of these nutrients improve liver function and lower oxidative stress (Conroy et al., 2013). Since food aversion is a common problem in HIV/AIDS patients, the majority of these elements can be found in a multivitamin or separate supplement, however, whole, fresh foods are the first choice. A high calorie, high protein diet with snacks between meals is most commonly recommended and avoiding processed foods, refined flour and sugar and undercooked meats is essential. Additionally, more thorough food safety precautions are necessary, such as hand washing and thoroughly washing fruits and vegetables as bacterial infection risk is extremely high in HIV/AIDS patients. ENDOMETRIOSIS CAM USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE 20 Endometriosis, as well as other disorders of the female reproductive system, has become more prevalent amongst the current female population. Approximately 10%-15% (reported cases) of women of reproductive age are affected by endometriosis (EM). The true population of those with EM is actually larger as many are not aware until symptoms become increasingly worse or when EM is found in surgical procedures such as a cystectomy or oophorectomy. In the cases of EM that is found surgically, the growing endometrial tissue is cauterized but the tissue growth will ultimately return. Endometriosis is a condition resulting from the appearance of endometrial tissue outside the uterus which causes pelvic pain. There is no one specific reason why one develops endometriosis but hormonal imbalance is commonly involved. As there is no known cure for endometriosis, many women seek herbal and nutritional protocols to deal with the symptoms. Dietary support can be most beneficial for those suffering from EM. Elimination diet protocols are at the forefront of treating EM. Foods to avoid include: red meat, non-organic dairy products, processed foods and inflammatory substances such as sugar, caffeine and alcohol. Eating foods that creates an imbalance in the immune system lead to limiting the body's ability to fight disorder (Balch et al., 2011). According to Pizzorno & Murray (2013), several dietary principles are key in a natural medicine approach to endometriosis: Reduce inflammatory foods and increase anti-inflammatory foods Enhance detoxification mechanisms Increase dietary fiber to promote optimal transit time and optimal gut flora Increase omega-3 fatty acids and reduce trans fats CAM USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE 21 Pizzorno & Murray (2013) continue to state that \"the consumption of trans fats appears to increase the risk of endometriosis, whereas long-chain omega-3 fats appear to be protective\". They further state that \"those women who had the highest intake of tans unsaturated fats were 48% more likely to be diagnosed with endometriosis\". Although higher-protein diets are found to provide enzymes for the detoxification of pathways of estradiol, vegetarian diets are of greater value owing to their lower fat content. By adding vegetable protein, soy and nut butters the anti-inflammatory prostaglandins inhibit endometrial growth. Foods to increase include dark leafy greens, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, artichokes, carrots, watercress and lemons. Recommended nutritional supplements include: Vitamin C Increase in cellular immunity, decrease in autoimmune progression and decrease in fatigue. Decreases capillary fragility and tumor growth (which may be evident with endometriosis) Beta-carotene Enhances immunity Vitamin E Helps to correct abnormal progesterone:estradiol ratios. May be advantageous for abnormal growth of lesions in endometriosis. Vitamin E may fight the free radicals contributing to the inflammation and excessive growth of endometrial tissue. Pine Bark (pycnogenol) A randomized-control study showed that the pycnogenol group maintained normal menstruation and estrogen levels and had an increased rate of pregnancy. Essential fatty acids Helps to decrease the inflammatory response on the tissue levels through pathways that produce prostaglandins. B vitamins Help the liver to inactivate estrogen Selenium Aids in the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes responsible for detoxification reaction within the liver. Adapted from Pizzorno, J., & Murray, M. (2013). Textbook of natural medicine (J. Pizzorno & M. Murray, Eds., 4th Ed., pp 1351-1353). St. Louis, MO: Elsevier Churchill Livingstone CAM USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE 22 Other recommended foods include beets, dandelion greens, onion, cultured yogurt, garlic, apples, cherries (which contain the phytochemical indole-3-carbinol, which supports the liver's detoxification of estrogen). Regarding herbal treatment, researcher Shan (2006) states that \"redressing hormonal imbalances can have a remarkable beneficial effect in alleviating symptoms. However, it has to be appreciated that the phytochemical efficacy of exogenous hormones does not compare to the complex pharmacological interplay of endogenous hormones that influence normal reproductive physiology. Much of the basis for treatment strategies rests on anecdotal evidence, and attempts at understanding the phytopharmacological mechanisms of herb actions remain speculative\". That being said, although there is not a wide array of herbal studies available regarding EM, many women have seen beneficial results in alleviating symptoms with the use of herbal protocols. Traditional Chinese Medicine (particularly herbal support) is most commonly sought to treat EM. Researchers Burks-Wicks et al., (2005) state that \"in traditional Chinese medicine, the Yin-Yang theory is the foundation upon which disease processes are understood and treated. Yin and Yang are two types of energy that are present in the universe and within the human body. All things in the universe are a balance of these opposite yet complimentary forces. Each body organ has elements of Yin and Yang. It is believed that Qi and blood are the fundamental fluid substances of the body, which sustain the normal physiologic functions of the organs and tissues\". They further state that \"in traditional Chinese medicine, imbalance of Yin and Yang is thought to cause illness. Any disruption or blockage of the organs and channels is associated with an imbalance of Qi and blood, thus leading to disharmony of Yin and Yang and to diseases such as endometriosis and infertility. Therefore, the goal of treatment in Chinese medicine is to tonify deficiency, open blockages, relieve stagnation and regulate the internal organ balance\". CAM USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE 23 There is growing evidence that traditional medicinal Chinese herbs have pharmacologic anti-inflammatory effects and pain- and infertility-alleviating properties. Anti-inflammatory actions of Chinese herbs used traditionally for the treatment of endometriosis include Angelica root, Cordyalis rhizome extract, Frankincense, Licorice root, root and White peony root (Burks-Wicks et al., 2005). In the U.S., individuals can seek out TCM through doctors of Chinese medicine and acupuncturists. In the U.S., the use of commonly found botanical medicines to treat EM has grown in popularity because it is more widely available in local health food stores. Although many can seek out TCM, the growing number of women seeking local herbs is prevalent; largely due to self-education and obtaining a naturopath or herbalist. According to Pizzorno & Murray (2013), the herbs appropriate for acute pain relief in endometriosis are the same herbs commonly used for menstrual cramps such as valerian, crampbark, and black cohosh, in addition to other traditional herbs that might be helpful such as wild yam, chamomile, blue cohosh, ginger, passion flower and false unicorn root. The following table presents herbal protocols that may help in the treatment of EM: Chaste Tree (vitex agnus castus) Used as treatment for hormonal imbalance. Increases progesterone. Useful for fibroids, premenstrual syndrome and perimenopause. With its use less estrogen available to stimulate endometrial tissue. Dandelion root (taraxacum officinale) One of the most detoxifying herbs. By supporting the liver, excessive estrogens and toxins can be deactivated. Prickly ash (xanthoxylum americanum) Known for specific effects on capillary engorgement and sluggish circulation. For women with pelvic congestion, this herb enhances circulation throughout the pelvis. Motherwort (leonorus cardiaca) Antispasmodic properties; gently soothes nerves. Useful during the times of extreme pain in the uterus and other regions. CAM USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE 24 Turska's Formula A well-known, old-time treatment for decreasing aberrant cancer cell growth. Useful in endometriosis owing to the similarities in cell growth found in the pelvis. Contains monkshood, yellow jasmine, bryony and poke root. Adapted from Pizzorno, J., & Murray, M. (2013). Textbook of natural medicine (J. Pizzorno & M. Murray, Eds., 4th Ed.). St. Louis, MO: Elsevier Churchill Livingstone Conclusion The use of complementary and alternative methods of medicine (CAM) in the U.S. is gaining in popularity but not at a rate that is acceptable. According to a 2012 survey by the CDC which compares the use of CAM from 2002, 2007 and 2012, less than 40% of the population is seeking CAM for disease treatment. Among those, 80% seek yoga, Tai Chi and Chi Gong as methods to promote wellness. There are very few statistics regarding those who seek nutritional support as well as botanical medicine as viable option, mostly due in part that these methods are not commonly reported. In addition to this, many that are inflicted with disease additionally suffer from depression or other co-morbidities that are also not reflected in statistical studies. The prominent problem, besides reporting to allopathic doctors, is that those seeking CAM methods are often lost as to where to begin to seek education and treatment. Across the globe, many have sought out methods of medicine alternative to the allopathic methods prominently sought in the U.S. as a viable source of disease treatment for years (such as Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda). In the U.S., few allopathic medical practitioners are educated in CAM and therefore do not offer advice on the topic. Although statistical data regarding the use of CAM in the U.S. is slim, the amount of research studies and medical journals regarding the use of particular forms of CAM and its beneficial success is vast. As shown throughout the discussion portion of this paper, one can see that there are a great number of references which show documented evidence to the success of CAM use, particularly in nutritional support and botanical medicine. For example, with those suffering from HIV/AIDS, a proper nutritional CAM USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE 25 protocol is the key to establishing immune support and to prevent \"wasting syndrome\". A portion of the recommended foods and dietary supplements have been presented here but those seeking further knowledge have countless online research sites with links to medical journals as well as books and other library resources. It is merely a matter of educating oneself. With more publicly published journals, articles and the like in the U.S., the greater population can then educate themselves on the topic and seek out CAM methods through licensed naturopaths, nutritionists, acupuncturists and herbalists. Many of those that have sought alternative methods in disease treatment have seen successful and beneficial results. Recommendations As previously stated, education regarding CAM, including nutritional support and herbal protocols, is the first step in seeking wellness for disease treatment via an alternative method to medication and surgery. Although the allopathic method of treatment for chronic disease should not be dismissed, combining it with alternative therapies can produce substantial results. But where to begin? With proper research and education, one can allot a wealth of information regarding treating disease using alternative methods of medicine. Seeking out naturopathic doctors as well as licensed herbalists and nutritionists is the first step. Depending on one's area of residence these can be found via recommendations from friends and family, online research or even recommendations from allopathic doctors. When naturopathic doctors and the like are not immediately found in one's city, travel to nearby cities may be necessary. However, with the growing number of naturopathic doctors, herbalists and nutritionists becoming available across the country, seeking them out will not be difficult. Individuals can start their own research online via a number of websites that will link them to pertinent information regarding alternative medicine. Of course, there are many CAM USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE 26 individual blogs and personal websites pertaining to nutrition, alternative medicine and herbalism but most of those should be carefully considered depending on the referenced material presented. Some of the best reference sites for information include the following (links to CAM included): Medline Plus, via the U.S. Library of Medicine - https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/complementaryandintegrativemedicine.html Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database - http://naturaldatabase.therapeuticresearch.com/home.aspx?cs=&s=ND University of Maryland Medical Center, Complementary and Alternative Medicine Guide - http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed University of Connecticut Health Center, Healthnet: Connecticut Consumer Health Information Network - http://library.uchc.edu/departm/hnet/altmedres.html Natural Medicines - https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/ PubMed (a site to research articles) - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?querykey=4%26dbase=pubmed%26querytype=eSearch%26 Journal of Complementary and Alternative Medicine - http://www.liebertpub.com/overview/journal-of-alternative-and-complementary-medicine-the/26/ Additionally, to review research studies and the like, a search on Google Scholar will most likely provide some great results but some are not available in full text form. However, several are, so spending a bit of time to review results should provide one with beneficial information regarding the chosen topic. In addition to seeking online information, local libraries (including CAM USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE 27 college libraries), provide a wealth of books on the topic of chronic disease and treatment. Again, like many online sites, weeding through these to find the most pertinent information from respected sources is key. In most cities, the public health department, as well as individual clinics, hold workshops that provide valuable information regarding chronic disease and treatment. Amongst these workshops are many that focus on alternative methods of medicine and should be sought out. As nutritional support is key to maintaining wellness and immune support whilst treating a chronic disease, seeking a licensed and degreed nutritionist is the best option. Nutritionists will provide not only the right support for disease treatment but will provide patients with the proper reading materials pertinent to their particular disease. Again, finding a nutritionist that is well versed and educated regarding disease treatment is essential. This should not be a difficult task as many cities, including naturopath offices and clinics, usually have a nutritionist on staff. Besides researching some of the recommended sites as stated above, each individual suffering from a chronic disease can begin a nutritional support at home by adopting a healthy diet that is free from processed foods and meats, refined sugars and white flour and incorporating a large consumption of fresh vegetables, fruits, grains, nuts and seeds. In addition to this, drinking fresh water throughout the day and beginning an exercise program (that is acceptable for one's condition) will help promote wellness and start one on a path of alleviating symptoms, improving quality of life and promoting longevity.
