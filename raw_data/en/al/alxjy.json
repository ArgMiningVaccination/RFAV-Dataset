AUG. 21, 2017: Millions across North America, South America, Africa and Europe gazed upward as the moon silhouetted the sun for a few brief minutes, casting large portions of the earth into temporary darkness. More than 200 miles above us, three Americans, two Russians and one European gazed out the windows of the International Space Station, becoming the only six citizens of the world that day to witness the moon's umbra shadowing a large portion of the United States. \"No words needed,\" tweeted European Space Agency astronaut Paolo Nespoli, who, along with his fellow travelers aboard Expedition 52, had outfitted his camera with a special filter to capture the eclipse during the ISS's three rotations. Back on Earth, Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon, remarked to a reporter, \"It occurred to me that I got to see quite a few solar eclipses \u2014 every time we orbited into the shadow of the moon.\" Aldrin is, in fact, one of less than 600 people to personally witness Earth from space. And yet humanity's ventures into our solar system have taught us as much about the planet we reside on as they have about what exists beyond our horizon. Thanks to technology developed for interplanetary travel, we can look at the earth today with as much wonder as we gaze into the sky. \"Mystery creates wonder, and wonder is the basis of man's desire to understand,\" Armstrong said. Gazing up through telescopes, we capture life beyond the earth's atmosphere. Gazing down, satellites record the world at our feet.EARTH + SPACE 1J MERCURY ALUM KEY TO MESSENGER SUCCESS Talk about impressive numbers. NASA's MErcury Surface Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging (MESSENGER) mission, the /f_irst spacecraft to orbit the planet closest to the sun, tallied amazing successes: 8.8 billion miles traveled, 4,105 orbits around Mercury, 10.8 years of operation and 270,000 images sent home. Among its achievements: characterized Mercury's surface composition, unveiled its geological history, discovered an internal magnetic /f_ield oset from Mercury's center and found polar deposits with signi/f_icant water ice. On the core team of 20 was Purdue alumnus Jim McAdams (BSAAE 1984, MSAAE 1985), then at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. As mission design lead engineer, he created the trajectory and propulsive maneuvers. McAdams' involvement began in 1996 when the mission was /f_irst discussed and continued until after the spacecraft crashed onto Mercury on April 30, 2015. \"/T_he talented /f_light team delivered the spacecraft extremely close to the location and time I predicted months before impact,\" he says. His contributions included proposing and designing a shorter-duration extended-mission orbit; designing trajectory targets for launch, close-approach conditions for the six planetary gravity-assist /f_lybys; and planning course corrections. He also alerted leadership of a pending encounter with Encke, which yielded hundreds of images of the comet. Notable, too, was the mission's technology, including a /f_ixed, steerable antenna; innovative thermal design; and custom software. \"/T_he team had to invent, develop and test key capabilities,\" he says. Work concluded in May 2017, with /f_inal science delivery; its science and technology are highlighted at messenger.jhuapl.edu. \"MESSENGER returned a wealth of data that will enable years of analysis. We now have a complete Mercury globe,\" says McAdams, now a senior mission design engineer at KinetX Aerospace. \"It opened a whole new world of knowledge.\" \"MESSENGER returned a wealth of data that will enable years of analysis.

When it made its last six-hour solar eclipse, called the Transit of Venus, in June 2012, Purdue University Northwest invited students and the community to the top of its Hammond, Ind., campus parking garage for an educational evening. \"We hooked up our portable telescope to a video eyepiece and displayed it on a large screen,\" says Adam Rengstorf, associate professor of physics and astronomy and director of the Northwest Indiana Robotic Observatory. /T_he next time the transit occurs will be in 2117 and 2125. Purdue astronomers, however, have other educational and research reasons, in the meantime, to keep their eyes on the night sky. In one ongoing project, Rengstorf's students have so far made 110 new observations of 17 dierent near-Earth asteroids. /T_heir work has been published by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in its weekly and monthly circulars. /T_hat contribution, Rengstorf says, is valuable: \"We are helping the international astronomical community track objects that potentially could cause impact threats here on Earth.\" For this and other projects, researchers use the Northwest Indiana Robotic (NIRo) telescope, a 20-inch advanced Ritchey-Chr\u00e9tien re/f_lecting telescope acquired in 2008. Housed at the Calumet Astronomy Center in Lowell, Ind., it can be operated onsite or remotely via the internet. \"/T_his telescope is a great resource, especially for our physics majors,\" says Rengstorf, who has also developed projects for asteroid spin rates, eclipsing binary timing and exoplanet transits. 3above | The photo, taken circa 2010, shows Adam Rengstorf, former faculty member Shawn Slavin and former graduate student Brent Segally during initial calibration and engineering of a new telescope. below | The Transit of Venus takes place when Venus travels directly in front of the sun, showing as a small black disc.

Huang has identi/f_ied a new crystalline material that, if used to fabricate solar cells, could make them twice as ecient, thinner, more /f_lexible and less expensive. /T_he new material, known as a hybrid perovskite, could replace silicon as a semiconductor, which is currently used to fabricate cells. Huang, an assistant professor of chemistry, has worked with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to study how electrons move in the new material. Enough solar energy reaches the Earth to provide all of our power needs. But silicon cells lose one- third of the incoming energy to heat due to the Shockley-Queisser light-to-power eciency limit, which governs the amount of energy needed to boost an electron from a bound state to a conducting state that creates electricity. Huang has developed a new technique to track the range of motion and speed of electrons known as \"hot carriers\" by using fast lasers and microscopes. She also has shown that perovskite, which contains both inorganic and organic material, oers a new solar cell geometry that can overcome the limit and utilize the energy from light of the hot carriers missed by silicon. \"/T_his is fundamental, not just for solar cells, but nanoelectronics,\" Huang says. \"It can govern how fast computers and electronics run.\" 4PHOTO BY VINCENT WALTER\"This is fundamental, not just for solar cells, but nanoelectronics.\" Libai Huang View of the sun rising over Earth, photographed from the Earth-orbiting Challenger.

Watching the unmanned vehicles scoot across the butterscotch-colored landscape under the robotic control of NASA engineers 150 million miles away, the physics major thought to herself, \"/T_he coolest thing you could do is drive a rover on Mars,\" and decided to apply to graduate school in planetary science. Fast forward to 2018, and Horgan is now a scienti/f_ic member of two Mars rover missions, one launched in 2011 and another slated for 2020. Curiosity, which landed in 2012 and has been slowly making its way up a 3-mile-high mountain inside Gale Crater, is searching for evidence of past habitable environments. /T_he 2020 mission will pick up where Curiosity leaves o, investigating an even more ancient site (3-4 billion years old) for signs of past microbial life. \"Really, the big goal \u2014 and not just mine \u2014 is to try to understand whether or not life evolved and thrived on ancient Mars,\" says Horgan, an assistant professor of earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences who uses data from NASA's satellites and rovers, supported by lab and /f_ieldwork at analog sites on Earth, to understand the geologic history of the moon and Mars./uni00A0\"If we really do want to live on Mars \u2014 and I think it's humanity's destiny to explore other planets \u2014 then it's important to know if life once existed there.\" This 2017 image from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter shows small ripples, about 10 meters apart, located in Her Desher Vallis.

On this two-acre site in Purdue's Discovery Park called Visiting Our Solar System (VOSS), Jupiter and its seven planetary siblings are scaled to the model sun's size and placed in an orbital path that mimics the real ones in space. Seven years in the making, the $1.5 million interactive exhibit was designed by students to put the size of space in perspective and celebrate the contributions of alumna and NASA astronaut Janice Voss. More than 50 students from the EPICS (Engineering Projects in Community Service)/uni00A0program designed the interactive learning tool, which also serves as a reminder of Purdue's deep roots in space: 24 graduates have been selected for space travel, with countless other alumni working in the space industry. \"/T_he students were challenged to develop a model that would inspire interest in the STEM disciplines as well as space exploration,\" says Barrett Caldwell, an industrial engineering professor and director of the/uni00A0Indiana Space Grant Consortium. \"/T_he result is an impressive display.\" above right | The VOSS Model was created based on a Fibonacci spiral.

But unlike many of her peers, who imagined suiting up and heading into the great beyond as adults, Howell's thoughts were focused on what was happening behind the scenes at Mission Control. \"For me, the question was not so much, 'How can I become an astronaut?' but 'How can I make it happen, and what do I have to study to answer that question?'\" recalls Howell, the Hsu Lo Distinguished Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics. /T_hose musings took Howell on a career trajectory directly to spacecraft mission design research, in which she and her students analyze the impact of multiple gravitational /f_ields on the motion of a spacecraft and how to leverage those /f_ields for future missions. Ocially, Saturn has at least 61 moons , including the eight provisional moons. To explore them in more depth while optimizing fuel costs, spacecraft will need to exploit the natural dynamics of the gravitational environment instead of simply compensating for their gravitational in/f_luence. Working with mathematics and engineering colleagues at Purdue and elsewhere, Howell has developed multiple trajectories that spacecraft could take, depending on the exact nature of their mission. \"Many times when people think of going to Saturn, they think of just one path,\" Howell says. \"I see a whole road map in the solar system that we can leverage.\" She is applying that same philosophy to designing future missions to the moon, to other planets in the solar system, and even libration points \u2014 essentially celestial parking lots where a future space station or habitat could potentially orbit inde/f_initely. 7\"For me, the question was not so much, 'How can I become an astronaut?' but 'How can I make it happen, and what do I have to study to answer that question?'\" Kathleen Howell ISTOCK PHOTO BY VINCENT WALTEROUTER SPACEURANUS TWO PLANETS FOR THE PRICE OF ONE | With a /f_light time topping 11 years to reach Uranus, Justin Mansell says, \"It's a bit far for my taste, and for humans, it would be boring and incredibly dangerous.\" He and 19 other Purdue aeronautical and astronautical engineering graduate students, however, enthusiastically took on designing an unmanned orbiter and atmospheric probe that could visit the planet known as an ice giant because of its makeup. Unexplored by spacecraft for more than 30 years, Uranus now holds priority with NASA, prompting Sarag Saikia, visiting assistant professor, to create an intense, two-week Maymester 2016 course. With Mansell as principal investigator, the team worked 10-hour days on computers and white boards in a Neil Armstrong Hall of Engineering team-learning classroom, simulating a real-world research project. Details for a proposed launch between 2023 and 2037 for the spacecraft they named Oceanus included trajectory, vehicle design, onboard subsystems, atmospheric entry and a swing by Saturn, too, to drop o an entry probe to study its atmosphere \u2014 all within a $2 billion budget. /T_hat's two planets for the price of one, giving NASA more bang for its buck. \"You won't /f_ind many other schools with the capability of doing a concept study like this,\" Mansell says. \"And we received positive feedback and interesting insights on our results.\" /T_he team published a 27-page summary of its 160-page report in Advances in Space Research, and also gave three presentations \u2014 to NASA and Jet Propulsion Laboratory representatives, at the 13th International Planetary Probe Workshop and at NASA's Outer Planets Assessment Group Meeting.

By mass, Neptune is about 65 percent water and \"ices\"\u2014 methane and ammonia, primarily. \"If we can better understand this planet, we can know the origin and evolution of the solar system itself,\" he says, and that could enhance knowledge of similar planetary formations beyond the solar system. When NASA and the Jet Propulsion Lab chose Purdue as the only university research lab to participate in its Ice Giants Pre-Decadal Survey Mission Study, Saikia and the astrodynamics group quickly consented. Completed in April 2017, the report eyes a late 2020s or early 2030s orbiter-probe mission and covers needed technology, system reliability, mission implementation techniques, celestial mechanics, costs and other factors. Saikia served as principal investigator for implementing aerocapture on the proposed mission. \"A game-changing technology, aerocapture slows down the spacecraft at the destination using the target's atmosphere, saving propellant mass and travel time,\" he says. Besides contributing to the report, Saikia says, \"Working closely with people involved in actual missions helped me understand the real-world challenges faced in space /f_light.\"One of the \"ice giants, \" Neptune is dark, cold and windy.

For the next 200-plus years, scientists generally believed that asteroids \u2014 small, rocky objects that fall from the sky and are called meteorites when they land on earth \u2014 are the building blocks of planetary material. Now, a new theory has emerged: that asteroids may actually be the byproduct of planet formation. /T_he clues lie in the tiny bead-like grains of solidi/f_ied melted rock called \"chondrules\" found in meteorites, says Jay Melosh, a distinguished professor of earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences and professor of physics and aerospace engineering. \"We've found that an impact model /f_its extremely well with what we know about this unique material and the early solar system, and this suggests that asteroids are not leftover planet-building material and clumps of chondrules are not prerequisite to a planet,\" says Melosh, who, along with his colleague Prof. David Minton and former graduate student Brandon Johnson, published their initial /f_indings in Nature in 2015. /T_hat paper was not without controversy. \"We were kind of walking through a mine/f_ield by proposing an origin, but that's how science gets done,\" Melosh says. Now, with further research at Purdue and beyond that has borne out their initial /f_indings, he says, \"/T_hat opinion is beginning to turn.\" 10above | More than 100 asteroids were captured in this view from NASA's Wide-/f_ield Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE, during its primary all-sky survey.

But it was reading that changed the course of her life. While on a summer trip to her grandparents' farm, nine-year-old Voss picked up a copy of \"A Wrinkle in Time,\" Madeleine L'Engle's novel about a math and science whiz named Meg who travels through space and time to save her father. /T_he book inspired Voss to become an astronaut and also sparked a lifelong love of science /f_iction, the pinnacle of which may have occurred when Voss read passages from the book while orbiting in the space shuttle Columbia in 1997. Voss was one of few women ever launched into space. Over /f_ive /f_lights, she spent 49 days there, traveling 18.8 million miles in 779 Earth orbits while conducting such experiments as how /f_ire behaves in weightlessness and how plants adapt to extraterrestrial /f_light. After hanging up her spacesuit in 2000, Voss continued to champion the space program in other roles with NASA until her death in 2012. In her memory, Purdue students designed the VOSS (Visiting Our Solar System) exhibit, a $1.5 million interactive display in Discovery Park where youngsters can dream up their own adventures.

Starting as a Boilermaker in 1947 on a Navy scholarship, Armstrong left in 1949 to serve in the Korean War as a Navy pilot. Returning to Purdue in 1952, he graduated in 1955 with a bachelor of science in aeronautical engineering. In 1962, Armstrong became an astronaut and served as the command pilot for NASA's Gemini 8 mission, integral to the success of future NASA missions. On Gemini 8, he carried a ceremonial /f_lag that Purdue President Frederick Hovde had gifted him./uni00A0 On July 20, 1969 \u2014 the year of Purdue's centennial \u2014 Armstrong became the /f_irst man to walk on the moon; the next year, he received an honorary doctorate in engineering from Purdue. In 1971, following the Apollo 11 mission, Armstrong retired from NASA, moving home to Ohio to work as a professor. Armstrong regularly visited Purdue the rest of his life, spearheading fundraising campaigns and attending football games. Students he interacted with commented on his genuine interest in their academic pursuits. In 2007, Purdue ocials dedicated the Armstrong Hall of Engineering in a ceremony attended by Armstrong and 14 other Purdue astronauts. /T_he iconic 200,000-square foot building embodies the university's globally renowned engineering program, which to date has fostered the careers of nearly two dozen Purdue astronauts. Before his death in 2012, Armstrong donated his personal papers to Purdue Libraries' Archives and Special Collections; they chronicle his career in /f_light and are available for scholarly research. His spirit lives on in other ways at the university as well; outside Armstrong Hall, students and visitors are often seen posing for photographs next to his statue.left | The Saturn V launch vehicle (SA-506) for the Apollo 11 mission lifts o on July 16, 1969, from the Kennedy Space Center.

Cernan, who had graduated from Purdue in 1956 with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, commanded the Apollo 17, which blasted o from Kennedy Space Center on Dec. 7, 1972. /T_he lunar module touched down on the moon four days later. Over the course of the mission, he performed three moonwalks, exploring the barren landscape in a lunar rover, collecting about 250 pounds of soil samples and moon rocks, and taking scienti/f_ic measurements. On their last vehicular trek, Cernan \u2014 who returned to the spacecraft just behind his travel companion Harrison Schmitt \u2014 paused at the ladder to say goodbye. \"We leave as we came and, God willing, as we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind,\" he said. Years later, Cernan was quoted in the 2003 book, \"Wings of /T_heir Dreams: Purdue in Flight,\" written by journalist and Purdue /f_light historian John Norberg, \"Once you walk on the moon you can never 'unwalk.' You're one of the 12 human beings who have lived and called another planet in this universe home \u2014 and I refer to the moon as a planet because that's what it felt like for me after three days.\" Cernan was named a distinguished engineering alumnus by Purdue in 1967.

If only taboos about sexual health, sexual identity and HIV weren't so silencing. If only helping organizations could easily deliver programs to meet women's needs. /T_hat would simplify the research of Mangala Subramaniam, whose projects, many in India, examine inequality, social movements and how those who are disadvantaged organize to claim basic needs and rights, from accessing water to ending violence against women and reducing HIV risks. Instead, her research in India uses quantitative and qualitative data. \"It involves accessing marginalized populations \u2014 poor women, lower-caste women, transgender people and women in sex work,\" says Subramaniam, a professor of sociology and the Butler Chair and Director of the Susan Bulkeley Butler Center for Leadership Excellence. She makes contacts, develops trust, builds relationships, listens and oers empathy. And she writes about the challenges in the data collection process. \"I need a sense of the place, the people, their lives,\" she says. One connection can lead to another, such as the time a sex worker invited her to a meeting. /T_here, she sat in mismatched folding chairs with a dozen other women in saris and heard how they address intimate- partner violence and their increased HIV risk. \"What they share is insightful, making learning what they know critical,\" Subramaniam says. \"Policymakers think about this program, this intervention, this workshop, and then evaluate them. My argument is, should we not learn and understand what these women know, then make policy building on that?\" Sociologists often report that change is slow. \"I argue it is institutions, the structures embedded in society, that need to change,\" she says. \"Women are learning ways to address power and coercion, and to alter gender relations in their family, home and community.\" Satellite images of Earth at night \u2014 often referred to as \"night lights\" \u2014 show how humans have shaped the planet and lit up the darkness.

With 26 years' worth of data, the team found the causes were not only hot temperatures and declining precipitation, but also increased planting area, high use of fertilizers and rapid proliferation of crops with high water demands. \"/T_he soil moisture declined by 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent every decade of the study,\" says leader Qianlai Zhuang, Purdue's William F. and Patty J. Miller Professor of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences and professor of agronomy. \"Understanding soil moisture has major implications for agriculture and fresh water supplies.\" Even though droughts have been more intense and long-lasting in Northern China, \"/T_he driving forces for dry soil were inadequately understood, especially for those resulting from human activities,\" says team member Yaling Liu , a former Purdue graduate student now at Paci/f_ic Northwest National Laboratory. Mystery solved and counter measures identi/f_ied, the team published \"Agriculture Intensi/f_ies Soil Moisture Decline in Northern China\" in the July 2015 Scienti/f_ic Reports journal.

Unfortunately, these antidotes stay local, and are not often shared outside the community. Also, many countries do not have the possibility to analyze these natural compounds for their in/f_luence on known disease pathways, which prevents uncovering new potential treatments. An interdisciplinary global team of researchers is helping to create a global repository network of these local remedies in the hopes of learning more about their health bene/f_its, especially in the prevention of cancer. Dr. Sophie Leli\u00e8vre, a professor of cancer pharmacology in the College of Veterinary Medicine; co-leader, drug delivery and molecular sensing program in the NCI- designated Purdue University Center for Cancer Research; and scienti/f_ic director of the \"organ-on-a-chip,\" a 3-D cell culture method that harnesses advanced engineering to mimic the organization and activities of dierent organs in the laboratory. \"/T_he work has to be done with the proper model system to accurately identify bioactives that have an epigenetic impact and determine how they are working,\" says Leli\u00e8vre, who is developing the 3-D cell culture models in her laboratory and in the 3D3C. Already, her team of researchers has organized specimens from locations including Taiwan, France and Lebanon that are part of the International Breast Cancer and Nutrition (IBCN) collaboration. \"/T_he beauty of the organ-on a-chip model system is that it can ultimately be used with cells obtained from human populations of dierent origins, enabling an understanding of how natural compounds of medicinal plants and other natural species might work better in some populations than in others,\" she says. 3-D Cell Culture Core (3D3C) facility in the Birck Nanotechnology Center, is leading the charge in a new screening pipeline that focuses on epigenetics (the analysis of chemical changes on and around genes that are involved in gene expression control) to identify environmental factors with epigenetic impact. \"Many life-impacting chronic diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders and can cers are in/f_luenced by epigenetic changes,\" she says. Some environmental factors, like toxins in the air or water, turn on disease-causing genes. Others, like certain plants and fungi, might have protective eects. Leli\u00e8vre's biobank focuses on the latter, documenting the positive health impacts that local specimens have had on regions all over the world. Because many of these bene/f_icial eects are not scienti/f_ically understood, scientists cannot test the bioactive ingredients that cause the bene/f_icial eects directly on humans. /T_herefore, suspected bioactive ingredients must /f_irst be identi/f_ied and tested in an Heavy snow in Lebanon and Syria, 2012.

A research associate for the Department of Biology at Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne, she detailed her most recent work in the article, \"Assessment of Important Marine Turtle Nesting Populations on the Southern Coast of Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea,\" published in 2016 in Chelonian Conservation and Biology. What she's learned about declining turtle populations is fueling a program to develop local relationships, educate island residents and identify new income sources to reduce poaching. She's even dabbled in marketing, helping local women /f_ind a source for the recycled-paper jewelry her program taught them to make. \"You can have all the ideas you want about conservation work in another country, but if you don't provide alternative income, it might not work,\" she says. \"So, we created this artisanal program.\" With data on four species at /f_ive nesting beaches analyzed, she has gained key knowledge and reports that human aspects of turtle survival are progressing. Related successes include a printable sea turtle booklet given to 2,000 children in the last three years; community, elementary and university presentations; and /f_ive-month /f_ield camps for local and IPFW graduate students. \"During our workshops we explain the impacts of illegal poaching on wildlife, how it causes problems in our ecosystem, and why research, protection and conservation are needed,\" Honarvar says. \"We also hire people from the local community to assist with our research and conservation projects.\" On the horizon, pending funding, is a satellite telemetry project to identify where turtles go when they leave the beach and how they live. right | Aerial view of island in Equatorial Guinea in Central Africa.

Even though the deeper-hued corn could boost their bodies' production of Vitamin A, in turn possibly staving o blindness and death, they had their doubts. \"Do you eat it in the U.S.?\" they asked. Fair question, says Rocheford, who used natural breeding techniques \u2014 rather than genetic modi/f_ication \u2014 to help develop the more nutritious varieties. To dispel their fears, he provided it to a restaurant near Purdue University, and was able to report that diners devoured the chef 's creations. With education and encouragement from various organizations, the bioforti/f_ied orange maize is now gaining acceptance and grown in Zambia, Nigeria, Zimbabwe and Ghana. \"Adoption in Africa is coming along,\" Rocheford says. \"/T_here is steady progress.\" /T_he stateside taste success prompted him to launch NutraMaize LLC, with his son, Evan Rocheford, as chief executive ocer, to grow and market it in the United States. \"It has a nutty, buttery /f_lavor. It's creamy and rich tasting, along with being more nutritious,\" says the younger Rocheford, who honed his entrepreneurial skills through Purdue's startup program, the Foundry. In 2017, NutraMaize received a $225,000 Small Business Technology Transfer Research Grant from the National Science Foundation to collaborate with Rocheford's research lab at Purdue to prepare high carotenoid orange corn for large-scale commercial applications in the U.S. \"It won't be too long before you'll be seeing processed foods, like snacks and cereals, made from our delicious and nutritious orange corn,\" the CEO says. EUROPE | ARMENIA BIRD'S EYE VIEW | /T_he sky is probably not the /f_irst place you might think of to begin an archaeological excavation, but for Ian Lindsay , it is the logical place to start. Lindsay, an associate professor of anthropology and co-director of Project ArAGATS (Archaeology and Geography of Ancient Transcaucasian Societies), a collaborative American-Armenian research initiative, is using drone technology in order to capture data from Bronze Age sites in Armenia. Lindsay has found drones to be a good alternative to kites, balloons and cranes, as they oer a more detailed aerial perspective and an immediate sense of the spatial scale of the region's sites. /T_he aerial view provided by the drones has allowed him to collect both still images and video over much of his study area in the Kasakh River Valley of northern Armenia, while the spatial technology has allowed for more detailed 2-D and 3-D observations of ancient forti/f_ications \u2014 sites that date back to 1500 B.C. Last summer, Lindsay out/f_itted one of his drones with a multispectral sensor to detect subsurface architecture with thermal imaging, pushing new boundaries of the use of drones in archaeology. Lindsay's archaeological /f_ieldwork has been funded by the Executive Vice President for Research and Partnerships Oce and the College of Liberal Arts, which culminated in a $220,000 grant from the National Science Foundation in 2016 to study how ancient communities in the South Caucasus thrived 3,000 years ago. Speci/f_ically, Lindsay's team is surveying and excavating cemeteries and fortresses to understand how warfare shaped the region's earliest complex societies politically, socially and ritually, as well as the lifestyles of people who lived around the forts. In addition to his use of drones, Lindsay also uses a tablet-based mobile geographic information system (GIS), a collaborative tool that allows his survey team to add, edit and update data about /f_ield sites, helping them to be more ecient in the /f_ield. 20PHOTO BY VINCENT WALTERAn aerial view of excavations of the West Settlement at the base of the Tsaghkahovit Fortress in Armenia.

In 2015, he published \"Riding the Populist Web: Contextualizing the Five Star Movement in Italy,\" in Politics and Governance. /T_he article explores the populist dimensions of that movement. It emerged in the early 1990s as an anti-establishment, anti-globalist, Eurosceptic and pro- environmentalist movement. Its populist strategy and rhetoric helped transform it into a major player in the Italian political system in less than /f_ive years. \"Populist movements are good at galvanizing people around single issues and aggregating diused anger or disillusionment,\" Woods says. \"/T_hey politicize latent social cleavages,\" which identify voters as advocates or adversaries on certain issues. \"/T_hese movements focus on the feeling that a few bene/f_it more than most, and that fuels a sense of resentment,\" he's found. \"/T_he innate tendency of people to think they are or may be victims contributes to the ability of populist movements to claim that the majority has been ignored and are not truly represented by the minority.\" Short-term, the movements disrupt the status quo. \"/T_he long-term impact varies,\" he says. \"In some cases, it can lead to a realignment of a party system and voters' behavior, but in other cases, it proves ephemeral.\"\"Populist movements are good at galvanizing people around single issues and aggregating diused anger or disillusionment.\" Dwayne Woods PLANET EARTH The diverse and picturesque contours of southern Italy, known for its boot-like shape, take center stage in this Envisat image, acquired on January 25, 2011.

Besides rescue workers, civil engineers rushed in to both disaster areas to identify building damage and learn how to improve construction techniques. Currently, reconnaissance teams capture damage in photographs \u2014 as many as 10,000 a day \u2014 then spend hours describing the images and planning the next day's data collection. \"/T_hat takes a tremendous amount of time,\" says Shirley Dyke, professor of mechanical engineering and civil engineering. Could computers help, asked her postdoctoral researcher Chul Min Yeum , who now leads their National Science Foundation-funded work. He is creating deep-learning algorithms, inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, and developing computer vision technology to take on the task. And it's likely results will be even \"more complete than human evaluations,\" Dyke says. \"We're developing that expertise.\" /T_he work includes more than 100,000 images from about 15 earthquakes, hurricanes, /f_loods and tornados. \"What's most exciting is that we will use the actual data collected holistically, and we won't have to restrict our examination to /f_ive or 10 examples,\" Dyke says. \"/T_hat's what makes it powerful.\" /T_heir next step: \"We will take what we have learned to the /f_ield, see how it works, retrain and modify.\" Besides the image analysis project, Dyke's research includes hybrid simulation \u2014 \"a mix of modeling and testing\" \u2014 done in her Intelligent Infrastructure Systems Lab in Bowen Laboratory. /T_he learning and research lab includes a cyber-physical instrument for real- time structural testing, a cement wall reaction frame, hydraulic actuator, bridge model and three- and six-story building simulators.

Yes. Being nagged by street vendors, crafters and cab drivers? No. Tourists want to take in the local culture on vacation without feeling harassed by retailers, and yet in some areas across the world merchants may feel compelled to act aggressively simply to make ends meet. /T_hat's the conclusion of Jamaican-born Annmarie Nicely, an associate professor of hospitality and tourism management, who has studied visitor harassment in her home country and around the world. \"One of the things I do when I travel anywhere, whether it's for a vacation to relax, or not, is to make observations,\" says Nicely. Using her expertise in learning and performance, with an emphasis on the hotel industry, Nicely is investigating ways to help merchants in Jamaica and other countries learn more positive ways of selling. What a vendor may perceive as good marketing a tourist might perceive as badgering, and so Nicely and other researchers in the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management have studied visitors to identify speci/f_ic behaviors that they consider to be harassment. /T_hey have also discovered correlations between negative vending behaviors and both local socioeconomic and climatic conditions. One conclusion Nicely has drawn: instead of simply enforcing zero-tolerance policies on aggressive behavior, government ocials should place greater emphasis on desired nonaggressive selling behaviors in order to reinforce positive tourist-merchant interactions. 24 This MODIS true-color image from 2001 shows Cuba (center) and Jamaica (lower right).

Now, a certi/f_ication program spearheaded by Dr. Candace Croney , a professor of animal behavior and well-being in the Department of Comparative Pathobiology and Animal Sciences, adds a new measure of assurance to prospective pet owners. Canine Care Certi/f_ied, a national, voluntary program that sets rigorous standards for professional breeders, was developed after three years of research at Purdue and peer reviews by experts from other major academic institutions. \"USDA licensed commercial breeders, unlike true puppy mills, have to follow certain key regulations \u2014 and there are a lot of regulations,\" says Croney, director of Purdue's Center for Animal Welfare Science. But some breeders \u2014 like the members of Indiana's Amish community who approached Croney a few years ago \u2014 want further guidance on caring for their animals. /T_he certi/f_ication program, whose standards were re/f_ined after pilot-testing, addresses physical health (only veterinarians may perform necessary surgeries, for example), environment (such as enriched, high-quality spaces with outdoor access), behavioral health (including psychological enrichment and socialization), breeding life (such as mandatory spaying and neutering at retirement) and caretaker expectations (including continuing education and third-party audits). A debate continues in the United States on whether all dogs should come from animal rescues, but statistics show that the demand for pure-bred dogs is large and growing. \"If people are going to be buying dogs, we ought to /f_igure out a way to protect those dogs as much as possible, while also not sending the message that there's something wrong with getting shelter dogs,\" Croney says.

Born in Atchison, Kansas, in 1897, Earhart began /f_lying after her move to California in 1920. After taking lessons from aviation pioneer Neta Snook in a Curtiss Jenny, Earhart set out to surpass aviators before her, breaking the women's altitude record in 1922. In 1928, Earhart became a household name as the /f_irst woman passenger to /f_ly across the Atlantic Ocean. Her popularity soared with her solo transatlantic /f_light in 1932. She wrote and lectured around the country, highlighting Foundation established the Amelia Earhart Fund for Aeronautical Research and, with donations, purchased her Lockheed Electra airplane. She called it her \"/f_lying laboratory\" because of her experiments on speed and fuel consumption, radio communication, navigation methods and more. Earhart lost contact on her world-/f_light attempt on July 2, 1937, presumably crashing in the Paci/f_ic Ocean. Details, however, remain a mystery. Purdue houses the world's largest Earhart collection; it includes papers, memorabilia, artifacts and her /f_light jacket, among other items. Her presence at Purdue lives on in other ways: Outside the residence hall named after her is a life-sized statue, dedicated in 2009.her travels along with gender equality and women's opportunities in aviation. When Purdue University President Edward C. Elliott heard her speak in New York, he hired Earhart to mentor and counsel students on careers for women and serve as chief consultant in aeronautical engineering. She came to campus in fall 1935, staying until her /f_inal /f_light in July 1937. During her tenure, Earhart sought students' opinions and shared her views on gender stereotypes. Few women studied engineering then, and she set out to change that. Her push for women's independence included teaching women a \"handyman's course.\" While at Purdue, Earhart made plans to /f_ly around the world. /T_he Purdue Research left | A photo of Amelia Earhart sitting on her plane, circa 1935, which appeared in a 1937 article in the New York P ost.
