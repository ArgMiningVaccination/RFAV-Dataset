That is the motto of Julius Eulberg, founder of [Julisis](http://www.julisis.com/), the latest revolutionary skincare line to come to [Four Seasons Hotel Hong Kong](http://www.fourseasons.com/hongkong/). A modern day alchemist, Eulberg had spent his life in fashion while dabbling in holistic medicine until the wisdom of experience brought him to develop a skincare system that harnesses the potent efficacy of biodynamic herb,s as well as the trace minerals found in ultra-fine gold and silver signature serums. Working with these transformative products, [The Spa at Four Seasons](http://www.fourseasons.com/hongkong/spa/?c=t&_s_icmp=mmenu) is introducing the first Biorhythm Facial, a body, mind and skincare therapy designed to reveal radiant skin while working in tandem with the body's biorhythm. Biodynamic and Probiotic Skincare Julisis expands on the traditional notions of skincare by harnessing life giving powers of biodynamic herbs - a holistic, ecological and ethical approach to farming. The ingredients harvested from this farm of are medical grade, used for homeopathic medicine for more than 100 years. Once harvested, herbs undergo a fermentation process producing nutritionally dense priobotics. Eulberg likens the result to \"sauerkraut for the skin.\" Each batch of product is made to order, in production cycles that can take up to thirteen months. The product inside is alive with cellular nutrition - the gold essence alone has more than 150 living enzymes. The purity of these ingredients results in creams and serums that are extremely light weight, absorbed by the skin on contact. Liquid Gold and Liquid Silver There are many skincare products that harness the benefits of gold and silver, but Julisis goes beyond the norm. Patented signature products Liquid Gold and Liquid Silver, contain the only cell-accessible forms of gold and silver, accelerating repair and supporting skin's natural healing process. Liquid Gold is sourced from 22K gold, treated with various acids, salt and mineral formulas to distil the essence of gold. Julisis founder Julius Eulberg believes that no matter the concentration, to be most effective, these products be must work with a body's natural biorhythm. Liquid Gold, like the power of the sun, is used to energise and activate skin, ideal for smokers or others with tired or polluted skin in need of a boost. Liquid Silver, powered by the moon, is used for calming and grounding, a perfect follow up to meditation or for skin in need of detoxing and regeneration. Biorhythm Facial Designed to match each guest's natural biorhythm, this revolutionary treatment begins with a seated meditation to calm the mind. Tranquility is deepened and lingering facial tension released with a thorough face, neck, head and jaw massage. The face is cleansed, masked and moisturised using a personalised combination of Julisis skin care products. Drawing on millennia of alchemic history, the skin care line employs pure cell nutrition from biodynamic herbs as well as liquid silver and gold essence, to purify and perfect the skin. Aligning mind, body and skin care with the rhythm of nature the new [Biorhythm Facial](http://www.fourseasons.com/hongkong/spa/facial_collection/) shows immediate results for an energetically super charged glow. 1 hour Head Massage and Facial - Monday - Thursday: 60 minutes - HKD 1,620 - Friday - Sunday: 60 minutes - HKD 1,820 1.5 hours - includes seated mediation - Monday - Thursday: 90 minutes - HKD 2,380 - Friday - Sunday: 90 minutes - HKD 2,640 2 hours - includes seated meditation and back massage - Monday - Thursday: 120 minutes - HKD 3,150 - Friday - Sunday: 120 minutes - HKD 3,570 Full Moon Meditation at the Spa Senior Spa Director [Shoshana Weinberg](http://press.fourseasons.com/hongkong/hotel-team/shoshana-weinberg.html) is a fervent believer in the countless benefits brought by meditation - increased motivation and focus, heightened sense of empathy, better sleep, decreased anxiety and stress, and enhanced perspective of self.
