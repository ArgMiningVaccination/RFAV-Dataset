We will come to ord er. I apologize fo r bein g late. Th e full committee was heari ng the ad minist ratio n's nominee for Com missioner of the Ad ministratio n on the Ag ing , and we were inte rested in pu rsu ing some issues in the areas of nu triti on with him in the tit le I I I pro gra ms of the Older Am ericans Act. So I apologize for being late and look forw ard to this hear ing . Today , the Subc omm ittee on Hea lth and Scientific Rese arch holds a h earin g on S. 2466, the Nation al In stitu tes of He alth C are Resea rch Act of 1978. I intr oduce d this bill las t week, with the cosponsorship of Senat ors Schweiker, Williams, and Ja vits. The purpose of this new legisla tion is to give focus, str en gth , and vi talit y to a series of rese arch and statistic al activities aime d at im proving the quali ty, efficiency, and effectiveness of healt h servic es in the Un ite d States. Am eric ans have an abidi ng fa ith th at new know ledg e can improve their lives. I sha re this belief. I am pro ud th at ou r country has had the wisdom to invest generou sly over the las t 30 y ear s in biomedical and beh avioral research aimed at the conquest of disease. H ar d as it is to believe now, the re was a time when these research areas were neglected and undevelo ped. It took a com binatio n of un \u00ad sti nt ing pub lic fund ing and c are ful institutio n-bu ild ing to br in g them to the point the y are toda y. Th at natio nal effort is now pa ying gen\u00ad erous dividends. Th e his tor y of Fe deral invo lvem ent in biomedical and beh avioral rese arch offers im po rta nt lessons fo r the Congress and the Am eric an people. Fo r despite o ur N ation ' s commitment to health rese arch, some areas o f health -re lat ed in quiry are s till n eglected. Hea lth servic es research , healt h sta tistics, and epidem iology, the eva of new and existing m edical tech nology \u2014these disc iplines are support ed meagerly, if at all, by the Fe deral Government. And where money is available, it is oft en scattere d ha ph az ardly amo ng uncoord ina ted an d competitive prog ram s. (1) The result, I believe, is th at valu able oppo rtu nitie s to imp rove the lives of our citiz ens are bein g lost. It is time to star t bu ild ing these are as of inq uiry into powerful partn ers of basic biomedical sciences. It is time to complete the job of bu ild ing our Na tion's cap acity to imp rove the h ealth of its citizens th rou gh research. Tha t is why I am pro posing to create the National In stitu tes of Hea lth Care Research. It would provide an ins tituti onal home for healt h care research and relate d activities, an advanta ge which the biom edical sciences have enjoyed fo r decades. It would pro vide increased au thority and direction for the Dep art\u00ad ment to dra w tog eth er sca tter ed program s in the are as of statistics and healt h services research. It would provide modera te increases in fund ing for these activities, ^ive HEW money and au thor ity to exp and and systematize its work in the are a of evalu ati ng healt h technologies. And it would provide an ins tituti onal umbrella which could be exp and ed to include oth er research missions as ap prop ria te. These could include, for exam ple, selected areas related to disease preven tion and control. Spec ifically, the bill would accom plish the follow ing : I t would create a National In stitu tes of He alt h Care Researc h modeled upon and par allel to the National In sti tutes of He alt h. Th is umbrella org ani zation would pro vide overall policy guidan ce and coo rdination for its component i nst itutions. I t would create a National Cente r for the Ev alu ation of Medical Technologies, a new agency located in the National In stitu tes of Hea lth Care Research. The pur pose of this new cente r would be to assess th e cost a nd effectiveness of medical practices and procedures. It would exp and , redirect, and rename the National Cente r for He alth S tatistics. Th is agency would take on im po rta nt new fun ctio ns in the conduct of epidemiolog ic research and in the coo rdination of healt h statistics work. It would become a com ponent institut e of the National Insti tutes of He alt h Care Research. Fina lly , S. 2466 would expan d, redirect, and rena me the Nationa l Center for He alth Services Research. Th is agency would also become a component ins titute of the National In stitu tes of He alth Care Research.

V . 25 Senator Kenn edy. Before hearing testimony, I would like to comment on several of these proposals. The creation of a National Center for the Evaluation of Medical Technologies is a key element in our bill and deserves a few words of explanation. Last summer, the subcommittee heard 2 days of testimony on a problem which is of growing concern not only to the Congress, but to many thoughtful medical and social scientists throughout the country. It has been estimated tha t one-half of the annual increase in the cost of 1 day of hospital care can be attributed to the use of more technology in medical practice. That means that between 19 66 and 19 76 , expenditures on medical technology added be tw 'een $8 and $1 2 billion to our national hospital bill. What are we buying with this outlay of funds for additional tech\u00ad nology ? Are these expenditures improving the health of the American people? According to the testimony we heard last summer, in many cases, we simply do not know . I yield to no one in mv desire to see the products of biomedical research transferred rapidly and appropriately to the bedside. But we must recognize that we also pay a high price for the overly rapid application of ne w' technologies. The creation of a National Center for the Evaluation of Medical Technologies, like the one proposed here, seem s to us a reasonable and essential first step tow'ard assuring tha t the health practices commonly employed in the United States are efficacious and cost effective. Just one more point. S. 2466 makes changes in the mandate, loca\u00ad tion, and authorization of the National Center for Health Statistics. I view the gathering of health statistics as a vital function of Government. Statistics are the Nation's window on its own health. They tell us what our health problems are, and how to begin solving them. In this regard, I w ' ould like to say how impressed I was with the recently published HEW report, \"Health, United States, 1976-77 .\" It is an example of Government statistical reporting and analysis at its very best. It is because of the importance of health data-g athering that I am so distressed at the Department's continuing inability to coordi\u00ad nate its own data-gathering activities. The Federal Paperwork Commission has commented on this prob\u00ad lem . It estimates that the Nation would save $200 million if the current overlap and duplication in health data-gathering w Tere elimi\u00adnated at the Federal leve l. S. 2466 addresses this issue by increasing the authority of the revised National Center to coordinate health statistics. We will be interested to hear the administration's plans for dealing with the statistics coordination problem. In health statistics, as elsewhere, S. 2466 has ambitious goals. In \u00ad stitution building is no easy job. It will be argued that the proposal moves too fast and too far, tha t it is too disruptive of established organizations, that the health disciplines involved are underdeveloped and need time to mature. 26 Unfo rtu na tely, the situation could h ardly be worse th an it curre ntl y is. The b urd en is on those who would go slow t o prove they can do th e job w ith out a co mprehensive new initiative. S. 2466 will give us a solid st ar t at com ple ting the job of building our N ation's hea lth research c apacity . I look forw ard to the comments of our witnesses.

Y ou r s up\u00ad port, and that of your subcommittee over the years for our hea lth services research and sta tistics activities, is greatly appre cia ted by all of us in the D epartme nt. Yo ur continuing concern with both the prom ise and prob lems of health technolo gy has been a catalyst for im po rta nt new actions in the De partm ent, which I will outline in my rem arks. \\ I might ju st m ention, Senator, th at the hearings we pa rticip ate d in last summer, which you ref err ed to, set in motion a chain of events which ha ve been very im po rta nt to all of us and , we th ink, to the health of th e N atio n, ultim ate ly. The work of the centers make s invalua ble, although, un fortu nately, not always visible, contrib he alt h legisla \u00ad tion, Federal hea lth pro gra ms, and the decisions of health care providers. Th e comprehensiv e pro gra m of the N ational Ce nte r f or H ealth Sta \u00ad tist ics includes more than 20 da ta system s, which produce inform ation on healt h sta tus of the population , health resources, uti lization of 27 healt h services, n utrition, fam ily g row th, and the N ation's pa tte rns of births , deaths, marriage s, and divorces. You have alread y mentioned '' He alth, U.S.A.'' as one of the pu b\u00ad lications, Senator. I would also call yo ur a tte nti on to the \"C hartbook on He alt h, U.S.A.*' which are im po rta nt pro ducts and which repre\u00ad sent, I think , some o f the most comprehensive da ta on health sta tistics presented anywhere in the world, nationally. A few examples will illus tra te the importance of these acti vities. Among the specific contribu tions of the inf orma tio n that has been gen erated is an awareness of the healt h care tre nds th at form the fac tua l bac kdrop for many im po rta nt decisions in the healt h field, in cost con tain ment, quali ty, distr ibu tio n of services, and con trol of toxic substances. Fo r exam ple, the Hospital Discharge Sur vey has shown the inci\u00ad dence of hysterectom ies rising substan tia lly from 734 per 100,000 females 15 years and older in 1971, to 850 in 1974. More recently, there appears to be a down tur n, pe rhaps due to heig hten ed visibility of omen on, stimu lated in no small meas\u00ad ure, we think , by the data which have become available. The He alth a nd Nu tritio n Ex am ina tio n Surve y m easures the prev a\u00ad lence of among K ennedy . Hav e the same thing . Do c\u00ad tor? B oth were ta rgete d problems. Dr. R ichmond . Yes. Indeed, th ere ha s been a ve ry sign ificant decline since this has been made more visible\u2014a very s ign ific ant decline, and we will men tion t ha t, perha ps, la ter. The He alth and Nu tritio n Ex am ina tion Sur vey measures the p reva \u00ad lence of hyper ten sion amo ng ad ults and indicates tha t the prevalence rate among blacks is nearly twice as high as that amo ng whites. New epidem iologic tech niqu es in ma pp ing infant mortality and oth er m ortal ity rates to de term ine geo gra phic differentials can identi fy variations due to lack of access to care or exposure to env ironmental hazards. We intend to make m uch more use of these kin ds of geo gra phic dif \u00ad ferentia ls in our pla nn ing for hea lth services as we move for ward. The National Cente r fo r He alt h Services Research plays a par allel role in services research.

[The following m ate rial was subseque ntly received for t he rec ord:] 29 For the Record - Supplement to Dr. Richmond's Opening Remarks Ever since the term \"statistics\", meaning the numbers describing the situation in the state, came into use it has been recognized that statistics are essential to statecraft. Man manages his affairs better 1 if he has access to quantitative information on the condition of the state. The National Center for Health Statistics has an illustrious history in providing such quantitative information in the health field. The National Center for Health Statistics was organized in August 1960 upon the recommendation of the Surgeon General's Study Group on Mission and Organization of the Public Health Service. In its final report in June 1960, the Study Group cited a real need for such a statistical operation to serve as the health statistical arm of the Public Health Service with this statement: \"The needs of the Nation and the responsibilities of the Public Health Service require broad regional and national data with respect to the character and dynamics of health problems, their trends and implications. While States and other organizations contribute valuable data, national intelligence requires a center for the collection, evalua\u00ad tion, analysis, and Interpretation of data from many sources. The Public Health Service has primary responsibility at the Federal level to provide national intelligence on matters relating to health - blAhs, deaths, illness, disability, health services, marriages, divorces.\" 28-790 0 - 78 - 3 30 2 Although the Center was formed In 1960, some of its activities developed much earlier. For example, questions about births, marriages and deaths were included in the 1850 census and in the century that followed the Bureau of the Census (Department of Commerce) was given increasing re- f sponsibility to collect, compile and publish vital statistics. In 1946 these functions were transferred to the Public Health Service, and the National Office of Vital Statistics was established to admin\u00ad ister the program and provide a single authority for collecting vital records at the Federal level. As early as a century ago it was recognized that records uf deaths alone could not provide a complete picture of the impact of illness and disease on the population. In 1878, the Congress authorized the collection of data on cholera, plague, smallpox, and yellow fever, and in 1893 a bill was passed to collect weekly morbidity data from States and cities throughout the United States. This system of notifiable disease reporting has continued until the present time. Development of vital registration and of the system of notifiable disease reporting still left large gaps in our health intelligence. Information was needed which could be obtained only from the people themselves, from examinations of samples of the population, or from the providers of health services. Particularly missing was knowledge of those conditions that do not have high .rates of fatality but which have high Impact in terms of disability, economic loss, and the social and environmental concomitants. 31 3 The establishment of survey methods to measure morbidity has occurred only in recent years because the techniques and tools did not exist earlier. During the 1940's and 1950's research conducted within universities, as well as methodological work sponsored by the Federal government, resulted in refinements of questionnaire design and inter- viewing techniques which substantially reduced errors in survey data. The theory and application of techniques for sampling of human popula\u00ad tions was developed to a point where relatively small samples of the population could provide Information about the population as a whole, within stated margins of error and at reasonable cost. And finally, the electronic computer had proved its worth in processing of large volumes of complex survey data, in converting the answers to estimates for the entire population, and in tabulating and analyzing the results. By the time the National Health Survey Act was passed In response to increased demands for health Information, the basic methods had been devised for producing the data. Continued improvements have been made in sampling, survey, analytic, and computer technology, concurrent with the development of new health statistical systems. Pioneers in such survey techniques applied these methods to study the w Impact of the influenza epidemic of 1918 and in a number of community based surveys on child health, nutrition, dental disease, tuberculosis, costs of medical care, and many other aspects of morbidity that were of concern during'the first third p f this century. The economic depression of the 1930*s provided the Impetus for a national health survey in order 32 4 to tr y to rela te n u tr it io n , ph ys ical growth, he al th st atu s and he alth se rvic es to the econom ic co nd itio ns of the tim es . Res ul ts of th is survey, conducted In 1935-36 In over 700 ,000 household:* In 83 urban ar ea s, were used during the nex t 20 years to provide base li ne data to the he al th pro fe ss io ns, and to plan and promote pu bl ic he al th pro\u00ad grams .

This program promotes the uniform collection of data on these vital events, provides technical assistance to the registration areas, con\u00ad ducts followback surveys to expand the scope of national vital statis\u00ad tics, and prepares life tables. This program also conducts the biennial Family Growth Survey. This household interview survey collects data on fertility, family planning, and infant and maternal health from a prob\u00ad ability sample of ever-married women. The Health Interview Survey: Oldest of the Center's surveys, the Health Interview Survey was started in 1957 to provide a continuous flow of health data from interviews of a sample of households spread across the Nation. Data arc collected week after week. Questionnaires arc revised v annually so that information on new health topics can be compiled as . the need arises. * A About 42,000 interviews are conducted annually, covering about 134,000 persons, by skilled interviewers from the Bureau of the Census. They 36 8 use questionnaires to obtain a general health history of each family. Questions designed to produce \"yes\" or \"no\" answers are asked on a variety of health subjects. For example, questions might include asking if any member of the house\u00ad hold had experienced such diseases or conditions as asthma, tuberculosis, chronic bronchitis, high blood pressure, or heart trouble. If they have, then more detailed Information is sought. Data from this survey measure the social rather than the physiological dimensions of health; the total amount of illness, how it affects people's lives, what actions they take to prevent or cure Illness, and what the relation of health and medical care is to a wide variety of social, economic and demographic variables. The Health and Nutrition Examination Survey: In contrast to the Health Interview Survey, the Health and Nutrition Examination Survey collects nutritional, physiological and diagnostic data through specially designed health examinations, using objective measurements and tests. Like the Health Interview Survey, this is a continuing operation. Direct health examinations are given to pre-selected samples of persons of various age groups. The sample in each case represents national proportions of race, economic and educational levels, as well as rural areas, small towns, medium-sized cities, and metropolitan areas. 37 9 Recent data from the survey includes information on dietary intake, clinical findings, growth and development measurements, laboratory test, results on blood and urine, prevalence of emphysema, derma- y tologists* findings on skin disease, measures of auditory acuity, and assessments of pulmonary function. 4 The Health Resources and Health Resources Utilization Programs; These programs are designed to develop statistics on national resources in health manpower and health facilities and the uses made of these re\u00ad sources. The specific surveys include: . Master Facility Inventory: Maintains a file containing Census-type data on the nation's health facilities, their services, and staff. This file serves as a universe from which probability samples may be selected for particular surveys and it also services as a current source of baseline statistical data. Because censuses are conducted on the facilities, data arc available for small geographic areas. This file is the only source o.f comprehensive data on health facilities that is available and suitable for local health planning. . Resident Places Survey: Data is collected through interview surveys from a sample of long-term inpatient * facilities listed in the Master Facilities Inventory. Statistics arc published on the services provided by 38 io these facili ties , the education and experience of their staff, and the expenditures they incur in providing care. Statistics are also developed on the soclo-dcmo- graphlc characteristics and health status of residents in these facilities. The results of these biennial surveys are used for planning purposes at both the national and local levels. Hospital Discharge Survey: Demographic and medical data on persons discharged from short-stay, non-Federal hospitals is collected, analyzed, and published. The data is collected through a survey of hospital summary sheets and ledger records. Reports are prepared and published providing Information on demographic and medical characteristics of the patients ns well us data on type and location of hospitals participating in the survey. National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey: The purpose of this -survey is to provide statistics describing services to ambulatory patients including statistics on demographic characteristics, diagnoses, diagnostic * procedures, and patiept management. Physicians' offices arc the site of the greatest volume of health care and X 39 t h is su rv ey pro vid es in fo rm at io n th a t ha s been I n s u ffic ie n t In th e p a st, about th is Impor tan t seg ment o f th e h ea lt h ca re sy st em .

There has been a great deal of concern In recent years with ensuring equal acces s to medical care among all subgroups of the population. By monitoring trends in the National Center for Health Statistics data over the past several years, it is apparent that the large increases in Federal health programs have had a substantial impact on accessibility. For example, data from the Health Interview Survey shows that in 1964, before the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid, the poor averaged 17 percent fewer doctor visits per person than the uonpoor (age-adjusted). By 1976, however, the poor reported 10 percent more visits per person than the nonpoor (age-adjusted). Similarly, a recently published study (C. Bombardier, et al., NEJM 297: 669-705, 9/29/77) based on the 1963 and 1970 Health Interview Surveys show large increases in surgical operations among disadvantaged groups: the aged, the lower educated and non-whites in urban areas. Despite these encouraging results, however, there is clear evidence that substantial gaps in access remain. For example, a special supple\u00ad ment to the 1974 Health Interview Survey collected information about usual source of medical care. Seventy-eight percent of the poor reported that they had a usual source of care compared to 82 percent of the non- 4 poor. Yet, when asked about the provider.of their usual source*of care, 35 percent of poor blacks in metro areas identified a hospital clinic or emergency room compared to only 3 percent of non-poor whites in metro areas. 41 13 Another indication of unequal access is provided by data from the 1973 Health Interview Survey supplement on preventive care. Among black women aged 45-64, 30 percent have never had a Pap smear to detect cervical cancer compared to only 16 percent of white women in the same age group. Since cervical cancer is amenable to effective treatment if detected at an early stage, the health consequences of this type of unequal access are particularly revealing: the death rate among Black wonen in this aRe group due to cervical cancer is more than three times the corresponding white rate. The other side of the access issue is the question of unnecessary utilization of medical services. This issue has been raised most seriously in the hospital sector and particularly with respect to un\u00ad necessary surgery. The rate of surgical operations per 100,000 popu\u00ad lation has increased nearly 25 percent between 1971 and 1976. Careful monitoring of specific procedures, however, is needed to better under\u00ad stand the reasons for and possibly control the increase. For example, in 1971 tonsillectomy was the most frequently performed operation, with a rate of 478 per 100,000 population. A number of reports dealing with the appropriateness and demonstrating the lack of effectiveness of tonsillectomy led to a dramatic 40 percent decline in the rate by 1976. It still remains, however, one of the more frequently performed pro\u00ad cedures and shows narked variation by region: the region with the highest /V* rate (North Central) showed nearly 60 percent more tonsillectomies per 100,000 than the region with the lowest rate (Northeast). 42 14 A procedure which has shown marked increases over the years is 'Cacsearcan section. In 1971, 6 percent of all deliveries were by Caesearcan section. This rate doubled to 12 percent by 1976. Regional variation is also large: from 11 percent in the North Central region to 15 percent in the Northeast. The increase from 6 percent to 12 per\u00ad cent represents 188,000 additional Cacsearcan sections per year and (based on the 3.2 additional days per delivery for Cacsearcan section) 6 million hospital days. Of course, these data raise a number of questions which require further study. What wa3 the reason for the increase? Why did it vary by region? Does the regional varatlon in the incidence of Cacsearcan section relate to regional differences in the incidence of conditions which are indica\u00ad tions for surgery or to regional differences in surgical practice? Finally, before implementing policy to control unnecessary surgery, even more difficult questions must be addressed: what are the appro\u00ad priate Indications for the procedure? Under what conditions will this procedure improve the individual's health? What arc the potential risks? llow do alternative therapies compare in terms of risks and benefits? Finally, it should be emphasized that not all increases in surgery are \"unnecessary.\" The Bombardier study cited earlier illustrated Increases in surgical rates which may have reflected greater access to needed services. 43 15 Prevention * Another example of the Center's statistical support of the Department's program planning and evaluation activities is in the area of health promotion. The Department is attaching Lop priority to the reduction of the incidence and the abatement, through secondary prevention, of the burden of disease and Injury. Given the vast number of options that might go into a health promotion program and the scarcity of re\u00ad sources, it is imperative that the component initiatives be systemat\u00ad ically articulated in a structure which minimizes redundancy and attacks as broad a range of preventable illness as possible. The Center's surveys provide information that has been extremely valuable in targeting health promotional efforts. Knowledge of the extent and nature of the burden caused by various health conditions Is needed in establishing preventive program priorities. The Center's statistics are also used to determine the modifiable personal habits and environmental factors that occor with sufficient frequency and consequences to warrant intervention. In planning a program, it is necessary to identify the population groups with the greatest need for preventive activities of various types. For instance, the Health and Nutrition Examination Survey points to women in low-income households as being particularly prone to obesity. Obesity has been shown to * increase the risk of early dejifeh. Information regarding eating habits, physical activity, attempts to lose weight, and other considerations 44 16 relevant to prevention is obtained through several of the Center's surveys. Sirollnrly, the Center provides data essential to planning, monitoring, and evaluating prevention activities aimed at smoking, control of high blood pressure, accidents, and n variety of other personal and environmental factors. 4 Small-Area Data for Local Health Planning The national health planning legislation passed in 1974 (P.L. 93-641) explicitly states that where possible, the newly-created planning agencies use existing data, including those provided by national pro\u00ad grams, for planning activities. Furthermore, the high cost of conduct\u00ad ing surveys and collecting data increases the demand among local areas for reliable data specific to their areas for health planning. Questions arise as to the feasibility of using data derived from national surveys for local purposes, if such use is deemed feasible, and to the appro\u00ad priate methodology to be employed in utilizing national data. Over the past fifteen years the National Center for Health Statistics has responded to these requests-for small-area data in several ways. First, the Health Interview Survey (HIS) was designed to provide estimates of illness, disability, utilization of medical resources, periodic cstl- \u00ab mates of medical care costs, and other health-related topics for the Nation, four broad geographic Regions, and the 31 largest standard v' at metropolitan statistical areas (SMSA's). In addition, state estimates 45 17 of disability based on HIS data have been published for 1962-4, and similar State estimates of disability and utilization o f medical services have been published for 1969-71. Both of those publicationsr employed the \"synthetic\" estimation technique, which operates as follows. Hany of the health characteristics referred to above are related to age, sex, race and other demographic factors. The HIS can provide national and regional estimates of the particular health variable for each demo\u00ad graphic (age, sex, race, etc.) group. These national (or regional) rates are then disaggregated to the State level by multiplying by the propor\u00ad tion of the State's population in the demographic group and adding over all demographic groups. It is recognized that there are numerous problems associated with synthetic estimates, not the least of which Is that they are subject to biases which are, to date, not quantifiable. A large empirical study recently conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics has indicated that improved estimation -of small-area health characteristics can be achieved by combining a synthetic estimator with an estimator directly derived from survey observations taken in the local area of interest. A publication using this improved methodology with 1974-76 data from the HIS is currently in press. The application of the methods described above to areas smaller than fI* States (except for the 31 SMSA's already mentioned) is still in the research stage. The following two examples, however, illustrate uses 28 -790 O - 78 - 4 46 18 -o f NCHS data at the local level In somewhat different contexts, one Involving HIS data, the other using data from the vital statistics registration system. Our National concern for equal access to health care has been translated into a large number of Federal laws which give special emphasis to medically underserved or health manpower shortage areas. The most com\u00ad prehensive attempt to go beyond health manpower to population ratios In identifying undereerved areas is the Index of Medical Underservice (IMU) which Is used to designate medically underserved areas (MUAs) under the HMO Act and other health service programs. The IMU is a composite of four variables (infant mortality rate, physician to population ratio, percent of population below poverty level, and percent of population over 65). These variables are weighted to predict the areas that a group of informed experts would judge as medically underserved. The use of such indirect measures to designate MUA's is the result of a lack of uniform small-area indicators across the United States which are more directly related to.access to medical care. Although the 1IIS collects a great deal of information on utilization of health resources and, in 1974, included a special supplement on medical care needs, it . * does not provide sufficiently reliable geographic detail to directly designate MUA's. It is possible, however, to use the 1I1S data to assist In critically examining MUA designations. Such a study is now in progress, and the preliminary results for non-metropolitan areas show that the differences 47 19 between MUAs and non-MUAs are not ns great as might be expected. For example, there was little difference between MUA and non-MUA respon\u00ad dents in the proportion with a usual source of care (80 percent in MUAs vs. 83 percent in non-MUAs). The proportions with no physician visit within the past year were also similar (29 percent in MUAs vs. 27 percent in non-MUAs), and the numbers of physician visits per person per year were identical (4.5). It is possible to go even further and use the 11IS data together with Census data, vital statistics, and manpower data, which arc available for small areas, to define an index which is better able to discriminate between underserved and non-underserved areas. By choosing a few key variables which reflect access (e.g., availability of a usual source of care, absence of problems which delayed or prevented needed care, etc.), it is feasible to use multivariate statistical methods to choose those variables available at the local level which best predict medical underservicc. The use of natality and infant mortality data in planning maternal and child health programs is an areas In which health status data is relevant to health planning. For example, despite the large decreases in Infant mortality in recent years, there remain very large geographic variations in mortality during infancy. In fact, during the period 1974-1975, the infant mortality rate for certain medium-sized non-metropolitan countiesr ' was 19 percent higher for both white and black Infants than the corres\u00ad ponding rates for suburban counties of large metropolitan areas. The 48 20 white/black differences also remai n large: in 1975 the black infant mortality rate was C5 percent higher than the white rate. The black rate was fully 25 years behind the white rate! These considerations have led to a new effort on the part of the Bureau of Community Health 4 Services to revitalize State maternal and child health programs. The vital statistics system allows the planner to examine county infant mortality rates over long time periods. Thus, the planner can identify areas with consistently high rates or unusual shifts in rates which indicate the need for appropriate intervention. Natality data can also be useful to the planner for a number of purposes. First, in 42 States, data on the birth certificate indicate the month or trimester in which prenatal care began and the number of prenatal visits. These data provide an Indication of areas or population subgroups (e.g., teenage mothers with no high school education) who arc not receiving adequate prenatal care. Furthermore, intervention to improve the level of prenatal care can be evaluated rpther quickly and Inexpensively by using birth certificate data. Although the evidence is not conclusive, there are indications that adequate prenatal care is a determinant of healthy newborns. Another example of the use of natality data at the local level Js in a planning and evaluating family planning programs. A priority of family planning programs is the reduction of birth rates among mothers at* highest risk of infant loss (e.g., teenagers, women over 35 or 40, women with large numbers of children, etc.). The distribution of births 49 21 by these characteristics can be used in targeting programs to meet the needs of high-risk, women, and by following births over a period of time, in evaluating the success of the programs. Tt is also rela\u00ad tively easy to \"translate\" the distribution of births into expected infant mortality rales which can then be compared with actual rates. Finally, the infant's birth weight (which is given on the birth certificate) provides another health status measure which should be examined to identify those mothers at risk of low birth weight infants. Still another example of the uses of mortality data which goes beyond the population of mothers and infants is the examination of small area death rates fur specific causes. Dr. David Rutstcln and his colleagues have listed causes of death which arc preventable under current medical knowledge. Thus, areas with high rates for these causes could be ex\u00ad amined to detect any deficiencies in their health care delivery system. We are beginning to study geographic variations in these cause-specific death rates. * . Epidemiology Program Under the Public Health Law 93-353 discussed earlier, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) is authorized to become involved in environ\u00ad mental and social studies that arc related to health; \"The Center may collect statistics on environmc' ntal, social, and other health hazards; determinants of health.\" For many reasons, NCHS has not emphasized these aspects during Its first few years of Implementation of the law. However, changes are underway. 50 22 The July, 1977, report of the Technical Consultant Panel to the U.S. National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics, on Statistics Needed for Determining the Effects of the Environment on Health, con- * tains eight detailed recommendations. These include the cstablIshment of a National Death Index, the strengthening of the epidemiologic capabilities of the NCllS, mainly concerned with analyzing, and inter- 4 preting epidemiologic data related to environmental exposures, and the resultant health status. The panel encouraged the use of the Health Interview Survey and the Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for the collection of data on environmental exposures, morbidity, and other environmentally relevant effects. They also recommended collecting more detailed information on occupational and industrial exposures in such national surveys. The Center is responding to each of these recommendations. A national working group has been formed to implement the establishment of a National Death Index. This development is of great importance to the epidemiologic community for it will facilitate followup of persons exposed to suspected health hazards without violating standards of confidentiality. A Another major initiative in this area Is the establishment of an epidemiology program at NCllS. While epidemiologic activities to varying degrees exist throughout the Center, there will be a focal < * point in the Office of Statistical Research. Tills office has already undertaken several epidemiologic studies. 51 23 A major purpose of this new program Is to Integrate the data needs of researchers In environmental health with the resources available at the National Center for Health Statistics. Toward thLs purpose it is proposed to more extensively analyze the existing data available at NCHS to answer questions currently arising in the field of environmental epidemiology. It is also proposed to alter some of the ongoing surveys within NCHS to provide explicit new information useful to epidemiologists. Another important new epidemiologic activity is establishing a national health monitoring program on a more systematic basis. Thia involves developing statistical and computer methodology for displaying and de\u00ad tecting unusual disease time trends and levels by age group, race, sex, and geographic region. The forthcoming (1978) National Atlas of Mortality depicting racc-scx-disease specific age-adjusted death rates for all major diseases by State Economic Arens is a first step in this direction by NCHS. This publication is a followup to the innovative mortality atlases published by the National Cancer Institute. Such monitoring of primary cause of death, combinations of contributing causes, and unusually young deaths, will be conducted on a ugc-spccific as well as age-adjusted basis. Hopefully, the methodology can be ex\u00ad tended to birth defects from birth and infant mortality records, the Hospital Discharge Survey, and to morbidity mapping of Health Interview Survey data as well. There is evidence that important epidemiologLe clues are being missed by failure to systematize such monitoring. 52 26 Should unusual disease patterns present themselves such that fi eld stud ies appear warranted, epid emiolog ic in ve stigat ion un its in appro\u00ad pr iate Federal agencies would be not ifie d. Valuable data that has been and is no w being co lle cted at the Nationa l * Center for Health S ta ti st ic s can be analyzed an d interp reted in the li ght of kn ow n and po tent ial environmental hazards. There arc also surveys in ex ist en ce that could be supplemented or altered in order to obtain addit ion al inform ation on the relat ion ship of environmental fac tors to hea lth stat us .

There is widespread rec ognit ion within the Depa rtment and throughout the hea lth com mu nit y that N C H S is the pr inc ipa l health sta ti sti c a l agency in the Departm ent of Health, Education, and Welfare. Th e Of fice of Man ag em ent and Budget (O M B ) has designed N C H S as one of the fi ve general purpose sta tis tic a l age ncies in the Federal S ta ti st ic a l System\u2014the one charged with carrying out major in te llig en ce programs in the health fi eld .

Th e concept of Federal General Purpose S ta ti st ic a l Agencies is central to the government's de sir e\u2014almost ne ce ss ity \u2014that there ex is t In each broad so cia l and \u00bb economic area an imp artial fa ct -fin di ng org anization that embraces high standards, top pr ofessio na l and tec hn ica l ca pab ility, and acceptance by both thos e w ho mu st supply information and those w ho use s ta tis tic s for . 56 28 planning and managem ent. A few agencies, notably the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the National Center for Health Statistics meet these specifications, and have established themselves as Invaluable sources of unprejudiced quantitative background and baseline data. These general purpose statistical agencies aro a precious asset. Because they are impartial and protect the confidences of respondents, they are able to secure truthbul reporting from persons g and establishments, and thus to provide evidence that Is pertinent and closer to the truth than is otherwise obtainable. It is essential for NCHS to continue to meet these broad needs for health data, such as in local areas and in Federal program management; medical audit and utilization reviews; planning and policy making; epidemiological Investigations; production of Official U.S. Life Tables; actuarial projections by the Social Security Administration; lntercensal population estimates and population projections by the Bureau of the Census; anu a multitude of uses by private Industries dealing not only in health services and resources, but also In many other kinds of consumer services and products. NCIIS produces data for or related to all of these purposes.

MO NITORING AND SCREEN ING - What system is available to identify and catalog existing and em erging technologies ? - How could existing and emerging technologies be screened to d etermine which might wa rra nt high priority scr uti ny? - How can the Depa rtment identify and monitor the health needs in or de r to judge which problem s wa rrant high pr iorit y scrut iny ? A. Des crip tion of Monitoring and Screening Component The Monitoring and Screening component iden tifie s those technologies which should be regard ed as serio us candidates for detailed study. This component con sists of three eleme nts. The fi rs t is a data base of info rmation about existing and em erging tech nologies, which sets the firs t rough boun daries on the range of technologies to be con sidered. The second element is an inventory of the causes of health im pa ir\u00ad ments and disa bil ities. This inve ntory would not only rank the causes of death for v ario us age grou ps, but also ar ray the cau ses of v ario us levels of imp airm ent such as inability to work or confinement to bed. Information from the monitoring of health impairm ent s would thus help in selecting those technologies which deser ve serio us con sideration for intensive shady. Information from the impairments inve ntory could also help provide guidance for new technology development efforts. The third elem ent in the Monitoring and Screening component is a s at of cr iter ia for \"co ars e screenin g\" to identify candidates for deta iled study. The screenin g cr it er ia might be based on such fac tors as magnitude of the health problem to - / / - 79 which the technology addre sse s itself , the pote ntia l dollar and soc ial costs of the technology, prominence of problems conc erning the util iza tion of an existing technology, or the urgency of safety con cer ns. After candidate technologies have been identified through the app lica \u00ad tion of \"coarse screen ing \" cr iter ia , they would move on to the phase of Agend a-setting (See Section HI) where they would be subjected to \"One scr eenin g\" cr it er ia to produce the Annual Analytic Agenda of technologies which would actually be studied in d etail. B. Agency Activities and Def icien cies 1. Monitoring and Screening of Technologies.- Analysis of the agencies' repo rts reve als that there is curre ntl y no sys tem to identify existing and developing technologies or to provide the \"coarse screen \" to selec t candidate technologies to be studied. Not only is there no catalog of such technologies, eit her in or outside of the Departm ent, but expert estim ate s of the total number involved range widely from 8; 000 to 150, 00 0 ma jor and mino r pro ced ure s and products . While none of the agencies has a sys tem ati c monitoring and scre ening mec hanism, four of them repo rt activities which could contribute to the development of the needed system . NCH5 re po rts that its 20 data sys tem s include con siderable macro data on utiliz atio n and diffusion of selected existing medical tech \u00ad nologies and that it would be feasible to add to its ongoing survey s som questio nna ire items about additional technologies. Fo r example, NC HS can curre ntl y provide macro data which show inc reases or de creases over time of different types of sur gic al pro ced ure s such - / r - as ca rd ia c ca th et er iz at io n and hip ar th ro pla st y. Si m ilar ly , the annual ho sp ita l su rv ey supp orted by NCHS includ es ite ms vhich enable the ce nt er to tr ac k the dif fus ion ra te of such hosp ital -b as ed tec hn olog ies as heart su rg ery u ni ts, radi oiso to pe fa ci lities and he mod ialysis (Appendix Tab 9, pages 3-6).

NC HS H. re port s tha t its in tr am ura l staf f have developed a con cept de sig n fo r an \"id ea l sy st em \" to ide ntify, sc re en , tr ack, and fo re ca st develop ing tec hn olog ies , and that this con cept de sig n fo r a c om pu te r\u00ad ize d sy stem has now been embodie d in an RF P in ord er to have an ou t\u00ad sid e co nt ra ct or exa mine both it s fe as ib ility and its co st -e ff ec tiven es s.

Since 81 it will ta ke so m e tim e to d em o n str ate the fe asi b il it y of su ch a sy ste m , the ag en cy has al so de ve lo pe d an in te ri m in fo rm al appro ac h fo r id en tify in g and se tt in g p rio rit ie s fo r the st udy of de ve lo pi ng te chnol\u00ad ogie s.

F o r - / 7 - 82 exam ple, one would want to -m ow how many people with h ea rt dis ease are symptom atic but working, how many are unable to work but ambulatory, and how many are so incapacitated that they are confined to bed. Determining the tru e \"co st\" of a diso rder, and thus value of a technology to alleviate it, depends to some exten t on '.m ow \u00ad ing these impairm ent lev els , and not simply the bru te cau ses of death or ill ne ss. The mor bidity and m ortality data cu rre ntly being collected NCH S, NIH , CDC, and HCFA can ser ve as the basis for a more sy ste\u00ad matic inventory and a rray of the causes of i mpairment lev els . Such a mechanism for system atical ly collectin g, analyzing, arr ayi ng, and displaying the causes of health impairments needs to be developed sinc e it, together with the system for monitoring the technologies the mselves, constitutes the fron t end of a sys tem ati c Departme ntal approach to technology m anag ement. Without such a s yst em , it is quite poss ible that the most criti ca l technologies will be overlooked, or that the limited funds available will be inve sted in the study of lo w er 'prior ity techno logies. C. Recommended Approaches It is recom Dep artm ent determ ine the fea sibility and cos t-effectiven ess of developing within one or more of the agencies, a sys tem to: (a) identify and m onitor technologies; (b) inve ntory and m onito r the causes of health imp airme nts ; and (c) scree n the existing and developing technologies to selec t candidates for intensive study. The sys tem should be capable of serving both the knowledge development and the action agencies of the Depa rtment. Since it may not be possible to design and launch such a system in less than two y ears, an ad hoc interim approach will need to be conc eptualized and employed. HI.

On the other hand, a sim ilar assessme nt conducted on a nuclear powered heart is like ly to rev eal that it ra ise s profound questions abou t the environmental radiation impacts, the psy cho -so cial side - effe cts, the ethics of allocation, the dollar costs , the technical feasibility, and po litical-legal problems for which a full scale follow-up assessme nt is warranted. \" The proposal for a pilot program has obvious advantages: it would provide the Department with a needed capability which is now absent, and it fits into the mission of NCH SR. Ther e are also negative aspects: significant dollar costs are involved, and there may be overlaps in function between this proposal an d NIH's OMAR proposal (see Section V). There was insufficient time to evaluate this proposal or develop alternative options for institutionalizing comprehensive technology assessment. We recommend that this be don e in Phase II. If Phase II takes an extended period of time, however, we then recommend that a decision paper be prepared on the NC HSR an d N T H prop osals. -Jo 95 V.

DECIS IONM AK ING \u2014 How are technology evaluation results converted into reim bur sem ent, market aggregation, certificate of need and other kinds of technology impeding or stimulating actions ? -- Who should have the responsibility for taking the study findings an d expert opinion collected during the review and synthe sis process , and choosing among action altern atives'' A. Desc ription of Decisionmaking Component Decisionmaking is the bridge between the development of technical information about a technology and the action steps which might be taken to impede or prom ote use of a technology. The preceding review and synth esis component p res ents a technology for decision; this component ass ure s that decisions are made and that they are coordinated. Once the Sec retary (or his designate) has reache d a decision about a technology on the Dep artm ent's high prior ity list , he would s elect which intervention mechanism(s) to employ, and would charge the rele van t action agencies to alter regulations, draft standards, reallocate R 4 D funds, design a targeted pra ctit ioner education initiative, etc. Implementation wo uld be coordinated by the Departm ental-level management unit, and would be related to budget and legislative decisions and integrated, if feasible, with actions of other Federal agencies and private sec tor parties it inter est. For technologies not on the Departm ent's high priority lis t, the Departm ent-level unit will monitor the agency-based decisionmaking pro ces ses on an ad hoc basis to p ro\u00ad mote coordinated and consistent decisionmaking.

Description of Component There are five specific reg ula tor y con trols employed by the Department: (1 ) Mark et Approva or disappro ves the introduc tion of drugs and medical devices into the marketplace base d upon a determ ination of the efficacy and safety of the technology. FDA also may issue conditional approvals which re st ri ct where and how the technol\u00ad ogy can be used, and may rec all technologies on the bas is of subsequent adve rse information. (2) Certificate of Need/'Section 1 1 22 Cerxificate of Need (CoN) and Section 1122 req uir e the review and approval of s peci\u00ad fied capital expen ditures and prop osed changes in h ealth service s. States implemen these mechanisms with input from local health planning agencies and in accordance with minimum regulations esta blished at the Federal level by 3HPRD. CoN reg u\u00ad lat ory authority and p rac tices vary across the States. Only one State has neither. (3) Health Planning Guidelines The forthcoming National Guidelines for Health Planning will have to be considered by local he alth planning agencies in developing their plan s, and in conducting appro \u00ad pri ate ness reviews and the review of proposed se rv ices . Although not stric tly a reg ula tory mechanism, the guidelines will affect decisionmaking at all levels 108 throu gh th ei r ex pr es sion of nation al policy on the ap pr op ria te supply, orga niza tio n and distrib ut io n of health re so urc es.

Agency Ac tiv ities and De fic ien cies Ov erall ro le s and re sp on sibi lit ie s of the va rio us agenc ies were di sc us se d abov e. Specific ally, the prob lems re po rte d by the acti on age ncies ar e of two types: those inherent in the re gu latory mechanism s them selves and tho se re su lti ng from ana lytic de fic ienc ies, notably the diffic ulty in establish ing stan da rd s. Many of the re gu latory mec ha nism s, although avail able, are cu rr en tly in a devel opme nta l state ei th er because th ei r legi slativ e manda te is re la tivel y new (Medical Device Am end ments; P .L . 9-3-541), or because establish ed po lic ies and pr oc ed ur es are not adequate to ad dr es s the com plex issu es posed by mod ern me dic al tec hnolo gie s. As shown below, the se constitute a m aj or set of de fic ienc ies. 109 The 3u rea u of Medical Devices has not ye t completed form ulation of p re-m arke t and po st-ma rke t ass ess me nt pro ced ure s and pe rformanc e standards which are compara ble to those of the 3ura.au of Drugs. Though the stat e- of -the -a rt of developing standards for technologies was identified as a lim iting fac tor, the 3urea u of Medical Devices also rep orted that FDA proced ures and the furth er hampere d the pro cess. Health Systems Agencies (HSAs' and State Health Planning and Development Agencies (SHPDAs) are new State and local planning agencies in many ca ses, and the res ou rce ma terials and technical ass istanc e str uc ture which will support the ir reg ula tor y functions are not all in place . App ropriateness Review is not yet a requir ed HSA and SHPDA function,and issues surrounding its regulatory aspects are unclear. The draft National Guidelines for Health Planning are too recently issued to have had an effect on the health car e sys tem . PSROs are established in only a li ttle more than half the designated are as and sample cr it er ia s ets have been Issued only for pre -ad mi ssion and co ntin ued -stay-ra view for hospitalization. Fro m the agency repo rts , it is obvious that the newness of these reg ula tory mechanisms or their pre sen t state of development constitute a m ajor set of defic iencies. Other pro gramm atic prob lems identified by the Study Team include an ov erall lack of coordination and the exclusion of some medical care provid ers from regulation. Fu rth er coordination is needed between the various regulatory mec hanisms in orde r to assu re con sistency. D H EV Z was ridiculed when CT head scanning was approved under Medicare while 3HPRD was stating it did not have sufficient information to issue guidelines about CT service s even though technicians understood the Medicare decision was based on efficacy and safe ty data while the guidelines are base d on cost-benefit and cost -effectivene ss findings. The Study Team also consi ders that the regulatory mechanisms of CoN and Section 112 2 approval are weakened by the exclusion of physicians' offices ar.d other ambulatory care providers from the req uir em ents. 28-790 0 - 78 - 8 110 Without the author ity to contro l the acquisition of technologies outside health car e facilities, local and State planning agencies cannot, in our opinion, effe ctively plan and regulate the health car e deli very system for which they are res ponsible . The action agencies identified the lack of technical consensus about emerging and existing technologies as a m ajor analytic problem to their regulation . Although BHPRD has developed monographs address ing 1 8 health service s and has a co n\u00ad tra ctor working on a serie s of c ase studies describing specific technologies, neither of of these efforts resulted in specific standards that planning agencies could use for decisionmaking under CoN and Section 1122 beca use of lack of cons ens us. HCFA also rep ort ed the lack of technical consensus as a m ajor problem in the development of model set s of standards for PSRO's to use in r eim bursement decisio ns and quality ass ura nce. The recently issu ed National Guidelines established quantitative sta n\u00ad dards which (whe n issued in final form) must be c onsidered by health planning agencies. These may c ontribute to a movement towards consensus about m edic al technologies and a ssist in the development of standards'on which to ba se CoN and Section 11 22 approval. The sca rcity of data about existing technologies was identified by the agencies as a factor contributing to the difficulty of reaching consensus. Information was reporte d to be urge ntly needed for State and loc al health planning decisions and fo r PSROs. The inadequacy of the existing knowledge base and the lack of dissemination of re \u00ad sea rch findings also were cited by 3HPRD, HCFA, and OQ S as maj or impediments to the development of st and ards. HCFA identified a need for more comprehensive review of .ne w technologies in or de r to as si st in the development of Medicare reimb urs ement p olic ies. In addition, HCFA report ed that additional rese arch on the appropr iate conditions for use of pa rticu lar technologies is needed to assist PSROs and reim bur sem ent mechanisms in the development of sta nd ard s-f or- use and thus the esta blishme nt of payment policies. -X f- Las tl y, it sh ou ld be noted th at , while the Stu dy T ea m ag re es wi th the ac tion ag en ci es abou t the ne ed fo r a m o re str u ctu re d ap pr oa ch to ob ta in in g te ch nic al in fo rm at io n abo u m edic al te ch nolo gie s, we a re in no posi ti on to co m m en t on the ex te nt to wh ich the cu rre n t la ck of th is in fo rm at io n af fe ct s th e ir perf o rm an ce, si nce ev al uat io n of th e ir p erf orm ance and pro duct iv ity is beyo nd the sc op e of th is P has e I in quir y.

These pro jec ts focus on obtaining fur the r information about validity, efficiency, cost-eff ectiveness , and us er acceptance, but also aid in the diffusion of worth while innovations. To fac ilitate adoption of some of its pro jec ts and elimin ation of b arr ie rs to the tra ns fer of viable innovations, NC HSR has produced us er guidelines and supported \"user group organizatio ns.\" \u00bb An Office of Health Information and Health Prom otion was esta blis hed rec ently in OA SH to provide the Department .vi tii a focus for consum er education activities. This office, which plans to concentrate its efforts in area s where there is an absence of c urrent activities, will assist the agencies in c arryin g out any aspects of their missions which Involve or could involve consum er education, and will develop programs for the \"education of the public in the maintenance of persona l and fam ily health and in the app ropr iate use of the health care sy st em .\" This program is likely to encounter many of the p roblems commonly associated with the inadequacy of hard technical information about the effectiveness of many technologies. Also, the method\u00ad ologies used in affecting consumer behavior are imperfectly developed. These same informational and methodological problem s apply to professional edu\u00ad cation activitie s. In thi s case, the prob lems are compounded because the re is no departm ental focus for activit ies relating to the continuing education of ph ysicians and other health pro fes sio nals. Prac ticing physicia ns curre ntl y do not have an ade\u00ad quate source of information about the technologies that they are using or could use, and medical lit er atur e often is not directed towards die needs of p rac tition ers or written in term s fam iliar to them. In fact, the quality of that lit er atur e has been called repe atedly into question. Recently, there has been inc rea sed recognitio n of these inadequacies, and various DK ZlV agencies have been encouraged to remedy 'hem. Several acti vities discussed -<F- 114 la this repo rt (e .g ., the Medical Practice Information Dem onstratio n Pro ] set and she Dep artm ent-leve l Re-daw and Synthesis component des cribed in Section IV ) could aid in resolving these information and education problems. N TH , however, reporte d that any fu rth er involvement in prof ess ion al education might be inap propria te or infeasible. Since NIH c urr ently is the most active agency in this are a, it app ears unlikely that sub stantial improvem ents in pro fessional education will take place without a new locus for such-activity.e lsew here in the Dep artm ent. The re was no explicit requ est in the Agency Report Form for info rmation on patent and licensing policies or activitie s. Agency rep orts, the ref ore , provided no basis for disc ussi on of these mechanisms. The Study Team is aware, however, that the Department has not articulated a policy which reco gnises the dua; use that patent and licensing policy can perform in encouraging or discouraging innovations resu lting from D AND/OR DISINCENTIVE ME S A. Description of Component The allocation of Ri sD res ou rce s is an effective means for dir ectly affecting technol\u00ad ogy development. Pr e-marke t mechanisms can be used to s tim ulate, retard or red ire ct technology development. Decisions on the type and amount of R& D res ou rce s to be applied in any given area would be based, for example, on c ri te ri a such as the ove rall mission of the Department, the n ature of the problem, the importance of the problem , targets of opportunity, and the availability of funds. B. Ag enc y A ct iv itie s and D ef ic ie nc ie s Agencies reporte d no conscious or formal use of R& D res ou rce s allocation polic ies 115 as p re -m a rk e t in ce nt iv e or dis in ce ntive m ech an is m s.

Market aggregation refers to Government action to g uarantee an exclusiv e mar ket for a given technology which it de sires, but which priva te corpo ration s consider not cost-ef fective (i. e. , manufacturing and sales costs cannot be sufficiently recove red and/o r free mar ket profit margins are too sma ll or unc erta in). This mechanism, therefore, ass ure s a minimum sales volume .and/or exclusive access to s pecific interested buyers (e .g ., VA , PHS, DO D, G5A ) for a given length of time 3. Agency Activities and D eficiencies Agencies ess entially rep orted no activities to develop and apply marke t incentive mec hanisms. The .Study Team concluded, theref ore , that eit he r lit tle was being done with this cla ss of Intervention mechanisms, or that the utility of such ac ti\u00ad vities have not been recognized by agency manag ers. The situation app ears to be comparable to the agencies' lack of a stra teg y for .allocation and reallocatio n of RtiD res ou rce s as an intervention mechanism. While the agency rep orts demonstrate d considerab le concern with the problem of restr ict ing technology use , they d emo nstrate d no comparable concern with identi\u00ad fying and stimu lating beneficial but lagging technologies which are not being d eve l\u00ad oped because they fa ll between the cra cks of the health care marke t. Fo r example, prev entative, reha bilitation, mental health and environment.il technologies could reduce co sts , but many are lagging in development because the norm ally ove r- generous medical reim bur sem ent sys tem does not cover their use. This gap in agency planning should be add ressed at the Department level. It calls first for sys tem atic ally identifying lagging or absent beneficial technologies and tnen, on the basis of the identification, for developing a more balanced strategy for managing technology development. 117 It is worth noting tha t the Exp er im en til Technology Incen tives Pr og ra m of the De partm ent of Co mm erc e has the ex plicit mission of help ing Fed er al agencie s conceptua lize and im plem en t ex pe rim en tal appro aches to tec hnolo gic al innovation .

I consider the research functions performed by these. Centers to be extremely significant. Only if their full potential is realized will we have sound factual and conceptual bases for the management of the health care system at every level, from Federal, State, and regional policy level to the individual provider of health care. In order to assist these Centers in meeting this challenge, I have recently moved them into my oflice, where their activities will be co- * ordinated more effectively with the other agencies in the Public Health Service as well as the Health Care Financing Administration. We fully recognize the need to improve coordination of th ese critical activities. We have established a Public Health Service Committee for . Coordination of Health Statistics Systems, chaired by the Director of the National Center for Health Statistics. To address the need for Department-wide coordination, we have established a Health Data Advisory Committee, which will serve as a permanent and formal body to advise the Secretary on major cross\u00ad cutting health data issu es. All of these important activities can be carried out under existing legislative authority. Senator K ennedy , dust before you go on, isn't that the one that cannot agree o n a Chairman, and they have not met ? Dr. R ichmon d . Yes. That is a Committee that did tend to fall into disuse, but we are now taking steps to reorganize and redirect that Committee. Senator K ennedy . That is hopeful, because T am sure you are im\u00ad patient about its functioning and functioning well. Flow does this sort of new, coordinated effort that you refer to work with HCFA? I understand that this is still a problem in terms of working out an effective coordinating process. Dr. R ichmon d . Well, we are integrating our activities with the Health Care Financing Administration, Senator. And T have asked, from the Public Health Service vantage point, Mrs. Ila nft, to direct that effort for us, and perhaps she can elaborate on that for you, if you would like. Mrs. H anft . We have a research committee that consists of the principles in health services research, including the Office of the As\u00ad sistant Secretary of Planning. That committee lias m et once in the last 4 weeks. We viewed the agendas of both the HCFA research programs and the National Center research programs. We have a second meeting next week. We are working on the char\u00ad ter right now of the Health Data Advisory Committee and hope to _ have that set up fairly soo n. We also have regular meetings with the Health Care Financing Ad \u00ad ministration about an every 2-week basis, to discuss mutual problems, overlap, and coordination. T hope in the future tha t we will even be able to undertake som e joint research projects of interest to both organizations. Senator K enne dy . OK. We might come back to that later. Dr. R ichmon d . Yes . T would only reenforce. Senator, what Mrs. Han ft has indicated. This Committee did fall into disuse, and as 1 came into my of fice and became aware of this, we have taken steps, with the support of the Secretary and the Under Secretary, to really reactivate this and to make it more functional. 136 We a re worki ng hard to give both C enters the substan tiv e and m an\u00ad agerial su pp ort which the y need to perform th ei r fun ctions and to assure th at the y can meet the substan tial dem and s th at will be pu t upon them by our efforts to imp rove the healt h care system in this cou ntry . Now, Mr. Chairma n, I w ould like to tu rn to th e issue of health tech\u00ad nology. Yo ur proposal for a National In stitu tes of Hea lth Care Re\u00ad search has, as you know, spu rre d considerable tho ug ht t hrou gh i ts use of t he rene wal of the Cente rs' auth oriza tio ns to addre ss a problem of > which we are all aware, bu t which has not received the att en tio n it deserves. Wh en I testified befo re your su bcom mittee las t Ju ly , you expressed dissat isfact ion with the De pa rtm en t's ability to lin k sys tem atic ally . lab orato ry bench findings to bed side practice. You urg ed us to exam ine the problem and to deve lop a more sys\u00ad tem atic appro ach to tech nolo gy develop men t and use. We concurr ed in your assessment and , in concert with the Office of the As sistan t Secre tar y fo r Pl an ning a nd Ev alu ation , the Se cre tar y created a joint team to co nduct an analysis of the problem. We asked the team to surv ey the technolo gy-b ased act ivities which are now taking place in the agencies, to iden tif y the gaps and defi\u00ad ciencies in those activities, and to out line a str ateg y to cope more effectively with those deficiencies. While many sha re a com mitmen t to come to gr ips with the \"tech\u00ad nology problem ,\" our ana lysis quickly showed th is seeming consensus to belie man y d iffe rent conception s and prio rities . To some, it ha s seemed a problem o f cost conta inm ent , because tec h\u00ad nology is perceived as a ma jor c ulprit in the s piralling costs of hea lth care. To others, it has seemed a problem of red ucing the tim e th at it tak es to get effective new technolo gies in to medical p ractice . To others, i t has seemed a problem of preven tin g prem atu re tran sfer of techn ies which are unp rov en and pe rhaps even harm ful. To others, it has seemed a question of harne ssi ng the techological imperative in order to enhance , ra th er th an endanger, our social and ethical values. All of these concerns illus tra te th at the tech nology problem is a grossly mislead ing form of shorthand. In fac t, there are ma ny tech- , nology problems. Fu rth ermore, im po rta nt pa rti es at int ere st have conflicting and com peting priorities. The ir views mu st be tak en into acco unt if we hope to develop a bette r balance between contr oll ing the costs of , healt h care while not stif ling tech nolo gical inn ovation and imp rov e\u00ad men ts in t he quality of care. Our study, which we are subm itting for the record, Mr. Chairma n, has also made us keenly aware th at while the De pa rtm ent is exten\u00ad sively involved with tech nology as a developer, an eva lua tor, a pu r\u00ad chaser, and a reg ula tor , it has no comprehensive str ateg y to lin k sys\u00ad tem atical ly stages in the life cycle of tech nology develop ment, evalu a\u00ad tion, trans fer, diffusion, uti liz ati on and pha seout. In s ummary, while departm ental agencies , an enlarg ed eva lua tion cap aci ty is c learly needed. 137 The achilles heel, however, is our present incapacity to provide co\u00ad ordination and linkages among the activities. Senator K ennedy . Why is th at so, do you think, Doctor? Dr. R ichmon d . Well, I think, Senator, as our task force studied this and looked at the complexity, which is in the report which we are sub\u00ad mitting, and in this chart which you have before you, when one breaks down the various components of health technology management, one identifies a high order of complexity. And, as I have indicated, various people have various perceptions of which pieces of this ought to be tackled first and, indeed, which issues are of the highest priority. In our Department, we have in the National Institutes of Health, in the Food and Drug Administration, and the Center for Disease Con\u00ad trol, many activities which deal with various pieces of this. And here\u00ad tofore, we have not had a systematic way of dealing with this, and what our task force has recommended is a way of systematizing this approach, Mr. Chairman, so th at we can begin to deal with all of the pieces which are ongoing in the Department and which also are on\u00ad going in the extramural community across the country, in the uni\u00ad versities and industry and in laboratories throughout the country and, indeed, in medical practice. And what we have not had heretofore is a focal point for bringing these together. Senator K ennedy . Doctor, do you com e later in your testimony to what they are doing at the present time ? Dr. R ichmon d . Yes; we will com e to so me of that. Senator K ennedy . Okay. Dr. R ichmon d . Even the most carefully devised technology initia\u00ad tive is unlikely to provide a \"quick fix' ' to the extraordinarily complex set of problems involved. Nevertheless, we have developed and plan to implement shortly a new ' technology strategy which we believ e will enable us to reduce significantly the gap between analysis and action. As you can see from the diagram which I have already referred to, we have developed a technology management strategy that is com\u00ad prised of six linked steps: First, the identification and screening of candidate technologies and health needs for analysis; Second, an annual priority setting for a departmental study agenda; Third, the conduct or sponsorship of studies; Fourth, the translation and synthesis of technical findings; Fifth, explicit decisionmaking to restrain or to stimulate develop\u00ad ment and use of a target technology; and Sixth, the implementation of decisions through a spectrum of such intervention mechanisms as allocation of R.&I). resources, market approval, incentives, utilization guidelines, and professional and consumer education. Since such a strategy will require considerable orchestration among the agencies and extensive collaboration with the private sector, a Department-level locus is needed to provide the managerial leadership and coordination. The Secretary has assigned that responsibility to my of fice , and I have already taken important steps to establish an Of fic e of Health Technology. 138 One of the ma jor tasks of the new Office will be to conduct a pilot dem onstra tion of the technolo gy assessment and m anagem ent strateg y, with four to seven high -prio rit y technologies. These dem onstra tions will focus on technolo gies which typify such curre nt concerns as pre ma tur e or delayed tran sfer from bench to bedside prac tice , un wa rra nted cost in rel ationship to anticipa ted benefits, and the need fo r early wa rning on controversial societal side effects. Senat or K ennedy . O f course, there is no question about the im por\u00ad tance of the manag erial fun ction in thi s area. On the coo rdinating aspect, what I consider to be the most im po rta nt i ngred ien t in makin g this case is your own personal lead ership. Our real problem is from an institut ion al point of view as over a ny period of time, w hat is going to ha pp en ; whether you are able to get the kin d of people to come down to work in thi s area for 2, or 3 years, until it gets on its feet, with the idea o f b eing sp un off, and get the s upport from the a dm inis\u00ad tra tio n, in terms of OMB. We would have th at difficulty, as well, I am sure. But just in term s of the m ana gerial setup , outside o f w hat I conside r to be a strong team in the De pa rtm ent at the prese nt time , th at is not an inco nsiderab le problem. I do not think from a s tru ctural point of view, it is going to make a tremen dous difference. In the area s of responsibility, do you have an advisory committee working with you. Dr. R ichmond . We are plannin g. Senator, to first of all try to get the advice of the In stitu te o f M edicine to the repo rt of our task force, and on the basis of their recommendations, if we are successful in enlistin g their coopera tion, g et their advice abou t the kind o f advisory committee st ructu re t o set in place. Bu t we are looking for the widest kin d of con sultation. Senator K ennedy . So you will have some form or str uc tur e of an adv isory council ? Dr. R ichmond . Yes. I have discussed this pointedly with the Sec\u00ad retary and he is very eag er for us to have some b roa d adv isory gro up, th at would be not alone from within the Public He alth Service or the De partm ent, bu t bro adl y rep res ent ative of the scientific and hea lth com mun ity. Senator K ennedy . Do you th ink OMB will give you t he go-ahea d on th at ? Dr. R ichmon d . Well, as you know, they are very sensitive about adv isory comm ittees, Senator, bu t we think th at this is an instance where it will be extr emely im po rta nt to be in the prop er place. Se nator K ennedy . Y ou also talk about pilot dem ons trat ions. Do you need a pilo t or rea lly som ething bigger? Or is th at more de\u00ad scriptive of th e buildup tha t you see ? Dr. R ichmond . W ell, we think , Senator, it is very im po rta nt to try to focus on some high pr iority techn ologies and to esse ntia lly carry those throug h some pilo t testing. We have a lready begun that. I have developed an Office of He alt h Pra ctices Assessment, which is cur\u00ad ren tly in the process of review ing three health technologies. We are revi ewing the manag ement of manic-depressive psychoses, rheumatic heart, disease, and ma lig nant melanoma. These are three areas th at we t hink lend themselves to com prehen\u00ad sive review, and we think the results of such studies will have im por\u00ad tant implication s to the man agemen t of these diso rders. 139 We are pilotin g those. We think the re are many others. We think if such thing s as the CT scanne r had been pilo ted in this fash ion earlier and more effectively th at we perha ps would have ha d a more ord ered appro ach to the develop men t o f these technologies. Senator K ennedy . If you had to draw a flow c ha rt for the next 3 to 5 years, where would you be in yo ur pr op os al ; say, in 5 years, wha t sort of thi ng s would you be d oing\u2014or would you hav e spun t his off by then ? Dr. R ichmon d . Well. I think , Senator , my thou gh t is th at in the ins tituti onali zatio n of this prog ram which you have ref erred to and you see developing a center, I think we would think th at such a de\u00ad velopment would be extrem ely im po rta nt to policy develop ment in the De par tment . Policy develop men t at the highes t level takes place in the Office of the Ass istant Secre tary, and my view is tha t since such an office would have to dra w on the technolo gies which are being developed in various agencies of the De partm ent, th at it would be im po rta nt\u2014fo r a time, at any rate, un til we gain more experienc e\u2014 for us to keep thi s at the level of the Office of the Assistan t Sec retary , to see how effectively th is feeds into policy de velopment. Senator K ennedy . O f course, th at has all the lim iting factors, does it not, from an ins titution al point o f view? There is so much th at you can do as the Assistan t Sec retary . Bu t it seems to me by definitio n it would be a more limited fun ctio n, quite fra nkly. I mean , OMB is not going to let your whole operation ju st expand and develop, I would not think , given the pas t record, the num bers in people and pers onnel and all the rest. I think th at it crea tes some rea lly im po rta nt ational in stitu \u00ad tion al prob lems about how fa r you can go over wh at period of time. And I think pro bab ly there are men and women with differing views about that. Dr. R ichmond . W ell. I think you are rai sin g a very im po rta nt ques\u00ad tion. Since T have come into my office, Mr. Chairma n, wh at I have perceived is the need for s tre ng the ning our policy d evelopm ent cap ac\u00ad ity. And. as Mrs. ITanft has come into th at off ice and tak en on th at responsibility, T think we have increased our cap acity. But T think along with the two exi sting centers, if we had this th ird cen ter ulti\u00ad mately. which would enhance our policy-g enera ting cap acity, I think it would be an extr emely valuable addition at that level. What I am suggesting . Senat or, is th at the re may be anoth er way to instituti onali ze this fun ctio n, ra th er than the creatio n of anoth er agency. I am not sug gesting th at perha ps several yea rs from now. I mig ht not come to th at conclusion, but I think T would pr ef er to see us gain some experienc e in str en gth en ing our policy developmental cap acity at the pres ent time, and I think we a re on the roa d to doi ng that. You have raised. Mr. Ch air ma n, the question of rec ruitment. I think we would want to rec ruit ahead fo r this Office of He alth Tech\u00ad nology. We would hope to rec ruit g scie ntis t, with cre \u00ad dentials in both the research and the health care com mun ity. We think that it is possible to rec ruit at th at level if th is Office is located at the lev el.of the As sistan t Se cre tar y's Office. To support thi s dem onstration phase, we p lan to red irect $5 million of Public He alt h Service fun ds in fiscal 1978 to s upport the necessary 140 studies and evaluate innovativ e approache s to the com munica tion of find ings to such diverse users as practic ing p hysicians, consumers, a nd policymaker s. To exp edite establishment of the Office, sta ff fo r the firs t 6 m onths will be com prised of 22 detailees, dra wn from different disc iplines includ ing health professionals, biomedical scie ntis ts and engineers, statistician s, policy . Other fun ctio ns we would see in thi s new Office for Hea lth Tech\u00ad nology would inclu de servin g as a catalyst and De partm ental focal point fo r policy fo rm ulat ion; developm ent of a process th roug h which the De portm ent can collaborate on technolo gy dec isio nmaking with oth er Fe de ral agencies and the pri vate sector; pro vision of tech nical assistance tran sfer activities thr ou gh ou t the De partm ent in order to identify gaps and deficiencies; the assessment of the fea sib ilit y and cost-effectiveness of developing a long-rang e system to identify and screen techn olog ies and health needs; provision of reco mmendations to the He alth Care Fina ncing Ad mi nis tra tio n on the advis ability of reim bursem ent for dru gs, devices, and procedures un de r the medicare and med icaid pr og ram s; and finally, the Office of He alth Technology will be cha rged with dev eloping recommendations rega rd ing possible insti tut ion al changes th at might contribu te to ach ieving our tech\u00ad nolog y m ana gem ent objectives. In clos ing my rem arks, Mr. Chairma n, I would like to cer tainly commend you and the members of your subcomm ittee fo r the innova nolo embo died in your bill S. 2466. Once aga in, you have forced policym akers both inside and outside of gov ernment to focus their efforts on developing an effective tec h\u00ad nolog y manag ement s trateg y. 1 recognize th at the pla n of action I have j us t outlin ed may a ppear conserv ative by comparison. In stitu tio na l change along the lines e m\u00ad bodied in your bill may indeed be wa rra nted as we gain more experi\u00ad ence an d persp ective on the technology problem. We are un prepare d, however, to endorse your prop osa l at th is time, because we believe th at it would be pre ma tur e for the De partm ent to u nderg o such a m ajo r structural change wi tho ut a more fun dam ental un de rst an ding of the com plex ities involved. Be assured, however, th at we do pla n to move quickly. We believe th at the efforts of this pil ot Office of He alth T echnolo gy will provide esse ntial inf orma n th at will enable us to retu rn in 2 yea rs with recommen dations m ajo r stru ctural ref orm . A pa rt from wh at we believe is the prem atur ity of reo rga niz ation at this time, we are tro ubled by some of the specifics rel ate d to the National Cente r for Hea lth Stati stics and the Na tional Cente r for He alth Services Research . The proposed institut es would have within th ei r purview activities which are integ ral to oth er Publi c He alth Serv ice operations. As men tioned earlie r, the National Center for He alth Stati stics is now un de rta king some epidemiolog ic analyses designe d to comple\u00ad ment the ong oing activities of the National In sti tutes of He alt h, the Cente r fo r Disease Control, the FD A, and AD AM AH . 141 The epidemiolog ical activities of the National In stitu tes of He alth and the Cente r for Disease Control are closely int ert wi ned with the oth er activities of those units and coo rdination or con trol of them from outside would int erf ere with the place of these activitie s in the overall mission o f N IH and CDC. Fu rthe r, the prop osed change in orien tat ion from healt h servic es research to healt h policy researc h obscures real differences between these disciplin es. They are not the same. Bo th are nece ssary, and both need sup port. It is ou r goal to p rovide research th at is re sponsive no t only to sho rt\u00ad term policy consideration s, bu t to ind ependent and lon g-rang e re\u00ad search needs as well. In addit ion , we have recently begun a majo r stu dy of th e National Cente r for Hea lth Services Research's research age nda and structur e. A list of experts servin g as consu ltants in this review is being sub\u00ad mi tted fo r the record. The In stitut e of Medicine, as you pro bab ly know, is also con ducting a bro ad-based stu dy of healt h services re\u00ad search th at will not be complete d for several m onths. Because we intend to move as rapi dl y as possible in these efforts, in improving the existing centers, and in dev eloping pla ns for a larg e- scale tech nology man agement program , we would su pp or t a redu ctio n in the extension o f these program s to 2 yea rs. By 1980, we believe we wou ld have the inf orma tio n necessary to eva luate ade qua tely options fo r reo rie nta tio n and w ould look forw ard to wo rki ng with the subcomm ittee to develop a sound proposal. In closing, Mr. Ch airma n, I would like to say th at th e De pa rtm ent shares yo ur com mitmen t to deve lop a technology manag ement cap abi lity . We concur in you r assessment th at the D epart ment c urrently direc ts ina t viable tech nology gy mu st also add ress the manag ement need to be tte r link know ledge development and int erv ention stra tegies. Thus, while we are pre sen tly un prepared to endorse m ajor in stitu \u00ad tional reo tion of S. 2466 in stimu \u00ad latin g a bro ad discussion of a lterna tiv es, and we hope th at differences in the tim ing of our strate gie s will not prec lude the me aning ful col\u00ad uired for creativ e solu tions to the whole ran ge o f prob \u00ad lems imposed b y tec hnology in the health care system. Th is concludes my prepared testim ony at this time, Mr. Chairma n. My colleagues and I would be ha pp y to respon d to questions.

AND WELFARE O F F IC E OF T H E S E C R E TA R Y W A S H IN G T O N . D C 20201 STATEMENT BY JULIUS B. RICHMOND, M.D. ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR HEALTH BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RESOURCES UNITED STATES SENATE TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1978 143 MR. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE: I am pleased to appear before you today to discuss the renewal of authorizations for the National Centers for Health Statistics (NCHS) and Health Services Research (NCHSR), issues of technology assessment and use, and the proposal for certain changes in the structure of these programs, embodied in your bill, S. 2466. ' Research and statistics expenditures are an investment in the future--in our ability to make sound decisions that can improve our health care delivery system. Your support and that of your Subcommittee over the years for our health services research and statistics activities is greatly appreciated. Your continuing concern with both the promise and problems of technology has been a catalyst for important new actions in the Department, which I will outline in my remarks. The work of the Centers makes invaluable, although not always visible, contributions to policy deliberations, health legislation, Federal health programs, and the decisions of health care providers. The comprehensive program of the National Center for Health Statistics 144 - 2 - includes more than 20 data systems, which produce information on health status of the population, health resources, utilization of health services, nutrition, family growth, and the Nation's patterns of births, deaths, marriages, and divorces. A few examples will illustrate their importance. Among the specific contributions of such information is an awareness of the health care trends that form the factual backdrop for many important decisions in the health field, in cost containment, quality, distribution of services, and control of toxic substances. For example, the Hospital Discharge Survey has shown the incidence of hysterectomies rising substantially (from 734 per 100,000 females 15 years and older in 1971, to 850 in 1974). More recently, there appears to be a downturn, perhaps due to heightened visibility of the phenomenon. The Health and Nutrition Examination Survey measures the prevalence of hypertension among adults and indicates that the prevalence rate among blacks is nearly twice as high as that among whites. New epidemiologic techniques in mapping infant mortality and other mortality rates to determine geographic differentials can identify variations due to lack of access to care or exposure to environmental hazards. 145 - 3 - The National Center for Health Services Research plays a parallel role in services research. NCHSR-supported research and demonstration activities produced the factual justification for new legislation which provides for reimbursement of physician assistants and nurse practi\u00ad tioners practicing in rural clinics. Other NCHSR research has produced the health scarcity index for identifying shortage areas. The Experimental Medical Care Review Organization project initiated in 1970 provided the working model for Professional Standards Review Organizations The Center has become increasingly sensitive to the demand for policy-relevant research and is preparing to fund research on cost containment specifically tailored to the needs of local health systems agencies. It has initiated a series of National Medical Care Expenditure studies as a major component of its intramural program. Data for this study is being developed in collaboration with the National Center for Health Statistics. The product of this effort will provide valuable information for evaluating alternative financing mechanisms for health care in the United States. More detailed information about the activities of the Centers is being submitted for the record. 146 - 4 - I consider the research functions performed by these Centers to be extremely significant. Only if their full potential is realized will we have sound factual and conceptual bases for management of the health care system, at every level--from Federal, State, and regional policy level to the individual provider of health care. In order to assist these Centers in meeting this challenge, I have recently moved them into my office, where their activities will be coordinated more effectively with the other agencies in the Public Health Service as well as the Health Care Financing Administration. We fully recognize the need to improve coordination of these critical activities. We have established a PHS Committee for Coordination of Health Statistics Systems, chaired by the Director of the NCHS. To address the need for Department-wide coordination, we have established a Health Data Advisory Committee, which will serve as a permanent and formal body to advise the Secretary on major cross-cutting health data issues. All of these important activities can be carried out under existing legislative authority. 147 - 5 - We are working hard to give both Centers the substantive and managerial support which they need to perform their functions, and to assure that they can meet the substantial \u00bb demands that will be put upon them by our efforts to improve the health system in this country. , for the National Center for Health Statistics, we intend to complete the first three components of the Cooperative Health Statistics System for all States during the next several years. We plan to reinstitute follow-back surveys to add to our knowledge of epidemiologic and health status data. We have plans to expand the analytic capability of NCHS to mine the wealth of available data. For the National Center for Health Services Research, we plan an expansion of their technology program during fiscal year 1979. We are reviewing the allocation of research efforts between intramural and extramural activities. 'We plan to develop a capability to evaluate the impact of health services programs. Our organizational arrangements are being directed toward more effective coordination of research and statistical activities. * Now, Mr. Chairman, I would like to turn to the issue of health technology. Your proposal for a National Institutes of Health Care Research has, as you know, spurred considerable thought through its use of the renewal of the Centers' authorizations to address a problem of which we are all aware, but which has not received the attention its deserves. 148 - 6 - When I testified before your Subcommittee last July, you expressed dissatisfaction with the Department's ability to systematically link bench findings to bedside practice. You urged us to examine the problem and develop a more systematic approach to technology development and use. I concurred in your assessment and, in concert with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, created a joint team to conduct an analysis of the problem. We asked the team to survey the technology-based activities which are now taking place in the agencies, to identify the gaps and deficiencies in those activities, and to outline a strategy to cope more effectively with those deficiencies. While many share a commitment to come to grips with \"the technology problem,\" our analysis quickly showed this seeming consensus to belie many different conceptions and priorities: o To some, it's a problem of cost containment, because technology is perceived as a major culprit in the spiraling costs of health care. o To others, it's a problem of reducing the time that it takes to get effective new technologies into medical practice. o To others, it's a problem of preventing premature transfer of technologies which are unproven and perhaps even harmful. o To others, it's a question of harnessing the technological imperative in order to enhance, rather than endanger, our social and ethical values. 149 - 7 - o Still others are particularly concerned about our under-investment in efficacy and safety studies, cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses, or comprehensive technology assessments. o Additional divergent objectives include the \u00ab need to address: Obsolescent technologies; - Inappropriate utilization of technology; Maldistribution of technology; Inadequate market incentives for promotion of preventive, system management, and mental health technologies; and The need for public input into technology decisions. o Finally, there are those who fear: - Federal intrusion into medical practice; - Federal interference in the health market; and Suppression of technology development. All of these concerns illustrate that \"the technology problem\" is a grossly misleading form of shorthand. In * fact, there are many technology problems. Furthermore, important parties-at-interest have conflicting and competing priorities. Their views must be taken into account if we hope to develop a better balance between controlling the costs of health care while not stifling technological innovation and improvements in the quality of care. 150 - 8 - Our study (wh ich 1 am submitting for the record) has also made us keenly aware that while the Department is extensively involved with technology as a developer, an evaluator, a purchaser, and a regulator, it has no comprehensive strategy to systematically link stages in the life cycle of technology development, evaluation, transfer, diffusion, utilization and phase-out. Consequently, o The \"knowledge development\" agencies (such as NIH, NCHSR and NCHS) each decide independently which technologies they will examine, how they will examine them, and what use will be made of the results; o The \"action agencies\" (such as HSA, Medicare, Medicaid, and the PSRO program) lack adequate technical information to carry out their responsibilities and effective links to the knowledge development agencies which would promote development of action-supporting information on technologies of interest; o Results of technical evaluations appear in the research literature, but often do not come to the attention of practicing physicians, consumers, or those officials responsible for making reimbursement, regulation, or standard development decisions; 151 - 9 - o Considerable effort is focused on efficacy and safety evaluations, but little is directed to evaluation of cost-benefit and cost-effective\u00ad ness implications, and virtually nothing is being done to assess unintended societal side effects; o Inadequate emphasis is placed on methodological studies to improve the reliability and validity of technology-based analysis and testing; and finally, o Ad hocracy reigns in the absence of explicit linkages between technology studies and public , or private actions to impede or stimulate technology transfer and utilization. In summary, while DHEW agencies currently engage in many technology-based activities, an enlarged evaluation capacity is clearly needed. The Achilles heel, however, is our present incapacity to provide coordination and linkages among the activities. Even the most carefully devised technology initiative is unlikely to provide a \"quick fix\" to the extraordinarily complex set of problems involved. Nevertheless, we have developed and plan to implement shortly a new technology strategy which we believe will enable us to significantly reduce the gap between analysis and action. 152 - io - As you can see from the diagram attached to my testimony, we have developed a technology management strategy that is comprised of six linked steps: 1. Identification and screening of candidate technologies and health needs for analysis. 2. Annual priority setting for a Departmental study agenda. 3. Conduct or sponsorship of studies. 4 . \"Translation\" and synthesis of technical findings. 5. Explicit decisionmaking to restrain or stimulate development and use of a target technology. 6. Implementation of decisions through a spectrum of such intervention mechanisms as allocation of R&D resources, market approval, incentives, utilization guidelines, and professional and consumer education. Since such a strategy will require considerable orchestration among the agencies and extensive collaboration with the private sector, a Department-level locus is needed to provide the managerial leadership and coordination. The Secretary has assigned that responsibility to my office, and I have already taken important steps to establish an Office of Health Technology. One of the major tasks of 153 - n - new office will be to conduct a pilot demonstration of the technology assessment and management strategy with four to seven high-priority technologies. These demon\u00ad strations will focus on'technologies which typify such current concerns as premature or delayed transfer from t bench to bedside practice, unwarranted cost in relation to anticipated benefits, and the need for early warning on controversial societal side-effects. To head the new Office of Health Technology, we will recruit an outstanding scientist with credibility in both the research and health care community. To support this demonstration phase, I plan to redirect $5 million of Public Health Service funds in FY 1973 to support the necessary studies and evaluate innovative approaches to communication of findings to such diverse users as practicing physicians, consumers, and policymakers. To expedite establishment of the Office, staff for the first six months will be comprised of 22 detailees, drawn from different disciplines including health professionals, biomedical scientists and engineers, statisticians, policy scientists, ethicists, economists, behavioral scientists, and communication experts. 154 - 12 - Other functions of the new Technology Office include: o Serving as a catalyst and Departmental focal point for policy formulati'on; o Development of a process through which the Department can collaborate on technology decisionmaking with other Federal agencies and the private sector; o Provision of technical assistance to DHEW agencies; o Evaluation of technology assessment and transfer activities throughout the Department in order to identify gaps and deficiencies; o Assessment of the feasibility and cost effectiveness of developing a long-range system to identify and screen technologies and health needs; o Provision of recommendations to the Health Care Financing Administration on the advisability of reimbursement for drugs, devices, and procedures under the Medicare and Medicaid programs; o Finally, the Office of Health Technology will be charged with developing recommendations regarding possible institutional changes that might contribute to achieving our technology management objectives. 155 - 13 - In closing my remarks Mr. Chairman, I would like to commend you for the innovative approach to technology evaluation embodied in S. 2466. Once again you have forced policymakers both inside and outside government, to focus their efforts on developing an effective technology management strategy. I recognize that the plan of action I have just outlined may appear conservative by comparison. Institutional change along the lines embodied in your bill may indeed be warranted as we gain more experience and perspective on the technology problem. We are unprepared, however, to endorse your proposal at this time because we believe that it would be premature and disruptive for the Department to undergo such a major structural change without a more fundamental understanding of the complexities involved. Be assured, however, that we plan to move quickly. We believe that the efforts of this pilot Office of Health Technology will provide essential information that will enable us to return in two years with recommendations for major structural reform. Apart from what we believe is the prematurity of reorganiza\u00ad tion at this time, we are troubled by some of the specifics relating to NCHS and NCHSR. 156 - 14 - The proposed Institutes would have within their purview activities which are integral to other PHS operations. As mentioned earlier, the NCHS is now undertaking some epidemiologic analyses designed to complement the ongoing activities of the NIH, CDC and FDA. The epidemiological activities of the National Institutes of Health and the Center for Disease Control are closely intertwined with the other activities of those units, and coordination or control of them from outside would interfere with the place of these activities in the overall mission of NIH and CDC. Further, the proposed change in orientation from health services research to health policy research obscures real differences between these disciplines. They are not the same. Both are necessary and both need support. It is our goal to provide research that is responsible not only to short-term policy considerations, but to independent and long-range research needs as well. In addition, we have recently begun a major study of NCHSR's research agenda and structure. A list of experts serving as consultants in this review is being submitted for the record. The Institute of Medicine is also conducting a broad-based study of health services research, that won't be completed for several months. 157 - 15 - Because we intend to move as rapidly as possible in these efforts, in improving the existing Centers, and in developing plans for a large-scale technology management program, we would support a reduction in the extension of these programs to two years. By 1980, we believe we would have the information necessary to adequately evaluate options for reorientation and would look forward to working with the Subcommittee to develop a sound proposal In closing, Mr. Chairman, I would like to say that the Department shares your commitment to develop a technology management capability. We concur in your assessment that the Department currently directs inadequate resources to technology evaluation, but would argue that a viable technology strategy must also address the management need to better link knowledge development and intervention strategies. Thus, while we are presently unprepared to endorse major institutional reordering, we appreciate the contribution of S. 2466 in stimulating a broad discussion of alternatives and hope that differences in the timing of our strategies will not preclude the meaningful collaboration required for creative solutions to the whole range of problems imposed by technology in the health care system. That concludes my prepared testimony at this time, Mr. Chairman. My colleagues and I will be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 28-790 0 - 78 - 1 1 158 Senator K ennedy . Th ank you very much. Dr. Richmo nd, I think we are hopefully moving int o a tim e frame with healt h insuranc e where health inf orma tio n and rese arch and tech nolo gy assessment is going to be extremely im po rta nt. We will get the administ ratio n's pro gra m la te r this sprin g, and we intend to have quite exten sive hea ring s on it d ur in g the period of the summer, and hopef ully have action on it in the very ne ar future with the kin d of inf orm ation th at will be gathe red by our proposal and th e kin d of inf orm ation t ha t I think you also recog nize is of grea t imp ortanc e is absolutely ur gent at th is time. There is a g reater sense of u rgen cy about it, I think, now th an really any tim e in the past'\u2014there should be, rat her. Pe rh ap s there is not, bu t the re s hould be. One of the factors th at troubles me with the ad minist ratio n's p ro \u00ad posal is it would seem t hat you would be moving a lon g f or 1,2 , perh aps even 3 years, tryi ng to shift people around wi thin the De partm ent, and I t hink th ere would have to be some leg itim ate questions as to the typ es of tr ai ni ng and the back gro und and experience th at these people would have, bein g loaned to variou s agencies, focusing on thi s prob lem; the difficulty of at trac ting people from outside th at would come down to the De partm ent for 1 or 2 years, with the idea th at there is going to be a change in admi nis tra tiv e str uc ture of this par \u00ad tic ular p rog ram and u nsu re where th at is going to lead. Tt is the ques\u00ad tion about wha t we are goi ng to find out, even th roug h e xperime nta tion and even throug h t his k ind of a dm ini strative setup th at you ta lk about, th at we rea lly will not know in a couple of years. I think really the leg itima te question is : If we h ave some idea s and views abou t these issues, why doesn't it make sense to set up this process now and get about the business which we should be about, in terms of tech nolo gy, in terms of inf orma tio n, in terms of the tvp es of rese arch ? Let's give i t the kind of vis ibility , get i t moving in the priva te sector, with insurance companies and the priva te areas, and give it t he sup\u00ad po rt, both cong ressional and ad mi nis tra tio n support , get the quality people in there, an d get about the busin ess of doing it. Th at is really wTha t I think needs to be done. I am just troubled \u2014 and you make a case, and it is an appealing one. th at with yo ur own pers onal lea der ship and t he leade rship of the peop le at this table, who are high lv qualified and hav e a view about th is pa rticul ar issue, th at you will be able to develop it throug h its early process, and perha ps be able to spin th is off when it gets on its feet. T am ju st troubled whether, from an admi nis tra tiv e point of view and org aniza tional point of view, and the sense of urgency th at this pa rtic ul ar issue dem ands, whethe r that is as effective. I do not know, w ith all respect, th at th e pro posals an d the com ments th at were adva nced pu ttin g forw ard thi s issue this mo rni ng are going to change my mind. Maybe you did not expect to, but th at is where we come out. I do not know wh eth er you would want to make any general comment----- Dr. R ichmond . I think I would. Mr. Ch airma n. I think your pro posal is\u2014as T in my innova\u00ad tive. Conce ptu ally , it make s sense. And T suppose T feel that wav because it is going in the dire ctio n th at we are moving in as well. 159 Senator Kenne dy. Yo u know, these ideas have been around. I think we have attempted to package them, but among thoughtful people, both in your Department and other areas that are thinking about it, we recognize it. Dr. R ichmon d . I think I would just also indicate, Mr. Chairman, that we have been moving in the direction of explorations. The Off ic e of Health Practices Assessments, to which I referred, we set up to try to accomplish som e of the objectives that you had in the Center for the Evaluation of Medical Technology\u2014 or in the proposed Center. We have also, we think, improved our capacity to evaluate various health technologies for the administration of the medicare and medic\u00ad aid programs, and we have begun to systematize that. We do feel, however, that there are many activities, many programs ongoing within the Department in the various agencies, that are very relevant to the management of health technology. And we do indeed need to learn how to bring all of tha t together at a focal point in the Department more effectively. It is for that reason that we want to move quickly, even to the point, of course, of redirecting, as I indicated, som e $5 million to get started immediately. Our task force, as is, I think, well-illustrated in this diagram which you have before you, identified the inordinate complexity of this problem. The whole matter of moving from basic research all the wav to the practice and applications end of the spectrum\u2014and there are many, many stages in between. And we think in order to recruit the kind of competence that you are talking about, Mr. Chairman, in order to develop this on a sound basis, in order not to replicate what is going on in the existing agencies, but to develop som e way of tapping into the good work that is going on there, as well as in the broader community outside of the Public Health Service, will take som e really creative kind of effort. And we need to bring som e people in to work on that. We do not think that that can happen instantly. Senator K ennedy . We are going to have to recess for about 10 minutes, and then I have some other questions and we will continue along. [Whereupon, a short recess was taken.] Senator K ennedy . We will come to order. Dr. Richmond, you have indicated that you would probably get $5 million for this project within IIE W; is tha t correct? Dr. R ichmon d . That is correct. Senator K ennedy . Could you tell us where that $5 million will com e from? Dr. R ichmon d . We were planning to redirect those funds from several of the agencies\u2014 som e from the National Institutes of Health, som e from the Center for Disease Control, some from the Food and Drug Administration, and some from the National Center for Health Services Research. Senator K ennedy . Well. I think we ought to find that out. You know, we spent a lot of time last year to get the increased budo -et for example, in FDA, because of all of their responsibilities in terms of investigating and drug testing. And I would expect that they will 160 probab ly have addit ion al respon sibilities in the are a of cosmetics be\u00ad fore this session is over. So I won der how we can do it in terms of FD A. The CDC has all the pro gra ms now with reg ard s to the Rus sian flu and oth er factors. Do the y have loose money around? The N II I, I would like to see where th at is coming from, in terms of the pr o\u00ad gram. He alth services is the same way. All of those pro gra me s are heavily pres sed w ith the ir bud gets in a ny event. So I think we ough t to g et some idea of where this is coming from and wh at you see as to where it will come from over any period of time, the next 2 years, 3 yea rs, and how you see the grow th of th at pa rticul ar kin d o f pr ogram w ith in HEW . You can submit th at, unless you wa nt to make a comment on it now. Dr. R ichmond . Well, we would, Senator, plan to come t o you with some requests for new fun ds fo r this program before very long. The redirectio n of the $5 million was largely in an effort to get som ething mov ing imm ediately, ra th er than wa iting for the nex t budg eti ng cycle. Bu t we will be gla d to sub mit a pla n to you for the record.

The preliminary nature of this plan must be emphasized. One obvious possible change would be to have only one intradepartmental group instead of the two under I. IMPLEMENTATION.

Functions of OHT - (attachments 1 and 2) The functions and responsibilities of OHT are described In the functional statement for OHT as reflected In the April 17 memorandum from the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health Policy, Research and Statistics (attachment 3). In essence, OHT will systematize and manage the diverse technology-based activities which take place In the Public Health Service agencies (e.g., monitoring, evaluation, review/syntliesls, transfer and Intervention). 2. Functions of OHAR - (attachment 4) This office has the lead responsibility for coordinating all NIK activities with respect to the evaluation of medical applications of research. In concert with the BID directors, OMAR has developed criteria for identifying health technologies which are ready for consensus development. Together with the BIDS, Ol'AR develops and refines procedures for consensus development regarding the safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of sue. technologies. It oversees selection of topics and consents activities. OMAR has the responsibility of assuring that the results of consensus development exercises are conveyed 1n an understandable fora to those that require such information (e.g., other PUS agencies, the practicing community, et c.). 3.

In Its role, OMAR provides (1) technical Input to OUT regarding establishment of priorities, (2) readiness of a given technology for * assessment, and (3) technical Information on safety and efficacy for use by OHT 1n Its broader responsibility for comprehensive technology assessment. OHT furnishes to OMAR results of these assessments for consideration by the research community 1n setting research priorities. In developing these Interactive roles, both OMAR and OHT will consider the recmnendatlons contained 1n the Department's Technology Management Report. e / Ju li u s 2. Ei cta ou d Julius B.

CONSENSUS DEVEL OPMENT ANO HEALTH RESEARCH/HEALTH CARE INTERFACE A P R O C E S S FO R DH EW HE AL TH TE CHNOLO GY DE VELO PMENT NIH /O MAR1 O H E W /O H T R E S P O N S IB IL IT Yh i 173 Senator Kenn edy. I mentioned just before we recessed the impor\u00ad tance of getting the private sector, both the m anufacturing industry, as well as other aspects of the health industry th at are in the private sector, very much involved. And I am just wondering how you intend io do that. I think that, quite frankly, there is probably greater opportunity with an independent posture and position than within the Depart\u00ad ment, but maybe you have got some ideas on that. Dr. R ichmon d . As I indicated earlier. Air . Chairman, we certainly plan to seek the advice of all appropriate groups. And certainly, in terms of research and development, industry is very significantly involved. This is a place where we do hope to. as I indicated, gain the advice of the Institute of Medicine. We are hoping that the Institute will review the document which our task force has produced and that they will advise us on the best way to proceed with getting appropriate planning and policy development representation from all sectors. We certainly, in addition to industry, would want to have uni\u00ad versity groups, the scientific and professional community, certainly professional organizations\u2014I might note. Senator, that organizations like the American College of Physicians, the American Surgical As\u00ad sociation. the American Academy of Pediatrics and many other groups are very actively involved in one or another aspect of tech\u00ad nology assessment and transfer, and we would want to build those deliberations in. This is part of what I meant earlier when I said we would not want to replicate what is ongoing. Many of these groups have very signifi\u00ad cant contributions to make in this development. Senator K ennedy . Let me ask you about how long is it going to take to get the cooperative health statistics system in place? Dr. R ichmon d . I think, Senator. I would like to ask Mrs. Rice if she would make some comments on that, since she has that under her supervision. Mrs. R ice. We are quite pleased with the development of the system . There really is quite an active interest and acceptance and support of the system in most of the States. Bv the end of this fiscal year, we will have 44 States participating in the cooperative health statistics system. Of these, we will have 11 in the hospital care data component, 2 7 in health facilities, 26 in health manpower, and 38 in biostatistics. We expect, with the planned budget for fisc al 19 79 submitted to the Congress, to have almost all of the States fully operational in the biostatistics component, and to have about 42 States in the health manpower data and health facilities data components. We are going more slowly in the hospital care component, with additional funds, we could do much more than we have in the past. Senator K ennedy . That was one of the questions. On this last point, you indicate with additional funds you could mov e more lapidly. That is, basically, you feel there is a hindrance to greater progress; is tha t correct ? Mrs. R ice. Yes; we do need additional funds to get the program going in the hospital care component. We expect that these data consortium, in many cases, for the collection of hospital discharge 28-790 0 - 78 -12 174 data would be self-supporting within a period of about 3 to 4 years after the initial funding. The proposal is that the States actually collect the data through this nonprofit organization or a public agency and then the consortium could be self-funding by funds from the PSR O's, the HSA 's, and the private organizations. . . .Senator K enn edy . What kind of administrative problems or bureaucratic problems do you have, if any\u2014or don't you have any Mrs. R ice. I know you are referring, Senator, to some of the prob\u00ad lems we have been having with the coordination with the Health Care Financing Administration. In New York, NCHS had in 19 76 entered into a contractual ar\u00ad rangement with the New York State Health Department to design and test a statewide hospital discharge data system. And in carrying out the work of the health department, they had subcontracted to this New York Data Consortium, which is a nonprofit organization rep\u00ad resenting the public agency, the private insurers, the physicians, hos\u00ad pitals, and PSR O's , the local planning agencies, as well as the State of Neiv York. The work of the consortium had been substantially performed through the contract, at a cost of about $190,0 00. Last year, back in September, in anticipation of the enactment of the Medicare/Medicaid Frau d and Abuse Act tha t mandates uniform reporting system, we learned that HCFA was making a grant to the State Department of Health in New York. A fter learning about this grant, we communi\u00ad cated our concern to the Health Care Financing Administration and successfully arranged tha t a set of provisions be inserted into the grant, that they coordinate and cooperate with the Cooperative Health Statistics System. We are meeting with the New York State people and the consortium next week, to resolve some of the problems that have emerged. I do think tha t the proposal that Dr. Richmond had indicated would be for a health data advisory committee will assist in settling som e of the problems that have emerged between the Health Care Financing Administration and the National Center for Health Statistics. We hope to bring these issues for discussion between us at that forum and then, if there needs to be a resolution, to bring them to the Under Secretary and the Secretary of HEW for resolution. Senator K ennedy . Well, would you let us know what the results of tha t meeting are? Mrs. R ice. We would be very pleased to inform you after the meeting. Senator K enn edy . Fine. I have no further questions. Dr. R ichmon d . Thank you very much, A ir. Chairman. Senator S chweiker . Mr. Chairman. I apologize for being late. I had som e trouble getting in this morning bec ause of the sn ow. Mrs. Rice, I understand you have alreadv commented a bit on the epidemiological activities of your Center. My first question is. W hat do you see as the impact of this bill on the epidemiological work that is being none now, and is there\u2014well, maybe I will just ask that ques\u00ad tion first and see what your response is. Mrs. R ice. The bill does emphasize, of course, the expansion of the epidemiological activities of the National Center for Health Statistics. 175 The fac t is t ha t we are cu rre ntl y involved in a v ari ety o f epidemio\u00ad logical activities , and we can do this under the curre nt legislative man date. We are in the process of dev elopin g a set of map s, com parable to those th at were prepare d by the Na tio nal Can cer In stitu te, to apply to all diseases. In th at way, we would be iden tif ying high risk areas for variou s causes of desk. Th is will be a way of id en tif ying these diseases, and for the CDC, for example, to go in to find ou t w ha t c an be done to imp rove the s ituation. We are in the process of dev eloping a national death index. Th is has been requested by the Congress, as well as the Nalional In sti tutes of He alth. We are in the process of exam ining o ur da ta and our da ta systems to be able to do more epid emiolog y work. We think we can do this under our manda te. Of course, with addit ion al staff and addit ion al fun ds, we could do even more. Se na tor S ciiw eiker . Specifically, w hat k ind of ep idem iology studies are you doing now? Airs. R ice. Well, I mentio ned the m apping and the------ Se nator S ciiw eiker . Re lat ing to a ny specific diseases? Mrs. R ice. All causes of dea th. T his is a pre sen tation of th e maps o f all causes of death , by specific cause of death, so th at we can look a t th e reasons fo r the varia tio ns across the c ountry for differen t dea th rates. The Can cer In stitu te has pre pared , using our data, maps showing the different ials across the cou ntry in canc er d eaths. We expect to pro\u00ad duce a volume th at will i dentify all causes o f dea th. Senator S ciiw eiker . H ow abo ut mo rbidity da ta, diseases sho rt of dea th ? Mrs. R ice. We have a variety of d ata system s, Senat or, t ha t can be used a nd are being used to pro duce d ata on m orb idity and on the hea lth of th e Nation. Ou r health exa min atio n and nu tri tio n survey, a surv ey where we go out and exam ine the population over a period of tim e, we produc e inf orma tio n abou t the health sta tus of the pop ula tion throu gh th at survey. Fo r exam ple, we have iden tified, as Dr. Rich mon d ind icated in his testimo ny, th at th ere is a significant diffe rential in hyp ertens ion am ong the blacks com pared with the whites. We have been pro ducin g such inf orma tio n from o ur da ta systems. Se nator S ciiw eiker . Is the re any duplication with CD C's w ork in the epidem iology area ? H as that been much o f a p roblem ? Mrs. R ice. S enato r, I do not see tha t the re is anv dup lication at all with CDC . Se nator S ciiw eiker . Le t's tak e t he exam ple of L egi onnai res' disease. I have been very activ e and intere sted in th at case. CDC has acted as the lead agency, I believe, and has done some ra th er tho rou gh epi\u00ad demiological work. What, if anyth ing, has your o rganiza tion done in th at case, in terms of epidemiology ? Mrs. R ice. We sim ply pro vided some inf orm ation to them on the dea ths from those diseases. We were able to iden tif y the dea ths in the past from diseases like Le gio nnaires' disease. And CDC went into the area to learn firs thand wha t the problem s were, how the y arose, and wh at were the fac tors associated with tha t disease. 176 We use our data systems in a bro ad way by iden tif yi ng hig h risk areas. CDC goes into th at are a to find out more about t he specifics of the disease. Dr. R ichmond . Senator Schweiker, if I might ju st elaborate on Mrs. Rice's comments, wh at he r epidemiologic da ta do is ch art the course of mo rbidity and mortality in the Nation, and CDC, with its cap acity fo r lab orato ry and field inv estigation the n moves in on the leads th at are provide d. Ju st as an exam ple, one of the reasons why we become concerned about p ote ntial outbreaks of influenza is tha t complic atio ns of influenza ran k amon g the 10 leadin g causes of death. We know th at with outbreak s we can have those mo rbidities and mo rtalities rise considerably. So CDC then moves in to give us the advice on how we ought to proceed to try to minimize the increases in mo rbidity and m ortality from a cause like tha t. I w ould like to just comm ent, too, on the d ata collection system s th at Mrs. Rice and h er staff have developed, which give us no w much more detaile d pictures of the loci of high infant m ortality rates, fo r example. We now are b egi nning to use those data in the plan ning for hea lth services, so th at we are no t firing our service resources like buckshot, bu t we are beg inning to tr y to find ways of concentra tin g those re\u00ad sources at target areas where the outbreaks o r the rates are h igh. Senator S ciiw eiker . I would like to ask you or Mrs. Rice abo ut the current sup ply of epidemiolog ists. Do we need more? Sho uld we train more? What are the imp lica tion s, if we do expand epidemiological activities and t raining? Dr. R ichmond . Well, as the for me r chairma n of th e De partm ent of Preventiv e and Social Medicine at the H ar va rd Medical School, I think I can tell you, Senator, th at we are in very sho rt supplv. For a va rie ty of reasons, young phy sicians in pa rti cu la r have not been at\u00ad tra cte d to this field in sufficient numbers, and I think th is is something th at we are going to have to a tte nd to. T do not mean by th at to ind icate that phy sician s are the only ones who can do good epidemiolog y, but they con stitute one significant source. Se nator S ciiw eiker . A re we able to t ake steps un der ex isting legisla \u00ad tion to attrac t more people into the field and expan d tra ining, or is this something tha t new legisla tion is needed f or ? Dr. R ichmond . Well, I t hink we have th e au thority , and we do have some pro grams in preven tive medicine which enable us to do some tra ining. T think we should exp and these proo-rams, however. Se nator K ennedy . Wo uld th e Senator yield on that po int? Se nator S chweiker . Yes. Se nator K ennedy . We did not get into this in the other question period, but as Senator Sch weiker understands, this is one of the im\u00ad po rta nt ing red ien ts th at compels our pa rti cu la r appro ach , because each of the in stitut es h as a str ong tr aining function, an d for the reasons th at you have outlined h ere, we stress the importanc e o f th at. And T think it is not as a pp are nt in term s o f yo ur pro posal \u2014T know th at you know it is necessary \u2014but we have really tri ed to targ et th at as an im porta nt ing red ien t in our legisla tion , fo r the reasons th at you have iust mentioned here. I th an k the Se nator. 177 Sena tor S chweike r . I have ju st one more question. Dr. Rich mon d, you may ask one o f you r assoc iates to answer it \u2014I am not sure who in the \" roup w ould handle it. here would the pro gra m supp ort fun ds fo r health sta tistics and health services re search act ivities come f rom , ac cording to the ad minis \u00ad tra tio n's bud get proposa ls? In oth er words, would the money have to come from autho riz ati on specifically tied to the centers, or would it come from the Assistan t Secre tar y's Offic e, or some place else? Dr. R ichmond . I think I migh t ask Mrs. H an ft to comm ent on tha t. Mrs. H anft . Th e centers ' pers onnel and th eir staffing are tar geted at each ind ivi dual center. The entire bud get appears in the bud get of the Office of the Assistant Secre tar y of H ealth . The supp ortin g functio ns, such as man age ment, con tracts, finan cial management, and personnel are pa rt of the overhea d of the Office of the Assistan t Secre tary of He alth, which serve all his functio ns. Bu t each cen ter has an iden tified bud get for th eir research and their sta tistic al ope rations, th eir salaries and expenses and the costs of th eir variou s pro gra ms, bo th intra mural and e xtramural p rogram s. Senator S chw eiker . Well, str aigh ten me out if I am wrong, bu t I thou gh t in the pas t, that XCI IS and XCIIS R \"program su pp or t\" fun ds, as the President's budget calls them , did not come out of the specific autho riz ati ons for ap prop ria tio ns f or th e centers, b ut actu ally came o ut o f other Xow, maybe I misunderstood. Mrs. H anft . They have a separate ap prop ria tio n for each of the centers. We also, in the Office of the Assistan t Secre tar y for He alt h, provide them with certain su pp ortin g services in the way of finan cial management, personnel, and contrac ts. Bu t the y have their own autho riz ati on , each cen ter has its own au tho riz ati on for sala ries, expenses, gran ts, con tracts, and th ei r total costs. In addit ion , the Xation al Cente r for He St atistic s perfo rm s certain reim bursable services for oth er agencies, and the y are rei m\u00ad bur sed for those services out of the other agencies' budgets. Senator S chw eiker . Oh, the o ther agencies r eimburse them for th eir services ? Mrs. H anft . Fo r certain services th at are done on a reim bursable basis by XC HS and b y XC IIS R. For exam ple, th e em ergency medical services research is fun ded under the emergency medical servic es b ill ; yet the Xational Ce nte r for He alt h Services Rese arch perfo rm s th at research for the H ealth Services A dm ini stration. Dr. R ichmond . I think Dr. Ros enthal may w ant to m ake a com ment on this. too. Dr. R osenthal . Only to note briefly th at up until we were tran s\u00ad fer red to the Office o f the Assistant Secre tary, the pro gra m manag e\u00ad ment bud get for the Xational Cente r for He alth Services Research and for the Xation al Cente r for Hea lth Stati stics showed up in the ap prop ria tio n for pro gra m manag ement for the Hea lth Resources Ad mi nis tra tio n. It was not in the line labeled \"X ational Ce nte r fo r Hea lth Services Res earc h,\" or in the line labeled, \"X ational Cente r fo r Hea lth Sta \u00ad tistics.\" An d the autho riz ati on levels which were alluded to in our legisla tion d id not inclu de the pro gra m manag ement resources. 178 Now, the re was some discussion ove r wheth er th at was the best strate gic way to do th at, hu t I think the way the law is written, those program manageme nt fun ds now will be pa rt of the Office o f the As\u00ad sis tant Secre tary for He alt h, and the approp ria tio ns made again st our autho rizations will specifically refer to the research th at we are un derta kin g, the statistic al activities t hat we initiate, and in our case, only those thi ngs related to the dire ct man agement of the int ramu ral pro gra m, which comes also ou of th at legi slation. Bu t the pro gra m manag ement gen erally\u2014my salar y and those of our own admi nis trative staff\u2014are not included in th at num ber. I think that is the n atu re of th at question. Senator S chweiker . Thank yo u ve ry much. Se nator K ennedy . Th an k you very much. We will be sta ying in touch with you and w ork ing closely w ith you. Ou r n ext witness is David H am burg, who we are please d to welcome before the committee. He is the dis tinguished president of the In st i\u00ad tute o f Medicine, and his advice is always valued and alw ays helpful. Ou r only reg ret is th at we do not get you down here more ofte n, Dr. H am burg. We look forward to your testim ony. STATEMENT OF DR. DAVID HAMBURG, PRESIDENT, INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE, NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, WASHINGTON, D.C . Dr. H amburg . Tha nk you, very much indeed. Mr. Chairma n, I am very grateful for the invit ati on to testi fy be\u00ad fore t his rem arkable comm ittee, which has contributed so much to the healt h o f our Nation. I h ave a dmired for yea rs the deep int ere st th is committee has taken in healt h care, research, and education. Yo ur work has had a hig hly con stru ctiv e and stimula tin g impac t on the he alt h sciences and h ealth professions in th e United State s and abro ad. I recognize th at the occasion for this he aring is the introducti on of S. 2466. I believe this bill is tim ely and sig nific an t; it addresses con\u00ad structively some of the major issues of the next decade in health policy. The In stitu te of Medicine shares man y intere sts and concerns of this committee. Ou r ch arter specifies th at our mission is to prote ct and promote the health of the pub lic and to exam ine healt h policy issues objectively, from m ult ipl e perspe ctives. Today . I tes tify as an in div idu al, expressing my own views. I n doing so, I am fortu nate to be able to draw upon a num ber of studies, pape rs, and conferences undertaken by the In stitu te du rin g the past 2 years. They are listed in my statem ent, Mr. Ch airma n, bu t I am no t going to rea d them , and indeed, the re are oth er pa rts of my sta tem ent th at I will simply submit for the record. I want to make my sta tem ent as brief and, I hope, u sefu l as possible. These activities of the In stitu te of Medicine listed in the statem ent deal with problems believed by our council, mem bers and our staff to be of crucial imp ortanc e in health science policy, in healt h services, and in disease preven tion . In add itio n to these ma terials, I dra w upon my own bac kgroun d of 30 years active work in basic science, clin ical inv estiga tion, and healt h care. 179 The essential po int I wa nt to make tod ay is th at we sta nd on the thresh old of a gr ea t op po rtu nity to imp rove the healt h of t he public. Th at op po rtu nity rests on an exte nsion of science to the whole of the healt h care system. In the next decade, I think we can grea tly increase the extent to which the he alt h system is based on scientific attitu des, methods, and principle s. To take advanta ge of this op po rtu nity, we m ust p rov ide con ditions th at will strength en needed disc iplines and fos ter novel col lab oration among the disc iplines in addre ssing the gr t prob lems of healt h and disease. Circum stan ces have really c hanged rapidly in the p ast few decades, and we mu st make ins titution al changes to deal effectively with the new circum stances. Th is will require th at we constru ct a powerful chain of research from lab orato ry bench to pa tie nt bedside to the com mun ities and homes\u2014with every link in the cha in strong. Tha t is th e essen tial p oin t I want to make\u2014broad ening of science throu gh the whole of the health care system. I wan t first to discuss some explo ration s tow ard this wider ran ge of scientific un derpinning s for the h ealth of th e public. It is im po rta nt to bear in min d th at the re are t hre e gen era l classes of fac tors affe cting the health of the public, and the y are all very importa nt. One is m edical care and o the r p ersona l c are by health pro fessionals; anoth er is e nviron me nta l conditio ns, which hav e been very im po rta nt his tor ica lly in ma tte rs such as sa ni ta tion ; an d, no less i mpo rtan t now, alth ough in somewhat differen t ways than let us say in the last cen\u00ad tury ; and finally, the effect of ind ividual beh avi or on hea lth. All three are very im porta nt, a nd all three have to be addresse d scientifically. In this con text, let us consider the science base for im proving the health of the public. We know th at the establishment and ma int e\u00ad nance of very hig h sta nd ty bv the National Insti tutes of He alth has served the Nation well over the pa st q ua rte r century . There now exists in this country a general appre cia tion of the im\u00ad as biochemistry, genetics, physiology', related fields. ' Ind eed , Mr. Ch airma n, whereve r I have gone thr ou gh ou t the wor ld\u2014E uro pe and Af ric a and elsew here\u2014I have fou nd very great resp ect for the N II I. I t is a visible symbol of high-qu ali ty achieve \u00ad ment in biomedical research. Now tod av, I think we are seeing the emergence of addit ion al ele\u00ad ments that build upon th at base created prim arily , tho ugh not ex\u00ad clusively, by N II I; the emergence of inter est in othe r sciences to add on to the established fields, in pu rsu ing the goal of imp roved health. These include but are not limited to epidem iology', biostatistics, bio\u00ad eng ineerin g, the b ehavioral social sciences as th ey rela te to healt h, health services research and preven tion research. Incre asi ngly, we see th at each of thes e lines of inq uir y has great poten tial value for imp roved health and well-being, and are th ere for e des erving of su pp ortin g and nurtu ran ce. And some of the new er or renewed sciences do indeed req uire care\u00ad ful nu rtu rin g. 180 Epide miology, for exam ple, has a valu able and in fact pioneering his tor y in health and has been revived rece ntly, pa rticul arly in the con text of chronic diseases. The most recent HEW forw ard plan points out th at epidemiology is em erg ing as the f irst line of defense in detecting new cancer hazard s th at may he missed in variou s screens, and a pp ear fo r the first time in hum ans. Most of the clea rly iden tifiable env iron mental causes of have been fou nd first throug h epidemiological studies and confirmed later t hrou gh labora tory studies. Now, this is not to arg ue in any way for epidem iology as a sub\u00ad sti tute for research on basic biological mechanisms. It is to argue for the strength ening of thi s old disc ipline in a new context. Also \u2014and I would emphasize thi s point, Mr. Ch air ma n \u2014we have to find ways to bring about effective integrat ion of epid emiolog y with lab ora tor y sciences such as biochemistry and with clinical medicine. Tha t is a special area where the tra in in g pro gra ms you spoke of a mom ent ago may be quite per tinent . As we learn more about the burde n of illness in thi s cou ntry, the importance of beh avioral fac tor s health becomes inc reasingly clear. Wh ereas infe ctio us diseases used to he the most burdensome ill \u00ad nesses, we now see c ard iov asc ula r diseases, cancers, lun g diseases, ac\u00ad cidents, homicide, and other violence as the m ajo r assaults on life and hea lth. Because such bur den s clea rly have str ong beh avioral factors, app roache s to the prev ention or man agemen t of these problems must obviously include a strong beh avioral science pers pective. As the burde n of illness changes, the sciences needed to lessen the burde n also must change. We must find out how we can br ing the best in beh avi ora l science, whatever th at may he at a given mom ent \u2014 and it will develop over tim e \u2014to bea r on these serio us hea lth problems. Here I refer to the rel ationships of factors like heavy cig are tte smoking , heavy alcohol use, risky dri vin g, prolonged stress, pec uliar diets, and lack of exercise, to car dio vas cular diseases and some can \u00ad cers, especially lun g cancer \u2014as well as to mental illness. And these are, of course, among the very heaviest burdens of illness we have. Now let us briefly con sider health services research. Th is is a field of study concerned with the pra ctical delivery of health services. The mode in which services are pro vided, th eir cost, their quality, their av ail ability \u2014all have a g rea t hearing in the long run on health sta tus of the pop ula tion. To the e xte nt th at health servic es research can increase un de rst an d\u00ad ing lea din g to positive change, both in the content and in the orga ni\u00ad zati on of healt h services, it shows a relevance to healt h th at is of great potent ial imp ortanc e. And I am sor ry to say th at th at poten tial im\u00ad portan ce has not been fully apprec iated, even in the health professions and the health sciences, let alone in the general pub lic, but th at day is coming. The key point being made here is that a whole spectru m of health research is needed in order to meet Am eric a's long range problems. An exclusive or heavy focus on only one com ponent of the spectru m is unwise. We must try to help the Nation tes t out the ex\u00ad ten t to which the methods o f science could he b roug ht to bear, not just 181 on some pieces of the hea lth system, hut over the entire ran ge of the healt h system. Senator K ennedy . Ju st to illu str ate , th e area of biomedical research and the support that it has received is an exam ple, obviously , of ex\u00ad cellence which has g otten str ong sup port from thi s committee. Bu t is your point here th at wha t has been done in that area ought to be rep licated in these oth er areas? I)r. H amburg . Yes; it is, precisely. An d I would like to------ Senator K ennedy . An d th at if you just have th at soil of tow er sta nd ing in and of itse lf, th at even its full poten tial might not be as realized if we do the oth er kinds of thi ng s which you have outlined here. Dr. H amburg . Le t me give two or three concrete examples th at I think are tangib le and down to ea rth in the next few minutes, th at show really how this spectru m can work , if only we provide the con\u00ad dition s to make it work over the whole range of health problems. Let us talk about hyp erte nsion. Th at was refer red to by Dr. Rich\u00ad mon d and some of his dis tinguish ed colleagues very well. It is a te r\u00ad ribly serio us problem. It is a very importa nt dis order an d a risk factor for stroke, coronary disease. It is concentrat ed heavily in the black population , as you have heard. It has been a stim ulus for and a beneficiary of a gre at deal of basic research which this comm ittee has fostere d in car dio vas cular and kidney physiology and biochemistry, as well as research in en\u00ad docrino logy and in the neurosciences. Now, out of th at basic research came first small-scale clinical ex\u00ad plorations , and then well-designed large -scale clinical tri als, mainly in the VA. An d it was fou nd th at under these optima l conditio ns of the cli ni\u00ad cal tria ls th at the re were indeed several good tre atm ents in the way of med ication for hyper tension th at would reduce blood pressure over an extended period of time. Wh en these clinical tri als dem onstrate d the effectiveness of med ica\u00ad tion , we who were inte rested in hyp ertens ion felt a lot of sa tisfac tion, and the prob lems appeare d to be largel y solved. Bu t, in fac t, it was not solved. To our distress, it turned out that only abo ut ha lf the patie nts did in fac t adh ere to the the rap eutic regim en. H al f of them sim ply did not take the medication. Hy pertension is by no means unu sual in that respect. Now, it be\u00ad came im po rta nt to ascerta in, throug h behavioral and healt h services research, why pa tie nts were not taki ng med ication th at was mani\u00ad festly good for them , and dem onstrabl y able to preven t strokes. An d I may say with some feeling, Mr. Ch airma n, th at my fath er this past week had a stro ke related to hyp ertens ion, and I reg ard this as one of the majo r problem s we have in this cou ntry. We have within our grasp the ability to preven t a great deal of this hum an suffering, and yet h aving th e biochemical and pha rma cological cap ac\u00ad ity in itself is not sufficient. Now, health servic es research has brou gh t abou t some clar ificatio n in this situation. An d some o f these fac tors may a pp ea r munda ne, bu t I can assure you th at they are very im porta nt to hyp ertens ion pa \u00ad tients and th ei r families. 182 Failu re to tak e the medication depe nds pa rtly on such fac tors as the se: Long wa iting times for the doctor and at the ph arm acy; in\u00ad ade qua te followu p d side effects\u2014th at is, when no thing has been exp lain ed abo ut wh at is like ly to occur, particu larly when the patie nt lias not had symptoms prior to medication, even tho ugh his blood pressure was no t elevated. Now, reco gnizing th at, lea rning those fac ts throug h health services researc h, the re has rece ntly been some caref ul work on the utility of non phy sician med ication counselors, who focus specifically on these issues.

The point is that if we do not delive r the serv\u00ad ice which is the res ult of the basic research, we re ally perha ps minimiz e the achievement. Dr. H amburg . Tha t is rig ht. We can have a wonde rful tre atm ent, bu t if we do not get it the re in a sensible way, it is not going to do us muc h good. It is won derful for us to know about it in the In sti tute of Medicine or somewhere like th at , but in the com mun ities where peop le act ually live, it has to get there more or less in the way that it is pres cribed. Following out th is hypertension -ca rdiovasc ula r disease problem, a n\u00ad other type of esse ntial effo rt which I know this committee has been intere sted in involves tryi ng to pre vent the disease in the first place. We do n ot know enough about the mechanisms to pre vent t he disease in the most fun dame nta l sense. B ut on the other h and, some of the risk fac tors in the way we live our lives can be modified. Fo r exam ple, the study o f h ea rt disease prev ent ion based at St an ford , which utilized three commun ities in Ca lifornia , pub lic edu ca\u00ad tion . An d I think we are going to need much more pub lic education. W ha t th at gro up did was to tak e two exp erimenta l communities and a control commun ity. All thr ee were very sim ila r communities in no rth ern Ca lifornia ------ Senator K ennedy . We had a very good vis it at Stan ford, Doctor, and we were very well bri efe d on th at pro gra m. I t is a very exciting pro gra m, with profo und lessons for the res t of the cou ntry. We were *very impressed with wh at we observed the re, and I think the Ca li\u00ad fornia pro gra m will be an im po rta nt model for the typ e of research which o ught to contin ue. Dr . H amburg . M y own judg me nt is th at we need an inte nsification * of research to learn how to do th at effectively, nationwid e. Ju st 10 day s from tod ay, we are ha vin g a conference at th e In stitut e of M edi\u00ad cine whose focus is to a considerable extent on this kin d of question. Now, in the C ali fornia case, the two ex perime ntal com munities c learly had a decrease in tors throug h pub lic edu cation using\u2014 wh eth er one used mass media alone or mass media plus some pers onal con tact with hig h risk ind ividuals \u2014eit he r way. you did bette r than the control com mun ities in resp ect to low ering blood pressure, lower blood cholesterol and lowering cigare tte smoking. 183 Now, the Stanford study does not yet have measures th at help out\u00ad come . But there was a similar study recently from Finland which does have measure of health outcome and show s, for example, a really his\u00ad toric change in the trend of coronary attacks, a decrease in the coronary attack rate. So there is reason to believe that community-based programs can be effective, and we must now clarify the conditions under which such programs are likely to b e most effective. So this sketch of research on hypertension is meant to suggest the need for fostering the full spectrum of research from laboratory bench to patient bedside to the communities were we live and die. Now I would like very briefly to turn to a couple of other paths of progress which I believe require intensified research efforts and more adequate institutional facilitation. These are directions in which useful research on health care and disease prevention can be built on the solid foundations of biomedical scie nce . rI he y deal with practical, common problems tha t constitute an important part of today's burden of illness. For example, the organization of health care efforts for specific pur\u00ad poses can be remarkably effected even under harsh and difficult conditions. We all know the plight of the Indians in this country. Yet, in the 20 years from 19 55 to 19 75 , a time in which intensive and systematic effort was made to bring public health and preventive care to Indian mothers and infants, through the Indian Health Service, there were striking health status improvements. In those 20 years, the infant mortality declined about 70 percent; maternal mortality declined about 80 percent, The infa nt and ma\u00ad ternal mortality among the Indians in this country today is belo w tha t if the black population, which has not had on the whole such intensive and highly organized efforts to deal with these issues. Now , taking advantage of current knowledge based on public health and biomedical research, prenatal and perinatal care can clearly de\u00ad crease not only infant mortality and maternal mortality, but also birth defects and premature births, which so often have unfortunate aftereffects. Similarly, recent studies have shown that well-organized programs for children can decrease the days of illness, decrease expensive hos- pital time, and prevent later complications of childhood disease. In one such program, there was a 60-percent reduction in the incidence of rheumatic fever by virtue of prompt and appropriate use of anti\u00ad biotic therapy. This means that these persons were spared the heart disease that you remember used to kill so manv in young adulthood. When I was in medical school, we used to see those cases all the time. Now . here we have a clear example of the value of modern bio\u00ad medical research or preventive care that truly improves health. And yet. once again, the matter is not so simnle as it appears at first glance. A recent pediatric study shows an alarming problem that requires careful investigation if we are really going to fulfill the potentiality of science-based health care. 184 In th e clinic w here th is stu dy was done, a 10-day course of pen icillin was prescribed fo r chi ldr en with streptococca l th ro at infection. Bu t by the 3d day of this puta tiv e 10-day course, 56 perc ent of the childre n were no longer taking the pen icillin, and by the 6th day , 71 percen t were no longer ta king it. Th is means that much of the value, much of the preven tive poten \u00ad tia lit y of the penicillin is in actual fac t bein g lost. Now, we need to know how wid espread are such problems, wh at can we do to cope with them more effectively. To ans wer those pra ctical questions, we req uir e clin ical inv estiga \u00ad tion, h, epidemiology, and behav ioral science. A study done las t ye ar by the Ins tit ut e of Medicine is ve ry revealing in this reg ard . It sugg ests th at missed oppo rtu nitie s in childhood disease preventio n are n eit he r rare nor tr ivial. Th is stu dy was an ana lysis of the large body of scientific evidence beari ng on the efficacy and saf ety of polio vaccines. And I may say, Mr. Chairma n, th at the stu dy was in no small measure stimu lated by the ac tivitie s of t his committee. Now, while the polio vaccines are rem ark ably effective, th eir actu al use in th is c ountry is disappointing . In 1974, only about 67 percent of white chi ldr en and 45 percen t of nonwhite children in the Un ited Sta tes, ages 1 to 4, had been vaccin ated ag ain st polio. The com parable figure in no rth ern Eu ropean cou ntries and the Scandin avian countries is above 90 perc ent. Why is this so? To w hat exten t does it a pp ly to othe r poten tia lly v aluable vaccines? W ha t can be done to increase u tiliza tio n ? I submit, Mr. Ch airma n, th at these are not trivial questions. They are n ot beneath the dign ity o f science o r beyond the ran ge of scientific methods in th e 1980's . Some of the prob lems a re easily overlooked. We have in th is country a sort of romance with youth. We glo rify you th. And yet, curiously, the adolescent age gro up, and especially the early adolescents, 10 to 15, ten d to be poorly served and poorly researched, reg ard less of position in society. Bu t this is a critical period fo r the forma tion of he alth\u00ad releva nt beh avior pa tte rns th at have life long significance. I refer here to cig are tte smoking, alcohol use, risk y drivi ng, adolescent pregna ncy , sexually tra ns mitted disease, and hab its of nu tri tio n and exercise. An d of course, there are stil l ma ior problems o f the elderly, largely cu tting across socioeconomic lines, b ut most poign ant among the poor. In connectio n with problem s of adole scents and of the elderly and also o f the menta lly ill in general, we must lea rn more not only abo ut the basic natur e of the difficulties, but also how to integ rate hea lth services with social servic es in the communities where people act ual ly live a nd get their care. Th is committee has heard ample testimo ny in recent mon ths, and I will not dwell on it, about the need for gr ea ter empha sis on research which assesses both the risk s and benefits of diagnostic, the rap eutic, and preven tive interv ent there certainl y is a problem abo ut procedures in common use, as has alread y been ref err ed to this mornin g. It is tru e that the healt h professions striv e con tinu ous ly to improve their quali ty of ca re ; there is a str ong tra ditio n in th at respect. And yet, much of clinical care ha s not been based on m odern scientific meth- 185 ods. I t is necessary to determ ine more than we have done in the pas t the efficacy and safety of dia gno stic , the rap eutic , and preven tive interventions. I submit th at the cost and ethical implication s of not con duc ting such research a re very serious. There a re hopeful signs that th is matter is now bein g discussed and taken seriously and the introducti on of S. 2466 sh ould greatly enhance these conside rations. Mr. Ch airma n, it is exceedingly im po rta nt t ha t the Am eric an people understand the need to build a firm fou ndation for de aling with the newer problem areas of healt h in pract ica l, useful ways. W ha t I am tryi ng to do tod ay is p rim arily to cla rif y the need fo r a broadened app roa ch to the health sciences. I hese new fro ntier s involve man y form s of clinical inv estiga tion, health servic es research , b oth at the institut ion al and ind ivi dual level. Such inv estiga epid emiologica l, and ethical con sideration s. To be done effectively, they need a secure home th at can do for this field wha t N IH h as done for basic biomedical research. So we ask. Wh o can pro vide the right con ditions? N IH pro bab ly could, but for reasons of its t raditio na l str en gths and bou nda ries , N II I is not likely to do more than a pa rt of wha t needs doing. AD AM AH alr ead y does some of it and could do more. Th e same app lies to the FD A, CDC, and perha ps o ther health agencies as well. The existing health agencies deserve vigorous su pp ort fo r their tra ditio na l missions, and fo r some, wid ening o f their horizons. But if the y can not, or should not, do the whole job th at needs doing \u2014th at we have l)een disc ussing this mo rni ng\u2014then an oth er agen cy of com\u00ad par able sta ture must be developed to str ength en and ap ply a wid er ran ge of sciences and act ivities to improving the Na tio n's hea lth. The N IH has not until very recently accorded a hig h pr io rity to research explicitly dire cted tow ard disease and trau m a pre ven tion , especially in rega rd to the beh avioral and env ironm ent al aspe cts of hea lth. This sit uatio n, I am gla d to say, has begun to change , and oth er agencies have take n an interest also. But the re is, in my jud gm ent, s till a l ong way to go. It may well be t ha t new institut ion al arr angeme nts are necessary to fos ter researc h on near-term preven tion. The In stitut e proposed in S. 2466 could mak e a grea t contr ibu tio n to th is reg ard . I might add , Mr. Ch airma n, I would welcome a little more lan guage in t ha t bill addre ssing preven tion e xplicitly . Now, let me summarize briefly and make a co ncluding comment. The biom edical science effort of the Un ite d State s has ear ned worldwid e respect. In fact, the princ ipa l source of new inf orma tio n since Worl d W ar II on the na ture o f living o rga nisms h as been the A me rican life sciences com munity , much of which has been biomedically orie nted. We now have gro wing concerns about findin g ways in which the social ut ility of th is g rea t effort can be fu rthe r enhance d. To do th at , it is ap prop riate to broaden the tra di tio na l concept of biom edical sciences to include centrally, not marg inally, the sciences associated with public hea lth, with the environme nt, and with behavior. Th is broadened field may usefully be desig nated as \"the he alth sciences.\" 186 The health sciences must be concerned in a m ajo r w av not on ly with deepen ing the base of fun dame nta l know ledge, but with continuous mo nitoring of these adva nces fo r applicat ion s th at are pro mising in rega rd to clinical problems. Fu rth ermore\u2014and T would emph asize thi s\u2014arra ngem ents are needed to insure that t her e will be feedback loops from the clinical a nd social needs th at can stim ula te the research enterprise. The entire con tinu um o f h igh q uality research from basic science to clinical inv estigation to healt h services rese arch should be fostere d * by any com prehensiv e national health policy. If a hig her research pr iorit y is to be assigned to work of the so rt we have been discussing this mornin g, as I think it must, the n I want to say a word about wh at I believe we will need. We will need a nation- wide cadre of hig h quali ty scientists, qualified to tackle these diffi\u00ad cul t problems\u2014not just a fine gro up of people here in Wa shington . We will need an ability to collaborat e across dis cip lin ary lines th at exceeds most of w hat we have so f ar seen in the healt h sciences. For exam ple, health services research is not a single field. I t is a com bination of discipline s bro ught to bear on he alt h care problems. To do this sort of thing , we will need both ex tra mu ral and in tr a\u00ad mu ral pro grams. We will need work relevan t both to nea r-te rm policy problem s and to lon g-rang e cha nges in health an d society. We will need fo r such efforts high vis ibility and respect, first class intelle ctual leader ship, a clea r organiz ational focus, and a deter mi na\u00ad tion to persist over many yea rs in wh at is necessa rily a complex and difficult enterp rise . Mr. C hairm an, I believe the conditions are now exceptio nally fav or\u00ad able to titution al ar \u00ad rangem ents th at will complete the spectru m of healt h research and developm ent. Th e cha in can be made s tro ng in all of its links d ur ing the next few years. I say thi s for several reasons. One is the thou gh tfu l, con stru c\u00ad tive , far -si gh ted int ere st of this committee as reflected in S. 2466 an d in oth er comm ittee activities. I say it also because toda y's lead ership in the D epartm ent o f He alth, Education, a nd W elf are is keenly awa re of these problems an d read y to create new o pportunitie s. Dr. Rich mon d and his distinguished colleagues here tod ay un de r\u00ad sta nd these issues very well and are deeply com mitted t o dea ling with \u00ab them effectively. Th is is also tru e to an unu sual extent of the cu rre nt heads of the he alth agencies in DHEW . In this, I believe they have the keen inter est and full bac king of Secre tary Ca lifano and Un der Secre tary * Cha mpion. They have alread y tak en c onstructive steps, of which I men tion two briefly. One is the recent elevation in sta tus of the National Center fo r He alth Statist ics and the National Cente r for He alth Services Researc h, which we discussed earlier . An d anoth er is the intensive, system atic effort to focus on disease pre ven tion throug ho ut the entire Pu blic He alth Service in an unprecede nted way. Th is includes ma jor str en gth en ing of research relevant to pre vention in the foreseeable futur e. 187 It is my belief that this committee can work toegther with the De\u00ad partment of Health, Education, and Welfare in ways that will pro\u00ad vide strong institutional arrangements to complete the spectrum of health sciences. This can contribute in a major way to the continuing improvement of health care, a perennial quest. It can make our health services as rational, compassionate, and scie nce based as is humanly possible. Although I do not believe in any single right way to achieve such a goal, I believe that S. 2466 is a landmark pointing toward future progress in the health of our people. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Dr. Hamburg follows:] 18 8 SENATE SUBC OMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH Statement of DR. DAVID A. HAMBURG President, Institute of Medicine National Academy of Sciences Washington, D. C. February 7, 1978 a 189 Mr. Chairman, I am very grateful for the invitation to testify before thia remarkable committee which haa contributed ao much to the health of our nation. 1 have admired for years the deep Interest this committee has taken in health care, research, and education. Tour work has had a highly construc\u00ad tive and stimulating effect on the health sciences and health professions in the United States and abroad. I recognize that the occasion for this hearing is the introduction of S. 2466. 1 believe this bill is timely and significant; it addresses constructively some of the major Issues of the next decade in health policy. The Institute of Medicine shares many Interests and concerns with this committee. Our charter specifies that our mission is to protect and promote the health of the public, and to examine health policy Issues objectively from multiple perspectives. Today, I testify as an individual, expressing ay own views In doing so, 1 am fortunate to be able to draw upon a number of studies, papers and conferences undertaken by, the Institute of Medicine during the past two years. These Include: 1) Policy Issues in the Health Sciences; 2) Perspectives on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention in the United States; 3) Evaluation of Poliomyelitis Vaccines; 4) A Policy Statement on Computed Tomographic Scanning; - 1 - 28-790 0 - 78 - 1 3 190 - 2 - 5) Assessing Quality in Health Care: An Evaluation; 6) Technology and Health Care; 7) Invited papers prepared for the President's Commission on Mental Health; a) The Relationship of General Health and Mental Health Services, and b) The Assessment and Improvement of Mental Health Services; 8) The 1976 Annual Meeting of the Institute of Medicine, (entitled The Health Sciences and The Burden of Illness) which led to the publication The Current Burden of Illness by Dorothy Rice, Kerr White and Jacob Peldman; 9) A Survey of Current Problems In Clinical Investigation (currently underway); and 10) An Assessment of Health Services Research (also underway). These activities deal with problems believed by our Council, members, and staff to be of crucial Importance in health sciences policy, health services, and disease prevention. In addition to these materials, I draw upon my own back\u00ad ground of thirty years* active work in basic science, clinical investigation, and health care. The essential point I want to make today is that we stand on the threshold of a great opportunity to improve the health of the public. That opportunity rests on an extension of science to the whole of the health care system. In the next decade, we can greatly increase the extent to which the health 191 - 3 - s y s te m I s b a se d on s c i e n t i f i c a t t i t u d e s , m e th o d s , an d p r i n c i \u00ad p l e s .

We must try to help the nation test out the extent to which the methods of science could be brought to bear, not just on some pieces of the health system, hut over the entire range of the health system. Let me briefly talk about hypertension to make the research spectrum more meaningful. Hypertension Is a very important disorder and a risk factor for stroke, coronary disease, and kidney disease. It affects millions of Americans, particularly In the black population. It has been a stimulus for and a beneficiary of a great deal of basic research In cardlo vascular and renal physiology and biochemistry, as well as research in endocrinology and In the neurosciences. Out of that basic research came small-scale clinical explorations and then well-designed large-scale clinical trials, mainly in the VA. Under optimal conditions, we now have several good treatments in the drug sphere. After the randomized clinical trials demonstrated the effectiveness of medication, we felt much satisfaction. The problem appeared to be largely solved. But, in fact it was not. About half the patients simply did not adhere to the therapeutic regimen. Hypertension is by no means unusual in that respect. It became important to ascertain, through behavioral and health services research, why patients were not taking medication that was manifestly good for them and 196 - 8 - demonstrably able to prevent strokes. A certsln amount of clarification has emerged; some of It may appear mundane but very Important to hypertensive patients and their families. Failure to take the medication depends partly on such factors as: long waiting times for the doctor and at the pharmacy; Inadequate follow-up by doctors and clinics; over-complicated and confusing dosage schedules; unsatisfactory doctor-patient relationships; unexplained side effects, particularly In patients who had no symptoms prior to medication. Recently there has been some careful work on the utility of non-physician medication counselors who focus specifically on these Issues, and It has been shown that they can markedly enhance the adherence to a therapeutic regimen In hypertension. Still another kind of essential effort Involves trying to prevent the disease In the first place. We do not know enough about the mechanisms to prevent it In the most fundamental sense, but on the other hand, some of the risk factors In the way we live our lives can be modified. For example, the study of heart_disease prevention based at Stanford which utilized three communities in California was centered around public education in two experimental communities and a control com\u00ad munity. These were very similar communities -- one had mass media alone providing Information about cardiovascular risk factors, one had mass media plus some personal contact with high- risk individuals, and the third had no intervention. In both experimental communities there was a very considerable decrease In the risk factors achieved over two years \u2014 risk factors 197 - 9 - lncludlng lowering of hypertension, lowering of blood cholesterol lowering of cigarette smoking. That study, however, did not measure actual changes in health outcomes as a result of modifying these risk factors. There Is, however, a similar study recently reported from Finland which has not only documented a similar reduction In risk factors, but has also tracked changed In health outcomes \u2014 e.g., a decrease In the coronary attack rate. Thus, community- based programs can be effective. At the Institute of Medicine, we are currently trying to clarify the conditions under which such programs are likely to be most effective. Once again, this sketch of research on hypertension Is meant to suggest the need for fostering the full spectrum of research - from laboratory bench to patient bedside to the communities where we live and die. In considering our contemporary burden of Illness, and the lines of inquiry needed to reduce the burden, we should learn as many lessons as we can from past experience. We must try to sort out what has worked well and what has not, where gains have been made and why, and the gaps In research most urgently needing to be addressed 198 -10- Durlng the past centry, our health has benefited greatly from advances In agriculture, sanitation, Infectious disease, family planning, and maternal and child care. Yet much re\u00ad mains to be done. I want now to give several illustrations \u00ab of paths of progress. These are directions In which useful research on health care and disease prevention can be built upon the solid foundations of biomedical science. They deal with practical, common problems that constitute an important part of today's burden of Illness. We can deal with them more effectively by broadening the range of sciences brought to bear on them. For example, the organization of health care efforts for specific purposes can be remarkably effective, even under harsh and difficult conditions. We all know the plight of the Indians In this country, yet in the twenty years from 1955 to 1975, a time in which intensive and systematic effort was made to bring public health and preventive care to Indian mothers and infants through the Indian Health Service, there were striking health status Improvements. In those twenty years. Infant mortality declined about 70 percent, maternal mortality declined about 80 percent. The Infant and maternal mortality among the Indians in .this country today is below that 199 -li- of the black population, which has not had on the whole such intensive and highly organized efforts to deal with those issues. In the past decade, considerable evidence has also ac\u00ad cumulated indicating that organization of health care for specific groups with particular problems can reduce mortality, hospital coats, and the multiple burdens of chronic illness. Taking advantage of current knowledge based on public health and biomedical research, prenatal and perinatal care can clearly decrease not only Infant mortality and maternal mor\u00ad tality, but also birth defects and premature births which so often have unfortunate after-effects. Clinical investigation and health service research in the past decade have shown that such programs need not be complex or expensive in most Instances. Similarly, recent studies have shown that well-organized programs for children can decrease the days of illness, decrease expensive hospital time, and prevent later complications of childhood disease. In one such program, there was a 60 percent reduction in the incidence of rheumatic fever by virtue of prompt and appropriate use of antibiotic therapy. This means that these persons were spared the heart disease that used to kill so many in young adulthood. Here we have a clear example of the value of modern biomedical research for preventive care that truly Improves health. Tet the matter is not so simple as it appears at first glance. A recent pediatric study reveals an alarming problem that requires careful investigation if we are to be truly 200 -12- affactlve la fulfilling the potentiality of science-based health care. la the cllmlc where this study was done, a tea-day course af penicillin was prescribed for children with streptococcal throat Infection. But by the third day, 56 percent of the children ware no longer taking the penicillin, and by the sixth day, 71 percent were no longer taking It. This Beams that auch of the Aerapeutlc and preventive potentiality of the penicillin la In actual fact being lost. How widespread are such probleas? Vhat can we do to cope with them aore affectively? To answer such practical questions, we require clinical Investigation, health services research, epidemiology, sad hahavlsral science. A study dona last year by the Institute of Medicine suggests that missed opportunities in childhood disease prevention are neither rare nor trivial. Thia study was an analysis of the large body of scientific evidence bearing on the efficacy and safety of polio vaccines. While the vaccines are remarkably effective, their actual use In this country is disappointing. In 1974, only about 67 percent of white children and 45 percent of non-white children In the U.S. ages 1 to 4 had been vac\u00ad cinated against polio. The comparable figure In northern European countries Is above 90 percent. Why Is this so? To what extent does It apply to other potentially valuable vaccines? What can be done to increase utilisation? I submit that these are not trivial questions, not beneath the dignity of science nor beyond the range of scientific methods In the 1980s.

My remarks today are mainly concerned with trying to clarify the need for a broadened approach to the health sciences. These new frontiers involve many forms of clinical in\u00ad vestigation and the emerging field of health services research, dealing with the \"firing line\" where research advances are applied to the actual provision of health care on both an institutional and Individual level. Such investigations involve complex biological, behavioral, statistical, epidemiolo\u00ad gical, and ethical considerations. To be done effectively, they need a secure home that can do for this field what NIH has done for basic biomedical research. Who then can provide the right conditions? NIH probably could, but for reasons of its traditional strengths and boundaries, NIH is not likely to do more than a part of what needs doing. ADAMAH already does some of it and could do more. The same applies to the FDA, CDC , and perhaps other health agencies as well. The existing health agencies deserve vigorous support for their traditional missions and for some widening of their horizons. But if they cannot, or should not, do the whole Job that needs doing, another agency of comparable stature must be developed to strengthen and apply a wider range of sciences and activities to improving the nation's health. 203 -15- The NIH has not until very recently accorded a high priority to research explicitly directed toward disease and trauma pre\u00ad vention, especially in regard to the behavioral and environ\u00ad mental aspects of health. This situation has begun to change, and other agencies have taken an Interest also. But there is, in my judgment, still a long way to go. It may well be that new institutional arrangements are necessary to foster research on near-term prevention. The Institute proposed in S. 2466 could make a great contribution in this regard. Let me summarize briefly and make a concluding comment. The biomedical science effort of the United States has earned world wide respect. The principal source of new Information since World War II on the nature of living organisms has been the American life sciences community, much of which has been biomedically oriented. We now have growing concerns about finding ways in which the social utility of this great effort can be further enhanced. To do that, it is appropriate to broaden the traditional concept of biomedical sciences to in\u00ad clude centrally, not marginally, the sciences associated with public health,, with the environment, and with behavior. This broadened field may usefully be designated as the health sciences The health sciences must be concerned in a major way not only with deepening the base of fundamental knowledge, but with continuous monitoring of these advances for applications that are promising in regard to clinical problems. Moreover, arrange\u00ad ments are needed to Insure that there will be feedback loops from the clinical and social needs that can stimulate the research 204 -16- enterprlse . The entire continuum of high-quality research from basic science to clinical investigation to health services re\u00ad search should he fostered by any comprehensive national health policy. If a higher research priority Is to be assigned to work In this area, as I think It must, then we will need (a) a nationwide cadre of high-quality scientists qualified to tackle these difficult problems and (b) an ability to collaborate across disciplinary lines that exceeds most of what we have so far seen in the health sciences. To do this, we will need both extra\u00ad mural and intramural programs; work relevaat both to near- term policy problems and to long-range changes in health and society. We will need high visibility, first-class Intellec\u00ad tual leadership, a clear organizational focus for these efforts,, and the determination to persist over many years in a complex and difficult enterprise. The conditions are now exceedingly favorable to move forward expeditiously in providing the institutional arrange\u00ad ments that will truly complete the spectrum of health research and development. The chain can be made strong in all Its links during the next few years. I say this for several reasons. One Is the thoughtful, constructive, far-sighted Interest of this committee as reflected in S. 2466, I say it also because today's leadership in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare is keenly aware of these problems and ready to create new op\u00ad portunities. Dr. Richmond and his distinguished colleagues here today understand these Issues very well and are deeply committed 205 -17- to dealing with them effectively. This la also true to an unusual extent of the current heads of the health agencies In DHEW. In thia, I believe they have the keen Interest and full * backing of Secretary Califano and Undersecretary Champion. They have already taken constructive steps of which I mention two briefly: (1) the recent elevation In status of the National Center for Health Statistics and the National Center for Health Services Research; (2) the Intensive, systematic effort to focus on disease prevention throughout the entire Public Health Service; this Includes major strengthening of research relevant to pre\u00ad vention In the foreseeable future. It 16 my belief that this committee can work together with the Department of HEW in ways that will provide strong institu\u00ad tional arrangements to complete the spectrum of health sciences. This can contribute in a major way to the continuing improvement of health care, a perennial quest. It can make our health services as rational, compassionate, and science-based as is humanly possible. Although I do not believe in any single right way tb achieve such a goal, I believe that S. 2466 is a landmark pointing toward future progress in the health of our people. 28-790 0 - 78 - 14 206 Senator Kenn edy. Thank you very much, I)r. Hamburg, for a m ar\u00ad velous survey of the landscape, in terms of the types of research and the focus of research that really needs to be done. I think you gave us a perspective which made it clear and compelling, and we are very grateful to you for it. I am wondering whether you think we ought to have an additional institute on prevention. Are you suggesting that as well ? Dr. H am bu rg . Well, I do not think there is any one right way to *get at that. It is certainly conceivable. I t is plausible; indeed, to me, it is personally even attractive to have an institute sharply focused on prevention. On the other hand, we are seeing right now that Dr. Richmond, with Secretary Califano's backing, has really mobilized the entire Public Health Service first to do an inventory of what is going on in the way of prevention in various health agencies and what else they would like to do, what latent potentiality there is. And it is very im\u00ad pressive, that with this kind of leadership, you can do a great deal. And I am inclined to think tha t the prevention efforts are so per\u00ad vasive in the Public Health Service that we ought to give that effort a chance. B ut I would say, Mr. Chairman, we should keep in mind the possibility of a distinct institute for prevention, bu t let us see how the present effort goes, because it is getting the kind of leadership now tha t it has not had before. Senator K enn edy . Do you think we can get these kinds of results within the existing framework, within the NTH? I think you have already commented on it. Or, do you think that inherently\u2014as I understand their position, at least in the past, it has not had a very aggressive program into this type of factor. Yet, I think they are probably a little nervous about establishing this institute, as well. I t almost appears they want it both ways. I do not know if th at would be a fair characterization, and we will hear from them, but----- Dr. H am bu rg . The NTH is vast in scope. I t is high in qualit y; it has tremendous responsibilities and heavy burdens. The issue is whether one wants to add this whole set of responsibilities onto the Institute. A couple of years ago, I thought that was the way to go. I thought that primarily because of the very high quality of the Institute. I spent som e of the happiest years of my life there in the intramural \u00abprogram, and was an extramural beneficiary for many years at Stan\u00ad ford, so I love the place. On the other hand, I have come to feel that it is really adding too much. NIH has taken progressive steps in the last couple of years to bring the benefits of biomedical research right up to the edge of prac\u00ad tice. But for N IH to take on the whole health care system pervasively, through the communities where people live in the ways tha t I was dis\u00ad cussing, I think would be too m uch. There is a lot of concern, I think, within NIH and the scientific community that has been closest to NTH. that it would perhaps diffuse the efforts of NTH and perhaps even undermine its basic mission, if it were to take on the whole set of responsibilities delineated in vour bill. Therefore, I think the NIH itself might be better o ff not to have this additional set of tasks. Because, although the dollars involved 207 ria^h t now are small, the responsibilities are large, and ultimately I think the dollars would be large and the tasks would be very heavy. I would add, Mr. Chairman, that there is more than the NIH involved here. There certainly is much to be said for a role, a signifi\u00ad cant role, for AD AM AH, FDA. and CDC, at least those agencies, in the kind of thing we are talking about this morning. And in\u00ad evitably, however it is done, I think the Assistant Secretary and the Surgeon General will have to have a major active coordinating role, because there will be a certain healthy competition, even if the new institute is established. Senator K enne dy . Well, the question of coordination is a legitimate one . I think, for the reasons th at you outlined earlier, in terms of the visibility, the focus, the attention, it seem s to me that the institu\u00ad tional setup, at least as far as T believe, is best served by the way tha t we have outlined it in 2466 . Let me ask you, in terms of the study that you did on technology' and the need to evaluate it further, is there anything in this legisla\u00ad tion that is inconsistent with the recommendations and the findings of the institute? Dr. H am bu rg . No. Senator K ennedy . Let us put it the other way. Is it consistent with the recommendations, or do you think it helps to carry them forward? Dr. H am bu rg . Yes; T think it does. Tt seems to me\u2014 without getting into the details of it\u2014the broad thrust of this legislation would indeed be very helpful, in terms of the problems that we have identi\u00ad fie d and discussed in the Institute of Medicine studies. All T am saying is it is not the only wav. I could conceive of other ways to do it. Dr. Richmond and his colleagues make a plausible cas e. It may be that the two approaches can be combined, in fact. That, is, you can view the recent organizational arrangements in HE W as a transitional step toward the kind of institute proposed in the bill, and then the question becomes what would be the rate of the transition and what steps could be taken expeditiously to make that transition work well. Senator K ennedy . Off the record. [Discussion off the record.] Senator K ennedy . Let me just ask, on the clinical trials, do you think the center should do some clinical (rials, as well? Dr. H am bu rg . Now. which center are w e talking about ? Senator K ennedy . We are talking abo ut, the new one that we are proposing. D i. H am bu rg . Yes; T would favor that. Clinical trials have been a thorny issu e. To be done well\u2014there are very difficult scientific ques\u00ad tions and ethical questions. Wien should you start a trial\u2014when should you stop a trial. They tend to be expensive, ver y* technical problems. Tt is y cry understandable that there has been a certain amount of concern in the existing agencies about heavv commitment to tech\u00ad nical trials. That is reflected in the President' s Panel on Biomedical Research. In fact, in that report, they do not categorize clinical trials as research. But if it is not research, T do not kn oy v what it is. T t 208 migh t be some kin d of an art form . Bu t we certa inly need more clinical trials . Now, I think the N IH should and is doing a lot of clinical trials . AD AM AH is doing some and pro bab ly will do more.

D DEAN, SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, UN IVER SIT Y OF MIC HIGAN Dr . L ee. Mr. Chairma n, it is a p leasure to be here. I am very h ap py to resp ond to the com mittee's request to tes tify on the National In st i\u00ad tutes of Health Ca re Resea rch Act of 1978. I wish to make it clea r, as Dr. Ha mbu rg did , th at the testimo ny is my own and does not necessarily reflect th at of mv colleagues at the health policy pro gra m or the Un ive rsity of Ca lifornia . I will not read throug h my testimo ny in detail, but will sub mit it fo r the record, and ju st high lig ht several points in the t estimony and * the n leave it to you to ask the questions as you wish. Senator K ennedy . Fine. Dr. L ee. I think th at the act may require some minor m odific ations, such as the level of autho riz ati on for ap prop ria tio ns for health serv- ices research, bu t I wa nt to expre ss my str on g su pp or t for S. 2466. I think the prop osed revisions of the Hea lth Services, He alth Sta \u00ad tistics, and Medical Libraries Act are im agina tiv e and well thou gh t out. I believe tha t the changes p ropo sed in a uth orities and o rga niz ational str uc tur e are needed to reverse the years of neglect of health services research and health sta tistic s by the Nixon and Fo rd adminis trations. Tragica lly , despite what we have heard this mo rning, the Ca rte r admi nis tra tio n, throug h the strang leh old on the b udg et and personnel exercised by the Office of Management and Budget, is com pounding the erro rs of ea rlier ad ministrations. 209 The Ca rter ad mi nis tra tio n has proposed to cut the ap prop ria tio ns for healt h services researc h fo r fiscal 1979 to a level th at cannot pos\u00ad sibly allow the center to meet the goals establis hed by the Congress. Altho ugh the sup port for healt h sta tistics is stronger, it is s till well below w hat is needed, as D oro thy Rice po inted out th is m orn ing . F un ds are needed fo r various phases of the healt h sta tistic s pro gra ms th at are vita l to do the job tha t m ust be done. I think th at the proposal to establish a National Cente r fo r the Ev alu ation of Medical Technology is soun d, and the ap prop ria tio n autho riz ati ons there reasonable. In my testimo ny, Mr. Ch air ma n, I review some of the historical fac tors relatin g to the develop men t of th e National Ce nte r for He alth Services Research. I have been close to that development fo r the pas t decade, and I have also observed with some interest the work of the National Center for He alt h Statistics. In my testimo ny, I have described some of the thing s th at have occurre d with the new leader ship in the cen ter since 1974: The kind of policy direction th at is now being given to health servic es research, the priorities th at have been established, as well as some of the con\u00ad tribu tio ns tha t health servic es research has made, both t o health policy and to improvements in healt h care. One im po rta nt point which I make on page 7 of the testimo ny is th at the National Cente r for Hea lth Services Research has been the princ ipal su pp orter for health services research in the cou ntry. It has been and rem ains a uniq ue institut ion , because it is not con\u00ad str ain ed by the needs or the defined policies of a specific pro gra m, such as medicare or the He alt h Care Fina nc ing Ad ministratio n, with specific lim itatio ns on its au tho rity. It is possible for the National Cente r for He alth Services Research to supp ort stud ies th at question existing policies, explore new areas, and generate research th at will contr ibu te to futur e policy decisions. An example was the contr ibu tio n that the work of Dr. Lester Breslow and his associates at the Hu ma n Populat ion La bo rat ory in Ala meda County mad e to the evolution and the development of the He alt h In form ation and He alth Pro motion Act of 1976. I consider thi s act to be a piece of lan dm ark legisla tion , pro bab ly rep res enting a tu rn in g point in nat ional policy, sh ift in g from our pas t emp hasis on medical care to a more bala nced app roach. The researc h th at Dr. Breslow did was sup ported as investigator -in itiate d, without any pol\u00ad icy relevance at the time, unconstrained by any policies at the time, because the cen ter could support inv est iga tor -in itiate d research. Th at kin d of support was also pro vided the Ce nte r fo r He alt h Ad ministrat ion stud ies at the Un iversity of Chicago, un de r Dr. Odin And erso n and th at group. The Chicag o grou p have c arr ied two decades of s urvey research on the uti liz ati on of medical care services, medical care exp enditure s, and access to care. There is a recent special rep ort pub lish ed by the Rob ert Wood Joh nso n Foundation, des cribin g the results of some of th eir recent studies. Critic al to the work of the Chic ago gro up has been support from the National Ce nte r for He alth Services Research, over 10 years' time, inc lud ing supp ort of the recent study. The recent stu dy will provide all of those concerned with na \u00ad tion al health insu rance very basic da ta abou t access to care, curre nt ba rri ers to care, as well as the public's attitud e about medical care 210 and the kind of care they are receiving. Th at was the investiga tor- initiate d research wh ich will have significant imp act f or policymakers, even tho ugh it was not designed as a specific policy study. I t is the a bil ity to s up po rt th at kind o f w ork t hat is rea lly c ritica lly im porta nt for the Center. W ith all this good wor k done by the National Ce nte r for He alth Services Resea rch\u2014and I could cite a number of o the r a reas, and I do in t he te stim ony \u2014why do I think t ha t a N atio nal In stitu te f or H ealth Care Researc h should created? Wh y should the organiz ational str uctur e be changed ? I came to thi s notion ra th er slowly. Wh en I saw the Car ter admi n\u00ad istrat io n's decisions on the health services researc h bu dg et for fiscal * year 1979,1 was absolutely convinced that some ac tion h ad to be take n by the Congress to str ongly comm unicate to the ad mi nis tra tio n the importance of health service research, hea lth policy research , health statistics, and technolog y assessment. I am aware of the fact t hat t his is not an App ropriatio ns Com mit\u00ad tee hearing, M r. Chairma n, but if you look at tlie reco rd of ap pr op ria\u00ad tions in the las t 6 y ears, the ap prop ria tio ns have dwind led from $58 million to $23.8 m illion for fiscal y ear 1979. In the approp ria tio ns budget, the ad mi nis tra tio n has a figure of $31 million for health services research. Th at figure inclu des $7.2 million for personnel and oth er costs wh at I wou ld call overhead items. The re is only $23.8 million to actual ly supp ort the research of the center. Dur ing the la st 3 years, th e De pa rtm ent has included pers onnel and oth er admi nis tra tiv e costs in the ap prop ria tio ns request, so it gives, I believe, an infla ted figure when we com pare it to ea rlier figures. Senator K ennedy and it has gone ublican as well as Dem ocratic adminis trations. W ha t is the me nta lity , when we see a ll of the needs and the explo sions of costs and inflation in these oth er are as; I mean, what is th e problem there ? Dr. L ee. I think that one of the problems h as been a lack o f un de r\u00ad sta nd ing\u2014and the problem lies principa lly with the Ap prop ria tio ns Comm ittees. The re has not been a lack of supp ort in the He alth Su b\u00ad committees in either the Senate o r the House, but the A pp ropriatio ns \u00ab Com mittees have been more interested in dise ase-related researc h \u2014 cancer research , pa \u2014and the emp hasis and the payo ff th at they see from th at research. We have not been able to effectively p oint out the payoffs of health servic es research. How does health services rese arch h elp an indiivdual ? Members of the A pp ropriatio ns Com mit\u00ad tees know when disease related research has help a member of their fam ily or a member of fam ilies t hat they 'know. The benefits are very pers onal and very dem onstrable. Senator K enneoy . I suppose also, with reg ard to basically various research grants, there is some latent suspicion and pe rhaps even hos\u00ad tility tow ard that. I mean, the re should not be, but I think this gets ca ug ht up in that. And it is not only the admi nis tra tio n. OMB , of course, h as a s imilar att itu de. We were down the re and spent an hour and a ha lf with McIn tyre down there, on this very issue. And you would think th at people who were no t just listen ing to the special pleade rs \u2014and I think all of us 211 obvious ly plead som e guilt to that\u2014but people who are looking at it and have some degree to look at it from an assistance point of view, it just is incredible to m e that we cannot do better. I)r. L ee. Since 197 3, the Center has requested $1 00 million more than has been authorized by OMB. Senator K ennedy . There is no question in your mind th at it could be spent effectively, is there ? Dr. L ee. Absolutely no question in my mind, and that significant increases in the present authorizations should b e made. Groups like the University of Chicago's Center for Health Adminis\u00ad tration Studies used to rece ive continuing core support from the Na\u00ad tional Center for Health Services Research. It no longer receives that support because there is not enough money. And it is one of the best health services research groups in the country. It has made very im\u00ad portant contributions, and contributions that I think would more than pay for all the money we have put into health services research. The request by the Carter administration for this coming year is $2 3.8 million. When President Johnson established that Center, in 19 68 , he asked for $2 0 million in appropriations. And at that time, national health expenditures were $4 3 billion. This year, the Federal Government alone will spend $6 billion more than that. It would be a joke if it were not so serious. And it is unfortunate th at the issue has to be brought repeatedly to the Congress, rather than finding som e avenue within the administration to deal with it. Although Dr. Julie Richmond has made som e organizational changes and Ruth Han ft is doing a superb job helping the Center im\u00ad prove the internal management and giving greater visibility and status to both centers, is not the answer. And after hearing the testimony this morning, I am really even more enthusiastic than I was when I wrote my testimony about the proposal. I have one suggestion. I think it is an excellent proposal. I think it should be enacted promptly. Senator K ennedy . Let me ask you, though, why not do it through the current HEW system, under the wing, for example, of an Assistant Secretary and the team that is assembled, and they can give it the kind of encouragement, get it off the ground, and then spin it off a fter it has got some life to it. What is the principal trouble there ? Dr. L ee. The problem is time and priorities. If the Assistant Secre\u00ad tary for Health has to address issues of technology assessment, if he has to be involved with the details of organization, if he has to be per\u00ad sonally involved, as he obviously will have to be involved if it is in his of fic e, he simply is not going to be able to address himself to a number of the other major health policy issues that he has to be inolved in. That is why I like the idea of creating an institute, creating a direc\u00ad tor who is a Presidential appointee, and giving the Director responsi\u00ad bility to do that job. I nder those circumstances it should be possible to recruit one of the top people in the country to do the job\u2014provided it has the kind of congressional support that this would envision and that this would imply. If it was done purely by administrative action\u2014say, Secretary Cali- fa. no wants to reorganize, and he does that\u2014I think it would not bring with it the same kind of support. We know that it is difficult. The In \u00ad stitute of Child Health and Human Development is an example of a 212 congres sionally m andated institute t ha t has taken years to develop th e kind o f su pp ort th at is needed. W ith ou t th e congressional support , we really wou ld not see th e th in g fly in a viable way, even if i t were done admi nis tra tiv ely , with strong su pp ort from the Sec retary. The one suggestion I would make in the leg islation\u2014well, two rea lly\u2014one is to increase the level of autho riz ati on fo r health services research. The p ropo sed levels a re seriously below what could presently be spent very , very adeq uately, very, very so undly. Th e second suggestion relates to the tim ing or the tim etable to achieve the full development o f th e National In stitu tes o f H ealth Ca re Researc h and the ind ividual ins titute s withi n the National Ins titute s. I th in k it may take from 18 to 24 months to fully implement the legisla tive intent . I t will be necessary to g et approp ria tio ns , person nel ceilings, and to do the rec ruiting. If unrea listic expectatio ns are raised we are going to be disappoin ted a gain . Th at has been one of the problems. Ou r early exp ectatio ns for health services research exceeded what was possible to achieve. You are proposing, Mr. Chairma n, wh at we should have done in 1968; provide the kind of supp ort that is needed, link health services research and h ealth s tat istics to policy, b ut insula te them enough from the day -to-da y dem ands of the Secre tary's office , so th at they will not be politicized. I think it is a sup erb proposal, I am fully sup portiv e and certainl y will work as vigo rously as I can for its enactment. Th an k you for th e o pp ortun ity .

F r a n c is c o 214 l, Mr. Chairman an d m em be rs of the Subcommittee on Health and S cie n tific Research: I a m pleased to respond to your request to te s ti fy on the National In stitu te s o f Health Care Research Act of 19 73 [5.246 6}. I wish to mak e i t * clear th at the views I express are m y ow n and do not necessarily re fl e c t those of m y colleagues in the Health Po licy Program, School of Medicine, Univers ity of C alif orn ia , San Francisco or those of the ca mpu s or univ ers ity ad minist ratio n. Although som e deta ils of the Act m ay require m od ifica tio n, I want to express m y strong support fo r S.2466. Th e proposed re vision s in the Health Services Research, Health S ta tistics, an d Medical Lib ra ries Act (P.L. 93-353) are imaginative an d well thought out. I believe th at changes proposed in auth orities and org aniza tional structur e are needed to reverse the years of negle ct of health services research an d health s ta ti s ti c s by the Nixon and Ford Ad ministrations. T ra gic ally , the Carter Adm inistra tio n, through the strangleh old on the budget and personnel exercised by the Office of Managem ent an d Budget, is com poundin g the errors of e a rl ie r ad ministratio ns . Th e Ca rter Ad ministration has proposed to cut the ap prop ria tio n fo r the National Center fo r Health Services Research to a leve l th at cannot possibly allow i t to meet th e? goals estab lish ed by the Congress. Although the support fo r health s ta ti s ti c s is str onge r, i t is s t i l l we ll below what is needed. The proposal to es tablish a National Center fo r the Evaluation of Medical Technology is sound and the appro priation s authori ra tio n reasonable. < In m y testimony, Mr. Chairman, I w il l focus on health services an d health polic y research because I have been concerned about the development of these field s and th e ir effective ap plication for more than a decade. * 215 2. I a m more fa m ilia r with the needs and op po rtu nitie s in these fi e ld s than in health s ta ti s ti c s , although I fu ll y support your proposals regarding the crea tio n of a National In s ti tu te of Health S ta tistics and Epidemiology. H IS TO R Y A N D B A C K G R O U N D Ten years ag o in his Health an d Education Me ssage to the Congress President Johnson stated: America's annual spending fo r health an d medical care is more than $43 b il li o n . But despite th is investment our system of pro vid ing health services is not opera ting as e ffic ie n tl y and e ff e ctively as i t should. H e went on to note: Research and development could help eliminate these co nd itio ns by po intin g the wa y to better de liv ery of health care. Yet the government\u00ad wide to ta l investment in health services research amounts to less than one-te nth of one percent of our to ta l annual investment in hea lth care. Th e President directed the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to es tablish a National Center fo r Health Services Research and Development. He also recommen de d doubling the approp ria tion fo r health services research from $10 m illio n to $20 m illio n annua lly. This proposal received strong support from the Congress. In enacting the Partnership fo r Health Amen dm en ts of 19 67 (P.L. 90-174) sp eci fic au thor ization was provided fo r the support of health services research an d development. A fter ca reful planning, the National Center fo r Health Services Research and Development was establish ed on M ay 2, 1968 during m y tern as As sis tant Secretary fo r Health an d S c ie n tific A ff a ir s. Although the Center was estab lished in 1968, i t was not u n ti l 19 74 th at i t was 216 3. provided a sp ecific statu to ry base. With the passage of the Health Services Research, Health S ta ti s ti c s , and Medical Libr ar ies Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-353), the Cencer was required to meet ce rtain conditio ns and ca rry out ce rta in specific programs. I Unfortuna tely, ne ith er the Ford nor the Carter Ad minist ratio n has requested the funds or the po sitio ns nee ded to do the job adequately. Th e law sp ec ifies th at the Center must use not les s than 25 percent o f it s annual ap prop ria tion to conduct intramural rese arch. This was very sound judgment and in the long run w il l do more to strengthen the quality o f the health serv ices research supported by the Center than any othe r sing le step th at can be taken. Th e second Congressional manda te required th at the Center support at le ast si x special emphasis hea lth services research cente rs, to ta ll y independent of the Federal government. O ne of these centers must concentrate on health care technology and another on manag ement. (In 1975, Congress added a center fo r health services polic y analy sis to the li s t of special emphasis centers.) The th ird requirement of P.L. 93-353 is that no mo re than 20 gra nts , or $5 m illio n , m ay be used in any one year to study a partic ula r aspect of health se rvice s. In ad dition, a ll grants an d contrac ts invo lving dir ect costs in excess of $35,000 must be reviewed fo r s c ie n ti fi c merit by groups of non-Federal expe rts . F in ally,, the Congress gave the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, an d Welfare e x p li c it auth ority to support hea lth services research tr ain in g. This is a most needed auth ority , but the Ad ministration has refused to request funds to implement the needed train in g programs. 4With th is ne w Congressional mandate and new leadership in the National Center fo r Health Services Research (N CH SR ), the d iffic u lt job of transl ating Congressional po lic y into mo re useful re su lts was begun in 1974. W hen w e 217 4. fi r s t estab lished the Center in 1953, w e m ade a , serious mistake: w e trie d to isola te the Center from the day-to-day de man ds of polic y makers. W e f e lt th at the nation would be best served i f the Center supported health services research in an independent fashion, with ou t regard fo r the inmediate polic y problems th at w e faced, such as the ra pid ly inc reasing costs of medical care. There were a numbe r of people, includ ing m y deputy Dr. George S ilve r, who fe lt th at ju s t the opposite course should hav e bee n taken. In re tros pe ct, i t is clea r that w e should hav e done what th is Subcommittee is no w proposing \u2014 lin k the N C H S R and the National Center fo r Health S ta tistics to the health polic y process, but provide an effective buffer from the immediate de man ds by polic y makers fo r short-term polic y analyses. During the past three years the s ta ff of the N C H S R has designed an d implemented a research planning process th at is responsive to the po lic y nee ds of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and Congress. I t cannot possibly me et these needs, however, with cu rren t leve ls of support. Th e research planning process developed by the N C H S R is issue oriented . Th e purpose is to id e n tify c rit ic a l health care problems, to form ulate the research questions relevant to those problems, and to design research stra tegies fo r gathering and analyzin g the inform ation pe rtinent to questions th at polic y makers might find us eful. M A JO R R E S E A R C H A R E A S A N D PO LIC Y IM P A C T Th e N C H S R s research program is organized to address sp ecfic hea lth services deliv ery problems. Major areas, such as long term care, primary care, and the ap plication of technology are a ll addressed w ithin the targeted or applied program areas. Th e eig ht issues th at hav e em erg ed as areas of special emphasis are: 218 5. (1) Infl a ti o n and P ro ductivity; (2) Health Ma npower; (3) Em erg ency Medical Services; (4) Health Care and the Disadvantaged; Health.Insu rance Plans; (6) Qua lity of Care; (7) Planning and Regulation Methods; an d * (8) Long-term Care. In each of these broad areas sp ecific issue's are being addressed. For example, in the area of health man po wer one of the goals is to - develop mo re re liable techniques to estimate the adequacy of manpower supply, and the need, as well as the de man d, fo r health se rvices . Further research in th is area is c rit ic a l and must include stu dies of the ef fe cts of national health insurance on the de m an d fo r se rvice s. Research supported by the M C H S R in the fie ld of hea lth man po we r has muc h more cle arly id entified the needs in the area of dental hea lth ma npower; i t has provided m uch of the support fo r the pioneering work in the development of nurse pra ct itio ners and physicia ns as sistan ts; i t has provided c r it ic a ll y nee ded inform ation to the Congress on Foreign Medical Graduate (F M G s) during the de lib era tio ns on the Health Professions Educational Assistance Act of 1976 (P.L. 94-484); and i t is improving an understanding of fac tors affecting georgra phic and sp ecialty m ald is trib utio n. In m y judgment, the ultim ate cos t savings in medical care expenditures that w il l re sult from the decision o f the Congress to re s tric t the entry of F M G s in to the United States w il l exceed a ll the federal \u00ab expenditures to date fo r hea lth services research. Within the large category \"health insurance plans\" the pre sent N C H S R plan calls fo r special study of the po tential cost and impact o f the catastroph ic * 219 6. insura nce pr ov isions , and fo r the inve st ig atio n of na tural experiments invo lving health insurance be ne fit changes, such as the ad ditio n of co-insurance or deductible s to a group prac tice prepayment pla n. Th e pot en tia l usefulness of th is inform ation to polic y makers is apparent. Research and analy sis on the effectiven es s of emergency medical services continues to be a high p rio rit y . Studies are examining specific procedures or methods o f emergency care as we ll as altern ative m ea ns of org anizin g and deliv ering these services. As gra nt requests in th is area are reviewed stu die s th at hav e broad a p p lica b ilit y are given p rio rit y , provided th at they meet the standards of s c ie n ti fi c merit se t by the study sections. To o often proposals are submitted th at are re a lly loca l service demonstrations; the ch ara cte ristics of hospitals or other in s ti tu ti o n s involved as we ll as the communities are s u ff ic ie n tl y unique to mak e the re su lts of l i t t l e value outside of the part ic ula r community. In it s program s o li c it a ti o n fo r emergency medical services research, the tIC H S R had stress ed four areas: (1) measures of effectiven es s; (2) system de sc rip tio ns an d re la tionsh ip s; (3) polic y issues; an d (4) technique.^ and devices. Th e be ne fits of th is research w il l be not only in terms of be tter polic y decisions and mon ey saved, but also in terms of better services fo r people who desperately ne ed i t . Tw o areas are p a rt ic u la rl y imp ortant \u2014 emergenc y care fo r the se rio us ly injured an d emergency care fo r those with acute medical emergencies, such as heart attack , gastroin te stinal hemorrhage, and drug overdose. There are a numb er of oth er areas in which the work ca rried out or supported by the N C H S R has been of c rit ic a l importance in health po lic y 220 7* de lib era tio ns, in the enactment of important pieces of health le g is la tio n , in the operation of federal programs, and in the improvement of health services in a broad sense. Since the fIC H S R was establish ed in 1968, i t has been the princ ipal * sup porter of health services research. I t has been, and remains, a unique in s ti tu ti o n because i t is not constrained by the needs or the defined polic ie s of a specific program, such as Medicare. I t is po ssible fo r the N C H S R to support studies th at question exist in g polic ie s, exp lore ne w areas, an d generate research th at w il l co ntrib ute to futu re polic y de cis ions. A c rit ic a l s h if t in fed eral health po lic y began with enactment of the Health Inform ation and Health Promotion Act of 19 76 (P.L. 94-317). Although a num ber of people contributed to the de lib er ation and evalu ation of th is le g is la tio n , an imp orta nt co ntributio n w as m ade by Dr. Lester Breslow an d his associates at the H um an Population Laboratory in Ala meda County, C alif orn ia . Th e work of th is group demonstrated very cle arly the role of specific behaviors associated with good hea lth an d longevity . For almost a decade th is work was supported by the N C H S R . As a re sult of th is work an d th at of a few others the v it a l importance of behavior and so cial support networks to hea lth is beginning to be recognized. Th e Health Inform ation an d Health Promotion Act of 19 76 (P.L. 94-317) w as to provide the st atu to ry auth ority for Secretary of He alth, Education, and Welfare Ca lifano to launch his campaign to be tter inform young people, pregnant wom en , an d the general pu blic of the hazards to health associated with cigare tte smoking. I t has also provided the impetus fo r an exp anded 4 approach to disease pre vention. In the years to co m e P.L. 94-317 m ay be viewed as the rea l beginning of a s h if t in national health polic y from an excessive relia nc e on medical care to a more balanced approach inclu ding 221 8. healt h promotion and health pr otec tio n. A s h if t in po lic y of les ser po tential magnitude, but probably of mo re immediate fisca l impact, was represented by the Medicare and Medicaid Am en dm en t regarding Rural Health C lin ic s Services (P.L. 95-210), which perm its paym ent of nurse pra ct itio ners and physicians as sis tants under Medicare and Medicaid. The repo rt prepared fo r the Congress by the Congressional Research Service, \"Issues in Physician Extender Reimbursement,\" * pointed out th at services by physician extenders were cost effe ctive, did not compromise q u a lity , and were acceptable to consumers. Th e an alys is was draw n la rg ely from research supported by the N C H S R . Tw o areas th at w il l be of v it a l concern to polic y makers in the future \u2014 health outcomes of medical care and health inform ation systems \u2014 are in d if fe re n t stages of development. Health outcom e stu die s have been pioneered by John Williamson at Johns Hopkins and Robert Brook at the Unive rsity of C alif orn ia , Los Angeles. Rather than ana lyzin g the process of care or the stru cture of the health care system, they are designing measures of the qualit y of care. These stu dies, an d others lik e them, w il l be of increa sing Importance in future decisions about cost/qualit y trade-o ffs. Health inform ation systems represent another area o f grea t promise. Although developmental costs se em high in the short run, these systems have the pot en tia l fo r gre at savings in the fu tu re . For example, the Technicon System in use at El Ca mino Hospital in Californ ia could re sult in savings in excess of one b il li o n do lla rs per year i f i t were use d in ho sp itals throughout the United Sta tes. That w il l give you so m e idea of the pot en tia l value of these systems. This system is no w being tested in a h a lf dozen ho sp ita ls , but present reimbursement methods provide l i t t l e ince ntive fo r ho sp ita ls to in s ta ll such systems. A system with far-r ea ch ing pot en tia l 4 28 -790 0 - 78 - 15 222 9. for medical care is the P R O M IS system under study at the Univers ity of Vermont Medical Center in Bu rling ton, Vermont. Th e development of these inno vative systems has been m ade possible by support from the H C H S R . Th e work of the Center fo r Health Ad ministration Stud ies, Un iver sity Aof Chicago, deserves special co mmen t because i t ha s provided a model fo r the development of m ultid is cip lin ary health services research ce nter. Und er the direction of Dr. Odin Anderson, the Center has conducted basic studies e- on the u ti li z a ti o n of medical care service s, medical care expenditures , and access to care. In th e ir boo k Tw o De cade s of Health Se rvices: Social Survey Trends in Use s and Expenditures, Anderson, Lion , Andersen sum marize the re su lts of th e ir 1956, 1963, 19 67 and 19 70 surveys. In an appendix, they l i s t six pages of places, inclu ding books, papers, hearings, in which the 1970 survey data has been used. W e have rece ntly use d th e ir expenditure data to estimate expenditures fo r pr es criptio n drugs by age and income group in our analysis of options fo r the coverage o f pre sc ription drugs under national health insurance. That an alys is, by Milton Silverman an d Mia Lyd eck er ,in cide nt ally, was rece ntly published by the N C H S R . So on to be published by the Center fo r Health Ad ministra tio n Studies are the re su lts of th e ir recent national survey of access to medical care. This survey was supported by the N C H S R and the Robert W ood Johnson Foundation. I would li k e to submit fo r the record a b ri e f su mmary of the preliminary an alysis re ce ntly published by the Robert W ood Johnson Foundation (Attachment). 4 223 io. I would c it e a numb er of other areas in which imp ortant co ntrib utions have been m ade by health serv ices research: economic determinants of medical care, inclu ding incentive s fo r ho sp itals and physicians; performance of health maintenance orga nizations; improved methodologies to assess outcom es of patient care; hospital cost accounting systems; and computer assisted ele ctrocardiogram s, but I think that a de taile d account of these co ntrib utions is not necessary at th is time. W H Y A N ATIO N AL IN ST ITUTE F O R H E A LTH C A R E R E S E A R C H ? W hy , i f the N C H S R is doing so wel1 and health services research is making important co ntrib utions to health polic y an d health care, do I support the National In stitu te s of Health Care Research Act of 1978, which would s ig n ific a n tly a lt e r present ad ministra tiv e arrangements, exp and the auth ority of the National Center fo r Health S ta ti s ti c s , and add a new National Center fo r Evaluation of Medical Technology?

I did not reach m y conclusions quick ly. I n itia lly , I was not in favo r of another cha nge in organiz ation al arrangement. I f e lt th at the exis ting auth orities should be maintained, th at a technology assessment func tio n should be added to the N C H S R , an d that both Centers should be given increased au thorizations .

Mr. Chairman, I know th a t th is is no t the appro priations com mittee, but the budget o f the N C H S R does reveal a gr eat deal ab ou t the Car te r A dm in is tr ation 's understandin g o f he alth se rvices rese ar ch . While es tim at ing a $4.4 b illio n increa se in Medicare ex pe nditu res and a more than $1.1 b illio n increa se in Medicaid ex pen ditu re s, the y propose to cut the fun ds allo cate d to the N C H S R by $2 m il li o n . Since F Y 1973 the re has been a ste ady drop in the funds allocate d to the N C HSR: F Y 1973 $53 m il li o n F Y 1974 $37.9 m il li o n F Y 1975 $35.9 m il li o n ($8 m il li o n wa s reprogrammed by D H E W ) F Y 1976 $26 m il li o n F Y 1977 $24 m il li o n FY 1978 $26 m il li o n FY 1979 $23.8 m il li o n In the pa st thre e years the Department o f H ealth, Edu ca tio n, and W elfare budget has includ ed personnel and ot her ad m in is tr a tive co sts as pa rt o f the N C H S R budget. Thus in FY 1979 the A dm in is tr ation lis t s a fi g u re o f $31 m il li o n fo r the NCHSR, but $7.2 m il li o n o f th is amount re pr es en ts overhead. As the appro priation fo r researc h sh rin ks, the overhead re la ti v e to to ta l ex pe nd itu re ri se s. Since 1973, the N C H S R has requested $100 m il li o n more than has been approved by 0M8. Even the N C H S R requ es ts were modest in view o f the needs and o p p ort unitie s. 225 12. The figure of $23.8 m illio n in F Y 19 79 must be contras ted with the $20 m illio n proposed by President Johnson fo r the F Y 19 68 budget. You w il l re ca ll that to ta l national hea lth care expenditures in 1968 were $43 b il li o n ; in F Y 19 77 fed era l health expenditures exceeded th at figure by $6.6 b il li o n and national health expenditures had risen to $160.6 b il li o n . In F Y 19 79 to ta l fed era l health expenditures w il l exceed $63' b il li o n , Mr. Chairman. The N C H S R ap prop ria tion request by the Carter Ad ministratio n would be a joke i f i t were not such a serious mistake in judgment. Th e Congress must take dramatic steps to reverse this decision and give health s ta ti s ti c s , hea lth services research, health po lic y research, and the evalu ation of medical technologies the p rio rit y that they deserve, rather than allow them to be relegate d to a state of malignant negle ct. Doe s the proposal to es tablish the National In stitu te s of Health Care Research solve the problem? F ir s t, does i t mak e sense conceptually? Are health services research an d health polic y research re a lly linked? I f so, what is the connection? W H A T IS H E A LTH S ER V IC ES A N D H E A LT H POLI CY R E S E A R C H ? Research at the most basic end of the spectrum is us ua lly described as \"d is cip lin e \" or \"conclusion oriented \" research. Th e aim is to te st hypotheses and arriv e at ce rta in conclusions about what is , descriptively , the state of a ff a ir s . This type of research is designed to co ntrib ute to knowledge in a sub stantive area an d to co ntrib ute to theory as w ell. This research ty p ic a lly lacks a problem focus and us ua lly employs the s k il ls , methodology, and approach of one d is cip lin e. Although the fin ding s from th is type of dis cip lin e research can co ntrib ute to the id e n ti fi ca ti o n an d eventual so lu tio n of problems, th is ap plication is not contemplated by the 226 13. inve stigator. Health services research nig ht be described as the next step along the continuum. Health services research ha s an applied focus, i t is usually problem oriented, an d almost always involves the s k il ls of more than on e dis ciplin e. The scope of health services research spans anthropology, epidemiology, economics, sociology, bioengineering, systems ana lysis, psychology, medicine, an d m an ag em en t sciences. I t is prim arily concerned with problems in the organization, fina ncing, sta ffin g, u ti liz a ti o n , regulation , an d outco me of health services-. I t can be distinguished from biomedical research, which is related direct ly to normal biolo gical or behavorial processes or disease processes. Th e problem orientation of health services research brings i t on e step beyond disc iplin e research in the research spectrum. Although health services research m ay contribute to the discipline s involved an d i t m ay be useful in solving som e sp ec ific problems related to health services, i t is usually of very lit t le aid in health policy formation because the research questions are usually formulated without sp ec ific policy questions in mind. Health services research can be policy rele vant i f the research is designed to investigate factors am en ab le to policy manipulation, i f the quality of the research is such tha t i t m ay increase the likelihoo d of be tte r policy outcom es, an d i f the information is available in time to contribu te to policy decisions. Health policy research deals with a wide range of bio logical, behavioral, environmental, and sociocultural fac tors, including health care, tha t affect the health status of individuals an d populations. Unlike health services research, i t involves prim arily a synthesis an d analysis of information relevant to specific policy problems. Policy research attempts 227 14. to synthesize and in te rp re t fin ding s th at are re leva nt to a polic y problem, draw out im plic atio ns , an d m ak e recommendations fo r polic y conside ration . Po licy analy sis brin the process one step clos er to the decis ion making process. The aim of polic y analy sis is to permit improvements in decisio n making and polic y making by pe rm itting ca reful co ns ideration of a broad set of altern atives. Po lic y researchers must have a mo re refin ed ap prec iatio n of the polic y process than inve stigator s undertaking polic y- re le va nt health services research. Th e a b il it y of po lic y researchers to synthesize and in te rp re t fin ding s in li g h t of polic y problems must be matched with an a b il it y to tran slate inform ation in to a form th at is understandable and use ful in the world in which polic y makers operate. C O N C LU S IO N Th e proposed National In stitu te s of Health Care Research Act (S.2466) forges a strong connection betwee n health services research and health polic y research. S om e might prefer that you not change the na m es o f the National Center fo r Health S ta tistics an d the Nation al Center fo r Health Services Research, but m ak e cle ar in both the language of the b ill and in the Committee Report what is the in te nt of the Congress. Pe rson ally, I a m not fe arful th at the cha nges you are proposing w il l re su lt in a neglect of health services research o r the train in g of health services rese archers. Th e proposal to es tablish a National Center fo r Evaluation of Medical Technology separate from the N C H S R , but w ithin the framework o f the National In stitu te s of Health Care Research, also mak es a grea t deal of sense. Th e need fo r evalu ation fa r exceeds our present methodologies or ca pa citie s, but w e must undertake a major e ff o rt in the fi e ld or the problems w il l loom even larg er an d more complex. There are two prom ising signs th at progress can and w il l be m ade with the ri g h t leadership and orga niza tio n: the work in the health fi e ld by the Office of Technology Assessment and the stud ies undertaken by the Center fo r the Ana lysis of Health Pra ctices , School of Public Health, Harvard Unive rsity . A beginning has bee n m ade in studies of expensive technologies an d coronary care units, bu t muc h more must be done. To do i t rig h t, however, req uires careful planning and step-by-step development. H ow can the goals defined in the proposed Nation al In stitu te s of Health Care Research Act (.S-2466) best be accomplished? I fu ll y support the proposal and view i t as an important, indeed, a c rit ic a l step by the Congress in firm ly es tablishing health services research , health po lic y research, health s ta ti s ti c s , and technology assessment as areas of high p rio rit y . Th e goals an d plans fo r reorganization set fo rt h in the Act cannot,, however, be achieved ov ernigh t. As one who played an imp orta nt ro le in a major overhaul of the health program s in the Department of He alth, Education, an d Welfare in the la te 1960's, I a m fu ll y cognizant o f the d if fic u lt ie s ; the disadvantages, and the loss of program m om en tu m th at ofte n occur during the process of organiz ation al change. H e have fi rs t- c la s s leadersh ip in the Department, part ic u la rl y in the health fie ld . Dr. Ju liu s Richmo nd is one of our most able and most se ns itive he alth-le ad ers. H e has rece ntly brought both the N C H S R and the National Center fo r Health S ta ti s ti c s in to a direct re la tionship with his o ff ic e . Th e Directo rs of both Centers re po rt to M s. Ruth Ha nft, his superb and extraord in arily able Deputy fo r Health Policy, Research, an d S ta ti s ti c s . She ha s already in stitu te d measures to improve the analy tic capacity of the National Center fo r Health S ta tistics and to strengthen the planning an d performance of the N C H S R . I a m very m uch 229 16. impressed with what she is doing to gain support fo r these a c ti v it ie s w ithin the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, the Congress, and 0M B. What Dr. Richmo nd has done and what Ms. Ha nft is doing are steps toward the crea tio n of the National In stitu te s o f Health Care Research. As pa rt of the le gis la tion perhaps you can inc lude a tim etab le to achieve the proposed org aniza tional changes. I would suggest 18-24 months from the date of enactment of the Act to the fu ll development o f the National In stitu tu es fo r Health Care Research. This would provide the time fo r adequate funds and new po sitions to be provided fo r the D irect or's o ff ic e as we ll as fo r the sta ffin g and development of the National Center fo r Evaluation of Medical Technology, under the guidance of the proposed National In s ti tu te s . In sum mary, Mr. Chairman, I a m impressed by the quality of the work supported by the N C H S R and the National Center fo r Health S ta tistics and by the importance of so m e of th is work in improving health care and health polic y. I fu ll y support the proposal embod ied in the National In stitu te s of Health Care Research Act of 19 78 (S.2466). I have suggested th at a pha sed care fu lly planned tr ansitio n over an 18-24 month period would be the best mea ns to es tablish the National In stitu te s of Health Care Research. Robert Wood Johnson Found ation Special Rep ort A New Survey on Access to Medical Care America's Health System: A Portrait 4 Leading Indicators 8-9 Health Opinions of the U.S. Population 14 NumberOne/1978 231 Foreword Americ ans of all a ges, of all r ace s, at all income levels have grea ter access to health care services than ever before. And by and large, individually, they are pleased with the care they receive . That is the sim ple and encouraging message contained in a repor t of a national survey now being co mplet ed. At the same time, a significant majority of Americans a lso say they believe there is a health care crisis in this count ry. Why this seeming para dox? Politicians, health care profe ssiona ls, and policy anal ysts will have this and othe r riddles to dissec t when the findings of a national survey of access to medical c are are published late in 1978. Th e s tudy is more than a compilation of statistics; it seeks to pinpoint and measure significant f actors that determ ine whet her or not people obtain the medical care they need. The Robert Wood Joh nson F oundation has supported this s tudy in the belief that a clea r and comprehen sive under stand ing of these factors is essential for a large national philanthropy con ductin g a highly targeted program to assist those seeking ways to improve America's health care system. Obviously, other institutions and grou ps\u2014both public and priv ate\u2014share an interest in this aspect of the $ 140-billio n a year health enter prise . When published, this study will prese nt a comp rehensive portrait of the nation's health system from the persp ectiv e of tho se it se rves. One of its principal uses will be to identify areas that need a ttent ion. It also can serve as a benchmark so that fu ture changes in the sy stem 's perfor manc e can be observ ed and measu red. At the same time, it reveals much about toda y's world as well. Special Report Nu mb er One/1978 3 232 America's Health Care System: A Comprehensive Portrait Ho w the nation's 220,000,000 peo ple obtain their m edi cal care (an d what t hey think a bout it) is p rob ed in a new survey. It reveals tha t barriers are tumbling, mo st pa tie nts are s atisfied, but c ost remains an overriding concern . In the world of business, a variety of indica\u00ad tors reflect the ups and dow ns of economic activity. Selected separa te indicators, for ex\u00ad amp le, comprise the Consumer Price Inde x, Dep artm ent of Labor employm ent statistics, Dow Jones stock average s, and othe rs. Magazines such as Business Week and U.S. Ne ws and World Rep ort each have identified certain indicators which they believe reflect the state of the nation's economy. Business Weeks 's includes net tons of steel, kilowatt hours of electricity, freight c ar loadings, board feet of lumbe r, wheat prices in Kan sas City, gold prices in Londo n, the prime inte rest rate, the Federal Reserve money supply, housing sta rts, and many othe rs. Fo r businessmen, governmen t officials, econom ists, ba nke rs, and investo rs, such indi\u00ad cators are considered essential to decision making. They tell where the economy of the nation is going, and they guide and influence those who have a hand on the tiller. In the business of hea lth, too, a variety of specialized statistics show how some parts of the system are performing c urre ntly: the infant mo rtality rate has d ecreased in the last five years by 19 percent more than 230 million days of care are rendered to 29 million patients admitted to hospitals each year health exp enditures total 8.6 percen t of the gross national pro duc t\u2014$140 billion annually federal Medicaid pay ments to states totalalmost three- qua rters of a billion dollars each month the ratio of docto rs to popu latio n has in\u00ad creased from 139 per 100,000 in 1960 to 16 2 in 1976. Analysis of these statist ics, how ever, only skirts the fringes of a central question: is health c are available to th ose who need it, a nd what kind of barriers must be overcom e to obtain care? In the jarg on of health policy ana lysts, this crucial issue goes by the phrase acce ss to care . In \" people terms ,\" how ever, acc ess trans\u00ad lates into a multitude of factors which togethe r determine whether or not persons obtain the irtedical care they nee d. Is a docto r available? How far away is the docto r's office? How long is the trip? How long doe s it take to get an appointmen t? How much time does the doctor spend with the patient? How much does the visit cost? How will the bill be paid? Was the patient satisfied with what the do cto r did? There is about to be completed a study which identifies these and other important factors\u2014in dicators\u2014bearing on access. One of its purpo ses is the develo pment of sta ndard means for consistent measure men t of these indicators. The national survey of acc ess to medical care was carried out by the Cen ter for Health Administration Studies of the University of Chicago.' The field work was conducted by the University's National Opinion Research I. Principals in the study are: Lu Ann Aday, study director: Ronald Andersen, principal investigator, and Gretchen Voorhis Fleming and Grace Chiu, assistant study directors, all of the Center for Health Administration Studies, University o f Chicago, 57 20 Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60637.

It is based on a sample of 7,787 persons and is statistically representative of the U. S. population. The study focuses on many factors believed to affect access for the entire population. Moreover, data for each indicator can be examined for sub-groups of the total popula\u00ad tion\u2014 sub-groups defined by of important age; sex; race; income; region of the country; suburban, urban, and rural residence; and education levels. (For a graphic representation, see chart on pp. 8-9.) As a bonus, certain parts of the survey are comparable w ith other projects carried out in 19 63 and 1970, so some trends can be seen. The survey generated large amounts of data and the ana lytic task facing the investigators has been form idable. The challenge: out of all the informa tion available, identify those par\u00ad ticular indicators which appear to be most significant in determining access for the total population and fo r sub-groups as well. In a number-oriented society, nothing makes a problem come alive so much as the measurement of it. Walter Lippman, a half century ago, said: \" The printin g of compara\u00ad tive statistics of infant mo rtality is often followed by a reduction of the death rate of babies . . . the statistics make them visible, as visible as if the babies had elected an alderman to air their grievances.\"2 Grievances, indeed, have been aired about America's health system: its cost, and its accessibility to such groups as min orities, rural and inner city residents, and the aged. Attempts have been made to fix deficiencies. Medicare and Medicaid are examples. The new University of Chicago study prom \u00ad ises to provide abundant information enabling an assessment of the impact of these and newer health initiatives. This info rmation will give new currency to the debates which shape changes in the nation' s health laws\u2014 ranging from recommendations of seeming m inor con\u00ad sequence to the sweeping changes implicit in proposals for national health insurance. Professional organizations, Congress, state legislatures, and other groups will be able to evaluate the relative needs of population groups believed to have particular problems obtaining medical care. Sim ilarly, over time, these data may define the nature of the so- called crisis in American health care.The study' s principal strength derives from its attempt to go beyond the raw numbers and to interpret and analyze what they mean. This process is now underway by principal investigator Ronald Andersen, 38-year-old sociologist, and his colleagues at Chicago. Ahead lie many more computer runs and much more analysis. Nevertheless, Andersen declares flatly that the wo rk \" . . . provides a comprehensive and timely baseline for inform \u00ad ing the current debates over national health policy options intended to impact\u2014 directly or ind irectly\u2014 on access to medical care in the United States.\" Traditional Health Indicators in Perspective Much past analysis of the subject of access has focused on counting doctors (with sug\u00ad gested remedies concentrating on increasing the supply of physicians) and has emphasized mortality and m orb idity statistics. But the first approach is akin to analyzing the energy shortage only by counting com er gas stations. And the la tter falls short because trad itional mortality and mo rbidity statistics fail to reflect adequately much that the health system does. A health care system provides useful out\u00ad comes other than prevention and cure\u2014 reas\u00ad surance and encouragement, for example. As Walsh McDermott puts it: \" Medicine is . . . not a science but a learned profession that attempts to blend affairs of the spirit and the cold objec tivity o f science. Everything the physician does, therefore, is a blend of tech\u00ad nology and samaritanism. By samaritanism is meant that collection of acts, big and little , that lends reassurance or at least gives support to someone troubled by disease or illness.\"3 To illustrate, the clinical capability of pin\u00ad ning broken hips among the injured eld erly has not changed the nation's gross m ortality statis\u00ad tics, but it has increased the utilization of medical services and it contribu tes substan\u00ad tia lly to improving the quality of these pa\u00ad tients' lives. Sim ilarly, take the case o f a woman visiting a physician because of a lum p in her breast. A diagnosis which reveals the lump is benign does not show up in mo rbidity statistics, but that diagnosis represents a major benefit to the patient. It is statistical intangibles such as these\u2014 Publication of the final report is expected late in 19 78 .

The Study: Who Gets What Care The national survey investigates five principal dimensions impinging on access to care: source of care, convenien ce of care, actual utilization of care, the need for care, and the patient's satisfaction with care received. It examines all in considerable detail. In the 19 76 survey year, 76 percent of the population\u2014160,000 ,000 \u2014saw a doctor. The percentage of infants and small children seeing a physician was highest: 87 percent. The percentage declines sharply in the middle and late years of childhood, then climbs slowly through the adult years to a level of 79 percent for those 65 or older. The report's most significant findings show that the population at large\u2014and every sub\u00ad population group studied\u2014has better access to medical services today than in 19 70 or 196 3. There are some instances of dramatic change. Chart 1 shows the improvement experienced by blacks since 19 63 in one important measure: percentage seeing a physi\u00ad cian at least once in the previous year. And Chart 2 shows how the gaps between persons of different income levels have narrowed, though discrepancies continue. \"These trends,\" says Andersen, \"corre\u00ad spond to those which might be expected as a result of the implementation of Medicaid and Medicare in 19 66 . Medicaid and most health center programs begun since 19 63 were de\u00ad signed to serve the low income population of all ages.\" The removal of financial barriers appears to have major impact on whether or not various groups have access to care. Whereas physi\u00ad cian utilization by low and medium income groups has moved closer to that for the upper income group (Chart 2), the same narrowing of utilization has not occurred for dentist visits (Chart 3). Andersen concludes: \" . . . dental services are least apt to be covered by existing financing mechanisms and it is this service for which the greatest inequities in use by family income and race . . . continue to persist.\" The study places special emphasis on whether or not persons surveyed indicated they had a regular physician or regular sourceof care. Previous studies have shown a strong correlation between having a physician and seeking medical service when illness occurs. More than 78 percent of the population claim to have a physician they see regularly; another 9 plus percent report a regular source of care (e.g., a clinic), but without identifying a particular physician. That leaves almost 1 2 percent who have neither a physician nor a regular source of care. Andersen speaks frankly of this group: \"Though this may appear to represent a small proportion overall, it means that there are actually an estimated 24 millio n people who can identify no particular place or provider as their regular point of entry to the health care system.\" The survey data reveal that low income groups, urban blacks and Spanish heritage persons in the Southwest were less apt than whites to have their own doctor. And for all races, persons below the poverty level were less likely to have a regular source of care than those above. Other findings include: 1 1 percent of the population spent at least one day in the hospital in the survey year 52 percent had a physical exam 49 percent saw a dentist rural farm dwellers were less likely than city residents to see a physician low income Spanish heritage persons were least likely of all ethnic groups to see a physician most persons can reach their regular source of care within 30 minutes blacks, when in their doctor's office, wait longer to see a physician than whites city residents use specialists more frequent\u00ad ly than other groups rural residents and farmers make greatest use of general/family practitioners 64 percent of the population can obtain a doctor's appointment within two days; 8 per cent have to wait more than 2 weeks. Moving Toward A Measure of M edical Need Although the survey's findings clarify the picture of access to health care for different population groups, a central and intriguing question remains: are people really getting the medical care they need?

While a sm all gap in physician utiliza tio n remains between blacks and whites, it has closed dram atically since 1970. The Chicago researchers report tha t the largest gains were made in areas o f the central city. Chart 2 Percentage o f High , Me dium, and Low Income Groups Seeing a Physician in a 12-Mo nth PeriodA com parison by incom e shows how low income groups have increa sed their use o f phy sician services.

Chart 3 Percentage of High, Me dium, and Low Income Groups Seeing a Den tist in a 12- Mo nth PeriodThe impact o f insurance is revealed in this chart showing the percentage o f the population seeing a dentist. For all incom e levels, the utilization o f dentists is lower than fo r physicians. An d the gaps between high, medium, and low income groups in 1976 are n ot signific antly different from 1963. One reason: 88 per cent o f the popula tion have some fo rm o f medical insurance: only 18 pe r cent have dental insurance.

This approach, they say, \"re fle cts the d ifference between the number o f people with a given mix of symp\u00ad toms who contact a physician at least once for the symptoms and the num ber that a panel of medical professionals say should contact a docto r for the s ym pto ms .\" To develop this measure, the research team asked a panel o f medical school physicians to determine fo r a variety o f symptoms an appropriate level o f medical care that could be considered standard. They did it this way. Each doctor partic ipating in the panel was asked \" to estimate, based on his training and experience, how many people out of 10 0 manifesting a certain sym ptom should see a docto r fo r it .\" Fo r example, frequent head\u00ad aches are considered to be a symptom requir\u00ad ing the atte ntio n of a physician in nearly all cases for young children, less freque ntly among adults. The study group then compared this stan\u00ad dard with the actual experiences reported by the tota l pop ulation and specific sub-sets of the pop ulation . The result: based on 19 76 data, virtu ally all groups saw doctors more often than the panel o f doctors estimated should be the case. To refine the technique fur ther, a second group of doctors was impaneled consisting this time of com munity-based, prima ry care physicians from throug hou t the nation \" . . . since a non-academic group was thought to be more representative overall of U.S . primary care phys ician s.\" 4 This panel provided the criteria necessary to deve lop a second sym ptom index. The doctors analyzed 22 sym ptoms, including headaches, rash, diarrhea, heart pain, weight loss, and \" tired mornings,\" and, as before, estimated a standard. The community-based panel of physicians recommended that pa\u00ad tients see physicians more frequently than the original panel. Arm ed with this second inde x, the research team compared it once again with the actual experiences reported by the pop ulation and 4. The prim ary care physician panel consisted of 36 physicians fro m th e follo wing ob-gyn are to be in cluded in fu ture w ork on this measure. The o rig inal panel of physicians included 40 Unive rsity o f Chicago medical faculty from these specialities : interna l By this measure, the total pop ulation sees physicians 6 percent less frequently than recommended. (Results of the second panel are inc orporated in the chart showing leading indicato rs o f access, pp. 8-9.)* Andersen is the first to caution that these data must be interpreted with care, so as to avoid incorrec t conclusions. He points out that the physician panels provided judgments only at a general level, not at an individual, patient-specific level. Further, the experiment covers only a segment of an individ ual's overall medical care needs. Patients undoubt\u00ad edly vis it their d octors at times simply fo r the reassurance provided. Andersen believes that a special value o f this index lies in being able to compare use to need for various population categories. This phase o f the study\u2014s till in its early stages of deve lopm ent and refinement\u2014is important and has already proved to be controversial. But Andersen strongly believes that the study of access demands a way to measure need and he and his team inten d to continue to pursue this approach. If, in fact, differences do exist between what patients do and what some doctors think they should do, it perhaps should not be considered surprising. Medicine is an inexact science and wid e variations exist in the be\u00ad liefs, opinio ns, and perceptions o f docto rs, as we ll as patients. Are Peop le Satisfied? What Americans Think About the Care Th ey Obtain Whether or not people are satisfied with their medical care, the Chicago researchers believe, is an important dimension of access and one part of the survey measures satisfac\u00ad tion : how patients feel about their encounters with the system. Studies on consumer satisfaction in many areas, including health, have been increasing in recent years. Critic s o f this approach argue that patients are not app ropriate judges of their health experiences because they lack sufficient technical knowledge to make an inform ed ju dgme nt. The study team does not agree with that conte ntion. Gretchen Fleming, assistant study director, notes: \"Q ue rying consumers derives from the ve ry notions on which dem ocracy its elf is defended\u2014that it is appro\u00ad priate fo r the public to be inv ited and even 5.

Chart 4 summarizes how the U.S . population feels about various as\u00ad pects of its most recent doctor visit. Time spent wa iting to see a docto r and the amount o f in forma tion given to the patient by the docto r are majo r areas o f dissatisfaction. But no factor rivals cost as a cause of dissatisfaction .* As with all aspects o f the study, each factor has been analyzed by income, age, race, region, sex and oth er varia bles, and the following generalizations can be made: satisfaction with care received increases with age persons in the South are least satisfied persons with higher income and more educa\u00ad tion are the most satisfied blacks are less satisfied than whites persons who see their own docto r regularly are more satisfied than persons who see different doctors in a series of visits rural blacks in the S outh are least satisfied o f all groups people of Spanish origin in the Southwest are less satisfied than o the r whites.

Despite the survey data which show, gen erally, a high level of satisfa ction, as we ll as increased access to the health system fo r Americans of all ages and races, the study also shows that 61 percent of the population \u2014 125,000,000 people\u2014 believe there is a crisis in health care in the U.S . And another 26 percent are so unce rtain theycannot deny it .' Why this paradox exists is a m ystery s till to be probed\u2014not only by the Chicago team, but by oth er investigators as well. It could be a product of the human propen\u00ad sity to seek reassurance and support when in need. When people contemplate their own medical care (i.e., \"W ere you satisfied with what y ou r doctor did fo r yo u? \"), the response is from the perspective of a patient\u2014each indiv idual is then a statistic of only one and answers are shaped according ly. It is quite another matter to respond to questions about health in the abstract, simply as a part of the aggregate (i.e ., \" Is there a crisis in health care?\"). In spite of these mixed perceptions about what goes on in Americ a's health care system , the national survey o f access to medical care provides important new insight into the how and why of the system and is a study of importance likely to be analyzed fo r years. 7.

A Hea lth Opinions questionn aire was an integral part of the nation al survey. Emphasizing to the respondents that there were no \" rig h t\" or \"w ro ng\" answers, it probed their view s on a w ide variety of health and personal issues. Mu ch o f the data collected in the national survey have been incorpora tedinto various ind ices and scales, but in th is particula r section the raw responses themselves reveal inte resting infor mation about what the U.S. population thin ks about health in the broadest sense. Some examples are presented here. A ll percentages have been rounded to equal 100 percent across each item . 243 Technical Specifications The 19 76 survey is the fifth in a series of national household surveys o f health care utilization and expenditures conducted by the Center for Health Administration Studies. The previous four\u2014 19 53 , 19 58 , 19 63 , and 19 70 \u2014emphasized estimates of families' total health care experiences and costs. The 19 76 survey focuses on access issues. While the emphasis o f the 19 76 survey differs from earlier ones, some questions were designed for comparability. The Study: Between September 19 75 and February 19 76 interviews were conducted with 7,787 persons in 5,4 32 households representing the non-institutionalized population of the United States (among the exclusions: groups in prisons, long term care institutions, religious institutions, military installations). The sample was representative o f a population estimated at 209,065,000. A ll population calculations in this report are computed on this base. Overall response rate was 85 percent. Oversampling: There was supplementary sampling of persons experiencing episodes of illness, non -S MSA (Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas) Southern blacks, and Spanish heritage persons living in the Southwest. Oversampling was done to insure that a sufficient number of case s would be available for analysis. All computations are weighted distributions to correct for the oversampling and to allow estimates to be made for the total non-institutionalized U.S. population. Regions: Standard U.S. Bureau o f the Census regions were us ed in the study: Northeast, South, North Central, West. Blacks: Because of the particular variable definitions employed, the category o f blacks includes a small proportion o f other non-white persons. Urban Blacks: The urban black category includes a small proportion of non-urban residents. Rural Southern Blacks: This category is defined as blacks who reside in areas outside smsa 's in the states of Arkansas, Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North and South Carolina. Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Spanish Heritage, Southwest: This category includes persons who had Spanish surnames, or who were from families in which the head or spouse spoke Spanish as a child. The sample was drawn from Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. Suburban Residents: This category includes persons living in smsa 's, but not in the central city.Income: Family income levels used in the 19 76 study are as follows: Low (below $7,999 annual income), Medium ($8,000-$ 14,999), High ($15,000 and above). Income categories in the three studies\u2014 19 63 , 19 70 , and 19 76 \u2014were different to reflect differences in inflation for the respective time periods. For all studies, approximately one-third of all families fell into each of the income categories. Determination o f poverty level cutoffs conforms to a Social Security Administration index.

Th is act is in the best intere st of the Na tio n's health, and it is a privilege for me to endorse it with ap prop ria te mod ifica tions as ou t\u00ad lined later in the sta tem ent and to urge , af te r due del ibe ration , its enactment into law.

The proposal to create a National Center for the Evaluation of Medical Technology is an idea whose time has surely come. My own research has been mainly devoted to statistical and epidemiological evaluation of drugs, surgical procedures, medical devic es, and pre\u00ad ventive strategies, utilizing randomized controlled clinical trials, com\u00ad parative studies, follow-up investigations, and surveys. There is presently no unit of the Federal Government devoted primarily to the total evaluation of new modalities for the prevention and treatment of disease. The Food and Drug Administration has major regulatory responsibility for new drugs prior to marketing, but until now has shown little systematic interest\u2014here, the operative word is \"systematic,\" I think\u2014in agents after their release for gen\u00ad eral use. Senator K ennedy . Let me ask. What is your view ' \u2014and then maybe Dr. Lee would comment on this\u2014Should we have a more forceful regulatory process, in terms of medical practices, like FDA does with drugs? Dr. R emingt on . I think that makes good sense. In the drug field itself, we see m to los e interest in drugs onc e they have com e on the market. And I know that you have held hearings on this matter several times in the past. I think there needs to be a much more systematic evaluation of drugs tha t have been around a while, some of which have effects that are not visible in the first three phases of testing. Senator K ennedy . We are moving on that very closely with the administration. I am just wondering in terms of the totality of pro\u00ad cedures, though, if w 'e should not get sort of a measure of inputs and outputs, just in terms of information, perhaps as a starter\u2014maybe later it gets into something else\u2014just in the area of technology, ob\u00ad viously, and try to do health evaluations and other factors. I do not know what sen se either of you have about the importance of that process. Dr. R emin gto n . We might take surgical intervention as an ex\u00ad ample. At present, there really is no system for applying the clinical trial methodology to surgical intervention that we have had in the pharmacologic intervention field for som e time. And I think that is an oversight. These are im portant interventive strategies, and I think they really need to be systematically evaluated. Dr. L ee. I think in the d rug area that the phase 4 notion of testing, where the drug is used in a fairly large population group, but with careful surveillance and a limited number of physicians and pharm a\u00ad cists and involved in the prescribing and dispensing is a good idea. It would be difficult, when drugs are approved for more general use, to furth er restrict their use. I have been an advocate, as you probably know, for years of restricting chloramphenocol to hospital-based physicians. We know that in hospitals, we can and we do restrict the use of drugs. I think we should have much more careful restriction of par\u00ad ticularly antibiotics within the hospital. And I think that is the setting in which that can be accomplished. 246 I am not sure th at the best way to accomplish this is with Federal regulation. I think we can do a much better job, and I think the FDA should be involved much more aggressively in education. I think we need things like a compendium of drugs for physicians. The FDA drug bulletin could b e use d much more effectively----- Senator K enn edy . I suppose if you knew the amounts that were being used----- Dr. R emington . We wish we knew. Senator K ennedy [continuing]. And the procedures and the out\u00ad puts, without getting into saying who is going to do what to whom\u2014 but just in terms of information, I think you clearly have to start off with that in mind on it. But it seems to me we have not got those measuring devices at the present time. We do not have tha t kind of information tha t is generally available. Dr. L ee. It is interesting to note that the Center for Health Services Research is supporting a project at Stanford to develop a hospital- based drug information system. Once that system is well developed, we will have a methodology that can be applied very widely in hospi\u00ad tals to have a surveillance on prescribing, and it could have I think a significant impact, for example, on drug\u2014drug interactions and the prevention of adverse drug reactions in tha t area alone . In addition, such a system could make sure that if an unauthorized drug was prescribed that an automatic consultation could take place. We absolutely have to have the information systems. Without that, we really could not do the job. Senator K ennedy . Let me ask Dr. Remington, what about an In \u00ad stitute on Prevention? Where do you com e out on that? Should we be adding that? Dr. R emingt on . Well, in my statement, I rathe r strongly recom\u00ad mend that as one of the possibilities. Frankly, the area that I find to criticize in the legislation, and it takes some hard looking, because I do favor the legislation as you have proposed it, is in that area of prevention. I see a National Institute for Prevention as an important addition to the National Institutes for Health Care Research. I have also proposed, changing the title of the Institutes, to broaden it somewhat. Senator K ennedy . What about NIH for such an institute; what are your thoughts about that ? Dr. R emington . Well, that would be interesting. I would fear my\u00ad self, within the NIH umbrella, that if prevention is isolated as a separate institute, it would be a place to put activities that really are not all that important. It would be in an identifiable location, and the rest of the Institutes can get on about the \"really important\" business of stomping out disease at the individual patient level by direct intervention. Now , that is a rathe r cynical point of view . I do not mean to be accusatory in this. I think NIH is a marvelous organization with im\u00ad portant activities within each of the institutes. I would worry that if an Institute for Prevention is formed, for example, the very excellent Epidemiologic U nit within the National Heart. Lung, and Blood Institute might be pulled away and removed from the focus on cardiovascular disease that I think is appropriate. 247 I think it is a delicate balance, bu t I would fav or b rin ging p rev en\u00ad tion into an aggre gate of the sort you have proposed in the new Na \u00ad tional In sti tutes structure. Senator K ennedy . W ha t about the env ironm healt h sciences? Cu rre ntly, N IH does most of the work in thi s area. Sho uld this be over in the National In sti tutes of He alth Care Research? Dr. R emington . It is certa inl y ap prop ria te th at an emphasis on env ironmental science would belong in an insti tute devo ted to pub lic health r esea rch; there is no que stion about th at. On the oth er hand, there are im po rta nt env ironm ent al hea lth- related research th ru sts now in NIO SH , in the National In stitu te of En vir onme nta l He alth Sciences, and in EPA . And it seems to me that shou ld be the subject of anoth er reorga niz ation discussion. I get confused when I look at the Federal env ironm ent al health research structur e. It is difficult to know which agency has what responsibility. [The prepared statem ent of Dr. Rem ington follo ws :] 248 TESTIMONY OF RICHARD D. REMINGTON, PH.D., DEAN, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH BEFORE U.S. SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH FEBRUARY 7, 1978 MR. CHAIRMAN, MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I AM RICHARD D. REMINGTON, DEAN OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IT HAS BEEN MY PRIVILEGE TO SERVE AS CONSULTANT TO MOST OF THE INDIVIDUAL INSTITUTES OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH, THE U.S. VETERANS ADMINISTRATION, THE NATIONAL CENTER * FOR HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH, AND THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH STATISTICS. I AM PRESENTLY CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL ON EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION AND IMMEDIATE PAST PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH. TODAY, AS A MEMBER OF ITS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, I REPRESENT THE LATTER ASSOCIATION, AN ORGANIZATION COMPOSED OF THE NINETEEN ACCREDITED U.S. SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THESE SCHOOLS ARE LOCATED WITHIN SOME OF OUR COUNTRY'S LEADING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES, AND EACH SCHOOL HAS A MAJOR INTEREST IN THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH CARE RESEARCH ACT OF 1978. THIS ACT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE NATION'S HEALTH, AND IT IS A PRIVILEGE TO ENDORSE IT WITH APPROPRIATE MODIFICATIONS AS OUTLINED LATER IN THIS STATEMENT AND TO URGE, AFTER DUE DELIB\u00ad ERATION, ITS ENACTMENT INTO LAW. THE PRESENT SYSTEM FOR PROVIDING PERSONAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IS SERIOUSLY FRAGMENTED. UNFORTUNATELY, THAT FRAGMENTATION EXTENDS TO THE FEDERAL HEALTH BUREAUCRACY AND INTERFERES WITH OPTIMAL ALLOCATION OF SCARCE NATIONAL RESOURCES TOWARD DISCOVERY OF SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS OF HEALTH PROMOTION AND DISEASE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT. THE PRESENT LEGISLATION WOULD BRING TOGETHER SEVERAL OF THESE FRAGMENTS TO FORM A BETTER COORDINATED AND MORE PRODUCTIVE UNI T, THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH CARE RESEARCH. THE PROPOSAL TO CREATE A NATIONAL CENTER FOR THE EVALUA\u00ad TION OF MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY IS AN IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS SURELY COME. MY OWN RESEARCH HAS BEEN MAINLY DEVOTED TO STATISTICAL AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL EVALUATION OF DRUGS, SURGICAL PROCEDURES, MEDI\u00ad CAL DEVICES, AND PREVENTIVE STRATEGIES, UTILIZING RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS, COMPARATIVE STUDIES, FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATIONS, AND SURVEYS. THERE IS PRESENTLY NO UNIT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DEVOTED PRIMARILY.TO THE TOTAL EVALUATION OF NEW MODALITIES FOR THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE. THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION HAS MAJOR REGULATORY RESPONSIBILITY FOR NEW DRUGS PRIOR TO MARKETING, BUT UNTIL NOW HAS SHOWN LITTLE SYSTEMATIC INTEREST IN AGENTS AFTER THEIR RELEASE FOR GENERAL USE. FURTHERMORE, EVALUATION OF SURGICAL PROCEDURES, PREVENTIVE STRATEGIES, AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF NEW TREATMENTS ARE NOT ADDRESSED IN AN ORGANIZED MANNER BY ANY AGENCY. THE PROPOSED CENTER IS URGENTLY NEEDED. WHILE IT IS NOT INTENDED TO REPLACE THE IMPORTANT WORK OF FDA, NIH, CDC, AND OTHER AGENCIES ENGAGED IN THE ASSESSMENT OF MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY, THE CENTER WILL PLAY A KEY ROLE IN COORDINATING, EVALUATING AND SETTING PRIORITIES FOR THE FULL RANGE OF PREVENTIVE AND THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS. THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH STATISTICS IS AN EXCELLENT AGENCY CHARGED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF KEEPING TRACK OF BIRTHS DEATHS, MARRIAGES, DIVORCES, AND CASES OF ILLNESS. IN ADDITION, IT COORDINATES HEALTH STATISTICS COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS AT THE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS. 250 3 YET OUR INABILITY TO TRACE PATTERNS OF HEALTH AND DISEASE THROUGH THE POPULATION IS A NATIONAL SCANDAL. STRONG WORDS WHICH SURELY REQUIRE SOME DEFENSE. THE NATIONAL HEART LUNG AND BLOOD INSTITUTE AND THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION ARE THIS WEEK SIMULTANEOUSLY CELEBRATING THEIR THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARIES. THERE IS A REAL REASON TO CELEBRATE. MORTALITY DATA FROM NCHS SHOW A RECENT SUBSTANTIAL DOWNTURN IN TOTAL CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE MORTALITY, IN CORONARY HEART DISEASE MORTALITY AND, BECAUSE HEART DISEASE IS OUR LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH, IN ALL CAUSE MORTALITY. ALL OF US ARE INTERESTED IN EXPLAINING AND UNDERSTANDING THIS DECLINE. IS THE REDUCTION IN DEATHS FROM CORONARY HEART DISEASE DUE TO A DECREASE IN NEW CASES OF DISEASE, OR IS IT DUE TO IMPROVED SURVIVAL OF EXISTING CASES? WE DON'T KNOW, AND OUR HEALTH STATISTICS SYSTEM CAN'T TELL US. IN SUMMARY, OUR MORBIDITY MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS ARE PITIFULLY INADEQUATE IN SCALE AND SCOPE. I HOPE AND BELIEVE THAT BY IMPROVING THE LEVEL OF FUNDING FOR THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH STATISTICS AND BY ADDING A MAJOR EMPHASIS ON EPIDEMIOLOGY THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION WILL CONSTITUTE AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP TOWARD IMPROVING THIS SORRY SITUATION. THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH, RE\u00ad PLACING THE CURRENT NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH HAS SEVERAL IMPORTANT FEATURES. ITS NAME SEEMS TO IMPLY THAT THERE SHOULD BE A NATIONAL HEALTH POLICY AND THAT THIS POLICY SHOULD BE BASED ON RESEARCH. THE INSTITUTE STRUCTURE IMPLIES RELATIVE PERMANENCE, TAKING APPROPRIATE ACCOUNT OF THE FACT THAT, CONTRARY TO OPINIONS EXPRESSED ONLY A FEW YEARS AGO, QUICK, CHEAP, AND SUPERFICIAL INTERVENTIONS WILL NOT BE ADEQUATE TO TREAT OUR 251 0 PRESENT AI LING SYSTEM OF ORGANIZING, FINANCING, AND DELIVERING PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES, EXTENSIVE RESEARCH IS NEEDED. WE ARE A COMPLEX, PLURALISTIC SOCIETY, AND WHEN OUR HEALTH SERVICE SYSTEM IS STIMULATED, IT OFTEN RESPONDS IN UNFORESEEN AND UN\u00ad FORESEEABLE WAYS. THIS BILL ALSO RECOGNIZES THE NEED TO IMPROVE THE FLOW OF TRAINED HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH WORKERS. INASMUCH AS OUR SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH ARE A PRIMARY SOURCE OF SUCH WORKERS AND SCIENTISTS, WE PARTICULARLY APPLAUD THIS INITIATIVE. FINALLY, A FEW RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE LEGISLATION AS PRESENTLY WRITTEN. THE BILL PLACES ITS MAJOR EMPHASIS ON TREAT\u00ad MENT OF DISEASE RATHER THAN ON PREVENTION. IT EMPHASIZES PERSONAL RATHER THAN PUBLIC OR COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICES. I DO NOT ARGUE, MR. CHAIRMAN, THAT WE SHOULD DEEMPHASIZE IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF DISEASE TREATMENT OR DELIVERY OF PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES. I DO ARGUE, HOWEVER, THAT THERE SHOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER EMPHASIS ON PREVENTION. THE HISTORY OF CONTROL OF MASS DISEASE SHOWS THAT PREVEN\u00ad TION HAS BEEN BOTH MORE EFFECTIVE AND LESS COSTLY THAN INDIVIDUAL MEDICAL TREATMENT. WHETHER WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IMMUNIZATION, SANITATION, BETTER HOUSING, CLEANER DRINKING WATER OR IMPROVED NUTRITION, THE RESULT IS THE SAME. THESE ARE THE METHODS THAT HAVE RESULTED IN REDUCED INFANT AND MATERNAL MORTALITY AND INCREASED LONGEVITY. THESE ARE THE METHODS THAT IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF THE PUBLIC. TO BRING THE MATTER UP TO THE MINUTE, STUDIES OF FACTORS MOST LIKELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RECENT REDUC\u00ad TION OF HEART DISEASE MORTALITY CONVINCE ME THAT, ONCE AGAIN, PREVENTION HAS BEEN THE KEY. CHANGES IN CIGARETTE SMOKING PATTERNS, IN THE EXTENT OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE 252 5 DETECTION PROGRAMS AND IN DIETARY HABITS ARE PROBABLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE REDUCTION. THIS IS NOT TO DENY THAT CORONARY CARE UNITS, CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS SURGERY AND OTHER TERTIARY CARE INTERVENTION MAY HAVE BEEN HELPFUL IN SOME CASES, BUT SUCH METHODS COULD HARDLY HAVE PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN THE MASS POPULATION IMPACT THAT HAS BEEN DUE, ALMOST CERTAINLY TO PUBLIC RATHER THAN INDIVIDUAL INTERVENTION. I ARGUE ONLY FOR BALANCE. WE SPEND A POUND FOR CURE, BUT ONLY A FARTHING FOR PREVENTION. ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH, I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU FIND, MR. CHAIRMAN, MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES IN LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE TO ADD AN EMPHASIS ON PREVENTION, POSSIBILITIES MIGHT INCLUDE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PREVENTION, AND ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL A CHANGE IN THE TITLE OF THE PROPOSED NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH CARE RESEARCH TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF PUBLIC HEALTH OR NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF COMMUNITY HEALTH. THESE CHANGES WOULD RECOGNIZE AND ENHANCE THE EMPHASIS ON DISEASE PREVENTION AND HEALTH PROMOTION. ONCE AGAIN, ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW AND COMMENT ON THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. I WILL BE PLEASED TO TRY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 253 Senator Kenn edy. Senator Schweiker is, of course, a cosponsor. We have had very strong support for this proposal from both Drs. Lee and Remington, Senator Schweiker. I think they have given us good in\u00ad dication of their continued interest and help for it, and I think they have made a very strong case for the organizational structure, and I think what is most important, the functions of those pa rticular agen\u00ad cie s. And I think that this is reassuring to us. I think their statements are very clear and crisp, and they have been very responsive. Senator S chweiker . I have just one or two minor questions. Do you have a better name for this new agency than the one we have com e up with? I am not so sure that the name in the bill is as clear and \u00bb crisp as your testimony. I do not know if you have made any suggestions or have any thoughts about that or not. Dr. R emington . I ventured a couple of them. Senator Schweiker, in mv testimony. I am a little worried about the title, National Institutes of Health Care Research. To me, th at implies too much emphasis on treatment of disease at the individual provider/client level. \"Care'' and \"Health Care\" even more see m to imply exclusively a personal health services orientation. I find missing the emphasis on prevention that we are beginning to see from the administration in the President's budget message, in Secretary Richmond's testimonv today, and in programs of several of the National Institutes of Health. I think most of us agree that when we look at the great gains in public health in the past, the majority of those gains have not been through the treatment of disease, but through the prevention of disease in the first place\u2014 in absolute or in relative terms, and in terms of cost containment. The name. National Institutes of Public Health is an option that I understand has been discussed; National Institutes of Community Health might be another option. I would argue for any kind of a crisp term that suggested some\u00ad thing more than personal health services as the exclusive focus of this agency. When we put the National Center for Health Statistics into an agency like this, for example, we get a polyglot group, because their concern is broader than personal health services\u2014 as important as that is. I t is difficu lt for me to state this position without seeming to diminish the appropriate emphasis on personal health services re- \u00bb search, and I do not mean to do that either. Senator S chweiker . Well. I share your concern. I think that was mv reaction in seeimr the label first off. T am not ouite sure where we should com e down to be clear and crisp, but I think the present name is subject to an awful lot of misinterpretation about the focus of resources and the emphasis that the bill intends this organization to have. So I can certainly assure you we will give it som e further thought and take your suggestions into account. Dr. L ee. I think it is important. Senator Schweiker----- Senator S chweiker . Yes: I was going to ask you. Dr. Lee: What are your thoughts on the name? 28 -790 0 - 78 - 1 7 254 Dr. Lee. I think the term, \" National In stitu tes,\" is very im po rta nt in th is reg ard , and I think the use of the term \"R esearch is very im po rta nt, because the ins titute s have been associated with research. W ha t you are doi ng in th is set of ins titution s\u2014whether you call the m centers or not\u2014is research, basically rese arch\u2014h ealth services research, policy researc h, the g athe rin g of statistical inf orm ation tha t is useful in healt h servic es research, useful in health policy. It is th at emphasis, th at is imp lied by the tit le\u2014I have a bro ad view of health care, and I think the title actua lly is quite a good \u00bb title. I do not have the same concern t ha t it emphasizes too exclusively pers onal health care, because you are ta lking about an institut e within th at for health policy. Th at is a broad concept and one that must be based on the sta tistic s th at you are going to ga ther out of the National Center for He alth Sta tistics, basic health services research, epidemiological studies, social and behavioral sciences stud ies of the kin d Dr. Ha mbu rg described this morning. I do not see those as at all inco mpatible. As a matter of fact, I was very impressed with the ma nner in which you were able to come up wi th wh at to me was a very good set of titles ------ Senator S chweike r . Well, we chan ged ou r minds three time s----- Dr . L ee. Well, I thou gh t th at as it went alon g, it improved. But I think it is im po rta nt, in terms of the use of the term , \"N atio nal In sti tutes.\" Se nator S chweike r . Well, the re is no arg um ent with that. I think th at is a very valid point. It is pu tti ng the word \"C are \" in there. It seems to me th at the word \"C are \" co njures up med icaid and medi\u00ad care, which I think is completely off-target of wha t we mean in the bill and ought to be say ing in the name. I agree with you abou t keeping \"N atio nal al \u00ad rea dy connotes research. Dr. L ee. Bu t I think also, the point Dr. Ham bu rg made thi s mo rn\u00ad ing was very im po rta nt. The pres ent NTH is not the rig ht place for these kin ds of activities, inc lud ing the tech nolo gy assessment activitie s. They have got a very good man agemen t str uc tur e, but they have got, more than enough to do. I f this is g oin g to get the kin d of atten\u00ad tion and pr iorit y and quali ty that it must have. I think it must be t in this kin d of sep ara te agency such as you have proposed in (his legislation. Se nator S chweike r . Well, we certainl y agre e with that. I do not wan t to pro lon g the hea ring. I know you have gone over the issues * with Senator Ke nnedy. Se na tor K ennedy . I think the strong support of wha t we are at\u00ad tempti ng to do is very reassu ring. The for me r Assistan t Sec retary of He alth, who has been very much involved in the whole areas of re\u00ad search pro gra m, rem inded us in his testim ony abou t the gra dual decline\u2014on page 11, in 1973, from $58 million , and how it has just continu ed to go down and how th is really is such an im po rta nt elem ent in terms of tryi ng to get a real han dle on cost. We are talking about every thi ng in this. We are talking about cost, we are talking abou t quali ty, we are talking abou t equity, and so many of these elements. 255 Dr. Lee. And you might ask Julie Richmond or. perhaps, Gerry Rosenthal, how many supergrade positions Dr. Rosenthal has been given since 1974 when he was made Director of tha t Center; how many additional new positions has he bee n given to staff up to do the job that has to b e done. Dr. Richmond indicated they are taking even more money away from the center to carry out this technology assessment activity in his of fice , further limiting what they are able to do. I think you raised som e very pertinent questions on that this morning. Senator K ennedy . Well, if you have some more questions we ought to be raising, we welcome those, too. I think it is helpful to the people in the Department to understand this, as well as those of us outside who are tryin g to mov e this issue forward to be able to dramatize it. We talked about it, but I would like to just get your sen se on the prevention institute. I think Dr. Remington indicated that XIH is not the place to do it\u2014I think I asked this before, but maybe you can just hammer it. How do you think we ought to deal with the function of prevention ? Dr. R emin gton . I think if you are going to have a National Ins ti\u00ad tutes structure, with the kind of breadth that T think we are all discuss\u00ad ing here, I think it needs more of a focus on prevention than I see in the present language of the bill. Senator S ciiweiker . Yo u want to see that accomplished through this National Institutes of Health Care Research concept? In other words, you are saying we should put prevention into that structure, provided for in this bill, in a bigger w ay? Dr. R emin gto n . T es; or community health\u2014whatever umbrella con\u00ad cept you want. Health care seem s to me, as I have stated already, not to be an appropriately broad umbrella. But in public health or community health, which I think are ap\u00ad propriately broad, supporting Dr. Lee' s statement that national insti\u00ad tutes is very appropriate, I would like to see a much greater emphasis on prevention. For one thing, as you did epidemiology to the National Center for Health Statistics, you will inevitably, then, have people who are doing work that closely relates to prevention. Perhaps epidemiology' may be thought of as the basic scie nce of prevention. And one worry I would want to articulate there is t hat I would not want to see an emphasis on epidemiology in this group draw epidemiologic strength away from CDC or from the individual Ins ti\u00ad tutes in the Institutes of Health. That would be very unfortunate. And I do not think it is the intent of the cosponsors of this legislation to do that. As I read Senator Kennedv's flood statement introducing the legislation, tha t is quite clear. But T would like to stress it again. I think our colleagues at CDC in epidemiology, particularly in such units as the Epidemic In \u00ad telligence Service\u2014 which by the way, is doing as much to produce new epidemioloflrists as any unit we have\u2014will be worried about the addition of epidemiology to a unit like this, if they believe that their budget will be affected or that their program will be diminished. I do not think we want that. Senator K ennedy . Well, wouldn't that also be true, sav, for the Cancer Institute, where they have got about $7 5 million for preven\u00ad tion, and the Heart as well. 256 Dr. Remingt on. Yes; indeed. Senator K ennedy . So how do we do tha t? They do not wa nt to lose that. The insti tut es feel th at th at is an im po rta nt dimension, and I think it is. So how do we deal with th at ? I suppose the X IH would say they are doing 20 percent o f their bu dget----- Dr. R emington . Well, the y are doing more and more. T think pr e\u00ad vention and epidemiolog y are a couple of words th at have come to town and are r eally begin nin g to move, as we all appre cia te what they really can do. And I think Les Breslow and Ned ra Belloc and th eir work , as Dr. Lee has pointe d out, suggest to us the ga ins we can make. As I look at th e down tur ns in card iov asc ula r disease mo rta lity, par \u00ad tic ularly corona ry heart disease mo rta lity, and b egin to tr y to e xplain th at latte r down tur n, it seems to me th at most of it sim ply has to be due to chan ges in the way of life, changes in pers onal health hab its. An d t ha t is an analysis t ha t needs to go for ward. Now, I have ju st recen tly learned\u2014very rece ntly on Epide miology a t th e D ire cto r's level w ith in NTH t hat is pro \u00ad vid ing a foru m for all of the n NC HS , within CDC, to get together to sha re ideas and to begin to th in k of ways of capit ali zing on th eir lim ited\u2014 numerica lly limited \u2014strength . And T th ink th at sho uld be enco uraged. Dr. L ee. I would agree, Sen ator, th at the idea of an insti tute o ught to be very caref ull y explore d within th is con text, that it is more ap \u00ad prop ria te in th is setting than within NTIT, th at X II I, certa inl y in the Can cer In stitu te and oth er ins titute s, should have a component of preven tion , just as the He alth Care Fi na nc ing Ad mi nis tra tio n mu st have a pro gra mm ati cally related he alt h services research component. Bu t it is not going to sup port the fun dame nta l healt h services re\u00ad search th at needs to be sup ported or the policy of the research th at is going to question the policies of med icare and medicaid. They sim \u00ad ply do not sup port that k ind of research. Nu tri tio n is a cri tic all y im porta nt area th at has a very low pr iority in the las t decade in HEW . We have seen in the Ag ric ulture Dep ar t\u00ad ment a significant turnarou nd with this curre nt ad minist ra\u00ad tion th at is very encouraging. Th e Offic e of Science and Technology Policy has almost directed H E W to do an assessment of d iet ary goals. I do not see th at that has been carrie d out yet. Tha t is the kin d of th ing th at an insti tut e like this could do. It might include nu tri tio n, env iron mental and soc ial-cultural com\u00ad ponents , inc lud ing social and beh avioral sciences and epidemiology. Stu die s of social networks, the im pact of widowhood on health, variou s oth er social fac tor s th at impac t on healt h might be exam ined. If we had bette r researc h in these problems the k ind s of bla ming-the- victim statem ents t hat we now see m ade rep eated ly by some very prom \u00ad inent health pro fessionals would be heard less often. It might also help to deal with the social and env ironm ental prob lems th at con\u00ad r health , th e prob lems o f p overty and oth er thin gs. I t hink t hat it is an excellent idea. I am sure you can re t the people in D H EW to pu t the pieces tog ether. They could iden tif y the various activities in pre ven tion th at might logically go into an insti tute th at has this kin d of com munity population focus as opposed to a disease- specific focus. 257 Sena tor S chweiker . Would you put \"epidemio logy\" into the title, or is t ha t draw ing too much away from CDC and some oth er efforts? I mean, you said th at is a word whose time has come, and it prob \u00ad ably has. Sho uld \"epidemiolo gy\" be pa rt of the ti tle? Dr. L ee. C ert ain ly you would want to have trai ni ng g rants as pa rt of it, and trai ni ng gr an ts in epidemiolog y. Pe rhap s the Direc tor of th at insti tut e would be an epidem iolo gist . Tha t is such a basic disc i\u00ad plin e for the developm ent of policies in preven tion and fo r individ\u00ad uals t o make decisions abou t what the y should do in prevention . Se nator S chweike r . W hat I am ge tti ng a t is t hat maybe we ought to use t hat word in the title, because it does ex pla in many of the thing s we are talking ab out. Dr. R emington . It is possible. Of course, you are talk ing to some\u00ad body who is biased. I think public healt h is a very ap prop ria te um\u00ad brella, and public health does not have quite the same narro we r con\u00ad notation th at it once had. It is a field th at has been changin g and ad aptin g. There would be those, I susp ect\u2014perha ps no t Dr. Lee or myself \u2014 who m ight find \"epidemio logy\" a bit confining in the t itle, just as some of us would find \"h ealth care .\" Se nator K ennedy . Can I ask how you relate this to our healt h in \u00ad forma tion and promot ion kin d of agency? Dr. L ee. The au thority th at is the re, as a matter of fac t, would pe rm it you now, or would permit HEW to create such an ins titu te. Th e majo r initiati ves th at Secre tary Ca lifano has tak en in the field of pre vention\u2014his whole antismo kin g pro gra m\u2014 is based on the au \u00ad thorities in th at legi slation. Se nator . Th at is exa ctly rig ht. So we have got a good deal o f flex ibility to move. Dr. L ee. Th at au thority is the re alread y, in terms of moving it if the De partm ent wished to. Se nator K ennedy . We ought to press on th at , obviously, for the reasons you have outlined . Th an k you very much.

M.D.. M.P.H., Executive Director February 22, 1978 The Honorable Edward M. Kennedy Chairperson, Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research 4220 Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington, D. C. 20510 Dear Senator Kennedy: The American Public Health Association is pleased to have the opportunity to present its views on S.2466, National Institutes of Health Care Research. APHA is supportive of efforts to develop capabilities in public health and health services research, and wishes to offer testimony designed to assist in making S.2466 achieve these goals. Very truly yours, E. Frank Ellis, M.D., M.P.H. President cc: David Blumenthal 259 S.2466 - National Institutes of Health Care Research comments of the AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION to the Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research of the Senate Committee on Human Resources February 1978 The American Public Health Association has long been aware of the need for research, evaluation, and demonstrations related to the area of community and preventive health > services. We are supportive of attempts to develop capa\u00ad bilities in public health and health services research comparable to our current highly developed biomedical capa\u00ad bilities. The goals of S.2466 encompass these endeavors and are worthy of support. APHA is anxious to assist in making the legislation achieve these goals and wishes to offer comments designed to strengthen the bill. While the purposes of S.2466, as we have indicated, are broad and far-reaching goals, we are concerned that the title and specific aspects of the bill limit the scope. We feel strongly that the title of the bill, National Institutes of Health Care Research, with its emphasis on traditional health care is not reflective of the stated goals of the bill. We would suggest that the title be amended to National Institutes of Public Health. Changing the title would serve the purpose or emphasizing areas of community health ser\u00ad vices and prevention research, demonstration, and training. Because the area of prevention is so critical to inves\u00ad tigations of health services, an additional purpose of the bill should be added to Sec. 304(b) (2)a-f to read, (g) the prevention of illness, disability, and pre\u00ad mature deaths in the United States. As currently drafted, S.2466 addresses two of the six goals in Section 304(b) (2). These deal with: (c) the collection, analysis and dissemination of 0 health related statistics, and (e) the safety efficacy, effectiveness, cost effective\u00ad ness, and social, economic and ethical impacts of medical technologies. w Legislative initiatives related to the four other goals are incompletely addressed in the bill. These are: (a ) the accessibility, acceptability, planning, organization, distribution, utilization, and financing of systems for delivery of health care, (b) alternative methods for measuring and evaluating the quality of systems for the delivery of health care, (d) alternative methods to improve and promote health statistical and epidemiological activities, and (f) alternative methods for disseminating knowledge concerning health and health related activities. SECTION 102 Section 102 changes the name of the National Center for Health Services Research to the National Institute for Health Policy Research but does not add additional re\u00ad sponsibilities or functions. Language should be added to incorporate the research described in Sec. 304(b)(2)(a)re\u00ad lated to the accessibility, acceptability, planning, organization, distribution, utilization and financing of systems for the delivery of health care. It would also be useful to include in the bill report some indication of the congressional intent leading to a change from the word \"services\" to the word \"policy\". We note that in his remarks on the bill' , Senator Kennedy makes reference to a new mandate to conduct training programs for health services researchers. We are unable to find specific language to this effect, but hope that some could be added to provide an expanded and continuing supply of persons qualified to perform needed research, evaluation and demonstration projects. SECTION 103 Section 103 renames the National Center for Health Statistics and adds epidemiology to the title. It appears as if the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) would be expected to carry out new epidemiological in\u00ad vestigations anticipated by this legislation. Epidemiological expertise currently rests in the Center for Disease Control, but the relationship of CDC to this Institute is unclear. NCHS currently operates a statistical service which relates very well to operating health agencies. APHA is 261 concerned that the move to a research orientated organization might result in a loss of focus on the cooperative federal- state health statistics system. It is important that statistical work for ongoing programs be continued. SECTION 104 Section 104 establishes a National Center for the Evaluation of Medical Technology. As outlined in S.2466, \u00ab this Center would provide useful information concerning the safety, efficacy, effectiveness, cost effectiveness and social, economic and ethical impacts of medical technologies. This kind of research, while difficult to accomplish, will yield extremely helpful data. In keeping with the spirit of Section 104, it might be appropriate to retitle the institute, National Institute for Health Technology Assessment, since it would deal with investigations related to health services delivery and medical practice as well as biomedical technology. NATIONAL PREVENTION INSTITUTE APHA urges the establishment of a fourth Institute to be titled National Prevention Institute. This Institute would be devoted to the investigation ahd evaluation of individual services and community activities of a preventive nature. The Institute should be concerned with the demonstration and testing of new preventive models for community and environmental health programs and with measuring the effectiveness and efficacy of existing models. Specific examples of areas of inquiry might include evaluation of the cost effectiveness of programs to change individual behaviors. It might undertake quantitative assessments of the effect of educational efforts to motivate healthy life styles. It may also attempt to gain a more definitive understanding of the potential for early identification of disease through screening. In summary, although we have indicated areas where S.2466 needs clarification and expansion, APHA would support the concept of Institutes which would give new focus and definition to public health policy. -3- 28-790 0 - 78 - 1 8 Writt en Statement of EUGENE W. FOWINKLE, M.D. Commissioner, Tennessee Department of Public Health and Past President of The Association of State and Ter rit or ia l Health Officials for the Subcommittee on H ealth and S cie ntific Research Comm ittee on Human Resources U. S . Senate February 27, 197 8 263 I app reciate the opportunity to offer written testimony on S. 2466, the National Ins titu tes of Public Health Act o f 1978, and in pa rticular that portion concerning the Nation al Institute for Health Statistics and Epidemiology. As Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Health, as Past President of the Association of State and Ter rit or ia l Health Officials, and especially as a forme r member of the Advisory Co mm itte e to the Cooperative Health Statistics System (CHSS) of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), I have become fa miliar with the programs of the Center and w ith some of its problems. 1 am pleased with the current enabling legislation for the Center and the broad authoritie s it provides fo r collecting, analyzin g, and disseminating health data which is so critically needed for planning and evaluating the nation's health services and health research programs. There is, however, a mo difica tion to the leg isla tion which I fee l would sig nifica ntly aid the Center in continuing to develop and imp lement a cooperative data collection system. I would suggest tha t appropriations fo r the new National Institute for Health Statistics and Epidemiology be divided into two separate auth orizations - one for the Cooperative Health Statistics System mandated under Subsection 306(e) of the Public Health Service Act and one for all other statistic al ac tiv ities of the Institu te which are conducted under Sections 304 and 306 of the Act. A separate appropria tion can also go a long way in helping the Institute in st ill confidence in, and develop permanent relationships with state and local governments which are essential for the successful implementation of the CHSS. This is p artic ularly true since the Cooperative Health Statistics System is designed to establish a coalition among the various levels of government and the priva te health sector to gather health data in a manner which permits the collection of any particular data element(s) by the organizational lev el best equipped to collect it and then to share it with the other levels. For the past several years, the NCHS has been restric ted in its budget to mandatory increases for such items as salaries or special pro jects. I strong ly recommend that the total appropriation be increased to a level which could adequately support the ac tiv ities of the Institu te. To accomplish this, a to ta l appropria tion of at least $60,000,000 would be needed for FY79. Of this $60,000,000 to ta l $35,000,000 should be designated for the CHSS with $25,000,000 to be used for operational data ac tiv ities and $10,000,000 to be use d for the development of \"co re\" sta ffs in State Centers for Health Statistics in all 50 states. Therefore, 1 would suggest tha t more appropriate to ta l amounts would be as follows: For NCHS For CHS S For State Fiscal National Operational Center Year Total Activities Activities \"Co re\" Staffs 1979 $ 60,000,000 $ 25,000,000 115,000,000 35,000,000 50,000,000 30,000,000 It should also be pointed out that additional appropriations should be authorized if any substantial epidem iologica l ac tiv ities are planned. In addition to the appropria tion issue, there is a need for a special Advisory Comm ittee to the Institu te which would assure adequate representation of state and loc al interests in policy development and decision making. Our experience has 265 shown that state-local participation in the decision-making process concerning the development and operation of data systems is a necessity. I would suggest that three-fourths of this committee be composed of state and local representatives who are actively involved with CH SS activitie s, including representatives of Health w Service Agencies (HS As) and State Health Planning and Development Authorities. This type of representation appears to be essential to ass ure long-term via bility and effectiveness. A final point for consideration is the nee d to cla rify and strengthen the role of the Institute/CHSS as the coordinator of uniformly defined standard health care information for all Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (DHEW) agencies. Coordination of data activities is of utmost importance in avoiding costly and inefficient duplication in data systems. Section 3 C W (d) of the Act provides for coordination of statistical activities by the Secretary of DHEW. This coordination could be strengthened by providing clear authority and jurisdiction for the Director of the new National Institute of Health Statistics and Epidemiology to coordinate all of DHEW's health statistics activities , especially those of the Health Care Financing Administration and other Public Health Service agencies. To further strengthen coordination, this legislation should provide for an internal Health Data Policy Committee chaired by the Director of the Institute. This committee would replace the present ad hoc committee of the sam e name but would have the capacity to make decisions and implement changes. 3 In summary, I feel that the legislation currently under consideration would signific antly strengthen national, state, and local efforts in collecting, processing, and disseminating quality health data by incorporating the modifications outlined in this testimony, ie: 1 ) a separate appropriation for CH SS which would include funding for development of \"core\" staffs in all states as well as operational funding, 2) an increase in the total appropriation, 3) establishment of an Advisory Committee to the Institute with more state representation, and k) a stronger coordinative role for Institute/CHSS. 267 -e t - a s s o c ia tio n off a m e r lc a n Cm 1 B, m e d ic a l c o lle g e s JO HN A.

Kennedy February 28, 1978 AAMC support is based on the following considerations: As you pointed out in your floor statement, the need for initiatives in the areas assigned to the proposed National Institutes of Health Care Research is of the utmost importance. While elements of these activities are presently under\u00ad taken in both the public and private sectors, there is presently no overall concept of how these functions should be related to one another and no overreaching managerial strategy for their support and conduct. The proposal is a very timely one. Examination of the various studies conducted in this area in recent years and the evidence developed in various Congressional hearings, suggest that now is an auspicious moment to modify the programmatic nature, the organizational location and the magnitude of effort for the National Centers for Health Statistics and for Health Services Research as well as related efforts. In fact, if the opportunity is not grasped now, an unusual advantage will have been wasted. S. 2466 enumerates for the first time in understand\u00ad able, reasonable and badly needed fashion some of the specific components which comprise the important but amorphous and poorly understood series of activities encompassed by the inadequate term, \"technology transfer.\" The bill offers a potentially effective and appro\u00ad priate counterpart in the health care area to the National Institutes of Health, with the latter's important and productive programs in biomedical research and related areas. The designation of separate authorizations for these activities should provide a necessary identifiable focus for assuring that each can gain at least minimal allocation of the essential financial resources for expanded programs in each area. The inclusion of an overarching organization, similar to the Office of the Director, NIH, provides the basis for one level of intra- and interagency cooperation and coordination required for its success. 269 Page 3 - Honorable Edward M. Kennedy February 28, 1978 While advancing health care research and technology transfer through separately identified functions, there is also assurance in your floor speech that the NIH and other agencies can conduct or support, u within reasonable limitations, epidemiological research and clinical trials which are especially pertinent to their categorical missions. The AAMC believes that this important point should be explicitly reaffirmed in Report language. The programs of the NIHCR will complement the programs of the NIH and should increase the total funding of research in the areas of biomedical, behavioral and health care research. The attractive\u00ad ness of the categorical foci of the NIH will remain a potent magnet for funds as in the past. In conveying its endorsement of this legislation, however, the Association recommends thorough consideration of several modifications which would even further improve the present bill: An Advisory Council should be mandated for each of the three components, rather than just for the National Center for Evaluation of Medical Technology as presently proposed. The Association is convinced that the activities subtended by each component are sufficiently different as to justify separate senior level advisory panels. Furthermore, we suggest that in Report language an Advisory Committee to the Director of the entire organization be recommended similar to the administratively established Director's Advisory Committee at NIH. The Advisory Councils, like their counterparts at NIH, should have public representatives and should other\u00ad wise be appropriately constituted so as to reflect the specific responsibilities of each component. For example, eminent statisticians, epidemiologists and clinicians should definitely be members of the Advisory Council for the National Institute for Health Statistics and Epidemiology. On the Advisory Council for the National Institute for Health Policy Research there should be prominent clinicians and other > provider representatives, economists, and behavioral and social scientists. 270 Page 4 - Honorable Edward M . Kennedy February 28, 1978 Peer review of grants and contracts should be mandated for each component so as to assure the highest possible quality in the awards and the subsequent research. The authorization ceilings for the three components * should total at least 0.5 percent of Federal health care expenditures. This would represent at the pre\u00ad sent time approximately $200 million. There are two reasons behind this proposal. First, this provision would provide a reasonable and definite level of ffinancial underpinning for these activities. Second, in very explicit fashion it would tie support for these types of research to the health care function and the Federal component of its funding. It seems only proper to set out in highly visible fashion the necessity of an investment for the future through research so as to assure continued improvements in the quality, quantity and cost effectiveness associated with the health care delivery system. Once again, we appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposed legislation. We stand ready to assist you and your colleagues in any way possible to assist in its success. 271 Association of Schools of Public Health 1825 K Street.

S M H ygHonorable Edward M. Kennedy United States Senate Room 431 Russell Senate Office Building Washington, D.C. 20510 Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the Association of Schools of Public Health, we wish to thank you for the oppor\u00ad tunity of presenting testimony in support of S. 2466, the National Institutes of Health Care Act of 1978 before the Senate Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research on February 7. At the hearings you and Senator Schweiker discussed with Dean Remington the title for the new National Institutes. There seemed a general concern that the proposed title could be misunderstood to limit the jurisdic\u00ad tion of the agency to the administration of personal health services on a one to one basis, whereas the intent of the legislation appears to include a major emphasis on prevention and an improved federal posture in public health research. The undersigned Deans wish to urge that you carefully reconsider changing the title of the proposed new organization to The National Institutes of Public Health. This change would, we believe, recognize that health statistics, epidemiology, evaluation of preventive strategies, and personal health services as now included in the language of S. 2466 are part of Public Health. In fact, sta\u00ad tistics, epidemiology and health services administra\u00ad tion are, in addition to environmental health, major components of every School of Public Health, mandated by our accrediting agency. 272 Letter to Senator Kennedy Page 2 February 10, 1978 v In addition, the Schools of Public Health are among the most research intensive units within their respective Universities. At the University of Michigan, for example, the School of Public Health generates per capita more research activity in terms of external federal, state, and private funding than any other school or college including the Medical School. Yet there is within the federal government no umbrella agency responsible for supporting public health research. That is why the Association of Schools of Public Health so strongly supports S. 2466 with an increased emphasis on prevention, promotion of positive health, and more appropriate title. Public health is a field with a distinguished record of research leading to major advances in the conquest of disease, improved delivery of personal, environmental, preventive, and therapeutic health services out of all proportion to the past and cur\u00ad rent investment in its research efforts. The National Institutes of Health, an excellent agency with a critical national mission is in reality de\u00ad voted almost entirely to biomedical research, an emphasis which should continue. We believe that the proper and intended concern of S. 2466 is not exclusively with health care but with public health, and therefore, urge that you amend the Act to retitle the proposed Institutes, the National Institutes of Public Health. I 273 Letter to Senator Kennedy Page 3 February 10, 1978 Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Richard D.

Groups such as ours, with keen interest in improving the delivery of health services, need time to fully assess the impact of each of the bill's suggested major changes in structure. We commend the sponsors for taking such a careful look at the existing programs and their problems and for developing the bill being considered. We agree with the views expressed by Senator Kennedy in his speech at APHA in November 1977 that health services research and health statistics programs must be insulated from politicalization which is a real future possibility within the recently revised structure of HEW. The National Center for Health Services Research has had a difficult time since its inception. Internal administrative problems, lack of adequate financing and organizational upheavals all are factors. Location in administrative charts is an important aspect for any program attempting to break new ground. 0 276 Health servic es research is certainly a field needing new breakthroughs. To make such breakthroughs requires coordinated research efforts on a number of fronts concurrently so that a cohesive plan for change can be developed rather than a bit by bit approach to such change. Congressional expectation of quick research results from the Center < has at times seemed unrealistic. Low appropriations also have restricted its progress. Some of us have also felt that certain of the research carried out was not in fact scientifically evaluated prior to recommending changes in policy (i.e. evaluation of effectiveness of nurse practitioners and physicians assistants in practice using time per encounter and numbers of encounters only, rather than measuring the quality of care provided by those groups). The four purposes of the bill (S. 2466) do address areas of major importance to the future effectiveness of our health care system. The umbrella agency approach would provide the coordinating mechanism essential to sound planning for health services and would provide access of the Institutes' director to top policymakers in DHEW and in Congress. The National Center for the Evaluation of Medical Technologies would provide leadership and coordination of efforts to assure both safety and necessity of new technological advances. We think it wise to point out, as was done by Senator Javits when S. 2466 was introduced, that this Institute will not \"inhibit innovation and research in the development of new medical technology.\" Inadequate evaluation of 2 277 apparent breakthrou ghs in the past are now causing skepticism on the part of the public. The large scale development of coronary care centers has been questioned in the .past year or so by researchers who claim mortality rates are not significantly affected by the spending of those hundreds of millions of dollars. The cost and value of neonatology intensive care centers are currently being questioned in the public press. Solid evaluation by the proposed Institute, to be done in controlled settings, would provide more effective public policy guidance. It will be important to assure that cost factors alone are never allowed to be the overriding factor in decision making in relation to the use of technology in health delivery. We feel that nursing research is an element that needs to be included in such studies. ANA's research priorities speak to this as one of our key areas of interest. These priorities include; Studies to improve the outlook for high risk parents and high risk infants. Studies to improve the health care of the elderly. Studies of life threatening situations, anxiety, pain and stress. Studies of adaptation to chronic illness and the development of self-care systems and group care systems. Studies to facilitate the successful utilization of new technological developments in patient care. ANA supports the third focus of the bill, the creation of a stronger Center for Health Statistics. We agree with the chairman that adequate data is essential to plan and evaluate national programs. Morbidity and mortality studies, for example, are essential and must be of the highest caliber to guide policy. 3 28 -7 90 0 - 78 - 1 9 278 Short term political goal s should not interfere with such data development. We have concerns currently about the exclusion of certain types of expertise from the health statistics expert committees. We therefore urge the legislative requirement that the National Committee on Health Statistics include persons specifically distinguished in the C fields of health manpower and health facilities statistics. The nursing field, for one, has several such experts, and quality manpower studies have been done on nursing needs and resources for many, many years. To exclude experts from these fields will continue to result in duplication of studies, unnecessary errors in developing the studies' methodologies, and extra cost to the taxpayer. The fourth purpose of S. 2466 is to create a more comprehensive program for health services research to be named the National Institute for Health Policy Research. The name can be misleading but our understanding is that research demonstrations and evaluation of new or different methods of delivering care will be its focus leading to policy development through research. Hospice care, currently receiving public attention, might be an example of one type of care to be so demonstrated in a variety of situations and evaluated prior to implementation of a national program. We heartily agree that health services research needs to be a more prominent and aggressive program. Long term support needs to be assured so that subsidized large scale (costly) demonstration studies can be conducted on many issues. Nursing has long sought demonstration funds to try new patterns of * delivering nursing care. Nursing research needs to be tested in controlled settings. Then when proven effective, those findings must be more quickly put into general nursing practice. 4 279 In 1968, the HEW Program Review Committee evaluating the effectiveness of the 1964 Nurse Training Act recommended a stronger Federal focus for nursing to tie research services and education together. It specifically recommended that federal funds be substantially increased for all mechanisms of support to accelerate and advance: research into all aspects of nursing practice, the organization and delivery of nursing services to the patient, nursing as an occupation, and ways of communicating research findings; research training, as a necessary adjunct to prepare nurses to do independent research, to collaborate in interdisciplinary research, and to stimulate and guide research important to nursing. Demonstration grants are still one of the missing links. In fact, there has been real interest on the part of nurse researchers to have an Institute of Nursing Research. However, administration support has not been evident for such an Institute, Center or Bureau. It seems extremely short sighted when the health care system employs close to one million registered nurses, almost one half million licensed practical nurses and many thousands of nursing assistants to have so little attention paid to research that could significantly Improve the utilization of those groups, possibly saving millions of dollars in federally funded health programs alone. Yet for fiscal year 1979 the administration requested \u00a3 funding for nursing research! We have had to work hard to get research project funding up to $5 million for this year. Congressional recognition of the potential impact of such research on the health delivery system has saved that program repeatedly. Only one million dollars a year is being spent to prepare nursing researchers. Again a short sighted view it seems. 5 It no w is timely to suggest the inclusion in S 2466 of a Center for Nur sing Research. This would not detract at all from the essential participation of nurse researchers in the Institute's other interdisciplinary health services research. In fact that element is essential. We do think it is appropriate that, in addition, nursing research should have a line item in the budget of such an institute and an administrative structure allowing it to participate effectively in policy making. Such a Center would assure that and would make it possible to do demonstration studies and get significant results into practice settings fairly quickly. We urge your committee to add a specific amendment to S 2466 to include a Center for Nursing Research within the proposed Institute for Health Services Research. Coordinating linkages could be built in to promote effective cooperative relationships with other units of government which fund nursing education and/or pertinent studies of importance to the delivery of nursing care. We suggest that the director of the Center for Nursing Research be given that coordinating responsibility. Finally we want to comment on the opposition of HEW to S 2466. The reasons for opposing and the problems addressed by Dr. Richmond in his testimony of February 7 are real. We know how hard it is for programs to move ahead when too frequent restructuring and reorganization occur. Staff energies are dissipated and pressures to produce needed administrative documents distract from programs moving forward. A major change has just been implemented within HEW. We think the changes proposed in S 2466 are appropriate at this time. If however, you should decide 281 to delay action for two years as HEW requested we urge that you suggest the department include nurse researchers in all of its deliberations and its internal studies. In closing, we do support the several thrusts of S 2466. Important areas of health research essential tc sound planning for the health system of the future need more attention and more support and soon. We want to work with the Congress and with the Administration as the best methods of implementing such changes are worked out. We think S 2466 offers a very good start for the necessary movement to improve the existing programs. We ask that this statement be made a part of the hearing record. 2-21-78 7 J AMER ICAN NURSES' ASSOCIATIONA Preparation of Nurses for Participation in Research Com mission on Nursing ResearchIn me eting its oblig at io n to th e pro fes sion of nursing and to society, the C ommission on Nursing Research of the Am erican Nurses' Association presents g uid elines io r the preparation of nurses for pa rticipa tio n in and ut iliza tio n of research.

They also prov ide members of othe r discipline s and the pu blic with inform ation up on which to base th ei r expectations of the nurse inv estigator. The guide lines are also an app roach to im plem en tatio n of the research aspects of the S tindirds for Nursing Education .' New know ledg e < oo ee ming human health and response to illness is accruin g at an ex po ne ntial rate. For nursing as to r othe r discip lines such tre ow \u00ad ledg e dem ands co ntinue d systematic investigation of both co nten t and process. Explicit emphasis on preparation fo r such research has be come an^ncreasing co nc ern of the profession. The Co mm ission on Nursing Research Of the Am erican Nurses' Association recognizes the-essential nature of research in the co nt inuing effo rt to im prov e nursing practice. As re\u00ad po rte d bv the Nation al Comm ission fo r the Study of Nursing and Nursing Education,- very little research has been do ne on the actual effects of nursing interven tio n and care. This points to the need for gre ater emphasis on edu ca tio n for research for the improv em en t of practice. If e du ca tio n fo r nursing research is to be useful and effective it should includ e bo th the d ev el\u00ad op ment and testing of the or y and the ap plication of findings. An attitud e of inqu iry and an in trod uc tion to research should be initiated in the early phases of undergraduate education . A clim ate should be foste red in which the find ing s of research are sou ght and utilize d in the provision of patient care. In ad ditio n to pr ov iding the nurse with a fu nd of usable scien tific know ledg e, un de rgraduate ed uc ation sho uld in \u00ad clu de bo th an introduct io n to and a be ginn ing experience in the research process. On the undergradu ate leve l, ed uc ation for research sho uld prepare the nurse to read research critica lly and to determine its value to prac tice. It should also p ro vide an understandin g of the rights and responsib ilities of pa rticip ants in research as we ll as of the rights of subjects. The prep aration of nurse researchers involves supervised activities in an investigative program includ in g observa tion of and pa rticipa tio n in all phases o f research, from th e de finitio n of a researcha ble prob lem th ro ug h the dissem ination and u tili\u00ad zation of fin din gs.

As more nurses are prepare d fo r pa rticipa tio n in research throug h undergraduate, gra duate, and co nt inuing education , new know ledg e resultin g from research sh ould increasingly pertain to the effects of nursing in te rv en tio n and care, and an observable impact on pra ctice can be expec ted.

Continuing education rele\u00ad vant to research must take several forms. Offerings of subject matter analogous to .those listed above for undergraduate and graduate education should provide the opportu nity for nurses to update their skills in re\u00ad search and to be introduced to the research process. Programs should be developed for nurse educators, nursing service administrators, and nurse practitioners, which will encourage improved climates supportive of open inquiry by nurse researchers and the furtherance of research in patient care. Through sound programs of continuing education\u2014 including symposia, colloquia, and seminars as well a s formal education\u2014active nurse researchers will be able to extend their knowlege, improve their understanding of the substantive base of research, and incorporate new concepts and methods in research. The practi\u00ad tioner will be better prepared to function as a partici\u00ad pant in and implementor of nursing research and its findings and to ass ess nursing interventions and patient outcomes within a research framework. The adminis\u00ad trator will have an expanded information base for deci\u00ad sion making related to the support and implementation of research studies and findings. REFERENCES 1.

In th e p a s t, J 5 286 we have given strong suppo rt and cooperation to the activities that have been conducted in these areas, particularly those of the National Center for Health Services Research and the National Center for Health Statistics. Further, we have clearly recognized the need for improved methods in the evaluation of advances in medical technology. Nonetheless, while these goals are commendable, we further recognize that there is no existing, specific model for the development of an N1HCR. The lack of such a model necessitates careful study and evaluation, and subsequent phasing and testing, of a variety of approaches in the development and implementation of such an endeavor. In many of its aspects, S.2466's development of research approaches and methodologies for the health care service area can take into consideration the pattern utilized in biomedical research under the National Institutes of Health. These national approaches recognize an important role of the federal government, as well as nonfederal activities, in health care research. It is our belief that, in exercising its role, the federal government must develop a coordinating and a supporting mechanism for carrying out this vast task through extramural, as well as intramural, activities. We therefore recognize the basic need for a federal organizational structure\u2014 a focus\u2014 which brings together under its direction many of the governmental con\u00ad tributors to such efforts and, where such direction is inappropriate, coordinates the activities carried out beyond its direct administrative purview. Such a federal structure also requires the development of an effective, broad-scale extramural program to encourage and assist existing, and develop additional, nonfederal resources\u2014 resources which are essential to the achievement of the legislation's goals. r2 287 National Institute for Health Policy and Research Section 102 of S.2466 would amend Section 305 of the Public Health Service Act by establishing within the NIHCR a National Institute for Health Policy Research. In our review of the amendments proposed to Section 305 of the Act, we have identified limited changes in the basic authority of the existing National Center for Health Services Research. One change, that of undertaking and supporting research evaluation and demonstra- tion projects in \"the uses of computer science in health services delivery and medical information systems,\" appears to be substantial. In this connection, we certainly support the development of computer science for health services delivery and medical information systems, and the identification of this area as a responsibility of the NIHPR. However, we believe that, in the categorization of responsibilities, it will be necessary to make a distinction between those that are appropriately a function of NIHPR, and the application and evaluation of computer science, as utilized in computer-assisted technologies, such as CT Scanners, cardiac catheterization systems, and microcomputer and microprocessor controls. These latter applications and evaluations in the clinical setting would probably be more appropriately a function of the National Center for the Evaluation of Medical Technology. Our review also indicates that the legislation proposes no advisory council or committee for the NIHPR. Because the present and future activities of the NIHPR, as well as such activities of the NIHSE and the NCEMT, will involve a close, cooperative effort between federal and nonfederal activities, we believe that an advisory council or committee should be established. We further recommend ) that such a council or committee be composed of individuals from both the private and public sectors, who would bring competence to this body from the fields of 3 A law , ec on om ics, scie n c e in I t s b ro a d e st d e f in itio n , p h y s ic ia n s , h o s p ita l ad m in is tr a to rs , h e a lth in s u r e r s , and co ns um er s.

These latter responsibilities in many ways include subject matters that might well be assigned to the NIHPR. Such categorization difficulties highlight the fact that no pattern has been established for such efforts, and that considerable study of the appropriate structure for managing this task is needed before any rigid boundaries are established. In the activities of this center, as in those of the other institutes included in the NIHCR, we believe that it is important there be recognition of a very significant responsibility which will have to be carried out in the nonfederal sector. While supporting the legislation's provision for establishment of an advisory council for the NCEMT, we suggest that, because of the overlap of activities among the NIHPR, NIHSE, and NCEMT\u2014 all of which will have impact on evaluations of medical technology that will be conducted, as well as, \"to the extent practicable, the development of exemplary standards, norms, and criteria concerning the utilization of particular technologies\"\u2014 consideration be given to the development of an overall council. The overall council's responsibilities would encompass those of the NIHCR, with other advisory committees or councils responsible for the specific activities, respectively, of the NIHPR, NIHSE, and NCEMT. With particular reference to the proposed Council for the Evaluation of Medical Technology, and in recognition of the far-reaching effects of the recommendations which the council will provide, we believe that it should include specific 5 representation from major health care constituenc ies. These constituencies will be affected by the recommended codes, criteria, and standards and therefore should have the opportunity for input. The bill provides that the council membership include 16 persons (seven from the fields of medicine or science, two from economics, and two from law, as well as five whose areas of expertise are not delineated), and certain specified ex officio members from departments of the federal government. We urge that there be a definition of members from medicine, as well as from the broader area of science, and that there be representation from hospital administration. We are concerned about the application of recommendations that result from the evaluation of medical technology. The drafters of S.2466 seem to recognize this problem. The bill states that \"after consultation with appropriate public and private entities,\" the council should \"develop, when appropriate and to the extent practicable [emphasis added], exemplary standards, norms, and criteria concerning the utilization of particular medical technologies.\" It is important to recognize that there are many examples in medicine, and in other areas, of early development of technologies which, on first review, appeared to provide little clinical promise, and from a cost benefit aspect seemed inefficient. However, after further development, they became both promising and cost effective, resulting in technologies of benefit both for clinical and/or administrative purposes. It is therefore exceedingly Important that, in the development and implementation of this legislation, those exemplary standards, norms, and criteria which are developed encourage, rather than stifle, initiative, creativity, experimentation, and flexibility. 291 Authorizations The AHA believes that the authorizations as identified for each of the activities within the NIHCR reflect the important element that such funding will play in the assistance and development of nonfederal activity. We believe, as we have Indicated before, that there is need for federal intramural activity in this area. We are strongly convinced, on the other hand, that the vast majority of this activity will have to be conducted in the nonfederal arena, as is done in the National Institutes of Health. It is our understanding that approximately 83 percent of National Institutes of Health expenditures are in the nonfederal setting, and we would recommend that authorizations for funding the NIHCR recognize this long-established research pattern. Conclusion We wish to express the Association's appreciation for this opportunity to present our comments and recommendations on S.2466 and to offer our assistance and technical support in the strengthening of this legislation. 7 292 Sena tor K ennedy .
