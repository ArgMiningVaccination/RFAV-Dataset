Possible autism? I have. 17 mo old who I think might have autism. Stuff he does that worries me are: - lines up objects - over focuses on things, small objects he'll bring up to his eyes - walks on tippy toes occasionally - has maybe 5-6 words but they're word approximations - doesn't wave What he can do: - Just started pointing recently - good joint attention - answers to his name 70-80% of the time - I feel like he understands things when I say where's your puppy he'll look at them or when I say throw your diaper away he'll put it in trash - start signing \"more\" - plays w kids - gives hugs and kisses - sleeps well and eats well - dances What do you guys think? Thanks.

My son was just given an ASD diagnosis at 2.5 yrs. He has good joint attention, sleeps well, and some other good qualities, but was lacking in some areas you mentioned your son is doing well as well. It's super hard to accept/come to terms with if he is on the spectrum, however you are being proactive and once possibly getting the help you need! Not saying he is on spectrum don't want to stress you, but I encourage you not to wait to get an evaluation either, for both his benefit as well as your mental health! Good luck what other signs did he show? thanks for commenting but yes what kind of symptoms does he show ? And does your LO say words. so sorry I didn't see this! He has some repetitive habits like opening and closing doors and light switches, he doesn't have any words, he looks at his hands very close to his eyes and tenses his body when excited has your pediatrician evaluated for autism? I would talk to them. My non autistic child was exactly the same has my child with autism until approx 17-18 months. sorry could you say the last part again ? I wasn't sure what it said If I were you, I'd make an immediate appt with your child's dr and also schedule an appt for early intervention evaluation to determine if and why he has any developmental delays--these will either validate your concerns or resolve the anxiety I don't want to minimize your concerns, and every autistic person is different, but the behaviors you describe as possibly indicating autism are all normal for young toddlers. I think asd would be more likely if there were social, sleep, feeding, and sensory issues that significantly impact daily life. yes I have his app at 18 mo I'll deff will bring it up to her! Thank you for your comment! Speak with the pediatric Would your baby flap his hands when being an infant ?
