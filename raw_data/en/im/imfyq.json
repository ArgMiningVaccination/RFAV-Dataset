Directive 92/26/EEC of 31 March 1992 concerning the classifi \u00ad cation for the supply of medicinal products for human use ( 1 ), Council Directive 92/27/EEC of 31 March 1992 on the labelling of medicinal products for human use and on package leaflets ( 2 ), Council Directive 92/28/EEC of 31 March 1992 on the adver \u00ad tising of medicinal products for human use ( 3 ), Council Directive 92/73/EEC of 22 September 1992 widening the scope of Directives 65/65/EEC and 75/319/EEC on the approximation of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action relating to medicinal products and laying down additional provisions on homeopathic medicinal products ( 4 ) have been frequently and substantially amended. In the interests of clarity and rationality, the said Directives should therefore be codified by assembling them in a single text. (2) The essential aim of any rules governing the production, distribution and use of medicinal products must be to safeguard public health. (3) However, this objective must be attained by means which will not hinder the development of the pharmaceutical industry or trade in medicinal products within the Community. (4) Trade in medicinal products within the Community is hindered by disparities between certain national provisions, in particular between provisions relating to medicinal products (excluding substances or combinations of substances which are foods, animal feeding-stuffs or toilet preparations), and such disparities directly affect the functioning of the internal market. (5) Such hindrances must accordingly be removed; whereas this entails approximation of the relevant provisions. (6) In order to reduce the disparities which remain, rules should be laid down on the control of medicinal products and the duties incumbent upon the Member States' competent authorities should be specified with a view to ensuring compliance with legal requirements. (7) The concepts of harmfulness and therapeutic efficacy can only be examined in relation to each other and have only a relative significance depending on the progress of scientific knowledge and the use for which the medicinal product is intended. The particulars and documents which must accompany an application for marketing authorization for a medicinal product demonstrate that potential risks are outweighed by the therapeutic efficacy of the product. (8) Standards and protocols for the performance of tests and trials on medicinal products are an effective means of control of these products and hence of protecting public health and can facilitate the movement of these products by laying down uniform rules applicable to tests and trials, the compilation of dossiers and the examination of applications. B 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 3 ( 1 ) OJ L 113, 30.4.1992, p. 5. ( 2 ) OJ L 113, 30.4.1992, p. 8. ( 3 ) OJ L 113, 30.4.1992, p. 13. ( 4 ) OJ L 297, 13.10.1992, p. 8. (9) Experience has shown that it is advisable to stipulate more precisely the cases in which the results of toxicological and phar \u00ad macological tests or clinical trials do not have to be provided with a view to obtaining authorization for a medicinal product which is essentially similar to an authorized product, while ensuring that innovative firms are not placed at a disadvantage. (10) However, there are reasons of public policy for not conducting repetitive tests on humans or animals without over-riding cause. (11) The adoption of the same standards and protocols by all the Member States will enable the competent authorities to arrive at their decisions on the basis of uniform tests and by reference to uniform criteria and will therefore help to avoid differences in evaluation. (12) With the exception of those medicinal products which are subject to the centralized Community authorization procedure established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 of 22 July 1993 laying down Community procedures for the authorization and super \u00ad vision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products ( 1 ) a marketing authorization for a medicinal product granted by a competent authority in one Member State ought to be recognized by the competent authorities of the other Member States unless there are serious grounds for supposing that the authorization of the medicinal product concerned may present a risk to public health. In the event of a disagreement between Member States about the quality, the safety or the efficacy of a medicinal product, a scientific evaluation of the matter should be undertaken according to a Community standard, leading to a single decision on the area of disagreement binding on the Member States concerned. Whereas this decision should be adopted by a rapid procedure ensuring close cooperation between the Commission and the Member States. (13) For this purpose, a Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products should be set up attached to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products established in the abovemen \u00ad tioned Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93. (14) This Directive represents an important step towards achievement of the objective of the free movement of medicinal products. Further measures may abolish any remaining barriers to the free movement of proprietary medicinal products will be necessary in the light of experience gained, particularly in the abovementioned Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products. (15) In order better to protect public health and avoid any unnecessary duplication of effort during the examination of application for a marketing authorization for medicinal products, Member States should systematically prepare assessment reports in respect of each medicinal product which is authorized by them, and exchange the reports upon request. Furthermore, a Member State should be able to suspend the examination of an application for authorization to place a medicinal product on the market which is currently under active consideration in another Member State with a view to recognizing the decision reached by the latter Member State. B 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 4 ( 1 ) OJ L 214, 24.8.1993, p. 1. Regulation as amended by Commission Regu \u00ad lation (EC) No 649/98 (OJ L 88, 24.3.1998, p. 7). (16) Following the establishment of the internal market, specific controls to guarantee the quality of medicinal products imported from third countries can be waived only if appropriate arrangements have been made by the Community to ensure that the necessary controls are carried out in the exporting country. (17) It is necessary to adopt specific provisions for immunological medicinal products, homeopathic medicinal products, radiophar \u00ad maceuticals, and medicinal products based on human blood or human plasma. (18) Any rules governing radiopharmaceuticals must take into account the provisions of Council Directive 84/466/Euratom of 3 September 1984 laying down basic measures for the radiation protection of persons undergoing medical examination or treat \u00ad ment ( 1 ). Account should also be taken of Council Directive 80/836/Euratom of 15 July 1980 amending the Directives laying down the basic safety standards for the health protection of the general public and workers against the dangers of ionizing radiation ( 2 ), the objective of which is to prevent the exposure of workers or patients to excessive or unnecessarily high levels of ionizing radiation, and in particular of Article 5c thereof, which requires prior authorization for the addition of radioactive substances to medicinal products as well as for the importation of such medicinal products. (19) The Community entirely supports the efforts of the Council of Europe to promote voluntary unpaid blood and plasma donation to attain self-sufficiency throughout the Community in the supply of blood products, and to ensure respect for ethical principles in trade in therapeutic substances of human origin. (20) The rules designed to guarantee the quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products derived from human blood or human plasma must be applied in the same manner to both public and private establishments, and to blood and plasma imported from third countries. (21) Having regard to the particular characteristics of these homeo \u00ad pathic medicinal products, such as the very low level of active principles they contain and the difficulty of applying to them the conventional statistical methods relating to clinical trials, it is desirable to provide a special, simplified registration procedure for those homeopathic medicinal products which are placed on the market without therapeutic indications in a pharmaceutical form and dosage which do not present a risk for the patient. (22) The anthroposophic medicinal products described in an official pharmacopoeia and prepared by a homeopathic method are to be treated, as regards registration and marketing authorization, in the same way as homeopathic medicinal products.

Directive repealed with effect from 13 May 2000 by Directive 97/43/Euratom (OJ L 180, 9.7.1997, p. 22). ( 2 ) OJ L 246, 17.9.1980, p. 1. Directive as amended by Directive 84/467/Euratom (OJ L 265, 5.10.1984, p. 4), repealed with effect from 13 May 2000 by Directive 96/29/Euratom (OJ L 314, 4.12.1996, p. 20). (23) It is desirable in the first instance to provide users of these homeopathic medicinal products with a very clear indication of their homeopathic character and with sufficient guarantees of their quality and safety. (23) It is desirable in the first instance to provide users of these homeopathic medicinal products with a very clear indication of their homeopathic character and with sufficient guarantees of their quality and safety. (24) The rules relating to the manufacture, control and inspection of homeopathic medicinal products must be harmonized to permit the circulation throughout the Community of medicinal products which are safe and of good quality. (25) The usual rules governing the authorization to market medicinal products should be applied to homeopathic medicinal products placed on the market with therapeutic indications or in a form which may present risks which must be balanced against the desired therapeutic effect. In particular, those Member States which have a homeopathic tradition should be able to apply particular rules for the evaluation of the results of tests and trials intended to establish the safety and efficacy of these medicinal products provided that they notify them to the Commission. (26) In order to facilitate the movement of medicinal products and to prevent the controls carried out in one Member State from being repeated in another, minimum requirements should be laid down for manufacture and imports coming from third countries and for the grant of the authorization relating thereto. (27) It should be ensured that, in the Member States, the supervision and control of the manufacture of medicinal products is carried out by a person who fulfils minimum conditions of qualification. (28) Before an authorization to market an immunological medicinal product or derived from human blood or human plasma can be granted, the manufacturer must demonstrate his ability to attain batch-to-batch consistency. Before an authorization to market a medicinal product derived from human blood or human plasma can be granted, the manufacturer must also demonstrate the absence of specific viral contamination, to the extent that the state of technology permits. (29) The conditions governing the supply of medicinal products to the public should be harmonized. (30) In this connection persons moving around within the Community have the right to carry a reasonable quantity of medicinal products lawfully obtained for their personal use. It must also be possible for a person established in one Member State to receive from another Member State a reasonable quantity of medicinal products intended for his personal use. (31) In addition, by virtue of Regulation (EC) No 2309/93, certain medicinal products are the subject of a Community marketing authorization. In this context, the classification for the supply of medicinal products covered by a Community marketing auth \u00ad orization needs to be established. It is therefore important to set the criteria on the basis of which Community decisions will be taken. B 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 6 (32) It is therefore appropriate, as an initial step, to harmonize the basic principles applicable to the classification for the supply of medicinal products in the Community or in the Member State concerned, while taking as a starting point the principles already established on this subject by the Council of Europe as well as the work of harmonization completed within the framework of the United Nations, concerning narcotic and psychotropic substances. (33) The provisions dealing with the classification of medicinal products for the purpose of supply do not infringe the national social security arrangements for reimbursement or payment for medicinal products on prescription. (34) Many operations involving the wholesale distribution of medicinal products for human use may cover several Member States simultaneously. (35) It is necessary to exercise control over the entire chain of distribution of medicinal products, from their manufacture or import into the Community through to supply to the public, so as to guarantee that such products are stored, transported and handled in suitable conditions. The requirements which must be adopted for this purpose will considerably facilitate the with \u00ad drawal of defective products from the market and allow more effective efforts against counterfeit products. (36) Any person involved in the wholesale distribution of medicinal products should be in possession of a special authorization. Phar \u00ad macists and persons authorized to supply medicinal products to the public, and who confine themselves to this activity, should be exempt from obtaining this authorization. It is however necessary, in order to control the complete chain of distribution of medicinal products, that pharmacists and persons authorized to supply medicinal products to the public keep records showing trans \u00ad actions in products received. (37) Authorization must be subject to certain essential conditions and it is the responsibility of the Member State concerned to ensure that such conditions are met; whereas each Member State must recognize authorizations granted by other Member States. (38) Certain Member States impose on wholesalers who supply medicinal products to pharmacists and on persons authorized to supply medicinal products to the public certain public service obligations. Those Member States must be able to continue to impose those obligations on wholesalers established within their territory. They must also be able to impose them on wholesalers in other Member States on condition that they do not impose any obligation more stringent than those which they impose on their own wholesalers and provided that such obligations may be regarded as warranted on grounds of public health protection and are proportionate in relation to the objective of such protection. (39) Rules should be laid down as to how the labelling and package leaflets are to be presented. B 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 7 (40) The provisions governing the information supplied to users should provide a high degree of consumer protection, in order that medicinal products may be used correctly on the basis of full and comprehensible information. (41) The marketing of medicinal products whose labelling and package leaflets comply with this Directive should not be prohibited or impeded on grounds connected with the labelling or package leaflet. (42) This Directive is without prejudice to the application of measures adopted pursuant to Council Directive 84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 relating to the approximation of the laws, regu \u00ad lations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning misleading advertising ( 1 ). (43) All Member States have adopted further specific measures concerning the advertising of medicinal products. There are disparities between these measures. These disparities are likely to have an impact on the functioning of the internal market, since advertising disseminated in one Member State is likely to have effects in other Member States. (44) Council Directive 89/552/EEC of 3 October 1989 on the coor \u00ad dination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities ( 2 ) prohibits the television advertising of medicinal products which are available only on medical prescription in the Member State within whose juris \u00ad diction the television broadcaster is located. This principle should be made of general application by extending it to other media. (45) Advertising to the general public, even of non-prescription medicinal products, could affect public health, were it to be excessive and ill-considered. Advertising of medicinal products to the general public, where it is permitted, ought therefore to satisfy certain essential criteria which ought to be defined. (46) Furthermore, distribution of samples free of charge to the general public for promotional ends must be prohibited. (47) The advertising of medicinal products to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them contributes to the information available to such persons. Nevertheless, this advertising should be subject to strict conditions and effective monitoring, referring in particular to the work carried out within the framework of the Council of Europe. (48) Advertising of medicinal products should be subject to effective, adequate monitoring. Reference in this regard should be made to the monitoring mechanisms set up by Directive 84/450/EEC. (49) Medical sales representatives have an important role in the promotion of medicinal products. Therefore, certain obligations should be imposed upon them, in particular the obligation to supply the person visited with a summary of product character \u00ad istics. B 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 8 ( 1 ) OJ L 250, 19.9.1984, p. 17. Directive as amended by Directive 97/55/EC (OJ L 290, 23.10.1997, p. 18). ( 2 ) OJ L 298, 17.10.1989, p. 23. Directive as amended by Directive 97/36/EC (OJ L 202, 30.7.1997, p. 60). (50) Persons qualified to prescribe medicinal products must be able to carry out these functions objectively without being influenced by direct or indirect financial inducements. (51) It should be possible within certain restrictive conditions to provide samples of medicinal products free of charge to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them so that they can familiarize themselves with new products and acquire experience in dealing with them. (52) Persons qualified to prescribe or supply medicinal products must have access to a neutral, objective source of information about products available on the market. Whereas it is nevertheless for the Member States to take all measures necessary to this end, in the light of their own particular situation. (53) Each undertaking which manufactures or imports medicinal products should set up a mechanism to ensure that all information supplied about a medicinal product conforms with the approved conditions of use. (54) In order to ensure the continued safety of medicinal products in use, it is necessary to ensure that pharmacovigilance systems in the Community are continually adapted to take account of scientific and technical progress. (55) It is necessary to take account of changes arising as a result of international harmonisation of definitions, terminology and tech \u00ad nological developments in the field of pharmacovigilance. (56) The increasing use of electronic networks for communication of information on adverse reactions to medicinal products marketed in the Community is intended to allow competent authorities to share the information at the same time. (57) It is the interest of the Community to ensure that the pharmaco \u00ad vigilance systems for centrally authorised medicinal products and those authorised by other procedures are consistent. (58) Holders of marketing authorisations should be proactively responsible for on-going pharmacovigilance of the medicinal products they place on the market. (59) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commis \u00ad sion ( 1 ). (60) The Commission should be empowered to adopt any necessary changes to Annex I in order to take into account scientific and technical progress. (61) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States concerning the time-limits for transposition of the Directives set out in Annex II, Part B.

Title IX shall apply to homeopathic medicinal products, with the exception of those referred to in Article 14(1). M3 CHAPTER 2a Specific provisions applicable to traditional herbal medicinal products Article 16a 1. A simplified registration procedure (hereinafter 'traditional-use registration') is hereby established for herbal medicinal products which fulfil all of the following criteria: (a) they have indications exclusively appropriate to traditional herbal medicinal products which, by virtue of their composition and purpose, are intended and designed for use without the supervision of a medical practitioner for diagnostic purposes or for prescription or monitoring of treatment; (b) they are exclusively for administration in accordance with a specified strength and posology; (c) they are an oral, external and/or inhalation preparation; (d) the period of traditional use as laid down in Article 16c(1)(c) has elapsed; (e) the data on the traditional use of the medicinal product are suffi \u00ad cient; in particular the product proves not to be harmful in the specified conditions of use and the pharmacological effects or efficacy of the medicinal product are plausible on the basis of long-standing use and experience. 2. Notwithstanding Article 1(30), the presence in the herbal medicinal product of vitamins or minerals for the safety of which there is well-documented evidence shall not prevent the product from being eligible for registration in accordance with paragraph 1, provided that the action of the vitamins or minerals is ancillary to that of the herbal active ingredients regarding the specified claimed indication(s). 3. However, in cases where the competent authorities judge that a traditional herbal medicinal product fulfils the criteria for authorisation in accordance with Article 6 or registration pursuant to Article 14, the provisions of this chapter shall not apply. B 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 28 Article 16b 1. The applicant and registration holder shall be established in the Community. 2. In order to obtain traditional-use registration, the applicant shall submit an application to the competent authority of the Member State concerned. Article 16c 1. The application shall be accompanied by: (a) the particulars and documents: (i) referred to in Article 8(3)(a) to (h), (j) and (k); (ii) the results of the pharmaceutical tests referred to in the second indent of Article 8(3)(i); (iii) the summary of product characteristics, without the data specified in Article 11(4); (iv) in case of combinations, as referred to in Article 1(30) or Article 16a(2), the information referred to in Article 16a(1)(e) relating to the combination as such; if the individual active ingredients are not sufficiently known, the data shall also relate to the individual active ingredients; (b) any authorisation or registration obtained by the applicant in another Member State, or in a third country, to place the medicinal product on the market, and details of any decision to refuse to grant an authorisation or registration, whether in the Community or a third country, and the reasons for any such decision; (c) bibliographical or expert evidence to the effect that the medicinal product in question, or a corresponding product has been in medicinal use throughout a period of at least 30 years preceding the date of the application, including at least 15 years within the Community. At the request of the Member State where the appli \u00ad cation for traditional-use registration has been submitted, the Committee for Herbal Medicinal Products shall draw up an opinion on the adequacy of the evidence of the long-standing use of the product, or of the corresponding product. The Member State shall submit relevant documentation supporting the referral; (d) a bibliographic review of safety data together with an expert report, and where required by the competent authority, upon additional request, data necessary for assessing the safety of the medicinal product. Annex I shall apply by analogy to the particulars and documents specified in point (a). 2. A corresponding product, as referred to in paragraph 1(c), is char \u00ad acterised by having the same active ingredients, irrespective of the excipients used, the same or similar intended purpose, equivalent strength and posology and the same or similar route of administration as the medicinal product applied for. M3 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 29 3. The requirement to show medicinal use throughout the period of 30 years, referred to in paragraph 1(c), is satisfied even where the marketing of the product has not been based on a specific authorisation. It is likewise satisfied if the number or quantity of ingredients of the medicinal product has been reduced during that period. 4. Where the product has been used in the Community for less than 15 years, but is otherwise eligible for simplified registration, the Member State where the application for traditional-use registration has been submitted shall refer the product to the Committee for Herbal Medicinal Products. The Member State shall submit relevant documen \u00ad tation supporting the referral. The Committee shall consider whether the other criteria for a simplified registration as referred to in Article 16a are fully complied with. If the Committee considers it possible, it shall establish a Community herbal monograph as referred to in Article 16h(3) which shall be taken into account by the Member State when taking its final decision. Article 16d 1. Without prejudice to Article 16h(1), Chapter 4 of Title III shall apply by analogy to registrations granted in accordance with Article 16a, provided that: (a) a Community herbal monograph has been established in accordance with Article 16h(3), or (b) the herbal medicinal product consists of herbal substances, prep \u00ad arations or combinations thereof contained in the list referred to in Article 16f. 2. For other herbal medicinal products as referred to in Article 16a, each Member State shall, when evaluating an application for traditional-use registration, take due account of registrations granted by another Member State in accordance with this chapter. Article 16e 1. Traditional-use registration shall be refused if the application does not comply with Articles 16a, 16b or 16c or if at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: (a) the qualitative and/or quantitative composition is not as declared; (b) the indications do not comply with the conditions laid down in Article 16a; (c) the product could be harmful under normal conditions of use; (d) the data on traditional use are insufficient, especially if pharmaco \u00ad logical effects or efficacy are not plausible on the basis of long-standing use and experience; M3 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 30 (e) the pharmaceutical quality is not satisfactorily demonstrated. 2. The competent authorities of the Member States shall notify the applicant, the Commission and any competent authority that requests it, of any decision they take to refuse traditional-use registration and the reasons for the refusal. Article 16f 1. A list of herbal substances, preparations and combinations thereof for use in traditional herbal medicinal products shall be established in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 121(2). The list shall contain, with regard to each herbal substance, the indication, the specified strength and the posology, the route of administration and any other information necessary for the safe use of the herbal substance as a traditional medicinal product. 2. If an application for traditional-use registration relates to a herbal substance, preparation or a combination thereof contained in the list referred to in paragraph 1, the data specified in Article 16c(1)(b)(c) and (d) do not need to be provided. Article 16e(1)(c) and (d) shall not apply. 3. If a herbal substance, preparation or a combination thereof ceases to be included in the list referred to in paragraph 1, registrations pursuant to paragraph 2 for herbal medicinal products containing this substance shall be revoked unless the particulars and documents referred to in Article 16c(1) are submitted within three months. Article 16g M10 1. Article 3(1) and (2), Article 4(4), Article 6(1), Article 12, Article 17(1), Articles 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 40 to 52, 70 to 85, 101 to 108b, Article 111(1) and (3), Articles 112, 116, 117, 118, 122, 123, 125, the second paragraph of Article 126, and Article 127 of this Directive as well as Commission Directive 2003/94/EC of 8 October 2003 laying down the principles and guidelines of good manufacturing practice in respect of medicinal products for human use and investi \u00ad gational medicinal products for human use ( 1 ) shall apply, by analogy, to traditional-use registration granted under this Chapter. M3 2. In addition to the requirements of Articles 54 to 65, any labelling and user package leaflet shall contain a statement to the effect that: (a) the product is a traditional herbal medicinal product for use in specified indication(s) exclusively based upon long-standing use; and M3 2001L0083 \u2014 \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 \u2014 31 ( 1 ) OJ L 262, 14.10.2003, p. 22. (b) the user should consult a doctor or a qualified health care practi \u00ad tioner if the symptoms persist during the use of the medicinal product or if adverse effects not mentioned in the package leaflet occur. A Member State may require that the labelling and the user package leaflet shall also state the nature of the tradition in question. 3. In addition to the requirements of Articles 86 to 99, any adver \u00ad tisement for a medicinal product registered under this chapter shall contain the following statement: Traditional herbal medicinal product for use in specified indication(s) exclusively based upon long-standing use. Article 16h 1. A Committee for Herbal Medicinal Products is hereby established.

The Committee for Herbal Medicinal Products shall establish Community herbal monographs for herbal medicinal products with regard to the application of Article 10(1)(a)(ii) as well as traditional herbal medicinal products. The said Committee shall fulfil further responsibilities conferred upon it by provisions of this chapter and other Community law. When Community herbal monographs within the meaning of this paragraph have been established, they shall be taken into account by the Member States when examining an application. Where no such Community herbal monograph has yet been established, other appro \u00ad priate monographs, publications or data may be referred to. When new Community herbal monographs are established, the regis \u00ad tration holder shall consider whether it is necessary to modify the regis \u00ad tration dossier accordingly. The registration holder shall notify any such modification to the competent authority of the Member State concerned. The herbal monographs shall be published. 4. The general provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 relating to the Committee for Human Medicinal Products shall apply by analogy to the Committee for Herbal Medicinal Products.

The report shall include an assessment on the possible extension of traditional-use registration to other categories of medicinal products. B CHAPTER 3 Procedures relevant to the marketing authorization M4 Article 17 1. Member States shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that the procedure for granting a marketing authorisation for medicinal products is completed within a maximum of 210 days after the submission of a valid application. Applications for marketing authorisations in two or more Member States in respect of the same medicinal product shall be submitted in accordance with M10 Articles 28 to 39. 2. Where a Member State notes that another marketing authorisation application for the same medicinal product is being examined in another Member State, the Member State concerned shall decline to assess the application and shall advise the applicant that M10 Articles 28 to 39 apply. Article 18 Where a Member State is informed in accordance with Article 8(3)(1) that another Member State has authorised a medicinal product which is the subject of a marketing authorisation application in the Member State concerned, it shall reject the application unless it was submitted in compliance with M10 Articles 28 to 39. B Article 19 In order to examine the application submitted in accordance with M4 Articles 8, 10, 10a, 10b and 10c , the competent authority of the Member State: 1. must verify whether the particulars submitted in support of the appli \u00ad cation comply with the said M4 Articles 8, 10, 10a, 10b and 10c and examine whether the conditions for issuing an auth \u00ad orization to place medicinal products on the market (marketing auth \u00ad orization) are complied with. 2. may submit the medicinal product, its starting materials and, if need be, its intermediate products or other constituent materials, for testing by M4 an Official Medicines Control Laboratory or a laboratory that a Member State has designated for that purpose in order to ensure that the control methods employed by the manufacturer and described in the particulars accompanying the application in accordance with Article 8(3)(h) are satisfactory. M3 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 34 3. may, where appropriate, require the applicant to supplement the particulars accompanying the application in respect of the items listed in the M4 Articles 8(3), 10, 10a, 10b and 10c . Where the competent authority avails itself of this option, the time limits laid down in Article 17 shall be suspended until such time as the supplementary information required has been provided. Likewise, these time limits shall be suspended for the time allowed the applicant, where appropriate, for giving oral or written explanation. Article 20 Member States shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that: (a) the competent authorities verify that manufacturers and importers of medicinal products coming from third countries are able to carry out manufacture in compliance with the particulars supplied pursuant to Article 8(3)(d), and/or to carry out controls according to the methods described in the particulars accompanying the application in accordance with Article 8(3)(h); (b) the competent authorities may allow manufacturers and importers of medicinal products coming from third countries, M4 in justifiable cases , to have certain stages of manufacture and/or certain of the controls referred to in (a) carried out by third parties; in such cases, the verifications by the competent authorities shall also be made in the establishment designated. Article 21 1. When the marketing authorization is issued, the holder shall be informed, by the competent authorities of the Member State concerned, of the summary of the product characteristics as approved by it. 2. The competent authorities shall take all necessary measures to ensure that the information given in the summary is in conformity with that accepted when the marketing authorization is issued or subsequently. M10 3. The national competent authorities shall, without delay, make publicly available the marketing authorisation together with the package leaflet, the summary of the product characteristics and any conditions established in accordance with Articles 21a, 22 and 22a, together with any deadlines for the fulfilment of those conditions for each medicinal product which they have authorised. 4. The national competent authorities shall draw up an assessment report and make comments on the file as regards the results of the pharmaceutical and pre-clinical tests, the clinical trials, the risk management system and the pharmacovigilance system of the medicinal product concerned. The assessment report shall be updated whenever new information becomes available which is important for the evaluation of the quality, safety or efficacy of the medicinal product concerned. B 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 35 The national competent authorities shall make the assessment report publicly accessible without delay, together with the reasons for their opinion, after deletion of any information of a commercially confidential nature. The justification shall be provided separately for each indication applied for. The public assessment report shall include a summary written in a manner that is understandable to the public. The summary shall contain, in particular, a section relating to the conditions of use of the medicinal product. Article 21a In addition to the provisions laid down in Article 19, a marketing authorisation for a medicinal product may be granted subject to one or more of the following conditions: (a) to take certain measures for ensuring the safe use of the medicinal product to be included in the risk management system; (b) to conduct post-authorisation safety studies; (c) to comply with obligations on the recording or reporting of suspected adverse reactions which are stricter than those referred to in Title IX; (d) any other conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product; (e) the existence of an adequate pharmacovigilance system; (f) to conduct post-authorisation efficacy studies where concerns relating to some aspects of the efficacy of the medicinal product are identified and can be resolved only after the medicinal product has been marketed. Such an obligation to conduct such studies shall be based on the delegated acts adopted pursuant to Article 22b while taking into account the scientific guidance referred to in Article 108a. The marketing authorisation shall lay down deadlines for the fulfilment of these conditions where necessary. Article 22 In exceptional circumstances and following consultation with the applicant, the marketing authorisation may be granted subject to certain conditions, in particular relating to the safety of the medicinal product, notification to the national competent authorities of any incident relating to its use, and action to be taken. M10 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 36 The marketing authorisation may be granted only when the applicant can show that he is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety of the medicinal product under normal conditions of use, for objective, verifiable reasons and must be based on one of the grounds set out in Annex I. Continuation of the marketing authorisation shall be linked to the annual reassessment of these conditions. Article 22a 1. After the granting of a marketing authorisation, the national competent authority may impose an obligation on the marketing auth \u00ad orisation holder: (a) to conduct a post-authorisation safety study if there are concerns about the risks of an authorised medicinal product. If the same concerns apply to more than one medicinal product, the national competent authority shall, following consultation with the Phar \u00ad macovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, encourage the marketing authorisation holders concerned to conduct a joint post-authorisation safety study; (b) to conduct a post-authorisation efficacy study when the under \u00ad standing of the disease or the clinical methodology indicate that previous efficacy evaluations might have to be revised significantly. The obligation to conduct the post-authorisation efficacy study shall be based on the delegated acts adopted pursuant to Article 22b while taking into account the scientific guidance referred to in Article 108a. The imposition of such an obligation shall be duly justified, notified in writing, and shall include the objectives and timeframe for submission and conduct of the study. 2. The national competent authority shall provide the marketing auth \u00ad orisation holder with an opportunity to present written observations in response to the imposition of the obligation within a time limit which it shall specify, if the marketing authorisation holder so requests within 30 days of receipt of the written notification of the obligation. 3. On the basis of the written observations submitted by the marketing authorisation holder, the national competent authority shall withdraw or confirm the obligation. Where the national competent authority confirms the obligation, the marketing authorisation shall be varied to include the obligation as a condition of the marketing auth \u00ad orisation and the risk management system shall be updated accordingly. Article 22b 1. In order to determine the situations in which post-authorisation efficacy studies may be required under Articles 21a and 22a of this Directive, the Commission may adopt, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 121a, and subject to the conditions of Articles 121b and 121c, measures supplementing the provisions in Articles 21a and 22a. M10 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 37 2. When adopting such delegated acts, the Commission shall act in accordance with the provisions of this Directive. Article 22c 1. The marketing authorisation holder shall incorporate any conditions referred to in Articles 21a, 22 or 22a in his risk management system. 2. The Member States shall inform the Agency of the marketing authorisations that they have granted subject to conditions pursuant to Articles 21a, 22 or 22a. Article 23 1. After a marketing authorisation has been granted, the marketing authorisation holder shall, in respect of the methods of manufacture and control provided for in Article 8(3)(d) and (h), take account of scientific and technical progress and introduce any changes that may be required to enable the medicinal product to be manufactured and checked by means of generally accepted scientific methods. Those changes shall be subject to the approval of the competent authority of the Member State concerned. 2. The marketing authorisation holder shall forthwith provide the national competent authority with any new information which might entail the amendment of the particulars or documents referred to in Article 8(3), Articles 10, 10a, 10b and 11, or Article 32(5), or Annex I. In particular, the marketing authorisation holder shall forthwith inform the national competent authority of any prohibition or restriction imposed by the competent authorities of any country in which the medicinal product is marketed and of any other new information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the medicinal product concerned. The information shall include both positive and negative results of clinical trials or other studies in all indications and populations, whether or not included in the marketing authorisation, as well as data on the use of the medicinal product where such use is outside the terms of the marketing authorisation. 3. The marketing authorisation holder shall ensure that the product information is kept up to date with the current scientific knowledge, including the conclusions of the assessment and recommendations made public by means of the European medicines web-portal established in accordance with Article 26 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 4. In order to be able to continuously assess the risk-benefit balance, the national competent authority may at any time ask the marketing authorisation holder to forward data demonstrating that the risk-benefit balance remains favourable. The marketing authorisation holder shall answer fully and promptly any such request. M10 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 38 The national competent authority may at any time ask the marketing authorisation holder to submit a copy of the pharmacovigilance system master file. The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the copy at the latest 7 days after receipt of the request. M4 Article 23a After a marketing authorisation has been granted, the holder of the authorisation shall inform the competent authority of the authorising Member State of the date of actual marketing of the medicinal product for human use in that Member State, taking into account the various presentations authorised. M12 If the product ceases to be placed on the market of a Member State, either temporarily or permanently, the marketing authorisation holder shall notify the competent authority of that Member State. Such notifi \u00ad cation shall, other than in exceptional circumstances, be made no less than two months before the interruption in the placing on the market of the product. The marketing authorisation holder shall inform the competent authority of the reasons for such action in accordance with Article 123(2). M4 Upon request by the competent authority, particularly in the context of pharmacovigilance, the marketing authorisation holder shall provide the competent authority with all data relating to the volume of sales of the medicinal product, and any data in his possession relating to the volume of prescriptions. M8 Article 23b 1. The Commission shall adopt appropriate arrangements for the examination of variations to the terms of marketing authorisations granted in accordance with this Directive. 2. The Commission shall adopt the arrangements referred to in paragraph 1 in the form of an implementing regulation. That measure, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, by supple \u00ad menting it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 121(2a). 3. When adopting the arrangements referred to in paragraph 1, the Commission shall make efforts to make it possible to submit a single application for one or more identical changes made to the terms of a number of marketing authorisations. 4. A Member State may continue to apply national provisions on variations applicable at the time of entry into force of the implementing regulation to marketing authorisations granted before 1 January 1998 to medicinal products authorised only in that Member State. Where a medicinal product subject to national provisions in accordance with this Article is subsequently granted a marketing authorisation in another Member State, the implementing regulation shall apply to that medicinal product from that date. 5. Where a Member State decides to continue to apply national provisions pursuant to paragraph 4, it shall notify the Commission thereof. If a notification has not been made by 20 January 2011, the implementing regulation shall apply. M10 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 39 Article 24 1. Without prejudice to paragraphs 4 and 5, a marketing authorisation shall be valid for five years. 2. The marketing authorisation may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the competent authority of the authorising Member State. M10 To this end, the marketing authorisation holder shall provide the national competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including the evaluation of data contained in suspected adverse reactions reports and periodic safety update reports submitted in accordance with Title IX, and information on all variations introduced since the marketing authorisation was granted, at least 9 months before the marketing authorisation ceases to be valid in accordance with paragraph 1. 3. Once renewed, the marketing authorisation shall be valid for an unlimited period, unless the national competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, including exposure of an insufficient number of patients to the medicinal product concerned, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal in accordance with paragraph 2. M4 4. Any authorisation which within three years of its granting is not followed by the actual placing on the market of the authorised product in the authorising Member State shall cease to be valid. 5. When an authorised product previously placed on the market in the authorising Member State is no longer actually present on the market for a period of three consecutive years, the authorisation for that product shall cease to be valid. 6. The competent authority may, in exceptional circumstances and on public health grounds grant exemptions from paragraphs 4 and 5. Such exemptions must be duly justified. B Article 25 Authorization shall not affect the civil and criminal liability of the manufacturer and, where applicable, of the marketing authorization holder. M4 Article 26 1. The marketing authorisation shall be refused if, after verification of the particulars and documents listed in Articles 8, 10, 10a, 10b and 10c, it is clear that: (a) the risk-benefit balance is not considered to be favourable; or (b) its therapeutic efficacy is insufficiently substantiated by the applicant; or (c) its qualitative and quantitative composition is not as declared. M4 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 40 2. Authorisation shall likewise be refused if any particulars or documents submitted in support of the application do not comply with Articles 8, 10, 10a, 10b and 10c. 3. The applicant or the holder of a marketing authorisation shall be responsible for the accuracy of the documents and the data submitted. M10 __________ M4 Article 27 M10 1. A coordination group shall be set up for the following purposes: (a) the examination of any question relating to a marketing authori \u00ad sation of a medicinal product in two or more Member States in accordance with the procedures laid down in Chapter 4; (b) the examination of questions related to the pharmacovigilance of medicinal products authorised by the Member States, in accordance with Articles 107c, 107e, 107g, 107k and 107q; (c) the examination of questions relating to variations of marketing authorisations granted by the Member States, in accordance with Article 35(1). The Agency shall provide the secretariat of this coordination group. For the fulfilment of its pharmacovigilance tasks, including approving risk management systems and monitoring their effectiveness, the coor \u00ad dination group shall rely on the scientific assessment and the recom \u00ad mendations of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee provided for in Article 56(1)(aa) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 2. The coordination group shall be composed of one representative per Member State appointed for a renewable period of 3 years. Member States may appoint an alternate for a renewable period of 3 years. Members of the coordination group may arrange to be accompanied by experts.

CHAPTER 4 Mutual recognition and decentralised procedure M4 Article 28 1. With a view to the granting of a marketing authorisation for a medicinal product in more than one Member State, an applicant shall submit an application based on an identical dossier in these Member States. The dossier shall contain the information and documents referred to in Articles 8, 10, 10a, 10b, 10c and 11. The documents submitted shall include a list of Member States concerned by the application. The applicant shall request one Member State to act as 'reference Member State' and to prepare an assessment report on the medicinal product in accordance with paragraphs 2 or 3. 2. Where the medicinal product has already received a marketing authorisation at the time of application, the concerned Member States shall recognise the marketing authorisation granted by the reference Member State. To this end, the marketing authorisation holder shall request the reference Member State either to prepare an assessment report on the medicinal product or, if necessary, to update any existing assessment report. The reference Member State shall prepare or update the assessment report within 90 days of receipt of a valid application. The assessment report together with the approved summary of product characteristics, labelling and package leaflet shall be sent to the concerned Member States and to the applicant. 3. In cases where the medicinal product has not received a marketing authorisation at the time of application, the applicant shall request the reference Member State to prepare a draft assessment report, a draft summary of product characteristics and a draft of the labelling and package leaflet. The reference Member State shall prepare these draft documents within 120 days after receipt of a valid application and shall send them to the concerned Member States and to the applicant. M10 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 42 4. Within 90 days of receipt of the documents referred to in para \u00ad graphs 2 and 3, the Member States concerned shall approve the assessment report, the summary of product characteristics and the labelling and package leaflet and shall inform the reference Member State accordingly. The reference Member State shall record the agreement of all parties, close the procedure and inform the applicant accordingly. 5. Each Member State in which an application has been submitted in accordance with paragraph 1 shall adopt a decision in conformity with the approved assessment report, the summary of product characteristics and the labelling and package leaflet as approved, within 30 days after acknowledgement of the agreement. Article 29 1. If, within the period laid down in Article 28(4), a Member State cannot approve the assessment report, the summary of product char \u00ad acteristics, the labelling and the package leaflet on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, it shall give a detailed exposition of the reasons for its position to the reference Member State, to the other Member States concerned and to the applicant. The points of disagreement shall be forthwith referred to the coordination group. 2. Guidelines to be adopted by the Commission shall define a potential serious risk to public health. 3. Within the coordination group, all Member States referred to in paragraph 1 shall use their best endeavours to reach agreement on the action to be taken. They shall allow the applicant the opportunity to make his point of view known orally or in writing. If, within 60 days of the communication of the points of disagreement, the Member States reach an agreement, the reference Member State shall record the agreement, close the procedure and inform the applicant accordingly. Article 28(5) shall apply. 4. If the Member States fail to reach an agreement within the 60-day period laid down in paragraph 3, the Agency shall be immediately informed, with a view to the application of the procedure under Articles 32, 33 and 34. The Agency shall be provided with a detailed statement of the matters on which the Member States have been unable to reach agreement and the reasons for their disagreement. A copy shall be forwarded to the applicant. 5. As soon as the applicant is informed that the matter has been referred to the Agency, he shall forthwith forward to the Agency a copy of the information and documents referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 28(1). 6.

Member States shall operate a pharmacovigilance system for the fulfilment of their pharmacovigilance tasks and their participation in Union pharmacovigilance activities. The pharmacovigilance system shall be used to collect information on the risks of medicinal products as regards patients' or public health. That information shall in particular refer to adverse reactions in human beings, arising from use of the medicinal product within the terms of the marketing authorisation as well as from use outside the terms of the marketing authorisation, and to adverse reactions associated with occupational exposure. 2. Member States shall, by means of the pharmacovigilance system referred to in paragraph 1, evaluate all information scientifically, consider options for risk minimisation and prevention and take regu \u00ad latory action concerning the marketing authorisation as necessary. They shall perform a regular audit of their pharmacovigilance system and report the results to the Commission on 21 September 2013 at the latest and then every 2 years thereafter. 3. Each Member State shall designate a competent authority for the performance of pharmacovigilance tasks. 4. The Commission may request Member States to participate, under the coordination of the Agency, in international harmonisation and standardisation of technical measures in relation to pharmacovigilance. Article 102 The Member States shall: (a) take all appropriate measures to encourage patients, doctors, phar \u00ad macists and other healthcare professionals to report suspected adverse reactions to the national competent authority; for these tasks, organisations representing consumers, patients and healthcare professionals may be involved as appropriate; M4 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 85 (b) facilitate patient reporting through the provision of alternative reporting formats in addition to web-based formats; (c) take all appropriate measures to obtain accurate and verifiable data for the scientific evaluation of suspected adverse reaction reports; (d) ensure that the public is given important information on pharmaco \u00ad vigilance concerns relating to the use of a medicinal product in a timely manner through publication on the web-portal and through other means of publicly available information as necessary; (e) ensure, through the methods for collecting information and where necessary through the follow-up of suspected adverse reaction reports, that all appropriate measures are taken to identify clearly any biological medicinal product prescribed, dispensed, or sold in their territory which is the subject of a suspected adverse reaction report, with due regard to the name of the medicinal product, in accordance with Article 1(20), and the batch number; (f) take the necessary measures to ensure that a marketing authorisation holder who fails to discharge the obligations laid down in this Title is subject to effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties. For the purposes of point (a) and (e) of the first paragraph the Member States may impose specific obligations on doctors, pharmacists and other health-care professionals. Article 103 A Member State may delegate any of the tasks entrusted to it under this Title to another Member State subject to a written agreement of the latter. Each Member State may represent no more than one other Member State. The delegating Member State shall inform the Commission, the Agency and all other Member States of the delegation in writing. The delegating Member State and the Agency shall make that information public. Article 104 1. The marketing authorisation holder shall operate a pharmaco \u00ad vigilance system for the fulfilment of his pharmacovigilance tasks equivalent to the relevant Member State's pharmacovigilance system provided for under Article 101(1). 2. The marketing authorisation holder shall by means of the phar \u00ad macovigilance system referred to in paragraph 1 evaluate all information scientifically, consider options for risk minimisation and prevention and take appropriate measures as necessary. M10 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 86 The marketing authorisation holder shall perform a regular audit of his pharmacovigilance system. He shall place a note concerning the main findings of the audit on the pharmacovigilance system master file and, based on the audit findings, ensure that an appropriate corrective action plan is prepared and implemented. Once the corrective actions have been fully implemented, the note may be removed. 3. As part of the pharmacovigilance system, the marketing authori \u00ad sation holder shall: (a) have permanently and continuously at his disposal an appropriately qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance; (b) maintain and make available on request a pharmacovigilance system master file; (c) operate a risk management system for each medicinal product; (d) monitor the outcome of risk minimisation measures which are contained in the risk management plan or which are laid down as conditions of the marketing authorisation pursuant to Articles 21a, 22 or 22a; (e) update the risk management system and monitor pharmacovigilance data to determine whether there are new risks or whether risks have changed or whether there are changes to the benefit-risk balance of medicinal products. The qualified person referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph shall reside and operate in the Union and shall be responsible for the establishment and maintenance of the pharmacovigilance system. The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the name and contact details of the qualified person to the competent authority and the Agency. 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3, national competent authorities may request the nomination of a contact person for phar \u00ad macovigilance issues at national level reporting to the qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance activities. Article 104a 1. Without prejudice to paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Article, holders of marketing authorisations granted before 21 July 2012 shall, by way of derogation from Article 104(3)(c), not be required to operate a risk management system for each medicinal product. 2. The national competent authority may impose an obligation on a marketing authorisation holder to operate a risk management system, as referred to in Article 104(3)(c), if there are concerns about the risks affecting the risk-benefit balance of an authorised medicinal product. In that context, the national competent authority shall also oblige the marketing authorisation holder to submit a detailed description of the risk-management system which he intends to introduce for the medicinal product concerned. M10 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 87 The imposition of such obligations shall be duly justified, notified in writing and shall include the timeframe for submission of the detailed description of the risk-management system. 3. The national competent authority shall provide the marketing auth \u00ad orisation holder with an opportunity to present written observations in response to the imposition of the obligation within a time limit which it shall specify, if the marketing authorisation holder so requests within 30 days of receipt of the written notification of the obligation. 4. On the basis of the written observations submitted by the marketing authorisation holder, the national competent authority shall withdraw or confirm the obligation. Where the national competent authority confirms the obligation, the marketing authorisation shall be varied accordingly to include the measures to be taken as part of the risk management system as conditions of the marketing authorisation referred to in point (a) of Article 21a. Article 105 The management of funds intended for activities connected with phar \u00ad macovigilance, the operation of communication networks and market surveillance shall be under the permanent control of the national competent authorities in order to guarantee their independence in the performance of those pharmacovigilance activities. The first paragraph shall not preclude the national competent authorities from charging fees to marketing authorisation holders for performing those activities by the national competent authorities on the condition that their independence in the performance of those pharmacovigilance activities is strictly guaranteed. CHAPTER 2 Transparency and communications Article 106 Each Member State shall set up and maintain a national medicines web-portal which shall be linked to the European medicines web-portal established in accordance with Article 26 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. By means of the national medicines web-portals, the Member States shall make publicly available at least the following: (a) public assessment reports, together with a summary thereof; (b) summaries of product characteristics and package leaflets; (c) summaries of risk management plans for medicinal products auth \u00ad orised in accordance with this Directive; (d) the list of medicinal products referred to in Article 23 of Regu \u00ad lation (EC) No 726/2004; (e) information on the different ways of reporting suspected adverse reactions to medicinal products to national competent authorities by healthcare professionals and patients, including the web-based structured forms referred to in Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.

As soon as the marketing authorisation holder intends to make a public announcement relating to information on pharmacovigilance concerns in relation to the use of a medicinal product, and in any event at the same time or before the public announcement is made, he shall be required to inform the national competent authorities, the Agency and the Commission. The marketing authorisation holder shall ensure that information to the public is presented objectively and is not misleading. 2. Unless urgent public announcements are required for the protection of public health, the Member States, the Agency and the Commission shall inform each other not less than 24 hours prior to a public announcement relating to information on pharmacovigilance concerns. 3. For active substances contained in medicinal products authorised in more than one Member State, the Agency shall be responsible for the coordination between national competent authorities of safety announcements and shall provide timetables for the information being made public. Under the coordination of the Agency, the Member States shall make all reasonable efforts to agree on a common message in relation to the safety of the medicinal product concerned and the timetables for their distribution. The Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee shall, at the request of the Agency, provide advice on those safety announce \u00ad ments. 4. When the Agency or national competent authorities make public information referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3, any information of a personal or commercially confidential nature shall be deleted unless its public disclosure is necessary for the protection of public health. CHAPTER 3 Recording, reporting and assessment of pharmacovigilance data S e c t i o n 1 R e c o r d i n g a n d r e p o r t i n g o f s u s p e c t e d a d v e r s e r e a c t i o n s Article 107 1. Marketing authorisation holders shall record all suspected adverse reactions in the Union or in third countries which are brought to their attention, whether reported spontaneously by patients or healthcare professionals, or occurring in the context of a post-authorisation study. Marketing authorisation holders shall ensure that those reports are accessible at a single point within the Union. By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, suspected adverse reactions occurring in the context of a clinical trial shall be recorded and reported in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC. M10 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 89 2. Marketing authorisation holders shall not refuse to consider reports of suspected adverse reactions received electronically or by any other appropriate means from patients and healthcare professionals. 3. Marketing authorisation holders shall submit electronically to the database and data-processing network referred to in Article 24 of Regu \u00ad lation (EC) No 726/2004 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Eudravigilance database') information on all serious suspected adverse reactions that occur in the Union and in third countries within 15 days following the day on which the marketing authorisation holder concerned gained knowledge of the event. Marketing authorisation holders shall submit electronically to the Eudra \u00ad vigilance database information on all non-serious suspected adverse reactions that occur in the Union, within 90 days following the day on which the marketing authorisation holder concerned gained knowledge of the event. For medicinal products containing the active substances referred to in the list of publications monitored by the Agency pursuant to Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, marketing authorisation holders shall not be required to report to the Eudravigilance database the suspected adverse reactions recorded in the listed medical literature, but they shall monitor all other medical literature and report any suspected adverse reactions. 4. Marketing authorisation holders shall establish procedures in order to obtain accurate and verifiable data for the scientific evaluation of suspected adverse reaction reports. They shall also collect follow-up information on these reports and submit the updates to the Eudra \u00ad vigilance database. 5. Marketing authorisation holders shall collaborate with the Agency and the Member States in the detection of duplicates of suspected adverse reaction reports. Article 107a 1. Each Member State shall record all suspected adverse reactions that occur in its territory which are brought to its attention from healthcare professionals and patients. Member States shall involve patients and healthcare professionals, as appropriate, in the follow-up of any reports they receive in order to comply with Article 102(c) and (e). Member States shall ensure that reports of such reactions may be submitted by means of the national medicines web-portals or by other means. 2. For reports submitted by a marketing authorisation holder, Member States on whose territory the suspected adverse reaction occurred may involve the marketing authorisation holder in the follow-up of the reports. 3. Member States shall collaborate with the Agency and the marketing authorisation holders in the detection of duplicates of suspected adverse reaction reports. 4. Member States shall, within 15 days following the receipt of the reports of serious suspected adverse reactions referred to in paragraph 1, submit the reports electronically to the Eudravigilance database.

These reports shall be appropriately identified in the forms referred to in Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 6. Unless there are justifiable grounds resulting from pharmaco \u00ad vigilance activities, individual Member States shall not impose any additional obligations on marketing authorisation holders for the reporting of suspected adverse reactions. S e c t i o n 2 P e r i o d i c s a f e t y u p d a t e r e p o r t s Article 107b 1. Marketing authorisation holders shall submit to the Agency periodic safety update reports containing: (a) summaries of data relevant to the benefits and risks of the medicinal product, including results of all studies with a consideration of their potential impact on the marketing authorisation; (b) a scientific evaluation of the risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product; (c) all data relating to the volume of sales of the medicinal product and any data in possession of the marketing authorisation holder relating to the volume of prescriptions, including an estimate of the popu \u00ad lation exposed to the medicinal product. The evaluation referred to in point (b) shall be based on all available data, including data from clinical trials in unauthorised indications and populations. The periodic safety update reports shall be submitted electronically. 2. The Agency shall make available the reports referred to in paragraph 1 to the national competent authorities, the members of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and the coordination group by means of the repository referred to in Article 25a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. M10 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 91 3. By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, the holders of marketing authorisations for medicinal products referred to in Article 10(1), or Article 10a, and the holders of registrations for medicinal products referred to in Articles 14 or 16a, shall submit periodic safety update reports for such medicinal products in the following cases: (a) where such obligation has been laid down as a condition in the marketing authorisation in accordance with Article 21a or Article 22; or (b) when requested by a competent authority on the basis of concerns relating to pharmacovigilance data or due to the lack of periodic safety update reports relating to an active substance after the marketing authorisation has been granted. The assessment reports of the requested periodic safety update reports shall be communicated to the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, which shall consider whether there is a need for a single assessment report for all marketing authorisations for medicinal products containing the same active substance and inform the coordination group or the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use accordingly, in order to apply the procedures laid down in Article 107c(4) and Article 107e. Article 107c 1. The frequency with which the periodic safety update reports are to be submitted shall be specified in the marketing authorisation. The dates of submission according to the specified frequency shall be calculated from the date of the authorisation. 2. Holders of marketing authorisations which were granted before 21 July 2012, and for which the frequency and dates of submission of the periodic safety update reports are not laid down as a condition to the marketing authorisation, shall submit the periodic safety update reports in accordance with the second subparagraph of this paragraph until another frequency or other dates of submission of the reports are laid down in the marketing authorisation or determined in accordance with paragraphs 4, 5 or 6. Periodic safety update reports shall be submitted to the competent auth \u00ad orities immediately upon request or in accordance with the following: (a) where a medicinal product has not yet been placed on the market, at least every 6 months following authorisation and until the placing on the market; (b) where a medicinal product has been placed on the market, at least every 6 months during the first 2 years following the initial placing on the market, once a year for the following 2 years and at three-yearly intervals thereafter. 3. Paragraph 2 shall also apply to medicinal products which are authorised only in one Member State and for which paragraph 4 does not apply. 4. Where medicinal products that are subject to different marketing authorisations contain the same active substance or the same combination of active substances, the frequency and dates of submission of the periodic safety update reports resulting from the application of paragraphs 1 and 2 may be amended and harmonised to enable a single assessment to be made in the context of a periodic safety update report work-sharing procedure and to set a Union reference date from which the submission dates are calculated. M10 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 92 This harmonised frequency for the submission of the reports and the Union reference date may be determined, after consultation of the Phar \u00ad macovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, by one of the following: (a) the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, where at least one of the marketing authorisations for the medicinal products containing the active substance concerned has been granted in accordance with the centralised procedure provided for in Chapter 1 of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004; (b) the coordination group, in other cases than those referred to in point (a). The harmonised frequency for the submission of the reports determined pursuant to the first and second subparagraphs shall be made public by the Agency. Marketing authorisation holders shall submit an application for a variation of the marketing authorisation accordingly. 5. For the purposes of paragraph 4, the Union reference date for medicinal products containing the same active substance or the same combination of active substances shall be one of the following: (a) the date of the first marketing authorisation in the Union of a medicinal product containing that active substance or that combination active substances; (b) if the date referred to in point (a) cannot be ascertained, the earliest of the known dates of the marketing authorisations for a medicinal product containing that active substance or that combination of active substances. 6. Marketing authorisation holders shall be allowed to submit requests to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use or the coordination group, as appropriate, to determine Union reference dates or to change the frequency of submission periodic safety update reports on one of the following grounds: (a) for reasons relating to public health; (b) in order to avoid a duplication of the assessment; (c) in order to achieve international harmonisation. Such requests shall be submitted in writing and shall be duly justified. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use or the coor \u00ad dination group shall, following the consultation with the Pharmaco \u00ad vigilance Risk Assessment Committee, shall either approve or deny such requests. Any change in the dates or the frequency of submission of periodic safety update reports shall be made public by the Agency. The marketing authorisation holders shall accordingly submit an appli \u00ad cation for a variation of the marketing authorisation. 7. The Agency shall make public a list of Union reference dates and frequency of submission of periodic safety update reports by means of the European medicines web-portal. Any change to the dates of submission and frequency of periodic safety update reports specified in the marketing authorisation as a result of the application of paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 shall take effect 6 months after the date of such publication.

A Member State or the Commission, as appropriate, shall, on the basis of concerns resulting from the evaluation of data from pharmaco \u00ad vigilance activities, initiate the procedure provided for in this section by informing the other Member States, the Agency and the Commission where: (a) it considers suspending or revoking a marketing authorisation; (b) it considers prohibiting the supply of a medicinal product; (c) it considers refusing the renewal of a marketing authorisation; or (d) it is informed by the marketing authorisation holder that, on the basis of safety concerns, the holder has interrupted the placing on the market of a medicinal product or has taken action to have a marketing authorisation withdrawn, or intends to take such action or has not applied for the renewal of a marketing authorisation. 1a. A Member State or the Commission, as appropriate, shall, on the basis of concerns resulting from the evaluation of data from pharmaco \u00ad vigilance activities, inform the other Member States, the Agency and the Commission where it considers that a new contraindication, a reduction in the recommended dose or a restriction to the indications of a medicinal product is necessary. The information shall outline the action considered and the reasons therefor. Any Member State or the Commission, as appropriate, shall, when urgent action is considered necessary, initiate the procedure provided for in this section in any of the cases referred to in this paragraph. Where the procedure provided for in this section is not initiated, for medicinal products authorised in accordance with the procedures laid down in Chapter 4 of Title III, the case shall be brought to the attention of the coordination group. Article 31 shall be applicable where the interests of the Union are involved. 1b. Where the procedure provided for in this section is initiated, the Agency shall verify whether the safety concern relates to medicinal products other than the one covered by the information, or whether it is common to all products belonging to the same range or therapeutic class. Where the medicinal product involved is authorised in more than one Member State, the Agency shall without undue delay inform the initiator of the procedure of the outcome of this verification, and the procedures laid down in Articles 107j and 107k shall apply. Otherwise, the safety concern shall be addressed by the Member State concerned. The Agency or the Member State, as applicable, shall make the information that the procedure has been initiated available to marketing authorisation holders.

The information shall include the description of the pharmaceutical form and composition with all the constituents of the finished medicinal product, their amount on a per-unit basis, the function of the constituents of: \u2014 the active substance(s), \u2014 the constituent(s) of the excipients, whatever their nature or the quantity including colouring matter, preservatives, adjuvants, stabilisers, thickeners, emulsifiers, flavouring and aromatic substances, etc., \u2014 the constituents, intended to be ingested or otherwise administered to the patient, of the outer covering of the medicinal products (hard capsules, soft capsules, rectal capsules, coated tablets, films-coated tablets, etc.), M2 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 135 \u2014 these particulars shall be supplemented by any relevant data concerning the type of container and, where appropriate, its manner of closure, together with details of devices with which the medicinal product will be used or administered and which will be delivered with the medicinal product. The 'usual terminology', to be used in describing the constituents of medicinal products, shall mean, notwithstanding the application of the other provisions in Article 8 (3) (c): \u2014 in respect of substances which appear in the European Phar \u00ad macopoeia or, failing this, in the national pharmacopoeia of one of the Member States, the main title at the head of the monograph in question, with reference to the pharmacopoeia concerned, \u2014 in respect of other substances, the international non-proprietary name (INN) recommended by the World Health Organisation, or, failing this, the exact scientific designation; substances not having an international non-proprietary name or an exact scientific desig \u00ad nation shall be described by a statement of how and from what they were prepared, supplemented, where appropriate, by any other relevant details, \u2014 in respect of colouring matter, designation by the 'E' code assigned to them in Council Directive 78/25/EEC of 12 December 1977 on the approximation of the rules of the Member States concerning the colouring matters authorised for use in medicinal products ( 1 ) and/or European Parliament and Council Directive 94/36/EC of 30 June 1994 on colours for use in foodstuffs ( 2 ). In order to give the 'quantitative composition' of the active substance(s) of the finished medicinal products, it is necessary, depending on the pharmaceutical form concerned, to specify the mass, or the number of units of biological activity, either per dosage-unit or per unit of mass or volume, of each active substance. Active substances present in the form of compounds or derivatives shall be designated quantitatively by their total mass, and if necessary or relevant, by the mass of active entity or entities of the molecule. For medicinal products containing an active substance, which is the subject of an application for marketing authorisation in any Member State for the first time, the quantitative statement of an active substance, which is a salt or hydrate shall be systematically expressed in terms of the mass of the active entity or entities in the molecule. All subsequently authorised medicinal products in the Member States shall have their quantitative composition stated in the same way for the same active substance. Units of biological activity shall be used for substances, which cannot be defined molecularly. Where an International Unit of biological activity has been defined by the World Health Organisation, this shall be used. Where no International Unit has been defined, the units of biological activity shall be expressed in such a way as to provide unambiguous information on the activity of the substances by using where applicable the European Pharmacopoeia Units.

Content: basic principles and requirements Special attention shall be paid to the following selected elements. (1) The pharmacological and toxicological tests must show: a) the potential toxicity of the product and any dangerous or unde \u00ad sirable toxic effects that may occur under the proposed conditions of use in human beings; these should be evaluated in relation to the pathological condition concerned; b) the pharmacological properties of the product, in both qualitative and quantitative relationship to the proposed use in human beings. All results must be reliable and of general applicability. Whenever appropriate, mathematical and statistical procedures shall be used in designing the experimental methods and in evaluating the results. Additionally, it is necessary for clinicians to be given information about the therapeutic and toxicological potential of the product. (2) For biological medicinal products such as immunological medicinal products and medicinal products derived from human blood or plasma, the requirements of this Module may have to be adapted for individual products; therefore the testing program carried out shall be justified by the applicant. In establishing the testing program, the following shall be taken into consideration: all tests requiring repeated administration of the product shall be designed to take account of the possible induction of, and inter \u00ad ference by, antibodies; examination of reproductive function, of embryo/foetal and peri-natal toxicity, of mutagenic potential and of carcinogenic potential shall be considered. Where constituents other than the active substance(s) are incriminated, validation of their removal may replace the study. M2 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 141 (3) The toxicology and pharmaco-kinetics of an excipient used for the first time in the pharmaceutical field shall be investigated. (4) Where there is a possibility of significant degradation during storage of the medicinal product, the toxicology of degradation products must be considered. 4.2.1. Pharmacology Pharmacology study shall follow two distinct lines of approach. \u2014 Firstly, the actions relating to the proposed therapeutic use shall be adequately investigated and described. Where possible, recognised and validated assays, both in vivo and in vitro, shall be used. Novel experimental techniques must be described in such detail as to allow them to be reproduced. The results shall be expressed in quantitative terms using, for example, dose-effect curves, time-effect curves, etc. Wherever possible, comparisons shall be made with data relating to a substance or substances with a similar therapeutic action. \u2014 Secondly, the applicant shall investigate the potential undesirable pharmaco-dynamic effects of the substance on physiological func \u00ad tions. These investigations shall be performed at exposures in the anticipated therapeutic range and above. The experimental tech \u00ad niques, unless they are standard procedures, must be described in such detail as to allow them to be reproduced, and the investigator must establish their validity. Any suspected modification of responses resulting from repeated administration of the substance shall be investigated. For the pharmaco-dynamic medicinal product interaction, tests on combinations of active substances may be prompted either by phar \u00ad macological premises or by indications of therapeutic effect. In the first case, the pharmaco-dynamic study shall demonstrate those interactions, which might make the combination of value in therapeutic use. In the second case, where scientific justification for the combination is sought through therapeutic experimentation, the investigation shall determine whether the effects expected from the combination can be demonstrated in animals, and the importance of any collateral effects shall at least be investigated. 4.2.2. Pharmaco-kinetics Pharmaco-kinetics means the study of the fate of the active substance, and its metabolites, within the organism, and covers the study of the absorption, distribution, metabolism (bio-transformation) and excretion of these substances. The study of these different phases may be carried mainly by means of physical, chemical or possibly by biological methods, and by obser \u00ad vation of the actual pharmaco-dynamic activity of the substance itself. Information on distribution and elimination shall be necessary in all cases where such data are indispensable to determine the dosage for humans, and in respect of chemo-therapeutic substances (antibiotics, etc.) and substances whose use depends on their non-pharmaco- dynamic effects (e.g. numerous diagnostic agents, etc.). In vitro studies also can be carried out with the advantage of using human material for comparison with animal material (i.e. protein binding, metabolism, drug-drug interaction). M2 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 142 Pharmaco-kinetic investigation of all pharmacologically active substances is necessary. In the case of new combinations of known substances, which have been investigated in accordance with the provisions of this Directive, pharmaco-kinetic studies may not be required, if the toxicity tests and therapeutic experimentation justify their omission. The pharmaco-kinetic program shall be design to allow comparison and extrapolation between animal and human. 4.2.3. Toxicology a) Single-dose toxicity A single-dose toxicity test shall mean a qualitative and quantitative study of the toxic reactions, which may result from a single admin \u00ad istration of the active substance or substances contained in the medicinal product, in the proportions and physico-chemical state in which they are present in the actual product. The single-dose toxicity test must be carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines published by the Agency. b) Repeat-dose toxicity Repeated dose toxicity tests are intended to reveal any physiological and/or anatomo-pathological changes induced by repeated adminis \u00ad tration of the active substance or combination of active substances under examination, and to determine how these changes are related to dosage. Generally, it is desirable that two tests be performed: one short term, lasting two to four weeks, the other long-term. The duration of the latter shall depend on the conditions of clinical use. Its purpose is to describe potential adverse effects to which attention should be paid in clinical studies. The duration is defined in the relevant guidelines published by the Agency. c) Geno-toxicity The purposes of the study of mutagenic and clastogenic potential is to reveal the changes which a substance may cause in the genetic material of individuals or cells. Mutagenic substances may present a hazard to health since exposure to a mutagen carries the risk of inducing germ-line mutation, with the possibility of inherited disorders, and the risk of somatic mutations including those leading to cancer. These studies are obligatory for any new substance. d) Carcino-genicity Tests to reveal carcinogenic effects shall normally be required: 1. These studies shall be performed for any medicinal product whose expected clinical use is for a prolonged period of a patient's life, either continuously or repeatedly in an intermittent manner. 2. These studies are recommended for some medicinal products if there is concern about their carcinogenic potential, e.g. from product of the same class or similar structure, or from evidence in repeated dose toxicity studies. M2 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 143 3. Studies with unequivocally geno-toxic compounds are not needed, as they are presumed to be trans-species carcinogens, implying a hazard to humans. If such a medicinal product is intended to be administered chronically to humans a chronic study may be necessary to detect early tumorigenic effects. e) Reproductive and developmental toxicity Investigation of possible impairment of male or female reproductive function as well as harmful effects on progeny shall be performed by appropriate tests. These tests comprise studies of effect on adult male or female reproductive function, studies of the toxic and teratogenic effects at all stages of development from conception to sexual maturity as well as latent effects, when the medicinal product under investi \u00ad gation has been administered to the female during pregnancy. Omission of these tests must be adequately justified. Depending on the indicated use of the medicinal product, additional studies addressing development when administering the medicinal product of the offspring may be warranted. Embryo/foetal toxicity studies shall normally be conducted on two mammalian species, one of which shall be other than a rodent. Peri- and postnatal studies shall be conducted in at least one species. If the metabolism of a medicinal product in particular species is known to be similar to that in man, it is desirable to include this species. It is also desirable that one of the species is the same as in the repeated dose toxicity studies. The state of scientific knowledge at the time when the application is lodged shall be taken into account when determining the study design. f) Local tolerance The purpose of local tolerance studies is to ascertain whether medicinal products (both active substances and excipients) are tolerated at sites in the body, which may come into contact with the medicinal product as a result of its administration in clinical use. The testing strategy shall be such that any mechanical effects of administration or purely physico-chemical actions of the product can be distinguished from toxicological or pharmaco-dynamic ones. Local tolerance testing shall be conducted with the preparation being developed for human use, using the vehicle and/or excipients in treating the control group(s). Positive controls/reference substances shall be included where necessary. The design of local tolerance tests (choice of species, duration, frequency and route of administration, doses) will depend upon the problem to be investigated and the proposed conditions of administration in clinical use. Reversibility of local lesions shall be performed where relevant. Studies in animals can be substituted by validated in vitro tests provided that the test results are of comparable quality and usefulness for the purpose of safety evaluation. M2 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 144 For chemicals applied to the skin (e.g. dermal, rectal, vaginal) the sensitising potential shall be evaluated in at least one of the test systems currently available (the guinea pig assay or the local lymph node assay). 5.

Content: basic principles and requirements Special attention shall be paid to the following selected elements. a) The clinical particulars to be provided pursuant to Articles 8 (3) (i) and 10 (1) must enable a sufficiently well-founded and scien \u00ad tifically valid opinion to be formed as to whether the medicinal product satisfies the criteria governing the granting of a marketing authorisation. Consequently, an essential requirement is that the results of all clinical trials should be communicated, both favourable and unfavourable. b) Clinical trials must always be preceded by adequate pharmaco \u00ad logical and toxicological tests, carried out on animals in accordance with the requirements of Module 4 of this Annex. The investigator must acquaint himself with the conclusions drawn from the phar \u00ad macological and toxicological studies and hence the applicant must provide him at least with the investigator's brochure, consisting of all the relevant information known prior to the onset of a clinical trial including chemical, pharmaceutical and biological data, toxi \u00ad cological, pharmaco-kinetic and pharmaco-dynamic data in animals and the results of earlier clinical trials, with adequate data to justify the nature, scale and duration of the proposed trial; the complete pharmacological and toxicological reports shall be provided on request. For materials of human or animal origin, all available means shall be employed to ensure safety from transmission of infectious agents prior to the commencement of the trial. c) Marketing authorisation holders must arrange for essential clinical trial documents (including case report forms) other than subject's medical files, to be kept by the owners of the data: \u2014 for at least 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the trial, \u2014 or for at least two years after the granting of the last marketing authorisation in the European Community and when there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in the European Community, \u2014 or for at least two years after formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. Subject's medical files should be retained in accordance with applicable legislation and in accordance with the maximum period of time permitted by the hospital, institution or private practice. The documents can be retained for a longer period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by agreement with the sponsor. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the hospital, institution or practice as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. M2 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 146 The sponsor or other owner of the data shall retain all other docu \u00ad mentation pertaining to the trial as long as the product is authorised. This documentation shall include: the protocol including the rationale, objectives and statistical design and methodology of the trial, with conditions under which it is performed and managed, and details of the investigational product, the reference medicinal product and/or the placebo used; standard operating procedures; all written opinions on the protocol and procedures; the investi \u00ad gator's brochure; case report forms on each trial subject; final report; audit certificate(s), if available. The final report shall be retained by the sponsor or subsequent owner, for five years after the medicinal product is no longer authorised. In addition for trials conducted within the European Community, the marketing authorisation holder shall make any additional arrangements for archiving of documentation in accordance with the provisions of Directive 2001/20/EC and implementing detailed guidelines. Any change of ownership of the data shall be documented. All data and documents shall be made available if requested by relevant authorities. d) The particulars of each clinical trial must contain sufficient detail to allow an objective judgement to be made: \u2014 the protocol, including the rationale, objectives and statistical design and methodology of the trial, with conditions under which it is performed and managed, and details of the investi \u00ad gational medicinal product used \u2014 audit certificate(s), if available \u2014 the list of investigator(s), and each investigator shall give his name, address, appointments, qualifications and clinical duties, state where the trial was carried out and assemble the information in respect of each patient individually, including case report forms on each trial subject \u2014 final report signed by the investigator and for multi-centre trials, by all the investigators or the co-ordinating (principal) investi \u00ad gator. e) The particulars of clinical trials referred to above shall be forwarded to the competent authorities. However, in agreement with the competent authorities, the applicant may omit part of this information. Complete documentation shall be provided forthwith upon request.

Reports of studies pertinent to pharmaco-kinetics using human bio-materials For the purposes of this Annex, human bio-materials shall mean any proteins, cells, tissues and related materials derived from human sources that are used in vitro or ex vivo to assess pharmaco-kinetics properties of drug substances. In this respect, reports of plasma protein binding study, hepatic metabolism and active substance interaction studies and studies using other human bio-materials shall be provided. 5.2.3. Reports of human pharmaco-kinetic studies a) The following pharmaco-kinetic characteristics shall be described: \u2014 absorption (rate and extent), \u2014 distribution, \u2014 metabolism, \u2014 excretion. Clinically significant features including the implication of the kinetic data for the dosage regimen especially for patients at risk, and differences between man and animal species used in the pre clinical studies, shall be described. In addition to standard multiple-sample pharmaco-kinetics studies, population pharmaco-kinetics analyses based on sparse sampling during clinical studies can also address questions about the contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic factors to the variability in the dose- pharmaco-kinetics response relationship. Reports of pharmaco-kinetic and initial tolerability studies in healthy subjects and in patients, reports of pharmaco-kinetic studies to assess effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and reports of population pharmaco-kinetic studies shall be provided. b) If the medicinal product is normally to be administered concomi \u00ad tantly with other medicinal products, particulars shall be given of joint administration tests performed to demonstrate possible modi \u00ad fication of the pharmacological action.

The treatment of the control groups will vary from case to case and also will depend on ethical considerations and therapeutic area; thus it may, in some instances, be more pertinent to compare the efficacy of a new medicinal product with that of an established medicinal product of proven therapeutic value rather than with the effect of a placebo. (1) As far as possible, and particularly in trials where the effect of the product cannot be objectively measured, steps shall be taken to avoid bias, including methods of randomisation and blinding. (2) The protocol of the trial must include a thorough description of the statistical methods to be employed, the number and reasons for inclusion of patients (including calculations of the power of the trial), the level of significance to be used and a description of the statistical unit. Measures taken to avoid bias, particularly methods of randomisation, shall be documented. Inclusion of a large number of subjects in a trial must not be regarded as an adequate substitute for a properly controlled trial. The safety data shall be reviewed taking into account guidelines published by the Commission, with particular attention to events resulting in changes of dose or need for concomitant medication, serious adverse events, events resulting in withdrawal, and deaths. Any patients or patient groups at increased risk shall be identified and particular attention paid to potentially vulnerable patients who may be present in small numbers, e.g., children, pregnant women, frail elderly, people with marked abnormalities of metabolism or excretion etc. The implication of the safety evaluation for the possible uses of the medicinal product shall be described. 5.2.5.2.

Case reports forms and individual patient listings When submitted in accordance with the relevant Guideline published by the Agency, case report forms and individual patient data listings shall be provided and presented in the same order as the clinical study reports and indexed by study. PART II SPECIFIC MARKETING AUTHORISATION DOSSIERS AND REQUIREMENTS Some medicinal products present specific features which are such that all the requirements of the marketing authorisation application dossier as laid down in Part I of this Annex need to be adapted. To take account of these particular situations, an appropriate and adapted presentation of the dossier shall be followed by applicants. 1. WELL-ESTABLISHED MEDICINAL USE For medicinal products the active substance(s) of which has/have a 'well-established medicinal use' as referred to Article 10(1)(a)(ii), with recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of safety, the following specific rules shall apply. The applicant shall submit Modules 1, 2 and 3 as described in part I of this Annex. For Modules 4 and 5, a detailed scientific bibliography shall address non-clinical and clinical characteristics. The following specific rules shall apply in order to demonstrate the well-established medicinal use: a) Factors which have to be taken into account in order to establish a well-established medicinal use of constituents of medicinal products are: \u2014 the time over which a substance has been used, \u2014 quantitative aspects of the use of the substance, \u2014 the degree of scientific interest in the use of the substance (reflected in the published scientific literature) and \u2014 the coherence of scientific assessments. Therefore different periods of time may be necessary for estab \u00ad lishing well-established use of different substances. In any case, however, the period of time required for establishing a well estab \u00ad lished medicinal use of a constituent of a medicinal product must not be less than one decade from the first systematic and docu \u00ad mented use of that substance as a medicinal product in the Community. b) The documentation submitted by the applicant should cover all aspects of the safety and/or efficacy assessment and must include or refer to a review of the relevant literature, taking into account pre- and post-marketing studies and published scientific literature concerning experience in the form of epidemiological studies and in particular of comparative epidemiological studies. All documen \u00ad tation, both favourable and unfavourable, must be communicated. With respect to the provisions on 'well-established medicinal use' it is in particular necessary to clarify that 'bibliographic reference' to other sources of evidence (post marketing studies, epidemiological studies, etc.) and not just data related to tests and trials may serve as a valid proof of safety and efficacy of a product if an application explains and justifies the use of these sources of information satis \u00ad factorily. M2 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 151 c) Particular attention must be paid to any missing information and justification must be given why demonstration of an acceptable level of safety and/or efficacy can be supported although some studies are lacking. d) The non-clinical and/or clinical overviews must explain the relevance of any data submitted which concern a product different from the product intended for marketing. A judgement must be made whether the product studied can be considered as similar to the product, for which application for a marketing auth \u00ad orisation has been made in spite of the existing differences. e) Post-marketing experience with other products containing the same constituents is of particular importance and applicants should put a special emphasis on this issue. 2. ESSENTIALLY SIMILAR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS a) Applications based upon Article 10(1) (a) (i) (essentially similar products) shall contain the data described in Modules 1, 2 and 3 of Part I of this Annex provided the applicant has been granted the consent of the holder of the original marketing authorisation to cross refer to the content of his Modules 4 and 5. b) Applications based upon Article 10(1) (a) (iii) (essentially similar products i.e. generics) shall contain the data described in Modules 1, 2 and 3 of Part I of this Annex together with data showing bio-availability and bio-equivalence with the original medicinal product provided the latter is not a biological medicinal product (see Part II, 4 Similar biological medicinal products). For these products the non-clinical/clinical overviews/summaries shall particularly focus on the following elements: \u2014 the grounds for claiming essential similarity; \u2014 a summary of impurities present in batches of the active substance(s) as well as those of the finished medicinal product (and where relevant decomposition products arising during storage) as proposed for use in the product to be marketed together with an evaluation of these impurities; \u2014 an evaluation of the bio-equivalence studies or a justification why studies were not performed with respect to the guideline on 'Inves \u00ad tigation of Bio-availability and Bio-equivalence'; \u2014 an update of published literature relevant to the substance and the present application. It may be acceptable for articles in 'peer review' journals to be annotated for this purpose; \u2014 every claim in the summary of product characteristics not known from or inferred from the properties of the medicinal product and/or its therapeutic group should be discussed in the non clinical/clinical overviews/summaries and substantiated by published literature and/or additional studies. \u2014 if applicable, additional data in order to demonstrate evidence on the equivalence of safety and efficacy properties of different salts, esters or derivatives of an authorised active substance should be provided by the applicant when he claims essential similarity. 3. ADDITIONAL DATA REQUIRED IN SPECIFIC SITUATIONS Where the active substance of an essentially similar medicinal product contains the same therapeutic moiety as the original authorised product associated with a different salt/ester complex/derivative evidence that there is no change in the pharmaco-kinetics of the moiety, pharmaco-dynamics and/or in toxicity which could change the safety/ efficacy profile shall be demonstrated. Should this not be the case, this association shall be considered as a new active substance. M2 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 152 Where a medicinal product is intended for a different therapeutic use or presented in a different pharmaceutical form or to be administered by different routes or in different doses or with a different posology, the results of appropriate toxicological and pharmacological tests and/or of clinical trials shall be provided. 4. SIMILAR BIOLOGICAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS The provisions of Article 10(1)(a) (iii) may not be sufficient in the case of biological medicinal products. If the information required in the case of essentially similar products (generics) does not permit the demon \u00ad stration of the similar nature of two biological medicinal products, additional data, in particular, the toxicological and clinical profile shall be provided. When a biological medicinal product as defined in Part I, paragraph 3.2 of this Annex, which refers to an original medicinal product having been granted a marketing authorisation in the Community, is submitted for a marketing authorisation by an independent applicant after the expiry of data protection period, the following approach shall be applied. \u2014 Information to be supplied shall not be limited to Modules 1, 2 and 3 (pharmaceutical, chemical and biological data), supplemented with bio-equivalence and bio-availability data. The type and amount of additional data (i.e. toxicological and other non-clinical and appropriate clinical data) shall be determined on a case by case basis in accordance with relevant scientific guidelines. \u2014 Due to the diversity of biological medicinal products, the need for identified studies foreseen in Modules 4 and 5, shall be required by the competent authority, taking into account the specific char \u00ad acteristic of each individual medicinal product. The general principles to be applied are addressed in a guideline taking into account the characteristics of the concerned biological medicinal product published by the Agency. In case the originally authorised medicinal product has more than one indication, the efficacy and safety of the medicinal product claimed to be similar has to be justified or, if necessary, demonstrated separately for each of the claimed indications. 5. FIXED COMBINATION MEDICINAL PRODUCTS Applications based upon Article 10 (1) (b) shall relate to new medicinal products made of at least two active substances not previously authorised as a fixed combination medicinal product. For those applications a full dossier (Modules 1 to 5) shall be provided for the fixed combination medicinal product. Where applicable, information regarding the manufacturing sites and the adventitious agents, safety evaluation shall be provided. 6. DOCUMENTATION FOR APPLICATIONS IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES When, as provided for in Article 22, the applicant can show that he is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because: \u2014 the indications for which the product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, or \u2014 in the present state of scientific knowledge, comprehensive information cannot be provided, or \u2014 it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such information, M2 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 153 marketing authorisation may be granted subject to certain specific obligations. These obligations may include the following: \u2014 the applicant shall complete an identified programme of studies within a time period specified by the competent authority, the results of which shall form the basis of a reassessment of the benefit/risk profile, \u2014 the medicinal product in question may be supplied on medical prescription only and may in certain cases be administered only under strict medical supervision, possibly in a hospital and in the case of a radio-pharmaceutical, by an authorised person, \u2014 the package leaflet and any medical information shall draw the attention of the medical practitioner to the fact that the particulars available concerning the medicinal product in question are as yet inadequate in certain specified respects. 7. MIXED MARKETING AUTHORISATION APPLICATIONS Mixed marketing-authorisation applications shall mean marketing-authorisation application dossiers where Module 4 and/or 5 consists of a combination of reports of limited non-clinical and/or clinical studies carried out by the applicant and of bibliographical references. All other Module(s) are in accordance with the structure described in Part I of this Annex. The competent authority shall accept the proposed format presented by the applicant on a case by case basis. PART III PARTICULAR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS This Part lays down specific requirements related to the nature of identified medicinal products. 1. BIOLOGICAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS 1.1. Plasma-derived medicinal product For medicinal products derived from human blood or plasma and by derogation from the provisions of Module 3, the dossier requirements mentioned in 'Information related to the starting and raw materials', for starting materials made of human blood/plasma may be replaced by a Plasma Master File certified in accordance with this Part. a) P r i n c i p l e s For the purposes of this Annex: \u2014 Plasma Master File shall mean a stand-alone documentation, which is separate from the dossier for marketing authorisation which provides all relevant detailed information on the characteristics of the entire human plasma used as a starting material and/or a raw material for the manufacture of sub/intermediate fractions, constituents of the excipient and active substance(s), which are part of medicinal products or medical devices referred to in Directive 2000/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 November 2000 amending Council Directive 93/42/EC as regards medical devices incorporating stable derivatives of human blood or human plasma ( 1 ).

(3) System in place between the plasma-derived medicinal product manufacturer and/or plasma fractionator/processor on the one hand, and blood/plasma collection and testing centres or estab \u00ad lishments on the other hand, which defines the conditions of their interaction and their agreed specifications. In addition, the Plasma Master File shall provide a list of the medicinal products for which the Plasma Master File is valid, whether the medicinal products have been granted a marketing authorisation or are in the process of being granted such an auth \u00ad orisation, including medicinal products referred to in Article 2 of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use. c) E v a l u a t i o n a n d C e r t i f i c a t i o n \u2014 For medicinal products not yet authorised, the marketing authori \u00ad sation applicant shall submit a full dossier to a competent auth \u00ad ority, which shall be accompanied by a separate Plasma Master File where one does not already exist. \u2014 The Plasma Master File is subject to a scientific and technical evaluation carried out by the Agency. A positive evaluation shall result in a certificate of compliance with Community legislation for the Plasma Master File, which shall be accompanied by the evaluation report. The certificate issued shall apply throughout the Community. \u2014 The Plasma Master File shall be updated and re-certified on an annual basis. \u2014 Changes subsequently introduced to the terms of a Plasma Master File must follow evaluation procedure laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 542/95 ( 1 ) concerning the examination of vari \u00ad ations to the terms of a marketing authorisation falling within the scope of Council regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 of 22 July 1993 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products ( 2 ). Conditions for the assessment of these changes are laid down by Regulation (EC) No 1085/2003. \u2014 As a second step to the provisions in the first, second, third and fourth indents, the competent authority that will grant or has granted the marketing authorisation shall take into account the certification, re-certification or variation of the Plasma Master File on the concerned medicinal product(s). M2 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 156 ( 1 ) OJ L 55, 11.3.1995, p. 15. ( 2 ) OJ L 214, 24.8.1993, p. 1. \u2014 By derogation from the provisions of the second indent of the present point (evaluation and certification), where a Plasma Master File corresponds only to blood/plasma-derived medicinal products the marketing authorisation of which is restricted to a single Member State, the scientific and technical evaluation of the said Plasma Master File shall be carried out by the national competent authority of that Member State. 1.2. Vaccines For vaccines for human use and by derogation from the provisions of Module 3 on 'Active substance(s)', the following requirements when based on the use of a Vaccine Antigen Master File system shall apply. The marketing authorisation application dossier of a vaccine other than human influenza vaccine, shall be required to include a Vaccine Antigen Master File for every vaccine antigen that is an active substance of this vaccine. a) P r i n c i p l e s For the purposes of this Annex: \u2014 Vaccine Antigen Master File shall mean a stand-alone part of the marketing authorisation application dossier for a vaccine, which contains all relevant information of biological, pharmaceutical and chemical nature concerning each of the active substances, which are part of this medicinal product. The stand-alone part may be common to one or more monovalent and/or combined vaccines presented by the same applicant or marketing authori \u00ad sation holder. \u2014 A vaccine may contain one or several distinct vaccine antigens. There are as many active substance(s) as vaccine antigen(s) present in a vaccine. \u2014 A combined vaccine contains at least two distinct vaccine antigens aimed at preventing a single or several infectious diseases. \u2014 A monovalent vaccine is a vaccine, which contains one vaccine antigen aimed at preventing a single infectious disease. b) C o n t e n t The Vaccine Antigen Master File shall contain the following information extracted from the relevant part (Active substance) of Module 3 on 'Quality Data' as delineated in Part I of this Annex: Active Substance 1. General Information, including compliance with the relevant mono \u00ad graph(s) of the European Pharmacopoeia. 2. Information on the manufacture of the active substance: this heading must cover the manufacturing process, information on the starting and raw materials, specific measures on TSEs and adventitious agents safety evaluation and facilities and equipment. 3.

A scientific and technical evaluation of each Vaccine Antigen Master File shall be carried out by the Agency. A positive evaluation shall result in a certificate of compliance to the European legislation for each Vaccine Antigen Master File, which shall be accompanied by the evaluation report. The certificate shall apply throughout the Community. \u2014 The provisions of the first indent shall also apply to every vaccine, which consists of a novel combination of vaccine antigens, irre \u00ad spective of whether or not one or more of these vaccine antigens are part of vaccines already authorised in the Community. \u2014 Changes to the content of a Vaccine Antigen Master File for a vaccine authorised in the Community shall be subject to a scientific and technical evaluation carried out by the Agency in accordance with the procedure laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1085/2003. In the case of a positive evaluation the Agency shall issue a certificate of compliance with Community legislation for the Vaccine Antigen Master File. The certificate issued shall apply throughout the Community. \u2014 By derogation from the provisions of the first, second and third indents of the present point (evaluation and certification), where a Vaccine Antigen Master File corresponds only to a vaccine which is the subject of a marketing authorisation which has not been/will not be granted according to a Community procedure, and, provided the authorised vaccine includes vaccine antigens which have not been evaluated through a Community procedure, the scientific and technical evaluation of the said Vaccine Antigen Master File and its subsequent changes, shall be carried out by the national competent authority that has granted the marketing authorisation. \u2014 As a second step to the provisions in the first, second, third and fourth indents, the competent authority that will grant or has granted the marketing authorisation shall take into account the certification, re-certification or variation of the Vaccine Antigen Master File on the concerned medicinal product(s). 2. RADIO-PHARMACEUTICALS AND PRECURSORS 2.1. Radio-pharmaceuticals For the purposes of this chapter, applications based upon Articles 6 (2) and 9 shall provide a full dossier in which the following specific details shall be included: Module 3 a) In the context of a radio-pharmaceutical kit, which is to be radio-labelled after supply by the manufacturer, the active substance is considered to be that part of the formulation which is intended to carry or bind the radio-nuclide. The description of the manufacturing method of radio-pharmaceutical kits shall include details of the manufacture of the kit and details of its recommended final processing to produce the radioactive medicinal product. The necessary specifications of the radio-nuclide shall be described in accordance, where relevant, with the general monograph or specific monographs of the European Pharmacopoeia. In addition, any compounds essential for the radio-labelling shall be described. The structure of the radio-labelled compound shall also be described. M2 2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 16.11.2012 \u2014 011.001 \u2014 158 For radio-nuclides, the nuclear reactions involved shall be discussed. In a generator, both mother and daughter radio-nuclides shall be considered as active substances. b) Details of the nature of the radio-nuclide, the identity of the isotope, likely impurities, the carrier, the use and the specific activity shall be provided. c) Starting materials include irradiation target materials. d) Considerations on chemical/radiochemical purity and its relationship to bio-distribution shall be provided. e) Radio-nuclide purity, radiochemical purity and specific activity shall be described. f) For generators, details on the testing for mother and daughter radio-nuclides are required. For generator-eluates, tests for mother radio-nuclides and for other constituents of the generator system shall be provided. g) The requirement to express the content of active substances in terms of the mass of active entities shall onlyapply to radio-pharmaceutical kits. For radio-nuclides, radioactivity shall be expressed in Becquerels at a given date and, if necessary, time with reference to time zone. The type of radiation shall be indicated. h) For kits, the specifications of the finished product shall include tests on performance of products after radio-labelling. Appropriate controls on radiochemical and radio-nuclidic purity of the radio-labelled compound shall be included. Any material essential for radio-labelling shall be identified and assayed. i) Information on stability shall be given for radio-nuclide generators, radio-nuclide kits and radio-labelled products. The stability during use of radio-pharmaceuticals in multi-dose vials shall be docu \u00ad mented. Module 4 It is appreciated that toxicity may be associated with a radiation dose. In diagnosis, this is a consequence of the use of radio-pharmaceuticals; in therapy, it is the property desired. The evaluation of safety and efficacy of radio-pharmaceuticals shall, therefore, address requirements for medicinal products and radiation dosimetry aspects. Organ/tissue exposure to radiation shall be documented. Absorbed radiation dose estimates shall be calculated according to a specified, internationally recognised system by a particular route of administration. Module 5 The results of clinical trials shall be provided where applicable otherwise justified in the clinical overviews. 2.2.
