But with a cult like army of loyal fans including Miranda Kerr, Adele, Katy Perry and the Hadid sisters, crystals have become big business, with many claiming the minerals have mystical healing abilities and the power to transform your mood and even a space's energy. From Yolanda Hadid's crystal garden at her family farm and Victoria Beckham keeping the sacred stones backstage at her fashion shows to Kim Kardashian West using them as a form of healing after her Paris ordeal, there's no denying their powerful allure. From getting rid of bad vibes to making you feel more calm and centered, we give you the ultimate guide to crystals, how to channel their energy and incorporate them into your home. What are crystals? Crystals are minerals formed underground the earth, that are made up of a series of molecules or atoms. While some are small, others can grow very large, developing over thousands of years. According to [Radford University](https://www.radford.edu/jtso/GeologyofVirginia/Minerals/GeologyOfVAMinerals1-1a.html), \"a mineral is a naturally-occurring, inorganic solid substance with a crystalline structure, a fixed or variable chemical composition, and a set of physical properties.\" More than 4,000 different minerals have been found in the earth's surface, [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/earth/inside-the-earth/minerals-gems/) reports, which is kinda carbonates, native elements, and halides. But how are crystals made, you ask? Well, these minerals and rocks are formed when molten rock or magma cools or when separating out of mineral-rich water such as underground caves (a process is known as crystallisation). Crystals for healing: Crystals have been used as a form of healing and as a way of harnessing spiritual energy for centuries. As the world of wellness continues to thrive, so too does interest in this ancient healing technique. There are many different types of healing stones each with a different shape, structural makeup and meaning. While some have more traditional aesthetics (such as clear quartz and amethyst) others are made up of more rock like formations (see: selenite and tiger's eye), each are as unique and powerful as the other. The decision of which crystals to incorporate into your home ultimately depends on what you're looking for. There are thousands of crystals that are associated with helping to enhance and enrich your daily life. Some stones are believed keep you more grounded and help you find your inner purpose while others might simply brighten up your day and dispel negative energies. You name it, there's a crystal for it. How healing crystals work: According to [Holistic Shop](https://www.holisticshop.co.uk/articles/introduction-guide-crystals) the chemical structure of crystals is thought to give them a kind of memory, allowing them to power and hold different energies. Each mineral has different characteristics and meanings. For example, rose quartz is known as the 'stone of love', while amethyst is believed to have calming, stress-relieving qualities. Many people use crystals to set intentions, believing that the stone will harness this energy and channel it into the environment where it's placed. But, to unlock the magical qualities of each stone, users are encouraged to care for their crystals by cleansing, charging and tactically positioning your crystals around the home for them to truly manifest the user's intentions. How to cleanse your crystals at home: Although at first this may seem like a bunch of hocus pocus, cleansing and charging your crystals is thought to be essential for you to harness their full abilities and potential. You should cleanse any new stones you bring into the house straight away to get rid of any negative energy they may have acquired on their previous journey, as well as any time you want to refresh the crystal and clear it of any residual unwanted energies. Here are three different methods for cleansing your crystal: - Submerge the crystal you wish to cleanse in a bowl of salt water. - Smudge new crystals with a sage stick or run them through sage smoke. - Leave crystals outside under the full moon for 24 hours. We like to put ours outside under the full moon to recharge the batteries like Bella Hadid: Remember, you should cleanse your stones every once and while, especially if they're in constant use or if the stone has properties that promote positivity, cleansing and remove negative energies. For example, smokey quartz may hold onto some of that negativity you've been letting go, which is why cleansing is so important. Charging your crystals at home: For each crystal to fully absorb your intentions you have to programme the stone for it to manifest. Think of it like growing a flower, you gotta give it some TLC in order for it to bloom - the same applies to crystals, a process known as 'charging'. There are various ways to charge your crystals, here are the main techniques: - Hold the crystal in your non-dominant hand and imagine a white light surrounding the stone while you recharge the stone and set your intention. - Place the crystal under the moonlight or sunlight for 24 hours. - Tingsha chimes, singing bowls, or tuning forks can be used to recharge crystals as they absorb the vibrations of the sound. - Place the crystal that needs charging with other crystals such as amethyst, quartz, and selenite, which can absorb the energies of other crystals and regenerate them. - Go back to the earth and bury your crystal in the garden for 24 hours. If you don't have a garden, pop your crystal into the soil of a flower pot. When charging your stones you have to visualise what you want from it and set your intention, making sure to open your mind and heart to their healing vibrations. Some people use crystals to help guide them into a new direction in life and reach a goal -these can be as small or big as you want or need them to be. Remember, the art of healing crystals is ultimately all about you and your journey. If you're feeling overwhelmed the best way is to start small. How to set your intentions If you want to try using crystals, you need to set a 'crystal practice'. This involves cleansing the crystal, setting your intention and then charging the stone. To do this think about the goals you want set and ask the stone to share its energy and qualities with you. You should be aware of the energy around you too - positivity will come to you if you seek it. Miranda Kerr is known to set her intentions everyday to keep her goals in sight, while others set them once a week or month. Other ways to keep your stone's energy present is by keeping them with you, if they're small place them in your pocket, on your desk, under your pillow or hold them during meditation. If you feel like your stone is heavy or have been setting regular intentions make sure to cleanse them so they don't get blocked and can continue to radiate positive energy into your life.
