Clinics that treat long COVID-19 patients at Chicago-based Northwestern Medicine and New York City-based Mount Sinai told the news outlet they don't see many people complaining of such sensations. At a Rochester, Minn.-based Mayo Clinic long COVID-19 clinic, however, \"It is something we see quite frequently,\" said Greg Vanichkachorn, MD, an occupational and aerospace medicine physician at Mayo who works with long COVID-19 patients in the first three months after their acute infection. Dr. Vanichkachorn estimates about 40 to 50 percent of long COVID-19 patients at Mayo experience such symptoms in the first three months after their initial infection. For some, the symptoms are debilitating, while they are more of a nuisance for others, he told the Journal. While health experts aren't exactly sure what causes the post COVID-19 tremors or vibrating sensations, some suspect it's related to autonomic nervous system dysfunction \u2014 which is common among long COVID-19 patients \u2014 nerve damage, or brain processing issues.
