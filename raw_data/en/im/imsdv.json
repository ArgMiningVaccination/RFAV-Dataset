With no proper treatment, it was considered hopeless to those diagnosed. It was a frontier deemed unchartable until a shocking discovery on a summer day in July. In 1921, Frederick Banting and Charles Best successfully kept a dog exhibiting symptoms of diabetes alive using an extract from cattle, sparking the development of insulin, an international treatment to save the lives of diabetics. When we heard this year's National History Day theme, \"Frontiers in History,\" we were at a loss for ideas. With endless fascinating topics, we hoped to do something in the medical field. After a wealth of research, our group came across the discovery of insulin. We read widely on the topic and ultimately came to a decision. We chose to create an exhibit detailing the captivating story of the development of insulin and research the scientists who conquered an unbelievable frontier. All of our group members have close connections to someone diagnosed with diabetes, and we hoped to gain more perspective into their life. Our research began through a number of primary resources including newspapers, letters, and other valuable artifacts. The University of Toronto was our most valued source containing an insulin library with a plethora of information. We gained much insight from a notebook written by Frederick Banting detailing his scientific process. As a group, we found a balanced number of primary and secondary resources, both contributing greatly to our project. After months of researching, writing, and perfecting our understanding of the topic, it was time to construct an exhibit. Using a wooden display and covering it with a cream fabric, we had our backdrop. Our vision was to recreate the laboratory that Banting and Best experimented in by building shelves including medicine bottles and scientific equipment. With endless ideas, we knew it would be challenging to execute them. Before we could build our exhibit, we had tocut out information, photos, quotes, and our timeline. This process was long and tedious, but we remained meticulous and eventually could begin our favorite part. The creation of our project required a lot of thought and an incredible amount of trial and error. Trying to attach the shelves to the board tested our patience and problem-solving abilities. Eventually reaching success, we spent much time discussing the lay-out and rearranging items. Though the process was challenging, our skills learned from History Day can be applied to virtually anything. A frontier represents an area that has yet to be explored. This could be a geographical location, a barrier of some sort, or a field of research that has yet to be mastered. Prior to 1921, people diagnosed with diabetes withered away, malnourished and starved. Frederick Banting, Charles Best, James Collip, and John Macleod did the unthinkable and developed a pharmaceutical drug called insulin. It took a small group of people with brilliant minds to develop a forever evolving product that has changed the world.ANNOT A TED BIBLIOGRAPHY PRIMAR Y SOURCES BOOKS Herbert, Charles Best.
