Panel on Nutrition, Dietetic Products, Novel Bente Mangschou and Gro Mathisen Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 4 Summary The Panel on Nutrition, Dietetic Products, Novel Fo od and Allergy has evaluated and summarised current scientific knowledge about organ ic food consumption and impact on human health. The aim was to investigate whether co nsumption of organically produced versus conventionally produced foods has a positive and/or negative influence on human health. A specification of the substances which may be connected to the reported health effects are outlined where possible. Comments have been included for differences in levels (compared to conventional food) of nutrients and ot her bioactive compounds. The evaluation is based on comprehensive literature searches. However, few relevant studies were found. Studies with humans (9 papers), animal model studies (9 papers) and biomarker studies (13 papers) including one or more health ou tcomes were included. Studies only describing levels of various nutrients or other bio active compounds in conventional foods versus organic foods were not considered. Only stud ies where organic food production was similar to the practises embedded in the European m ember state regulation were included. The following clinical health outcomes were investi gated in the included human studies: Atopy, eczema, respiratory disease, semen quality, hypospadias and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The studies are so far scar ce and have several limitations, and the clinical health outcomes studied have been investig ated in too few studies to allow for conclusions. No conclusion could therefore be drawn regarding semen quality, hypospadias or risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. For immun e-associated outcomes, there are some indications that organic food consumption may have a more beneficial effect than conventionally produced food. None of the included studies on human health report ed negative health effects from organic food consumption compared with conventional food. H owever, the studies were not specifically designed to investigate safety. In the nine included animal studies, various genera l health parameters were tested, but all studies included some immune parameters. Animals st udied were rats (six studies), mice, chicken and Drosophila Melanogaster (fruit flies) (one study each). Results from these studies might indicate a positive effect on some ou tcomes; however, the relevance of extrapolating from animal studies to humans remains a challenge. Organically produced plant foods in some well performed animal studies showed a positive effect on animal physiology which may have an impact on animal health, i.e. imm une parameters, hormonal balance and activity level. Not all studies substantiated these findings. Possible explanations for the discrepancies might be found in the differences in study design, including animal breed, plant food used, growing seasons and geographical locatio n. Thirteen included papers investigated changes in bi omarkers of antioxidant capacity, specific fatty acids, copper and zinc bioavailability and pe sticides from consumption of organic foods compared with conventional foods. The study designs and biomarkers measured in these investigations varied. The overall impression of the biomarker studies in humans is that there is probably no difference in antioxidant capacity, after absorptio n, between organic and conventional foods, but better designed studies are needed. There are s ome indications of increased concentrations of anti-inflammatory and growth stimulating trans f atty acids in human milk from mothers using predominantly organically produced dairy and meat products. In the USA, a lower urinary concentration of pesticides was found in ch ildren consuming an organic diet compared to a conventional diet. It was, however, d ifficult to relate any biomarkers to better health or protection against disease. Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 5 Our conclusions are in line with several previous r eviews. There were several methodological challenges in stu dies investigating organic food and the effect on human health. A frequent problem was inad equate descriptions of the foods which were tested in the various studies, also in terms o f production conditions. Another major problem was the lack of a suitable design, both for experimental studies, but perhaps even more so for clinical trials. The included animal st udies were well-designed and investigated relevant endpoints and selection of biomarkers. The present report has identified a marked need for more and improved studies. Research within the field shows lack of consistent findings and inconclusive results. It is of importance to gain more knowledge both on eventual positive an d negative health effects.

Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 8 Abbreviations ADI; haemocyanine OFA; Danish capacity PEM; Protein-energy-malnourished RCT; Randomised certification label Definitions Biodynamic agriculture Biodynamic agriculture is a method of organic farmi ng originally developed by Rudolf Steiner (Austrian philosopher 1861 - 1925) that emp loys what proponents describe as \"a holistic understanding of agricultural processes\". Being one of the first sustainable agriculture movements, it treats soil fertility, plant growth, and livestock care as ecologically interrelated tasks, emphasising planetary impact on plants and a nimals. All biodynamic farms in Norway comply with the regulations for organic farming and are certified and inspected by Debio. In addition to the \u00d8-label, biodynamic products are ma rked with the international Demeter-sign. Conventional farming In the present report conventional farming and conv entional products include all which are not defined as organic agriculture. Debio The Norwegian certification organisation for organi c products. Most of Debio's services deal with the inspection of organic production in accord ance with the Norwegian \"Regulations on the Production and Labelling of Organic Agricultura l Products\". The inspection services are based on an agreement with the Norwegian Food Safet y Authority, and the regulation is based on the EU Council Regulation 2092/91. It covers far ming, processing, import and marketing of organic agricultural products in Norway. Human health In the present report we have investigated organic foods in relation to various health outcomes, be it altered incidence of some health co ndition or effects on biomarkers of health and disease. For the purpose of this report \"human health\" in the context of organic food is therefore defined as \"The organic diet's or diet co nstituent's ability to influence indicators of health or disease\". Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 9 Organic farming Modified from Debio and the Norwegian Food Safety A uthority (Mattilsynet, NFSA): The term \"organic\" is protected by law for food and fee d products and can only be used when certified by Debio or a similar foreign control bod y. The \u00d8-label is therefore a guarantee for the product being organically produced. Debio inspe cts the farms and operators engaged with processing, packaging, import and trade of organic foods. Norwegian regulations for organic food and feed production are almost identical to th e parallel European regulations. Foods from organic farms are produced with use of animal manure and other organic fertilisers; the use of chemical-synthetical pesticides is forbidden . There are restrictions on the use of preservatives and the use of artificial aroma- and colours are not allowed. All use of genetically modified organisms (GMO) is also prohib ited. ( From The International Federation of Organic Agricu ltural Movements: Organic agriculture is a production system that sustains the health of soi ls, ecosystems and people. It relies on ecological processes, biodiversity and cycles adapt ed to local conditions, rather than the use of inputs with adverse effects. Organic agriculture combines tradition, innovation and science to benefit the shared environment and promote fair relationships and a good quality of life for all involved. EU regulation of organic production: Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 of 28 June 2007 on organic production and labelling of organic products and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91.

However, knowledge o n the impact of an increase in organic production in Norway is limited. If and how organic production practices may affect human health, animal health and welfare, plant health, th e environment and sustainability is not clear. In order to be able to give scientifically based in formation and advice on this issue to consumers and other target groups, the Norwegian Fo od Safety Authority (NFSA) requested a scientific evaluation of current research and other data on organic food and food production from The Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food (V KM). The scientific evaluation and the knowledge will also be used in connection with the NFSA's regulatory and international work on organic food production. The NFSA first prepared a draft request that was put out for public consultation. Remarks from the bodies that c ommented on the proposal clearly stated that there are limitations in the basic data for su ch an evaluation. NFSA therefore limited the scope and focus of the request somewhat. Sustainabi lity aspects and environmental impact of organic and conventional agricultural practices are not addressed. In addition, organic aquaculture, which has only been practiced for a fe w years, is excluded from the request. All foodstuffs on the market shall be safe and whol esome. Whereas all food produced and marketed shall comply with relevant legislation, fo od marketed as organic must in addition comply with regulations specific for organic produc tion. Organic food production is defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 of 28 June 2007 on organic production and labelling of organic products as \"The use of the production method compliant with the rules established in this Regulation, at all stages of production, preparation and distribution\". The regulation on or ganic food production is part of the EEA Agreement and covers inputs, crop production, lives tock production, rules for processing, labeling, and inspection, and provides provisions f or imports from third countries. According to Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007, o rganic production shall be based on the following principles (article 4): (a) the appropriate design and management of biolog ical processes based on ecological systems using natural resources which are internal to the system by methods that: i) use living organisms and mechanical production meth ods; ii) practice land-related crop cultivation and livestoc k production or practice aquaculture which complies with the principle of sustainable ex ploitation of fisheries; iii) exclude the use of GMOs and products produced from or by GMOs with the exception of veterinary medicinal products; iv) are based on risk assessment, and the use of precau tionary and preventive measures, when appropriate; (b) the restriction of the use of external inputs. Where external inputs are required or the appropriate management practices and methods referr ed to in paragraph (a) do not exist, these shall be limited to: i) inputs from organic production; ii) natural or naturally-derived substances; iii) low solubility mineral fertilisers; (c) the strict limitation of the use of chemically synthesised inputs to exceptional cases these being: Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 12 i) where the appropriate management practices do not e xist; and ii) the external inputs referred to in paragraph (b) ar e not available on the market; or iii) where the use of external inputs referred to in par agraph (b) contributes to unacceptable environmental impacts; (d) the adaptation, where necessary, and within the framework of this Regulation, of the rules of organic production taking account of sanitary st atus, regional differences in climate and local conditions, stages of development and specifi c husbandry practices. Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 13 Terms of reference The Norwegian Food Safety Authority (NFSA) requests the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VKM) to evaluate current scientifi c knowledge of organic production and organically produced food based on existing nationa l and international research results and other documentation. The NFSA wants the evaluation to focus primarily on Norwegian production. NFSA has found it appropriate to divide this compre hensive evaluation of organic production and organic food into five parts: 1. Plant health - plant production 2. Animal health - animal welfare and feed 3. Human health - nutrition and contaminants 4. Human health - hygiene and pathogens 5. Human health - pesticide residues NFSA would like VKM to compare the effects of organ ic versus conventional production based on the evaluations that are done in the five areas above. If lack of data prevents such a comparison, this should also be reported. Part III, IV and V. Human health NFSA requests VKM to evaluate the impact on human h ealth in Norway of eating organic versus conventionally produced food. The assessment is for practical reasons divided into three parts. Part III. Human health - nutrition and contaminants NFSA requests VKM to identify and/or assess: if consumption of organic food versus conventional food has a positive and/or negative influence on human health? Specification o f substances that may be connected to reported health effects is wanted and also possible differences in levels of these substances (between conventional and organ ic products). Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 14 1 Introduction The Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (Vitenskapskomiteen for mattrygghet, VKM) has at the request of the Norwegian Food Safet y Authority (Mattilsynet, NFSA) compared organic and conventional food and food pro duction in relation to possible impact on plant health, animal health and welfare and huma n health. The assessment is based on published peer reviewed scientific literature and a ssessment reports from international and national scientific bodies. The following aspects of organic food production we re not addressed in the assessment as they were not part of the request; sustainability a spects and environmental impacts of organic and conventional agricultural practices, and furthe rmore: aquaculture, because organic aquaculture has only been practiced for a few years . At the request of the Norwegian Food Safety Authori ty the assessment was divided into five parts addressing: I) Plant health and plant production (assessed by Pane l on Plant Health) II) Animal health and animal welfare (assesses by Panel on Animal Health and Welfare) III) Humane health - nutrition and contaminants (Panel o n Nutrition, Dietetic Products, Novel Food and Allergy) IV) Human health - hygiene and pathogens (assessed by P anel on Biological Hazards) V) Pesticide residues (assessed by Panel on Plant Prot ection Products) The present report focuses solely on current scient ific knowledge about organic food consumption and impact on human health. VKM appoint ed a working group consisting of VKM members and one external expert to prepare a dr aft opinion. The opinion was approved by VKMs Panel on Nutrition, Dietetic Products, Nove l Food and Allergy. The Scientific Steering Committee of VKM approved the final opinio n, i.e. this document. 2 Literature search 2.1 SEARCH STRATEGY Two literature searches were performed to retrieve publications addressing putative health effects of organically compared with conventionally produced foodstuffs, and only outcomes of relevance to human health were included. The str ategy for the literature searches was discussed and accepted in the project group and set up together with a librarian. Test searches were conducted to find relevant terms, search words and controlled vocabulary (MeSH and EMTREE). Literature search including different term s for organic and organic foods in the titles was conducted in Medline, Embase and ISI Web of Science. A second search was conducted to capture studies in subjects with an an throposophic lifestyle. The latter search included several specific terms for health outcomes and was also conducted in Medline, Embase and ISI Web of Science. The databases were u sed to ensure comprehensive study retrieval. The searches were conducted using a comb ination of both controlled vocabulary and text word searching as shown in Appendix 1. The searches were limited by omitting abstracts and by limiting the languages to Danish, English, French, German, Norwegian and Swedish. Sin ce a common regulatory framework for organic production was introduced in all member states of the European Economic Area in 1991, the search period was limited to the years 19 91 until present. In addition, in the first Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 15 search the term organic* or biodynamic* was require d in the title. The second search was conducted to capture studies of populations with a lifestyle including an organic diet. The first search was performed on the 17 th of October 2013; the second search was performed o n the 29 th of October 2013. 2.2 PUBLICATION SELECTION We considered four main study types for inclusion i n this report: human studies, biomarker studies, animal studies, in addition to other relev ant studies. The criteria for inclusion of a study were: It must be a full-text article It must be published and peer-reviewed It must contain a health outcome 1 (endpoint) that is related to organic food Organic production from countries outside the Europ ean Economic Area must be certified by an approved body Must include a comparison of organic and convention al foods Studies only describing levels of various nutrients or other bioactive compounds in conventional foods versus organic foods were theref ore not included. The first literature search identified 816 articles (Figure 2.1), of whi ch 65 articles were included as potentially relevant (including reviews). The examination of th e full text versions resulted in the exclusion of 23 studies which did not meet the incl usion criteria. Only one new paper was retrieved in the second literature search. The firs t assessment was performed by two reviewers for all articles and the second assessment was perf ormed by the reviewers separately. A manual search of reference lists identified an addi tional one relevant review that was included. A final total of 44 publications; 9 epidemiological /clinical studies, 9 animal studies, 13 biomarker studies, 1 other relevant study and 12 re views were identified and included in this report (see Figure 2.1). For all included single st udies, relevant data were extracted and entered into summary tables (Appendix 2). The data extraction was performed separately by the reviewers. 1A definition of human health for the purpose of this assessment is given on pag e 8. Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 16 Figure 2.1: Flowchart; the first literature search and the selection of publications 3 Results and discussion In the present assessment, the following categories of studies related to human health were included: Human studies including randomised and non-randomis ed controlled trials, or observational studies (prospective, case-control or cross-sectional) which included health endpoints of various kinds. Animal studies where animal models were explicitly used as a proxy for human physiological, biochemical or other hypothesised me chanisms in humans. Human studies using biomarkers of health as a proxy for health effects. In vitro and ex vivo studies in human or animal cell lines and serum us ed to investigate human-related cell mechanisms. 816 scientific publications were identified searching Medline, Embase and ISI Web of Science 752 publications were excluded. Reasons for exclusion: No full text article Not peer-reviewed Does not contain a health outcome that is related to organic or conventional food No comparison with conventional foods The full text versions of the remaining 64 publications were assessed 23 publications were excluded. Reasons for exclusion: Not peer-reviewed Does not contain a health outcome that is related to organic or conventional food The organic products were not certified by an approved body No comparison with conventional foods 41 publications including 11 reviews Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 17 3.1 EPIDEMIOLOGICAL /CLINICAL STUDIES IN HUMANS The literature search resulted in articles with the following clinical health outcomes in relation to organic food use in humans: Atopy, eczema, respi ratory disease, sperm quality, hypospadias and risk factors for cardiovascular dis ease. One study compared children with an anthroposophic lifestyle including organic food wit h children from homes using conventional produced food. Hay fever and asthma symptoms were s tudied among organic and conventional farms. One study of atopic manifestati on among infants brought up with respectively organic and conventional food was incl uded. Four papers were identified investigating organic farmers and/or use of organic food in relation to semen quality. Organic food intake and exposure to pesticides were evaluat ed in two papers. A case control study was included where the frequency use of organic food by the mothers during pregnancy was analysed in relation to hypospadias in the children . One study investigated nutritional status and risk factors for cardiovascular disease with us e of Italian Mediterranean organic diet. Table 3.1 gives an overview of all the studies in h umans included in this opinion. Table 3.1: Overview of all the studies in humans inc luded in this opinion.

Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 18 3.1.1 IMMUNE -ASSOCIATED OUTCOMES In a cross-sectional study from Sweden, Alm et al . (1999) investigated 295 children aged 5-13 years from anthroposophic families attending Steine r schools. The focus was on prevalence of atopic diseases, and they were compared with 380 ch ildren attending state schools. There were marked differences between the two groups of c hildren concerning use of antibiotics, MMR vaccination (measles, mumps histo consumption biodynamic food and fermented vegetables. History o f atopy or symptoms consistent with atopy was found in 25% of children attending conven tional schools compared to 13% from Steiner schools and (OR 0.62 (95% CI 0.43,0.91) for the Steiner school children and adjusted for MMR vaccination, other vaccinations, antibiotic s not more than twice and not before two years of age, antipyretics, consumption of fermente d vegetables and mainly biodynamic produced foods. When organic food alone was compute d against atopy/no atopy there was a significant result towards organic food and reduced risk of atopy (OR 0.63 (95% CI 0.42,0.94). In this study an anthroposophic lifesty le, which includes much more than organic food, indicate a protection against atopic diseases and atopy. The authors concluded that lifestyle factors related to the anthroposophic way of living including organic/biodynamic food appear to reduce the risk of atopic disease in children. In a prospective epidemiological birth cohort study in the Netherlands, Kummeling et al . (2008) investigated whether early life organic food consumption was associated with developing atopic symptoms during the first two yea rs of life. A birth cohort (n=2834) was followed prospectively with detailed questionnaires at 3, 7, 12 and 24 months. The mother's dietary intake from gestational week 34 until deliv ery and the food intake of the children the first 24 months were registered. Eczema and/or whee ze occurrence were classified by questionnaire, sensitisation by total and specific IgE. A trend for decreased risk for eczema in the organic consumers was seen, but it was not stat istically significant. A significant reduced risk of eczema was demonstrated in the group consum ing strictly organic dairy products (OR 0.64 (95% CI 0.44, 0.93). The analyses was adjusted for sex, maternal education, body mass index (BMI), parental and sibling history of allerg y, number of older siblings, breastfeeding, day-care attendance, pets, exposure to tobacco smok ing, vaccination, antibiotic exposure and vegetarian diet. The authors suggested that pregnan t and lactating mothers' consumption of organic dairy products within the context of an org anic diet is protective of eczema in young children. Smit et al . (2007) performed a questionnaire survey in adult conventional (n=1205) and organic farmers (n=593) from the Dutch part of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey to compare the prevalence of respiratory sym ptoms and furthermore compare the farming with a non-farming population. Farmers repo rted significantly less frequent asthma and asthma-like symptoms than non-farmers. Almost a ll asthma symptoms were less prevalent in organic than in conventional farmers w hile hay fever was reported more commonly. However this association decreased when a djusting for age, smoking habits, sex, current farm type, childhood farming environment an d disinfectant use in a multiple regression model. The study also showed that keepin g livestock and growing up on a farm were associated with a two times lower prevalence o f hay fever. In conclusion, this study showed that a farm childhood in combination with cu rrent livestock farming protected against allergic diseases. This effect was found for both o rganic and conventional farmers. 3.1.2 SEMEN QUALITY Abell et al . (1994) performed a cross-sectional study analysin g the semen of 30 members of the Danish Organic Farmers' Association and in 73 d ifferent blue-collar workers (19 were Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 19 flexoprinters, 22 were electricians and 32 were met al workers), all between 18 to 50 years of age. According to a self-completed questionnaire th e average intake of organic dairy products was at least 50% of the total intake of dairy produ cts the past year among 28 of the members. The members of the Organic Farmers Association had significantly higher sperm density compared with the three other groups of workers. Th e semen volume was; however, lower in the members of the Organic Farmers Association alth ough they had a significantly lower continence period. In the members of the Organic Fa rmers Association there was a significant correlation between continence period and semen vol ume, but not sperm density. The total sperm count (density * volume) was not higher in th e members of the Organic Farmers Association than in the other groups. The authors c onclude that the higher sperm density among the members of the Organic Farmers Associatio n in spite of shorter continence period was unexpected. Jensen et al . (1996) studied semen quality among 55 members fro m two different organisations for organic farming in a cross-sectio nal study in Denmark. All had at least 25% of the diet from organic products and were between 20 to 45 years of age. As controls, 141 men 23-43 years of age, working in an airline compa ny were included. A multiple linear regression of log transformed semen parameters cont rolling for age, continence period and season showed that the organic food users had 43% h igher sperm concentration compared to the controls. No other sperm parameter was differen t between the two groups. The authors reflect on selection bias since in the organic grou p members only wanted to participate if they knew they were fertile, while in the control group fertility problems might have triggered participation. The prevalence of genital disorders among the organic food users was lower compared to the control group while reported crypto rchidism was higher. In another Danish study Juhler et al . (1999) analysed the exposure to pesticides in the same study as Larsen et al . (1999) (see below), where a food frequency questi onnaire (FFQ) was answered in addition to semen collection. The study included 171 conventional farmers, mean age 38 years, and 85 organic farmers, mean age 40 y ears, who delivered one sample of semen just before the spraying season in 1995/1996. The f armers were divided into three groups where organic food intake represented 0%, 1-49% and 50-100% of the fruit and vegetable intake. Those with a high intake of organic fruit a nd vegetables also had a high intake of other organic foods. Calculations of exposure to 40 diffe rent pesticides were performed with use of the FFQ data, standard portion sizes and concentrat ion of the pesticides collected from the National Danish Food Monitoring Program. All partic ipating farmers were exposed to the pesticides at 1% of acceptable daily intake (ADI) o r below the ADI, except for three pesticides where the exposure varied between 1.1% a nd 2.2% of ADI. The farmers with high organic food intake were significantly less exposed to pesticides compared with those with no intake of organic food. The median sperm count did not vary between the three groups, but the farmers with no intake of organic food had lowe r concentration of morphologically normal spermatozoa. However, in relation to 14 othe r semen parameters no significant differences were found. Five significant correlatio ns were found out of 160 analyses with regard to pesticides exposure and different semen p arameters. All five significant correlations showed a lower percentage of dead spermatozoa with higher intake of organic foods. The analyses were adjusted for age, semen spillage, sex ual abstinence, fever previous three months, smoking, alcohol intake and self-reported r eproductive disease. The authors conclude that exposure to the 40 different pesticides analys ed did not increase the risk of impaired semen quality. In the same cross-sectional study Larsen et al . (1999), aimed to confirm or refute the hypothesis that organic farmers have higher sperm c oncentration than conventional farmers. The median sperm concentration was significantly hi gher in the organic farmers compared to Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 20 the conventional farmers, but after adjusting for a ge, semen spillage, sexual abstinence, fever previous three months, smoking, alcohol intake and self-reported reproductive disease the difference was no longer significant. The conventio nal farmers had significantly lower count of normal spermatozoa also after adjusting for conf ounding in one sample of the study, but this difference was not confirmed in a second sampl e. No significant differences were seen for total sperm count; proportion of non-vital spermato zoa, sperm chromatin structure or motility variables, and the authors concluded that there was no significant difference between conventional and organic farmers with regard to spe rm quality. 3.1.3 HYPOSPADIA Christensen et al . (2013) performed a case control study in Denmark including mothers of 306 boys operated on for hypospadias and 306 contro l children matched for geography and child birth year. Through a telephone interview, th e intake of fruit, vegetables, milk, dairy products, eggs and meat during pregnancy was record ed and use of organic or conventional products was registered. Intake frequency was categ orised as often/sometimes and rarely/never. The telephone interview was carried o ut in 2005 and 2006 and the hypospadia cases were operated on between 2003 and 2005, meani ng that some of the participants were interviewed up to three years after pregnancy. Logi stic regression models were constructed for dietary variables and adjusted for maternal age , BMI, and alcohol consumption, but was not adjusted for birth weight. Overall, an organic food choice during pregnancy was not associated with hypospadias in the offspring. Howev er, often consumption of high fat dairy products while rarely or never choosing the organic alternative was associated with increased odds for hypospadia (adjusted OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.09- 4.35). The authors refer to exposure of pesticides as a possible causation since some human studies have indicated a possible relationship between pesticides and hypospadias. 3.1.4 RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE De Lorenzo et al . (2010) studied the effects of an Italian Mediterr anean diet, consisting of organic versus conventional foods in a clinical stu dy. The outcome measures were body composition, and biochemical parameters. The study included 150 healthy Caucasian Italian men (mean age 45 years) and 50 male patients with c hronic kidney disease (mean age 46). The aim was to investigate if organic food could de crease cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor and the progression of renal diseases. The t otal number that completed the study was 130 (65%), but information about how many in each g roup was not available. At baseline, and after 14 days on a conventional Italian Mediterrane an diet and after 14 days with organic Italian Mediterranean diet, measurements of BMI, bo dy composition, by Dual-X absorptiometry scanner, the total plasma homocystei n (p-tHcy), serum phosphorus and glucose concentrations, lipid profile, and microalb uminuria were performed. The results showed a significant reduction of p-tHcy and phosph orous concentrations during the Italian Mediterranean diet with organic food compared to th e Italian Mediterranean diet with conventional food. Body composition analysis showed significant decrease in fat mass after the organic diet, expressed as kilograms and as per centage (p<0.001). Improvement of lean body mass was observed in the patients with chronic kidney disease (p=0.004). The authors concluded that intake of organic Italian Mediterran ean diet reduced p-tHcy and microalbuminuria levels in healthy individuals and in patients with chronic kidney disease. However, drop-outs were not reported which might ha ve biased the results. This was the only study found looking at homocysteine and phosphorous concentrations and body composition Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 21 parameters with regard to intake of organically pro duced food, and this paper will not be discussed further. 3.1.5 DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY OF THE MAIN FINDINGS , STUDIES IN HUMANS It is reported that most consumers using organic pr oduced food do this of reasons built on the belief that organic foods are naturally produced, s afe and healthy (Hjelmar 2011, Torjusen et al . 2001, van de Vijver and van Vliet 2012). The scie ntific basis for possible human health effects of the consumption of organically produced food is still scarce, and in our literature search only nine studies related to clinical health outcomes were found. Lifestyle seems to have impact on the development o f atopic diseases, and a positive effect of growing up on a farm on atopic disease has been doc umented before (Riedler et al . 2000, von Mutius and Radon 2008, von Mutius and Vercelli 2010 ). The same finding was reported by Smit et al . (2007) and she found lower frequency of atopic di sease in organic farmers as well as among conventional farmers, and especially among those growing up with animals. The Alm et al . study (1999) showed a positive effect of anthropo sophic lifestyle on the frequency of atopic disease and Kummeling et al . (2008) demonstrated reduced risk of eczema among children who at the age of two had only been given organic food and were born to mothers who during pregnancy and breastfeeding consumed org anic dairy products. The biological plausibility for an impact of organic food on atopi c disease and especially eczema is unclear. A higher content of n-3 fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid in organic than in conventional dairy products was demonstrated (Rist et al ., 2007 and Mueller et al ., 2010), and it is hypothesised that anti-inflammatory propertie s of these fatty acids could be protective. Furthermore, it is hypothesised that organic milk c ontains a higher amount of non-infectious microbial components which might have an effect on gut immunity (Kummeling et al . 2008, Suhren and Heeschen 1996). Health effects of an anthroposophical lifestyle, in which organic/biodynamically grown food is one of several characteristic features has been discussed in several papers. This aspect may be important and can suggest clues to possible heal th benefits of organic food consumption (and related practices), and it will be interesting to see if future studies may further disclose more details about the specific practices which con tributes to the reported findings. If more specific beneficial practices are identified, they may be adopted also in other lifestyle settings and have broader relevance for public health. Higher sperm concentration in semen among members o f the Danish Organic Farmers Association was first seen by coincidence in a stud y where the authors examined fertility among green-house workers. The first study designed to reevaluate the finding was performed by Abell et al ., (1994) followed by Jensen et al ., (1996). Both studies indicated a higher sperm concentration in organic farmers compared wit h conventional farmers or in blue collar workers. Both studies have been criticised for sele ction bias and for missing statistical adjustments of confounders. Another aspect mentione d was that the collection of semen was performed during different time periods of the year and seasonal variations may have impact on semen quality. In a more comprehensive study no difference was found between organic and conventional farmers with regard to sperm conce ntration when confounders were adjusted for (Larsen et al . 1999 and Juhler et al . 1999). In these studies exposure to pesticides from foods could not be separated from the occupati onal exposure which further complicates the picture and no conclusion was drawn regarding c onsumption of organically produced foods and semen quality. The suggested mechanism fo r an impact on sperm count and sperm quality has been pesticide exposure and it has been shown that high exposure to pesticides reduces sperm count and quality (Hossain et al . 2010). In the study by Juhler et al . (1999) it Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 22 was shown that the conventional farmers were expose d to more pesticides than the organic farmers. However, the exposure was only between 1-2 .2% of ADI for some of the calculated pesticides among conventional farmers, and in a rec ently published study from Norway no impact on sperm quality of pesticide exposure could be measured (Haugen et al . 2011). Hypospadias is another health outcome that has been connected with pesticide exposure and in a recent Greek study mothers giving birth to a b oy with hypospadia were more highly exposed to pesticides than mother with boys born wi thout hypospadias (Michalakis et al . 2013). Pesticide exposure through food might also e xplain the findings in the Danish study (Christensen et al ., 2013). A general healthier lifestyle related to choosing organic alternatives was also suggested as an explanation of the finding s. To summarise, two studies indicated a positive effe ct of lifestyle factors including organic food use and atopic diseases in children. However, the importance of organic food use could not be disentangled from other lifestyle factors. A lower exposure to pesticides with organically compared to conventionally produced foo d was discussed with regard to sperm quality and hypospadia, but no conclusion could be drawn. The shortage of clinical as well as epidemiological well designed studies in humans imp licate that no conclusions could be drawn with respect to health outcomes. 3.2 ANIMAL MODEL STUDIES Nine studies from the literature search described a nimal models used for comparing organically grown crops to conventionally grown. Th e study design varied, as some studies took seasonal and yearly difference into account an d others not. Furthermore some studies used blinding of the investigators, others not. Ani mals studied were rats (six studies), mice, chicken and Drosophila Melanogaster (fruit flies) (one study each). Various health parameters were tested, but all studies included so me immune parameters. One of the studies (Huber et al . 2010) aimed at identifying markers of health whic h may be used for future human intervention studies comparing organically an d conventionally produced food. Another study (Lauridsen et al ., 2008) aimed at defining which measurable aspects of health might be affected by differences in production meth ods. Table 3.2 gives an overview of all the animal model studies included in this opinion. Table 3.2: Overview of the animal model studies incl uded in this opinion.

Organic potatoes, raisi ns and soy led to significantly extended life span compared to conventional, while for banan as the life span was equal. Flies fed organic potato or banana, but not raisins, survived the oxidative stress treatment longer than the flies on conventionally produced feed. Physical activity of the flies was measured over a 48 hour period. It turned out that flies fed organi cally produced raisins and banana had higher overall activity than the same food produced conven tionally. Flies fed extracts of any organic produce had significantly more eggs per day than fl ies fed on conventional produce. The data suggest that organic food provide improved health o utcomes in Drosophila Melanogaster . The exact molecular mechanisms of the observed heal th effects are unclear. Altered insulin- signaling, altered redox balance or xenohormesis ma y all play a role. In a blinded animal feeding experiment in two gener ations of female Wistar Hannover GALAS rats (n=54first generation, n=29 mothers, n=1 34 pups), Jensen et al . (2013) studied the effect of maternal intake of conventionally or organically produced feed on oral tolerance Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 24 development in the offspring. The diets were compos ed of crops from a long-term field study including two cultivation systems x 2 years x 2 loc ations = 8 diets. The crops used were potatoes, winter wheat, spring barley and fava bean s grown with organic cultivation system with green manure and without pesticides or convent ional with inorganic fertilisers with pesticides. No differences in immune parameters or induction of oral tolerance between offspring rats of mothers fed organically or conven tionally grown plant diet were observed. The conclusion was that the data indicate an influe nce of maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation on tolerance development in the offspring , but no differences were observed between organically or conventionally grown diets. In an animal feeding study from Poland, Srednicka-T ober et al. (2013) studied rats fed crops from four different crop management regimes: 1) org anic fertilisation and crop protection, 2) organic fertilisation and conventional crop protect ion, 3) conventional fertilisation and organic crop protection and 4) conventional fertili sation and crop protection. The parents of the rats studied were fed on crops from the same re gimes as the offspring. The aim of the study was to quantify the effects of different cult ivation regimes on composition of rat feeds, body composition, growth, hormonal and immune statu s parameters. There were no detectable pesticide residues except for the growth regulator chlormequat which was detected in wheat grain grown under conve ntional crop protection. There were lower protein and cadmium concentrations in organic ally fertilised crops, higher concentration of polyphenols. Rat growth was similar for all types of feed and fi nal body weight was not affected by treatment. Organic fertilisation resulted in higher body weight at weaning, but lower total weight gain. Body fat content was not affected by t ype of feed. Hormonal balance was affected by the type of feed; Leptin and Insuline-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was higher in rats fed crops organically fe rtilised and with organic crop protection, corticosterone level was higher and testosterone lo wer in rats fed organically fertilised crops. Several immune parameters were affected by the type of feed: Lipopolysaccharid stimulated lymphocyte proliferation was low with no stimulatio n of cells from rats on organically fertilised crops. Feeds from organically fertilisat ion and organic crop protection resulted in an increase in spontaneous proliferation, while organi c fertilisation and conventional crop protection led to a decrease in Con-A stimulated pr oliferation. No significant effect on IgA or C-reactive protein (CRP) by crop management regimes . The authors conclude that different crop production practices which result in modulation of the composition of feed, may have a significant eff ect on rat physiology, especially immune status. Jensen et al . (2012) investigated in an in vivo and in vitro animal study the impact of consumption of carrots as whole food, grown under o rganic or conventional cultivation system during two consecutive years in Denmark coul d have on health parameters in female GK/MolTac (n=65/year) rats. The conventionally prod uced carrots were grown using inorganic fertiliser and pesticides. Three differen t organic cultivation systems were studied: minimalistic organic cultivation system following o rganic practices, with the maximum allowed manure input (O1), organic cultivation with intensive use of cover crops (O2) and (very organic) cultivation using green manure, cove r crops and intercrops (O3). The cultivation system and year did not show any impact on biomarkers of health and immunity. The conclusion was that the study showed little imp act of cultivation system and year on carrot quality and little (if any) effect of cultiv ation system on biomarkers of health and immunity. Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 25 Roselli et al . (2012) investigated the impact of organic and con ventionally grown carrots on intestinal and peripheral immunity in mice in an in vitro study from Italy. The study comprised two production years, and three varieties of organic production grown in two different geographic locations (Denmark and Italy). The carrots were grown in four different cropping systems for vegetable production, one conv entional and three organic (O1-3). The O1 was similar to the conventional but organic fert iliser and no pesticides, O2 and O3 had increasing content of fertility-building crops. The study indicated an immune stimulation by the organically grown carrots, especially from the two \"more organic\" produce. The results from measuring pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in serum showed no significant differences between conventional and organic groups of the three varieties. The authors suggest that although the study was not designed to study safety, the fact that organic feed did not induce an inflammatory response, could be an in dication that organically produced carrots did not introduce toxic compounds in mice. In concl usion it is stated that the study indicate an immune stimulation by organic carrots on intestinal and peripheral immunity, including an expansion of regulatory T lymphocytes. The study re inforces the concept that organic products are as safe as conventionally grown. Skwarlo-Sonta et al . (2011) performed a dietary intervention study in male Wistar rats (n=96/year) fed crops grown under conventional or o rganic conditions during two consecutive growing seasons. The crops were grown in the UK and transported to Poland where the feeds were prepared and the experiments carried out. The total feeding period on experimental diets was 12 weeks. The crops were produced under four di fferent production systems: 1) organic 2) organic crop protection + conventional fertilisa tion 3) conventional crop protection + organic fertilisation 4) conventional. In the first year no differences in rat growth were found, in the second year the growth rates of both generat ions rats were higher in rats fed crops grown conventionally. No differences between organi c or conventional systems in body composition or hematological parameters. Plasma ant ioxidant capacity measured as trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (plasma TEAC) was h igher in rats fed crops produced under organic crop protection regimes. Differences in IgA and IgG in serum was detected with higher levels of IgA in rats fed on conventionally produced crops while differences in IgG levels were only seen between years and not between production methods. Organic crop protection and organic fertilisation methods result ed in higher levels of proliferation after ConA stimulation of lymphocytes. In conclusion the results of the study show that production method affected the composition of the rat feeds, t he growth of the rats, their hormonal balances, body composition, and the immune status. However, the differences in feed composition could not be directly linked to the obs erved physiological differences. In a blinded animal feeding experiment from the Net herlands in two generations of chickens (n=72 first generation, n= 150 second generation), Huber et al . (2010) aimed at identifying biomarkers for future human intervention studies of the effect of organic feed on health in a chicken model, focusing on immune parameters (innat e and specific). The study was carried out in three chicken lines, a high immune responder line (H), a mixed conventional line (C) and a low immune responder line (L). Furthermore tw o generations were studied, focusing mainly on the second generation in order to rule ou t epigenetic confounders. All animals were fed a commercially obtained chicken diet until 11 w eeks of age, from 11 weeks - 94 days the animals received the experimental diets. Body weigh t differed significantly in the C-line animals, the conventionally fed being heavier durin g the whole period. L-line animals in the first generation on organic feed displayed a signif icant increase in Newcastle Disease vaccine- specific antibody titers. In the second generation the organically fed appeared to have a stronger immune competence in the innate immune sys tem reflected by an enhanced response of monocytes after Keyhole Limpet Haemocyanine (KLH ) challenge. The challenge activated Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 26 the specific immune system stronger, but no differe nce between the feed groups was seen. The different immune parameters indicate an immune modulation by the feeds and tendencies towards an enhanced immune responsiveness or immune competence of the animals on organic feed. Intermediates of the lipid metabolism showed differences in the organic group after KLH challenge, in accordance with the immunol ogical findings. The authors speculate that the differences found may partly be explained by more immune-stimulating gram- negative bacteria in the organic feed, but the diff erences between feeds were limited and the quantitative addition of bacteria is small compared to the bacterial load present in the gut. Genomic analyses displayed thirty genes differentia lly regulated between the feed groups independent of their genetic background. Of these, seven genes were involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and up-regulated in jejuni from the or ganically fed animals. Other genes found were involved in immunological processes. The autho rs concluded that diets from different cultivation systems can induce physiological change s in two generations of chickens. The underlying mechanisms are unclear. Lauridsen et al . (2008) performed a rat feeding study in Denmark u sing diets from crops cultivated with three varieties of nutrients and pe sticide use. Their aim was to identify health- related biomarkers affected by different growth con ditions of plant foods. The production methods used in the study were not the same as actu al commercial systems. One diet was produced using similar or lower levels of organic f ertiliser input through plant residues and animal manure than standard organic practice with n o pesticides, and one diet corresponded to standard conventional practice. The third method wa s organic in fertiliser input, but used pesticides. Although the dietary treatments were si milar in terms of nutritional quality, there were differences in alpha-tocopherol and IgG, dayti me activity, volume of adipose tissue, liver metabolic function and liver peroxidation. Th e rats fed an organic diet had a generally lower activity during the day with no differences d uring night. Rats being night-active animals usually rest during daytime and the result indicate a more uninterrupted sleep in organic fed rats which is in accordance with the lo wer content of adipose tissue in these rats. The higher IgG concentrations in rats fed organic a nd organic with pesticides compared to conventional diet is in accordance with studies cla iming that immune function could be affected by differences in cultivation systems. The authors concluded that the study has identified biomarkers which should be taken into ac count in further well designed studies in this field. Finamore et al . (2004) studied male Sprague-Dawley rats in a 30 d ays feeding period of organic vs conventionally grown cereals. The aim of the study was to propose a novel approach to evaluate the potential health risk indu ced by long-term consumption of organic versus conventional cereals, that is, the assay of sensitive markers of cell function in vulnerable conditions, in which cell defense can be less efficient. The rats were randomly assigned to two groups fed conventional or organic wheat. Each group was divided in two subgroups of well-nourished or protein-energy-malno urished (PEM) rats. The well-nourished rats were fed a complete balanced diet containing 2 4% casein and 8% wheat protein. The PEM subgroups were fed a casein free diet where 8% wheat protein represented the only protein source. The lymphocytes were cultured in me dium containing fetal calf serum as a standard serum and also in medium containing the co rresponding rat serum to mimic the in vivo conditions. The proliferative response of lymphocy tes collected at day 30 after sacrificing the animals was measured in the four su bgroups. No differences in proliferative capacity of lymphocytes (peripheral and intestinal sites) were seen in well-nourished rats. Organic wheat did not affect the proliferative capa city of lymphocytes in well-nourished or PEM rats when cultured in medium containing fetal c alf serum. Lymphocytes from PEM rats cultured in rat serum, however, showed lower mitoge n stimulation capacity in the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 27 conventional fed than in the organic fed. The autho rs suggest that the latter observation indicates the presence of contaminants in conventio nally grown and not in organic wheat. The overall conclusion was that this study demonstrates no higher risk of organic compared to conventional wheat that could affect fundamental ce ll functions. Furthermore, the study introduces the concept that it is advisable to use functional assays as well as chemical in the evaluation of food health risk. 3.2.2 DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY OF THE MAIN FINDINGS IN ANIMAL MODEL STUDIES The animal model studies included in this report we re intended to be models for human health and thus either describe physiological processes wh ich may directly pertain to humans or search for biomarkers of health which may in future be studied in humans. The studies differed in design, animals and crops for feed and it was thus difficult to compare and evaluate the results. There are, however, some gene ral traits which can be considered. The immune parameters investigated in animal studie s were immunoglobulin concentrations and spontaneous proliferative capacity of periphera l and gut/spleen lymphocytes with the different feeds or after stimulation with mitogens. Roselli et al . (2012) found a stronger immune stimulation by organic carrots, a result sup ported by Finamore et al . (2004) in well- nourished rats fed organic cereals, but not in prot ein-energy malnourished rats. Skwarlo- Sonta's study in rats showed that rats fed organic crops had a higher proliferative response after Concavalin-A stimulation (Skwarlo-Sonta et al ., 2011). The latter finding is different than the findings in Srednicka-Tober et al . (2013) who demonstrated that organic fertilisatio n did not influence Con-A - stimulated proliferation under organic crop protection, but resulted in lower proliferation under conventional crop prot ection. On the other hand Srednicka-Tober et al . also demonstrated a significantly higher spontane ous lymphocyte proliferation with organic fertilisation and crop protection regimes, but no effect of organic fertilisation under conventional crop protection regimes. The differenc es found in organic vs conventional feed on immune parameters as lymphocyte proliferation, s pontaneous or mitogen stimulated, may be explained by the presence of other unidentified immune-modulating properties in feeds, as also suggested by Finamore et al . (2004). Furthermore, yearly differences had an ev en more marked effect on mitogen stimulation, both by Conca navalin-A and Lipopolysaccharid. Thus, it is important to study yearly variations as well as cultivation method. Huber demonstrated a higher antibody titer after Newcastle Disease Vacci nation in a low immune response strain of chicken on organic feed, a result which is in accor dance with the finding of higher IgG concentrations in organically fed rats (Lauridsen et al ., 2008). However, two studies by Jensen et al . (2013 and 2012) did not find any differences in i mmunological parameters between organic and conventional feed in rats. A reduction in adipose tissue was demonstrated by L auridsen et al . (2008) in rats fed organically and Huber et al. (2010) (chicken). This is in contrast to Skwarlo-S onta et al . (2011) who demonstrated lower body fat in rats fed on diets based on compound feeds made from conventionally fertilised crops and to the stu dy by Srednicka-Tober et al . (2013) where no effect of diet on body fat was recorded. Huber et al . also showed an improved post challenge catch-up growth for chicken fed organic p roducts, in contrast to Srednicka-Tober et al . who found a higher body weight at weaning in rats fed crops under organic fertilisation, but a lower total weight gain. These results were i n contrast to the studies by Jensen et al . (2013 and 2012) where all rats were clinically heal thy with little or no impact on biomarkers of health by cultivation methods for the feeds. Lik ewise the study by Finamore et al . (2004) did not detect differences in general health parame ters. Interestingly, Chhabra et al . (2013) studied the activity in fruit flies ( Drosophila Melanogaster ) on organic or conventional feed Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 28 and demonstrated a higher overall activity in flies fed organic raisins and banana food. On the other hand, Lauridsen et al . (2008) found that rats, being night active animal s, had a lower daytime activity when fed organic feed, whereas the nightly activities of the rats were similar to those on conventional feed. The authors interpre ted the finding with organically fed rats having more uninterrupted rest during the daytime w hich may explain their lower content of adipose tissue. This is in line with human studies showing a significantly increased weight gain in people having less than seven hours sleep p er night (Patel et al . 2006). Although differences have been shown in plasma conc entration of alfa- and gamma tocopherol between rats fed conventional and organi c diet, the long-term status of vitamin E as assessed by measurements in adipose tissue showe d no effect of dietary treatment (Lauridsen et al ., 2008), indicating adequate amounts to meet physi ological needs in all diets, and thus probably no direct implication for health. The results are in accordance with those of Jensen et al . (2013 and 2012) There have been concerns that the reduced use of pe sticides and fungicides in organic farming may lead to a greater contamination by toxins in or ganic crop, while others tend to claim the opposite. Finamore et al . (2004) found that the proliferative capacity of r ats fed organically and conventionally grown feeds were similar, and fu rthermore that organic wheat did not affect the proliferative capacity of lymphocytes fr om protein-energy-malnourished rats with a less effective immune response. Finally, when lymph ocytes from protein-energy- malnourished rats were cultured in rat serum to mim ic in vivo situation, the capacity to respond to mitogen stimulation was lower in convent ional protein-energy-malnourished rats than in organic protein-energy-malnourished rats. T he latter finding indicates more contaminants present in conventionally than organic ally fed protein-energy-malnourished rats. Roselli et al . (2012) performed a cytokine secretion study which showed that organic carrots did not induce an inflammatory status in mi ce which could be an indirect indication of safety. However, the study was not designed for inv estigating safety. To summarise, in some well performed animal studies , a positive effect on animal physiology which may have an impact on animal health like immu ne parameters, hormonal balance and activity level was shown. Not all studies substanti ate these findings. Explanation for the discrepancies is to be found in the differences in study design which include animal breed, plant food used, growing seasons and geographical l ocation. 3.3 BIOMARKER STUDIES Major findings from thirteen papers are described i n this section.

Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 30 Authors Country Study design Study characteristic Main endpoint Main findings Curl et al . (2003) USA A cross-sectional study measuring concentration of 5 pesticides in 46- 47 months old. 18 children consumed organic diet and 21 a conventional diet. 24-urinary excretion of 5 pesticides The children consuming an organic diet had lower concentration of 4 of the pesticides and its metabolites. Residential pesticides had no effect on the results 3.3.1 ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY Soltoft et al . (2011) studied whether crops grown with conventional or wi th organic agriculture systems using animal manure (OA) or cov er crops (OB) had an impact on the content of carotenoids in carrots. Furthermore, the investigators tested the effect of diet based on conventional, OA and OB foods on the concentrati on of carotenoids in human plasma. The carrots were cultivated with conventional, OA and O B agriculture systems separately in 2007 and 2008. In the carrots, the content of -carotene was 75%, -carotene 23% and lutein 1.9% respectively The content of carotenoids in carrots cultivated with the three different agriculture systems were not significantly differen t. Eighteen men with mean age 25 years and average BMI at 22 kg/m 2 (1 st year) and 18 men with mean age 26 years and averag e BMI at 24 kg/m 2 (2 nd year) participated in double blind, crossover inte rvention trials. The intervention period for the trials was 12 days and a washout period two weeks. The conventional or organic diets based on carrots, oni ons, white cabbage, barley, potatoes, tomatoes and wheat had similar concentrations of ca rotenoids. Two menus and six types of diets were prepared from these food items. Six subj ects consumed conventional diet, six subjects consumed diet OA and six subjects consumed diet OB. Fasting blood samples were collected in the morning, on day one and on day 13. The -carotene concentrations in the plasma samples were significantly higher than the -carotenoid and lutein concentrations. The concentration of -carotene increased in plasma samples after the int ervention, both during the first and second year. No significant differenc e was detected in the concentration of plasma carotenoids when the participants with the t hree diet groups were compared. The focus in Burns-Whitmore et al . (2010) study from the USA was to evaluate the eff ect of egg intake on antioxidant levels, knowing that oxid ative stress is important in the pathogenesis of age-related macula degeneration (an eye-disorder). In their three-armed study examined plasma antioxidant l evels, using high-performance liquid chromatography, in 20 healthy subjects eating eithe r eggs from conventional fed chicken enriched with n-3 fatty acids or eggs from organica lly fed chicken, whereas the controls did not eat eggs. The participants ate six eggs per wee k during eight weeks. Serum lutein concentration increased significantly (about 2.5-fo ld) after the egg consumption period and no significant difference were found between the group s. Stracke et al . (2009) compared the content of carotenoids in car rots cultivated with conventional or organic agriculture systems. The au thors also studied the effect of carrot consumption on antioxidant status, DNA strand break s, and parameters of the immune system in healthy subjects. The content of carotenoids and the lipophilic antioxidant activity, measured as (\u00b5mol trolox equivalents/g fresh weight ) were not significantly different in the carrots produced organically and conventionally. Th irty-six non-smoker men, age 19-54 years, without the history of medication, participa ted in a randomised double-blind study. Two groups (12 subjects per group) consumed meals w ith 200g blanched carrots cultivated organically or conventionally for two weeks, wherea s the control group consumed carrot- restricted meals. The blood samples were collected on day 0, 2, 7 and 14. The concentration Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 31 of -carotene and -carotene in plasma increased significantly, howeve r, there was no significant difference in the concentration of - and -carotene between the groups eating carrots. The different diets had no significant eff ect on antioxidant status; ferric reducing ability of plasma, oxygen radical absorbance capaci ty, trolox equivalent antioxidative capacity (TEAC). Similarly, no significant differen ce was detected in DNA strand and the carotenoid concentration in the blood mononuclear c ells. Briviba et al . (2007) performed a double-blind randomised, cross over study to investigate whether consumption of organically or conventionall y produced apples will affect antioxidant status and DNA damage level in healthy subjects. Co nventional and organic apples, Golden Delicious, were cultivated according to the criteri a established by the Bio Suisse and Suisse Garantie, Switzerland. Eight organically and eight conventionally cultivated apples had similar concentrations of phenolic compound, chloro genic acid, and sum of all phenolic compounds. Six non-smoking healthy men, mean age 27 years and average BMI 23 kg/m 2 consumed 1000 g organically or conventionally culti vated apples. The subjects did not consume foods containing high concentration of poly phenols for three days before the intervention. The washout period between the two in terventions was one week. Blood was collected before and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, and 2 4 hours after the intervention. No differences in antioxidant status in plasma were found after co nsumption of organic or conventionally grown apples. Similar antigenotoxic potential was o bserved in both organic and conventionally grown apples. Di Renzo et al . (2007) determined the oxygen radical absorbing ca pacity (ORAC), antioxidant activity, in organic and conventional f ruits and vegetables. Except tomatoes and lettuce, the organically produced garlic, orange, b anana, carrot, beans, strawberry, lettuce, lemon, apple, potato, tomato, pears, peas, celery, wine, courgettes (summer squash) and milk showed significantly higher ORAC than the conventio nal products. The authors further tested whether the consumption of diets based on organic o r conventional food products might have an effect on the plasma levels of ORAC. Ten healthy non-smoker men, age 30-65, were given diets based on organic or conventional foods for 14 days. ORAC levels in plasma were elevated in men after the consumption of diets base d on organic products. The authors suggested that phenolic compounds in organic foods contribute to increase in antioxidant capacity in plasma. However, this study stands alon e and will have to be replicated by another research team to get scientific impact. Akcay et al . (2004) investigated whether the consumption of an organic red wine compared to a non-organic red wine increases antioxidant capaci ty and has an impact on the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein in healthy individuals. Six non-smoker healthy men and two non- smoker healthy women, age 24-45 years, participated in the study. The men consumed 200 ml and the women consumed 100 ml red organic wine in 1 5 minutes. Blood samples were collected at the baseline, one and six hours after the wine consumption. After a washout period for six weeks, the intervention was repeated . The total content of phenolic compounds, measured as galic acid equivalents, in organic and non-organic red wine was 18.3 mg/ml and 40.2 mg/ml respectively. The peak plasma concentrat ion of galic acid equivalents was reached one hour after the consumption of organic w ine and six hours after the consumption of non-organic wine (both 350mg/L). The consumption of organic wine was associated with a significant increase in erythrocyte superoxide dism utase after one and six hours of the trial and in erythrocyte catalase (eCAT) only six hours a fter the trial. Whereas, the consumption of non-organic wine was only associated with an increa se in erythrocyte superoxide dismutase after six hours. Organically and conventionally pro duced wines did not differ in the ability to inhibit the oxidation of LDL in the absence or pres ence of CuSO 4. Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 32 Caris-Veyrat et al . (2004) determined antioxidants in tomatoes cultur ed organically and non- organically in one area in France. The plasma antio xidant concentrations were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography, in humans c onsuming purees based on the two culture-forms of tomatoes. Ten healthy females ate 100 g/day for three weeks of tomato puree (for lunch or dinner) in a randomised trial. It was reported that albeit higher antioxidant levels were present in the organic tomatoes, it did not re sult in higher plasma antioxidant levels compared to conventional grown tomatoes. In a double-blind, crossover study, Grinder-Pederse n et al . (2003) compared the effect of diets based on organically or conventionally produced foo ds on urine flavonoids and plasma markers of antioxidant defence system in healthy su bjects. Six non-smoker healthy men and 10 non-smoker, non-pregnant women, age 21-35 years, mean BMI 23.4 kg/m 2, participated in the study. Their average energy intake was 12\u00b12.7 M J. The subjects consumed diets based on four menus, which contained breakfast, lunch, dinne r and snacks. The menus and food quantities in organic and conventional diets were i dentical. The vegetables grown organically or conventionally were harvested within the same we ek. Intervention period lasted for 22 days and the washout period was three weeks. Food analys es were performed on duplicate portions of each menu on day one to day four in the first we ek of each intervention period. Blood samples were collected before the intervention day -1, the baseline 0, after 22 and 23 days after each intervention. 24-hour urine samples were collected in acid-washed containers on day 0 and on day 22. Among the five flavonoids anal ysed, the quercetin concentration in the organically produced foods was significantly higher than in the conventionally produced foods. The trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity w as significantly higher after the consumption of conventionally produced foods than t he organically produced foods. Other plasma markers of antioxidant status did not change d significantly. The consumption of organically produced foods caused a higher urinary quercetin and kaemferol excretion than the conventionally produced foods. It was suggested that organically produced foods had greater impact than conventionally produced foods o n the concentration of urinary flavonoids and markers of antioxidant system. 3.3.2 FATTY ACIDS Rist et al . (2007) investigated whether the inclusion of orga nic dairy and meat products in maternal diet would alter the concentration of conj ugated linoleic acid isomers (CLA) and trans-vaccenic acid (18:1 trans-11) in breastmilk f rom 312 women of KOALA Birth Control Study (The Netherlands). Trans-vaccenic acid is the main trans fatty acid isomer present in milk fat. Mammals convert it into rumenic acid, a c onjugated linoleic acid. Based on a self- administered questionnaire 186 women reported that they consumed conventional diets, 33 women consumed diets which included 50-90% organic foods and 37 women consumed diets with >90% organic diary and meat products. The latt er group consumed more dairy fat than the former groups. The participants provided breast milk samples one month post-partum for the fatty acid analysis. The concentration of rumen ic acid (18:2 cis-9, trans-11) was significantly higher also after adjusting for sever al variables, in breastmilk collected from the women who consumed >90% organic diary and meat prod ucts than in breastmilk from the women who consumed conventional diet. Similarly, tr ans-vaccenic acid concentration was higher in the breastmilk collected from the women w ho consumed organic diet than in the women who consumed conventional diet. The breastmil k from the women consuming the organic diet had lower level of -linolenic acid (18:3 n-3) and total mono unsaturat ed fatty acid than the women on the conventional diet. An in crease in intake of organic food was associated with increased trans-vaccenic acid conce ntration. It has not been established yet Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 33 whether increased intake of CLA and trans-vaccenic acid by human newborn has any health benefits, nevertheless, in animal models, CLA and t rans-vaccenic acid have shown some anti- inflammatory effects. Mueller et al . (2010) measured the ratio of the trans fatty acid isomers in breastmilk from the women from the same Birth Control Study (KOALA Birt h Control Study, the Netherlands). The concentration of total trans fatty acids was no t significantly different in the breastmilk collected from the women on conventional diet (n=18 5) than in the women on 50-90% organic diet (n=33) or women on more than 90% organ ic diet (n=37). However, the ratio 18:1 trans-9/18:1 trans-11 was lower in breastmilk from the women in the two organic groups than in the conventional group. The 18:1 trans-10/18:1 t rans-11 ratio was lower in the breastmilk collected from the women with high dairy fat intake than in the women with lower dairy fat intake. Similarly, 18:1 trans-10/18:1 trans-11 rati o was significantly lower in the groups consuming organic meat and dairy products than in t he group, which consumed conventional diet. 3.3.3 COPPER AND ZINC Mark et al . (2013) ) report findings of two double-blind, cro ssover trials, which investigated the intake and absorption of zinc and copper throug h diets based on organic growing system with animal manure, organic growing system with cov er crops, and conventional growing system. Nine crops were cultivated to prepare diets for the study subjects. In 2008, 17 healthy non-smokers, mean age 24, average BMI was 22, and i n 2009, 16 non-smokers, mean age 28, average BMI was 24 participated in the trials. Spec ial diet menus were prepared. There were three dietary periods of 12 days in each trial. Int ervention trial from day one to day seven was used as equilibration period. On day eight, stable enriched isotope labelled breakfast, lunch and dinner were served to the subjects. The last fo ur days were used for analytical tracing of the isotope. The regular diets were compensated wit h 1mg ZnCl 2/10 MJ from day one to day seven and from day nine to day 12. On day eight, Zn Cl 2 was replaced with stable zinc isotope. The washout period between intervention periods was 14 days. Faecal samples were collected for 24 hours at baseline, two days before and after the isotope administration for the measurement of copper and zinc isotope. There was n o difference in bioavalibility of copper or zinc between organic or conventional diets. 3.3.4 PESTICIDES Lu et al . (2006) reported that the consumption of organic d iets decreased the urine concentration of organophosphorus pesticide metabol ites in children. Twenty-three children, age 3-11 years, consumed conventional diet from day one to day three (phase 1), organic diet from day four to day eight (phase 2) and convention al diet, from day nine to day 15 (phase 3). Urine samples were collected every day, twice a day for15 days. Among the five pesticide metabolites analysed, the richloro-2-pyridinol, were significantly decreased in the children during the phase 2 compar ed to phase 1 or phase 3. It was concluded that organic diets protected children from organoph osphorus pesticide exposure. Curl, Fenske and Elgethun (2003) estimated the leve l of organophosphorus pesticide exposure to preschool children from diets by measuring five pesticide metabolites in the urine samples. The age of the children ranged from 46 to 47 months , 56% were boys, all from Seattle, Washington, USA. Based on the label information on the food packs, 18 children consumed organic diets ( 75% organic foods) and 21 children consumed convent ional diets, (75% Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 34 conventional foods). Age, sex, child activity and f amily economy were not significantly different between the two groups. Dimethylthiophosp hate was the major metabolite detected in 87% of the urine samples. The children consuming organic foods had lower concentration of total dialkylphosphate metabolites, dimethylphos phate, dimethylthiophosphate, dimethyldithiophosphate, in the urine than in the c hildren consuming conventional foods. Residential pesticide (pesticide residues in home) had no effect on the findings. It was suggested that the children consuming conventional foods might had been exposed to higher dimethyl organophosphorus pesticide exposure than t he children consuming organic foods. 3.3.5 DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY OF THE MAIN FINDINGS IN BIOMARKER STUDIES Studying biomarkers to evaluate possible effects on human health is a well-known but rather complex approach, and few well designed studies inv estigating effect of organic foods compared to conventional foods were found. There are indications that increased oxidative stre ss is associated with chronic diseases. Data based on many studies suggest that increased bioava ilability of antioxidants attenuate oxidative stress and may protect or delay onset of disease. Indications from plant analyses indicate somewhat higher concentrations of bioactiv e plant metabolites in organically grown products compared with conventionally grown, and it has therefore been hypothesised that the antioxidants capacity in blood would be increased i n individuals who consume organic plant foods compared with individuals consuming conventio nal plant foods. In all but one study, organically grown foods did not result in a higher blood antioxidant capacity compared with conventionally grown foods (Di Renzo et al ., 2007). In one study it was found that antioxidant quercetin concentration in the organica lly produced foods was significantly higher than in the conventionally produced foods (Grinder- Pedersen et al ., 2003). However, the consumption of the organically produced foods resul ted in a higher urinary excretion of the metabolites quercetin and kaemferol. One explanatio n for these findings might be that abundant intake of antioxidants in an experimental setting may only lead to an increased excretion in health subjects with sufficient intake , i.e. the cup is full. It is possible that higher antioxidant concentrations with use of organic food would be seen in energy and nutrient deficient subjects, as was indicated in the animal study by Finamore et al . (2004). Zinc and copper are cofactors in several antioxidan t enzymes and the result from the study of Mark et al ., (2013) showed no difference in intake or absorpt ion of zinc or copper with use of an organic diet as compared with conventional diets . The concentrations of trans fatty acid isomers (CLA and trans-vaccenic acid) were altered in breastmilk in women who consumed diets composed of >90% organic meat and dairy products (Rist et al ., 2007 and Mueller et al ., 2010). Increased concentration of these trans fatty acids is reported to have anti-inflammatory a nd growth supporting properties, and hence a positive effect on a child's health could be expe cted. It remains, however, to be established whether increased intake of these trans fatty acid implicate health benefits in new born children. Two studies from USA showed a significant reduction of urinary pesticides excretion in children during dietary periods with mostly organic food as compared with conventional foods. Similar studies have not been conducted in N orway or in any of the Nordic countries, but in general exposure to pesticides in the Nordic countries were presumed to be lower than in USA and lower excretion of pesticide metabolites would be expected. However, Norwegian pregnant women participating in the Norwe gian Mother and Child cohort Study had higher total urinary concentration of organopho sphate pesticide metabolites compared to Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 35 pregnant women participating in the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey in USA (Ye et al . 2009). The higher concentration of pesticides in Norway might be explained by that about 98% of fruits and 69% of berries sold in Norway are imported 2. To summarise, organic and conventionally produced f oods resulted in similar antioxidant capacity in healthy subjects. There are some indica tions of increased concentration of anti- inflammatory and growth stimulating trans fatty aci ds in human milk from mothers using predominantly organically produced dairy and meat p roducts. Children consuming an organic diet as compared to a conventional diet had lower u rinary concentrations of pesticide metabolites. 3.4 OTHER STUDIES - CELL PROLIFERATION - IN VITRO This section contains a study that couldn't be cate gorised as human studies, animal model studies or biomarker studies. The study investigate s cell proliferation status, and the reported findings may be indirectly related to human health and organic foods. In their study, Olsson et al . (2006) used extracts from five different strawber ry-types grown either conventionally or in an organically in one S wedish research station. They used a measuring system based on suppression of proliferat ion of human colonic and breast cancer cell lines. The highest concentration of the organi cally-derived extracts caused a more pronounced antiproliferative effect (in the order o f 10% better) than extracts obtained from conventionally grown strawberries. 3.5 METHODOLOGICAL ASPECTS - LIMITATIONS During the preparation of this report several metho dological challenges in studies investigating organic food and the effect on human health became evident. A frequent problem was noted with regard to the inadequate des criptions of the foods which were tested in the various studies, also in terms of production conditions. The chemical composition of plant products is determined by multiple factors, e .g. cultivar variety, soil conditions, precipitation, and amount of light. All these condi tions have to be controlled for if the result of the agricultural system is to be evaluated prope rly. Another major problem identified in the literature was the lack of a suitable design, both for experimental studies, but perhaps even more so for clinical trials. Clearly, the most robust design would be to embark on a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomised trial. Ideally, such a trial should be sufficiently powered to addr ess clear and meaningful primary clinical endpoints, e.g. risk of various diseases or mortali ty. An adequately selected control-group is mandatory. We have not been able to identify any st udy in our literature search that satisfies these criteria. However, such trials are suited for medicines or food supplements, while interventions with whole diets cannot be run over m onths or years while waiting for eventual health outcomes to appear. Carefully conducted stud ies with other designs e.g. observational epidemiological studies (preferably prospective) ar e therefore realistic alternatives. In addition to clinically relevant endpoints, importan t knowledge might also be collected via sampling of various nutrient and non-nutrient bioma rkers and/or other compounds (e.g. pesticides and other contaminants). Although meanin gful endpoints should be fairly easy gr\u00f8nnsaker og po teter 2003-2012. Oppdatert 19. mars 2013. Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 36 identify for a clinical trial, the choice of biomar kers is probably more difficult. With regard to experimental studies, e.g. concerning cells culture d in vitro , there is a need for standardisation of the experimental conditions (types of cells, dos e and frequency of adding organically prepared solutions etc.). Animal studies may add to the knowledge about the p ossible positive or negative effects of organic foods. The included animal studies were wel l-designed and investigated relevant endpoints and selection of biomarkers. However, the extrapolation from animal studies to humans remains a challenge. This might be particula rly relevant to the field of possible benefits of organic food on human health. Rodents, the species most often used as experimental animals, display quite different chara cteristics in terms of e.g. life span, metabolic rate, and immune responses, compared with humans. Moreover, chronic disorders rooted in a sedentary lifestyle and/or poor diets a re quite rare among laboratory animals in general. To summarise, the present report has uncovered shor tcomings in experimental design and reporting and consequently identified a marked need for more and improved studies in order to establish whether consumption of organic food is beneficial for human health. It is of importance to gain more knowledge both on eventual positive and negative health effects. 4 Reviews The results and conclusions in the reviews describe d in this chapter are mainly based on the same studies as included in our chapter 3. The resu lts and conclusions from these reviews are therefore not taken into consideration in our concl usions in chapter 7. The description of findings in the reviews is included as they give an overview of the scientific literature in this field and lines will be drawn to compare the findin gs in these reviews with our own results and conclusions. A short description of the aim of the reviews, number of included studies and main conclusions are given below. In section 4. 1 additional specific human health outcomes and reported differences in concentrations of nutrients, other bioactive compounds and contaminants between organically and convention ally produced foods are outlined. A total of 12 reviews addressing possible health ou tcomes related to consumption of organically produced food were found, of which two were based on statistical meta-analyses (Brandt et al . 2011, Smith-Spangler et al . 2012). The reviews differ in their aims, and in t he types of studies included. Brandt et al . (2011) assessed only fruit, vegetables and herbs. Huber et al . (2011) and Velimirov et al . (2010) had a particular focus on animal studies. The number of studies directly addressing possible effects of organic food on human health is low, and as a consequence, conclusions in reviews (in particula r the older ones) are mostly based on evaluations of differences in contents of nutrients or other substances of relevance for health. In one review, an estimation of the impact on human health, in terms of life time expectancy, of a higher content of secondary plant metabolites in organic food is calculated (Brandt et al . 2011). Smith-Spangler et al . (2012) included 17 studies in humans and 223 stud ies of nutrient and contaminant levels in foods in their review. Their aim was to review evidence comparing the health effects of organic and conventional foods. O f the 17 studies in humans, three examined clinical outcomes, one reported Campylobacter infections, and the remaining studies examined health markers such as serum lipid or vita min levels. The authors described the reviewed studies as generally heterogeneous and lim ited in number, and that publication bias may be present. They concluded that the reviewed li terature lacks strong evidence that Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 37 organic foods are significantly more nutritious tha n conventional foods, but that consumption of organic foods may reduce exposure to pesticide r esidues and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (Smith-Spangler et al . 2012). The review by Brandt et al . (2011) had two aims: 1) to perform a meta-analysi s of the published comparisons of the content of vitamins an d other bioactive metabolites in organically and conventionally produced fruits and vegetables, and 2) to estimate the potential increase in life expectancy that would be achieved by switching from conventional to organic fruits and vegetables without changing the amount c onsumed per day. A total of 102 papers were included, and a quantitative meta-analysis was performed. The reported result was that the content of bioactive metabolites in organic foo ds is on average 12% higher than in corresponding conventional samples, an overall diff erence spanning a large variation among sub-groups of secondary metabolites, from a 16% hig her content for defense-related compounds to a non-significant 2% lower content for carotenoids, while vitamin C showed a 6% higher content. Based on the assumption that inc reasing the content of biologically active compounds in fruits and vegetables by 12% would be equivalent to increasing the intake of fruits and vegetables by the same 12%, it was estim ated that the potential increase in life expectancy that would be achieved by switching from conventional to organic fruit and vegetables without changing the amount consumed per day, to 17 days for women and 25 days for men. The model developed by Brandt et al . (2011) to perform this estimation was based on a model by (Veerman et al . 2006) to estimate changes in lifestyle expectancy caused by changes in fruit and vegetable intake. To put th ese results in perspective, the authors referred to screening for breast cancer which has b een calculated to provide an average increase in life expectancy of 35 days (Bonneux 200 3). The review by Dangour et al . (2010) (commissioned by the UK Food Standards Age ncy), included 12 studies and was aimed at assessing the strength of evidence that nutrition-related health benefits could be attributed to the consumpt ion of foods produced under organic farming methods. It included eight human studies (s ix clinical trials, one cohort study, and one cross-sectional study) and four animal studies or human cell lines or serum. Dangour et al . concluded that the majority of the studies showed no evidence of differences in nutrition- related health outcomes that result from exposure t o organic or conventionally produced foodstuffs, and that evidence is lacking for nutrit ion-related health effects that result from the consumption of organically produced foods. The auth ors reported that a quantitative meta- analysis was not considered justified due to the sc arcity of studies and heterogeneity with regard to study designs, exposures tested and healt h outcomes investigated (Dangour et al . 2010). The review by Gu\u00e9uen and Pascal (2010) is an update of the report published in 2003 by the French Agency for Food Safety (AFSSA) a nutritional and safety evaluation of organically produced foods. Approximately 100 studies were publ ished since the last review in 2003. The main part of the review concerned differences in th e contents of nutrients and other bioactive compounds, such as secondary plant metabolites, nit rate and pesticide residues. The authors concluded that the small differences observed in ch emical composition between organic and conventional foods have no practical significant ef fect on nutrition and health. The aim of the review by Huber et al . (2011) was to give an overview of recent studies investigating the health value of organic foods and to present a framework for estimating the scientific impact of these studies, while some stud ies in humans were also reviewed. The authors concluded that if \"health effects\" are defi ned as effects on defined diseases in humans, evidence for such effects is presently lacking. Bas ed on the literature, a hypothesis is proposed that organic food increases the capacity o f living organisms to recover to Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 38 homeostasis - referring to the term 'resilience' - suggested to reflect a qualitatively good state of health, and to confirm this, effect studies on s pecific markers for health are called for. The aim of the review by Velimirov et al . (2010) was to describe the state of the art of an imal experiments used for comparing the impact on the an imals' health as a model for the effects experienced by the human consumers. A total of 18 s tudies were reviewed, including plant- derived feeds only. These studies included feeding experiments with different fertiliser applications; feeding experiments with feed from or ganic versus conventional growing systems; feeding studies with the aim of defining b iomarkers for health as proxy for human health, measuring differences between organic and c onventional diets. The authors reported that the majority of the reviewed feeding experimen ts revealed effects of the organically produced feed on health parameters such as reproduc tive performance and immune responses. They concluded that the science-based results sugge st positive influences from organic feeds, but there is still a need for confirmation in anima ls and, finally, in humans. The authors remarked that for this purpose animal feeding trial s with feed from different production systems should be conducted, with the aims to defin e health indicators and to establish biomarkers as a basis for future dietary interventi on studies in humans. The review by Lima and Vianello (2011) aimed at rep orting on the main characteristics and properties of plants cultivated organically and con ventionally, and concluded that intake of organic foods appears to lead to some advantages, s uch as higher content of phenolic compounds and some vitamins, such as vitamin C, and a lower content of nitrates and pesticides. Crinnion (2010) mainly reviewed studies comparing o rganically vs. conventionally grown foods with regard to contents of vitamins, minerals , phytochemicals and pesticide residues, as well as one study on allergic manifestations in chi ldren. The author concluded that although in vitro studies of organic fruits and vegetables consisten tly demonstrate that organic foods have greater antioxidant activity, are more potent suppressors of the mutagenic action of toxic compounds, and inhibit the proliferation of certain cancer cell lines, in vivo studies of antioxidant activity in humans have so far not demo nstrated additional health benefits. It was further concluded that health benefits from consumi ng organic dairy products have been demonstrated in regard to allergic dermatitis. Holmboe-Ottesen (2004) reported that organic foods compared to conventionally produced foods seem to have a higher content of antioxidants in plant products and a higher content of fat-soluble vitamins and n-3 fatty acids in animal products. Animal studies show higher fertility and less morbidity in animals fed organic ally. She further reported that no controlled studies in humans have assessed health effects, alt hough a higher content of antioxidants have been found in the urine of subjects put on an organ ic diet. However, she concluded that a change to an organic diet may have a direct positiv e health effect on humans, as well as an indirect effect through a healthier environment. Magkos et al . (2003), reported that there is little evidence th at organic and conventional foods differ in respect to the concentrations of the vari ous micronutrients (vitamins, minerals and trace elements), but that there seems to be a sligh t trend towards higher ascorbic acid content in organically grown leafy vegetables and potatoes. They also reported a trend towards lower protein concentration but of higher quality in some organic vegetables and cereal crops. With respect to the rest of the nutrients and the other food groups, the authors found that existing evidence is inadequate to allow for valid conclusio ns. Animal feeding experiments indicated that animal health and reproductive performance wer e slightly improved when they are organically fed, but a similar finding has not yet been identified in humans. They concluded Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 39 that despite any differences, it seems that a well- balanced diet can equally improve health regardless of its organic or conventional origin (M agkos, Arvaniti and Zampelas 2003a). In their review on food safety aspects of organical ly vs. conventionally produced foods, Magkos et al . (2003), reported that some organic foods can be e xpected to contain fewer agrochemical residues and lower levels of nitrate t han conventionally grown alternatives. On the other hand, environmental contaminants are equa lly present in foods of both origins. With regard to other food hazards, such as natural chemi cals, microbial pathogens and mycotoxins, no clear conclusions could be drawn, although sever al interesting points were highlighted. They concluded that it is difficult to weigh the ri sks, but remarked that it should be made clear to consumers that \"organic\" does not equal \"safe\" ( Magkos, In 2006, Magos et al . presented a critical discussion of issues that re late to the safety of organically and conventionally produced food. They called for caution in making firm conclusions based on the literature available at th at point, and they also discussed the wider context of food quality which may be perceived as r elevant for consumers when they consider organic vs. conventional food in the market (Magkos , Arvaniti and Zampelas 2006). 4.1 HEALTH OUTCOMES AND COMPARISON OF NUTRIENTS , OTHER BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS AND CONTAMINANTS DISCUSSED IN THE REVIEW In the study by Kummerling et al . (2008) addressed in Smith-Spangler et al ., 2012; Huber et al ., 2011; Crinnion, 2010 and Dangour et al ., 2010, it was reported that consumption of dairy products of which more than 90% were organically pr oduced lowered the risk of eczema in children. The study by Kummerling et al . is included in our section 3.1.1. One study of differences in sperm quality related t o consumption of organic vs. conventional food was reviewed by Smith-Spangler et al . (2012), who concluded that no clinically meaningful differences were found. This study is am ong the studies included in our section 3.1.2. In studies investigating nutrient concentrations in organic vs. conventionally produced foods, higher levels of vitamin C and phosphorous and a te ndency towards lower levels of carotenoids were reported. It was further reported a trend towards lower protein concentration but of higher quality in some organic vegetable and cereal crops. However, most reviews concluded that these differences are of no clinical significance. The authors concluded that higher contents of some types of secondary plant me tabolites have also been demonstrated in organically grown produce compared with conventiona lly grown. However, it remains to be shown whether the level of differences between orga nically and conventionally produced food have and Smith-Spangler et al ., 2012). These conclusions are based partly on the same studies as included in our section 3.3.1, while som e of the reviews have investigated a large number of studies on differences in levels of nutri ents in organic vs conventional foods not included in our report. Higher concentrations of n-3 fatty acids and/or con jugated linoleic acid in milk and meat from organically raised animals were reported in Crinnio n, 2010; Gueguen and 2011and Smith-Spangler et al ., 2012. The two studies of Rist et al . (2007) and Mueller et al . (2010) where higher concentrations of conjugated linoleic acid and trans-vaccenic acids were found i n the breastmilk of mothers who reported consumption of a strictly organic diet were address ed in Crinnion, 2010; Drangour et al ., Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 40 2010; Huber et al ., 2011 and Smith-Spangler et al ., 2012. These findings are partly based on the same studies as included in our section 3.3.2. Lower levels of dietary exposure of pesticide resid ues, measured as pesticide metabolites with use of organic diets compared to conventional diets were commented on and all reviewers concluded that consumption of organic food provides protection against exposure to organophosphorous pesticides commonly used in agric Smith-Spangler et al ., 2012). With regard to mycotoxins, equal or lower amounts w ere reported in organic crops compared with conventional crops (Gueguen and Pascal, 2010; Huber et al ., and Smith-Spangler et al ., 2012). Lower levels and lower risk for contamination with deoxynivalenol (DON) was found i n organic grains than conventional alternatives (Smith-Spangler et al ., 2012). It is reported that estimates of differences in lev els of heavy metal contamination in food are highly heterogeneous, and it is generally concluded that these substances may be equally present in food from both farming systems (Magkos et al . 2003b and Smith-Spangler et al ., 2012). No significant differences in cadmium or lea d content were identifiable (Smith- Spangler et al ., 2012). Several studies report lower levels of nitrate in o rganic vs. conventional foods (Holmboe- Ottesen, and Magkos et al ., 2006). With regard to bacterial infections it is generally reported similar risks independent of farming system (Magkos et al ., 2003b and Magkos et al ., 2006). An exploratory case-control study showed no significant differences in symptoma tic Camphylobacter infections between organic and conventional animal products (Smith-Spa ngler et al ., 2012). It was reported that Escherichia coli contamination risk did not differ between organic and conventional produce. Bacterial contamination of retail chicken and pork was common but unrelated to farming method. However, the risk of isolating bacteria res istant to three or more antibiotics was higher in conventional than organic chicken and por k (Smith-Spangler et al ., 2012). To summarise, the overall conclusion of these revie ws is that no clear effects on human health have been presented as a result of consuming an org anic diet compared to a conventional diet. However, reduced frequency of atopic disease among children growing up with consumption of organic milk was reported. In one review, a 12% increase in intake of biologic ally active compounds with consumption of organically grown fruits and vegetables was sugg ested. This was evaluated to be equivalent to a 12% increase in intake of fruits and vegetable s and was modelled to represent a small increase in life expectancy. Some other reviews als o commented on higher concentrations of biologically active compounds with an organic diet compared to conventional and related this to human health impact, while others concluded that the small differences in intake would not have health consequences for humans. A reduced pesticide exposure with organic diet was commented on in several reviews. However, since no human studies had been conducted to verify a positive effect of the lower pesticide exposure no conclusions could be made on health impact in humans. Well-powered human studies for future research is c alled for and partly outlined. Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 41 5 Reports prepared by governmental bodies Other European governmental bodies have prepared re views and conducted assessments of the scientific knowledge on organic foods, nutritio n and health. The mode of working and main conclusions from two governmental reports will be presented here. 5.1 FOOD STANDARDS AGENCY , UNITED KINGDOM The British Food Standards Agency commissioned the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine to write the report \"Comparison of putativ e health effects of organically and conventionally produced foodstuffs: a systematic re view\" in 2009 (FSA 2009). Background: The large and increasing demand for org anic foods in the UK and elsewhere. Literature search: Systematic literature review cov ering peer-reviewed journals between 1958 and 2008. Only three of the 11 included studies met the pre-defined satisfactory quality criteria. Aim: To systematically review the evidence of diffe rences in putative health effects of organically produced compared with conventionally p roduced foodstuffs. Focus on the nutritional content of foods. The contaminant conte nt or the environmental impact of the agricultural practises was not addressed. Type of studies: Six human studies including four c linical trials; five in vitro or ex vivo studies on human cell lines or serum. Exclusion criteria: not peer-reviewed, no English a bstract, direct comparisons was not possible, animal health was investigated from a vet erinary perspective and not as a model for human health, were primarily concerned with content of other bioactive compounds. Comparator: Conventional farming methods Grading of evidence: No, not possible because of th e high diversity of the included studies. Main conclusions: Because of the limited and highly variable data available, and concerns over the reliability of some reported findings, the re is currently no evidence of a health benefit from consuming organic compared to conventionally p roduced foodstuffs. It should be noted that this conclusion relates to the evidence base c urrently available on the nutrient content of foodstuffs. 5.2 AGENCY FOR FOOD , ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY , FRANCE The French Food Safety Agency (Agence Fran\u00e7aise de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Sanitaire des Aliments) published the report \"Nutrition and health assessme nt of organic food\" in 2003 (AFSSA 2003). Background: An increase in production and consumpti on of organic foods in France. No overall evaluation had been conducted on the specif ic practices of organic agriculture in terms of nutrition and health. The working group consiste d of both scientists and stakeholders. Aim: Gather scientific data and perform a benefit a nd risk assessment. Scientific literature search: Emphasis on articles published since 1980 and published internationally. Clear inclusion and exclusion crit eria. When data were missing, a deductive approach was used. Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 42 Type of studies: Comparative studies, i.e. organic vs conventionally produced foods. Exclusion criteria: Unknown history of the farmland , incorrect practices in terms of organic standards, non-validated data. Comparator: Conventional farming methods. Grading of evidence: No. Main conclusions: In terms of nutrition, no conclusion could be drawn as to differences in nutrient content of organic foods and foods produced in a co nventional manner. Slight tendency to higher dry matter content in organicall y produced vegetables, but not fruits. Slightly lower protein content in organical ly produced cereals. Better amino acid balance. Notable differences in fatty acid pro files in animal products. Slightly higher vitamin C in organically produced potatoes, no differences in -carotene in vegetables. The only significant differences found were the higher content of polyphenols in organic fruit and vegetables. The assessment notes that some technological proces ses used in organic farming practices are likely to have consequences for nutri tional quality of the foods. For example, the milling processes enable better preser vation of the germ and bran in the flour, resulting in breads richer in minerals, fibr e and vitamins. In terms of health and food safety, the majority of studies show no residues of pesticides in organic foods. As to mycotoxins, no m ajor differences were reported. Lower nitrate levels in organically produces foods. Dioxins and other environmental pollutant exposure happen as a result of contaminat ion and are not specific to any particular agricultural system. 6 Comments on differences between conventional and organic foods - nutrients, other bioactive compound s and contaminants This chapter will briefly discuss eventual differen ces in the content of substances (nutrients and other bioactive compounds, pesticides, other co ntaminants and mycotoxins) in food products from the two production systems. Several o f the substances have partly been covered by sections in the VKM opinions Part I: Plant healt h and plant production and Part V: Pesticide residues. Nutrients and other bioactive compounds (secondary metabolites) in plants Nutrients The VKM opinion Part I: Plant health and plant prod uction has given the following conclusion regarding comparison of nutrient and oth er bioactive compound content in organically or conventionally produced food: \"The e valuation shows that protein content is commonly lower in organically produced wheat than i n conventional wheat. Dry matter and starch contents are higher in organic than in conve ntionally produced potato. Higher nutrient levels in the soil support rapid growth of the pota to tuber at the expense of dry matter and starch content in conventional farming. In most stu dies the nitrate content is higher in conventional than in organic potato due to higher s oil nitrogen availability in conventional than in organic farming. Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 43 Most studies report higher levels of dry matter, as corbic acid and antioxidant activity in organic than in conventional apples. Organic grown berries may have higher sensory quality and content of secondary plant metabolites with ant ioxidant activity and some minerals than conventional berries. For vegetables the results were variable and less c lear. In some studies vegetables grown in organic production systems have higher content of s ome nutrients and secondary plant metabolites with antioxidant activity, while in oth er studies there is no effect of the growing system.\" Based on the conclusions from the Part I: Plant hea lth and plant production, results from comparative studies do not allow for firm conclusio ns as to major differences in nutrient content between conventionally and organically grow n plants. Fertilisers with high nitrogen content drives the water content of plants up somew hat and leads to a certain dilution of nutrient concentrations, which explains the slightl y lower content of some nutrients in conventionally grown products. Oppositely, a higher nitrogen and nitrate content have been found in many studies of conventional compared with organically grown cereals and vegetables explained by the high nitrogen input fro m artificial fertilisers. Other bioactive compounds (secondary plant metaboli tes) Higher contents of secondary plant metabolites have been reported in organically compared to conventionally grown foods in the Part I: Plant hea lth and plant production, and in several single studies and reviews included in this report. This has been explained in the context of restrictions in the type and intensity of fertilisa tion in organic agriculture (Brandt and Molgaard 2001, Brandt et al . 2013). In one review, a 12% increase in intake of biologic ally active compounds with consumption of organically grown fruits and vegetables was sugg ested. This was evaluated to be equivalent to a 12% increase in intake of fruits and vegetable s and was modelled to represent a small increase in life expectancy. Some other reviews also commented on higher concent rations of biologically active compounds with an organic diet compared to conventi onal and related this to human health impact, while others concluded that the small diffe rences in intake would not have health consequences for humans. The results vary with rega rd to different types of secondary plant metabolites, and it remains to be shown whether the level of differences between organically and conventionally produced food have health relate d implications. Pesticides Both animal and human studies have shown that pesti cides may have a negative impact on reproductive health (Fernandez et al . 2007, WHO/UNEP 2013). Synthetic pesticides are no t permitted in organic farming, and lower concentrati ons of pesticides have been documented in organically grown compared with conventional gro wn vegetables, fruits and berries in the VKM opinion Part V: Pesticide residues and in sever al of the included single studies and reviews included in this report. Data from the 2010 EFSA Report showed that 4.2% of the conventional and 1.0% of the organic plant products exceeded the MRL values (maximum residue level), and 43.3% of the conventional and 1 0.8% of the organic plant products had measurable residues below the MRL (EFSA 2013). Of 6 24 organic samples analysed in Norway over the last six years only one sample had residues exceeding MRL. Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 44 The main conclusion from the VKM opinion Part V: Pe sticide residues is that the general levels of pesticide residues in both conventional a nd organic food are low, and well below what is likely to result in adverse health effects. Furthermore they conclude: \"Although the data in part is insufficient to perform quantitativ e comparisons of residue levels between conventional and organic products, it is concluded that organic food contains far lower amounts of pesticides than conventional food. No ge nerally accepted methodology is at present established for cumulative risk assessment of combined exposure to pesticide residues. Available data suggest however that combi ned exposure is not likely to result in increased human health risk.\" Although organic food not seems to be completely fr ee from pesticide residues, due to contamination from conventional agriculture or frau d, organic foods have been convincingly demonstrated to expose consumers to fewer and lower levels of pesticide residues. As discussed in section 3.3.5 in this report, the impo rtance of lower pesticides exposure with organic compared to conventionally produced food on human health has to be investigated further. Other contaminants The VKM opinion Part I: Plant health and plant prod uction has given the following conclusion regarding comparison of contaminants con tent in organically or conventionally produced food: \"The uptake in plants of most organi c chemical contaminants from soil is very low or negligible. Differences in organic contamina nts in soil are probably mostly related to sources that are not influenced by organic and conv entional practices. Due to high human consumption, cereals and vegetables are important s ources for dietary intake of heavy metals. The data do not provide basis for a conclusion on d ifferences in levels of metals between organically and conventionally grown food plants.\" This is in line with the reviews included in this o pinion, which also says that environmental contaminants are equally present in foods of both o rigins, and that differences in levels of heavy metal contamination contaminants in food are highly heterogeneous. It is generally concluded that these substances may be equally pres ent in food from both farming systems. Consequently, no conclusions can be drawn regarding health effects related to contaminant differences. Mycotoxins The VKM opinion Part I: Plant health and plant prod uction has given the following conclusion regarding comparison of contaminants con tent in organically or conventionally produced food \"Contamination of cereals with Fusarium mycotoxins is widespread. Results from comparison of mycotoxin contamination in organ ic and conventional cereals are variable. Most studies found no difference in DON c ontent and the majority of the remaining studies reported on lower levels in organic than in conventional cereals. Most studies showed that organically produced cereals contained lower l evels of T-2 and HT-2 toxin than conventionally grown cereals. Organic cereal farmer s practice wider crop rotation, more ploughing, and they apply less fertiliser which giv es lower plant density then on conventional farms. DON producing fungi are partly controlled by fungicides in conventional farming, while there are no approved fungicides for control of T-2 and HT-2 producing fungi. Some studies showed higher mycotoxin contamination in or ganic than in conventional apple products, while other studies reported similar cont amination. The difference may be due to Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 45 more efficient disease control in conventional orch ards, which reduces the mycotoxin producing fungi in apple fruits.\" The similar or lower levels of trichotecene mycotox ins (DON, T-2 and HT-2) in organic compared with conventional produced cereals may be of importance for infants and children who have a high consumption of cereals (VKM 2013). Differences in milk and dairy products In two articles, one from Norway in 2003 and in a m ore recent study from UK in 2012, organic milk was found to have lower concentrations of iodine than conventionally produced milk. In Dahl et al . (2003) results of iodine concentration in Norwegi an-produced milk and in a selection of dairy products was reported. Low-fat c onventional and organic milk were sampled from nineteen and seven different locations in Norway, respectively, during the summer and winter season of 2000. The median iodine concentration of organic summer milk (60 \u00b5g/l) was significantly lower than the iodine c oncentration of organic winter milk (127 \u00b5g/l) and lower than the corresponding conventional ly produced milk (88 \u00b5g/l and 232 \u00b5g/l respectively). The variance (35 - 365 \u00b5g/l in winte r milk) was greater in the organic produced milk compared to the conventionally produced milk ( 103 - 272 \u00b5g/l), which might indicate a more inconsequent use of iodine supplementation of organic fodder or that cows in organic farms have a longer out-of-doors season. There were no significant differences in iodine concentration with respect to geographical sampling location. With a recommended iodine intake of 150 \u00b5g/day for adults, a daily intake of 0.4 liters milk meets the requirement with 16% during the summer and 34% during the winter sea son with use of organic milk as compared to 25% and 60% with conventional milk. Bath, Button and Rayman (2012) aimed to compare the iodine concentration of retail organic and conventional milk and to evaluate regional infl uences in iodine levels in the UK. Samples of organic milk (n=92) and conventional milk (n=80) , purchased from retail outlets in sixteen areas of the UK (southern England, Wales and Northe rn Ireland), were analysed for iodine. It was shown that the iodine content was 42.1% lower i n organic milk than conventional milk (median iodine concentration 144.5 v. 249.5 \u00b5g/l; p <0.001). There was no difference in the iodine concentration with regard to area of purchas e, but a difference was seen in iodine concentration of organic milk by region of origin ( p<0.001). The Norwegian study points at the importance of mil k and milk products as sources of iodine. Based on information from TINE (personal informatio n from Kristi Br\u00f8nner 11.04.2014), the iodine concentration in organically produced milk h as increased to 200 \u00b5g/l, and the concentration is now similar to the iodine concentr ation found in conventionally produced milk. Differences in eggs Elevated concentrations of organic environmental po llutants as dioxins and PCBs have been observed in eggs from free range hens or eggs from foraging hens, relative to conventionally produced eggs (Schuler, Schmid and Schlatter 1997). The exposure of such compounds is thought to be increased in hens allowed access to t he outdoors because they have increased access to additional sources of these compounds as soil, worms, insects and non-commercial feeds, relative to those held in cages (De Vries, K wakkel and Kijlstra 2006). However, the main sources of PCBs and dioxins are oily and semi- oily fish and seafood, and increased Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 46 concentrations of PCB and dioxin in eggs are of no major importance to the total exposure of these contaminants (Kvalem et al . 2009). To summarise, there are some differences in concent rations of nutrients and other bioactive compounds in organically compared to conventionally produced foods. However, the relevance for human health remains to be explored. Pesticide exposure is lower with use of organic foo d compared to conventional food. The importance of lower pesticides exposure with organi c compared to conventionally produced food on human health in a Norwegian setting has to be investigated further. A possible lower concentration of mycotoxins with o rganic food production would be positive for human health and especially for child health. No negative or positive effect on human health can be drawn based on differences in contaminant concentrations based on cultivation sys tem. 7 Conclusions Studies to investigate the health impact of eating organically produced foods compared to conventionally produced foods are so far scarce and have several limitations as discussed in section 3.5. In the literature search VKM found tha t the clinical health outcomes studied have been investigated in too few studies to allow for f irm conclusions: o Immune-associated outcomes, three studies - indicat ions of a positive effect of organic food o Semen quality, four studies - no conclusion can be drawn o Hypospadias, only one study - no conclusion can be drawn o Risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, only one study - no conclusion can be drawn None of the included studies on human health report ed negative health effects from organic food consumption compared with conventionally produ ced food. However, the studies were not specifically designed to investigate safety. Animal models with feeding trials of food from diff erent production systems have been investigated. Results from these studies might indi cate a positive effect of organic feed on some outcomes; however, the extrapolation from anim al studies to humans remains a challenge: o Immune-associated outcomes, eight studies - no cons istent findings o Body composition, nine studies - no consistent find ings o General health, four studies - increased longevity and fertility in banana-flies on organic diet (one study), decreased daytime activit y in rats on organic diet (one study), two studies showed no differences - differe nt parameters investigated, and no conclusion can be drawn For the studies on biomarkers, there was a lack of a clear operational definition of health. The inability to distinguish between different levels o f health using valid biomarkers was among Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 47 the most striking short-comings. It was difficult t o relate any biomarker to good health or protection against disease: o Antioxidant capacity, eight studies - probably no d ifferences o Urinary pesticide concentrations, two studies in ch ildren - significantly lower concentration of urine pesticides after consuming o rganic diets compared to conventional diets o Fatty acid concentration in breastmilk, two studies - higher concentration of trans fatty acids with organic diet compared to conventio nal Based on national and relevant international resear ch it has not been possible to draw firm conclusions about possible positive health effects of organically compared to conventionally produced foods. Indications of health benefits from organic food on risk of atopic diseases in children were found. Animal model studies indicated positive impact on general health of organic diets. However, no consistent findings were found which enable a conclusion. An organic diet was found to give higher concentration s of trans fatty acids (different from industrially produced trans fatty acids, i.e. nic- and conjugated acid) of and lower urinary co ncentrations of pesticide metabolites in children. The relevance of these findings for human health in Norway is uncertain. There are some differences in concentrations of nutrients and other bioactive compounds in organic in comparison with conventional foods. However, differ ences are small and the relevance for health in humans on a well-balanced diet is uncerta in. The impact of organic diets on human health calls for more well designed and well powere d studies. None of the studies on human health reported negative health effects from organi c food consumption compared with conventional foods. These finding are in line with several previous rev iews which also conclude that no clear positive effects on human health have been presente d as a result of consuming an organic diet in comparison with a conventional diet. 8 Data gaps The work with this literature review has revealed a scarcity of relevant studies, and accordingly many data gaps. Research within the fie ld shows lack of consistent findings and inconclusive results. It is of importance to gain m ore knowledge both on eventual positive and negative health effects. Studies on human health An optimal study approach would be to conduct rando mised controlled studies where two groups of humans ate the same diet, but the foods w ere grown according to organic farming in one group and conventional farming in the other gro up. A limitation would be that such studies can only be done for a shorter time period, e.g. some weeks or a month. Therefore, prospective observation studies can be used to stud y long-term associations between organic food consumption and health. Questions about organi c food use should therefore be incorporated into food questionnaires in large coho rt studies. Birth cohort studies and other cohorts with numerous participants like e.g. the EP IC or HUNT studies, would be valuable studies for collection of health impact of organic food consumption. A number of health Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VK M) Doc.no 11-007-3 Final 48 parameters could be studied, such as growth (in stu dies with children), immunological and neurological development, and risk of diabetes, cor onary heart disease and cancer. Randomised controlled studies will be important to achieve knowledge about important biomarker for human health. Regarding mycotoxins, more work should be conducted on pregnant women and children since the foetus and small children are especially vulnerable to neurotoxicants because of their immature nervous systems, their rapid rate of brain growth and their low levels of the enzymes involved in the metabolism and detoxificati on of pesticides. Animal studies Animal experiments can be used to study doses and m echanisms of action. Some animal studies included in the present report indicate an effect of organic feed on immunity, longevity and fertility. This should be followed up with studies across several generations. Novel types of studies Organic farming will have an impact on soil microfl ora and accordingly, plant microflora. The diets impact on gut health is a rapidly expandi ng field of research.

Lancet, 353(916 3), 1485- 1488 Study design and type Cross-sectional study in children with epidemiologi cal and clinical parts. Objective To compare the prevalence of atopy in children from antroposophic families attending Steiner schools w ith children attending state schools. Number of participants, country and age 295 children from Steiner schools, 380 children fro m state schools, age 5-13 years. Baseline characteristics of study subjects/cells Significant differences in the subjects from each g roup (Steiner schools vs state schools): Breastfeed ing:> 76/6%. Exposure, substances, food (type and amount) Fermented vegetables (affecting intestinal microflo ra), other dietary factors not mentioned. Exposure; nature of the food (type and amount) An overall biodynamic/organic diet in children in S teiner schools (76%) vs 6% in state school children . Health outcome, a definition of the health outcome and how it was measured Atopy/ no atopy defined by history and/or clinical examination, skin prick test and blood test detecti ng sensitisation. Follow-up period, drop-outs One family in Steiner schools refused the clinical part of the study, 17 in state schools refused the clinical part of the study. These families are not included in the results. The clinical examinations took place between April and October 1997 by two physicians. Statistical analysis Odds ratio and 95% CI of atopy estimated by regress ion analyses. 95% CIs and p values (Wald test) base d on an estimator of variance that relaxed the assu mption of independence between observations within families. Results 13% of the Steiner school children had a history of atopy or symptoms consistent with atopy, 25% of th e children from state schools. Of all the children eating biodynamic/organic food 174 had no atopy while 54 h ad atopy. Conclusion There are many factors in the antroposophic lifesty le that may be preventive of atopy and organic vs c onventionally grown food may be one of them. Organi c food computed as one factor, atopy vs no atopy show a si gnificant result towards protection against atopy ( OR 0.63). Confounders adjusted for Other factors of anthroposophic lifestyle are not a djusted for. Relevance for our assessment purpose Some, especially in the discussion. Antroposophic l ifestyle contributes with more factors than organic food which may be important for the outcome.

Statistical analysis Logistic regression. Multivariate logistic regressi on fitted to control for confounders. Linear regres sion to evaluate differences in geometric means of total IgE. Separate analyses of conventional vs alternative sub-cohort revealed no differences, thus all infants were comb ined in the final models. Results Trend for association between organic food consumpt ion and reduced risk of eczema, but not statistical ly significant. There was an association between co nsuming strictly organic dairy products and reduced risk of eczema. The proportion of organic food within the total die t was neither associated with eczema, nor with recu rrent or prolonged wheeze, and no relation with atopic sensi tisation. Conclusion The consumption of organic dairy products within th e context of an organic diet in pregnant and lactat ing mothers is associated with reduced risk of ecze ma.

Farming characteristics in association w ith asthma and hay fever in univariate logistic regression mod el for CV and ORG farmers separately, and for all f armers together. Results Farmers reported significantly less often asthma or asthma-like symptoms than non-farmers. Almost all asthma symptoms were less prevalent in ORG farmers than CV farmers. Significant for waking up and wheezing wit h shortness of breath. Hay fever was reported more commonly among ORG farmers than CV farmers. The ass ociation ORG farming and hay fever decreased after adjusting for confounders in a multiplke logistic regression model. The same model confirmed that currently kee ping livestock and growing up on a farm were associated with a two times lower prevalence of hay fever. Conclusion Wheezing with shortness of breath was less prevalen t in ORG than in CV farmers, suggesting a lower ris k of asthma-like symptoms in organic farmers. The p revalence of hay fever is decreased in livestock farmers (ORG an d CV) who have lived on a farm during childhood com pared with crop farmers without a farm childhood.

All well described. Follow-up period, drop-outs 14 days. Statistical analysis Normality was checked and mean and SD was reported for normal distributed variables. Paired sample t-t est and Mann-Whitney test for difference. Results The majority of participants were regarded as seden tary during the whole study period (=no change in p hysical activity). No differences in the two groups were measured between after the IMD period as compared with at in clusion. After the IMOD period no differences in BM I were measured in the healthy subjects but lean bo dy mass increased significantly. After the IMOD the CKD pat ients reduced BMI and fat mass while lean body mass increased. Both for the healthy and the CKD patien ts, most of the biochemical variables improved with regard to C VD risk factors and for the renal patients the kidn ey variables also improved. There was a large reduc tion of the inflammatory markers in the healthy participants. T he antioxidant capacity was significantly higher in all of the organically grown vegetables as compare d with the conventional vegetables. Conclusion After 14 days with IMOD the risk of CVD was reduce and general health improved. Confounders adjusted for No, not necessary. Relevance for our assessment purpose Yes, the study is relevant.

Objective To test directly whether organically farmed food el icits beneficial health effects. Number of participants, country and age Life span analysis: 50x10 flies, stress resistance: 50x8, physical activity: 20 per vial. Fertility: 2 0 animals per vial. Starvation and Oxidative stress resistance: 50x8 flies. Quantitative PCR: 75 flies. Baseline characteristics of study subjects/cells Wild type strain Canton-S Drosophila . Exposure, substances, food (type and amount) Higher levels of essential nutrients in organic foo d (total protein, unsaturated fatty acids, increase in antioxidants. Exposure; nature of the food (type and amount) CV and ORG potatoes, raisins, bananas and soybean. Flies fed one or the other produce. Health outcome, a definition of the health outcome and how it was measured Longevity, fertility and oxidative stress resistanc e. Deaths were counted, eggs were counted. For oxid ative stress determination flies were cultured in m edium containing H2O2 and deaths determined twice daily. Furthermore mRNA-levels of three Drosophila insulin-like peptides were measured. Follow-up period, drop-outs Observation up to 60 days. Statistical analysis Log-rank tests for survival, two-way ANOVA for fert ility, t-tests for QPCR. Results ORG potatoes, raisins and soy led to significant ex tended longevity compared to CV food, while for ban anas the life span was equal. Flies fed extracts of any ORG produce had significantly more eggs per day. Flies raised on ORG potato or banana, but not raisins sur vived the oxidative stress treatment longer than th e CV produce diet. Flies raised on ORG raisin and banana food ha d higher overall activity than the CV same food. mR NA levels of three Dros Insulin-like peptides were slightly increased when fed ORG potato and banana, but the c hanges are so close to the detection limit and may be too small to be significant. Conclusion The data suggest that organic food provide improved health outcomes. The exact molecular mechanisms of the observed health effects are unclear. Altered i nsulin- signaling, altered redox balance or xenohormesis ma y all play a role.

Differences between the four crop management combin ations were tested using Tukey's honestly significa nt difference test. Results Growth rate similar for all feeds, and final body w eight not significantly affected by treatment. No e ffect on body fat. Organic fertilisation and crop p rotection resulted in higher concentrations of leptin, and IGF-1. Organic fertilisation with or without organic crop protect ion resulted in higher corticosteron and lower conc entration of testosterone. Lipopolysaccharid stimulated lymphocy te proliferation was low with no stimulation of cel ls from rats on organically fertilised crops. Feeds from organically fertilisation and organic crop protection resulted in an increase in spontaneous proliferation, while organic fertilisation and conventional crop protect ion led to a decrease in Con-A stimulated proliferation.
