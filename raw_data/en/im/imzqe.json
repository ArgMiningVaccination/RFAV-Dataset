Purpose The purpose of S. 702, a bill to provide for the reauthorization of the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act, is to improve the health status of Native Hawaiians through the continuation of a comprehensive health promotion and disease prevention effort that involves health education in Native Hawaiian communities, and the provision of health services using health care providers trained in western medicine and traditional Native Hawaiian healers. In areas where there is an underutilization of existing health care delivery systems that have the capacity to provide culturally- relevant health care services, S. 702 provides authority for the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to enter into contracts with Native Hawaiian health care systems to provide health care referral services to Native Hawaiian patients. S. 702 is intended to assure the continuity of the health care programs that are provided to Native Hawaiians under the authority of Public Law 100-579. As enacted in 1988, the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act is premised upon the findings and recommendations of the Native Hawaiian Health Research Consortium report to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services of December, 1985. That report clearly indicates that the underutilization of existing health care services by Native Hawaiians can be traced to the absence of culturally-relevant services in which traditional Native Hawaiian concepts of healing are lacking, as well as to a general perception in the Native Hawaiian community that health care services, which are fundamentally based on concepts of Western medicine, will not effect the healing or cure of diseases and illnesses afflicting Native Hawaiian people. Historical Background The islands that now compose the State of Hawai`i were governed by a monarchy of Native Hawaiians until 1893. The Native Hawaiian government was recognized as an independent sovereign nation by foreign governments, and treaty relationships were established with the United States (Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation of 1849; Treaty of Commercial Reciprocity, January 30, 1875.) Expanded trade with the United States resulted in increased western influence in the islands, and in 1893, the government of the Kingdom of Hawai`i was overthrown in an insurrection engineered by a group of western businessmen in an effort to secure the annexation of Hawai`i to the United States. The United States minister in Hawai`i ordered one company of marines and two companies of sailors to be landed, and the minister then recognized a new provisional government even before Queen Liliuokalani's lines of defense had surrendered. Although the provisional government sought immediate annexation by the United States, President Grover Cleveland refused to submit a treaty of annexation to the Senate, finding that the provisional government lacked the popular support of the Native Hawaiian population and that the government would not have been established but for the lawless and unauthorized military intervention of the United States (see Pub. L. No. 103-150). Upon the inauguration of William McKinley as the new President of the United States in 1897, however, the western businessmen that sought annexation were able to change the official U.S. position, and in 1898, Hawai`i became a territory of the United States. Prior to European contact, it was estimated that there were 400,000 Native Hawaiians in the Hawaiian Islands. By 1919, the Native Hawaiian population had been reduced to 22,600, and many were concluding that the native people of Hawai`i were a ``dying race,'' (see S. Rep. No. 108-85, at 13-14 (2004)) and that if they were to be saved from extinction, they must have the means of regaining their connection to the land, the `aina.' Accordingly, in 1920, the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act was enacted into law by the U.S. Congress, establishing a land base that could serve as a permanent homeland for Native Hawaiians and encouraging agricultural pursuits. The Act placed approximately 203,000 acres under the jurisdiction of the Hawaiian Homes Commission, a branch of the territorial government established for the purpose of ``rehabilitating'' persons of at least fifty percent Native Hawaiian ancestry through a return to pastoral life. The Act also authorized the Commission to undertake ``activities having to do with the economic and social welfare of the homesteaders.'' (See generally Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 42 Stat. 108 (July 9, 1921)) Hawai`i was admitted into the Union of States in 1959. Under the Hawaii Admission Act, the title to the lands set aside under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act was transferred from the United States to the State of Hawai`i. The Admissions Act requires the State to hold the lands ``as a public trust * * * for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians * * * and their use for any other object shall constitute a breach of trust for which suit may be brought by the United States'' (Hawaii Statehood Admissions Act, Pub. L. No. 86-3, Sec. 5(f), 73 Stat. 4 (Mar. 18, 1959)). Background Language contained in the 1984 Supplemental Appropriations Act, Public Law 98-396, directed the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a comprehensive study of the health care needs of Native Hawaiians. The study was conducted under the aegis of Region IX of the Department by a consortium of health care providers and professionals from the State of Hawai`i in a predominantly volunteer effort, organized by Alu Like, Inc., a Native Hawaiian organization. An island-wide conference was held in November of 1985 in Honolulu to provide an opportunity for members of the Native Hawaiian community to review the study's findings. Recommended changes were incorporated in the final report of the Native Hawaiian Health Research Consortium, and the study was formally submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services in December of 1985. The Department submitted the report to the Congress on July 21, 1986, and the report was referred to the Select Committee on Indian Affairs (S. Rep. No. 108-85 (2004)). Because the Consortium report's findings as to the health status of Native Hawaiians were compared only to other populations within the State of Hawai`i, the Select Committee requested that the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA), an independent agency of the Congress, undertake an analysis of Native Hawaiian health statistics as they compared to national data in other United States populations. Using the same population projection model that was employed in OTA's April 1986 report on Indian Health Care (U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, Indian Health Care, OTA-H-290 (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, April 1986)) to American Indian and Alaska Native populations, and based on additional information provided by the Department of Health and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs of the State of Hawai`i, the Office of Technology Assessment report contains the following findings: The Native Hawaiian population living in Hawai`i consists of two groups, Hawaiians and part-Hawaiians, who are distinctly different in both age distributions and mortality rates. Hawaiians comprise less than five percent of the total Native Hawaiian population and are much older than the young and growing part-Hawaiian populations. Overall, Native Hawaiians have a death rate that is thirty-four percent higher than the death rate for the United States all races, but this composite masks the great differences that exist between Hawaiians and part-Hawaiians. Hawaiians have a death rate that is 146 percent higher than the U.S. all races rate. Part- Hawaiians also have a higher death rate, but only 17 percent greater. A comparison of age-adjusted death rates for Hawaiians and part-Hawaiians reveals that Hawaiians die at a rate 110 percent higher than part- Hawaiians, and this pattern persists for all except one of the 13 leading causes of death that are common to both groups. As in the case of the U.S. all races population, Hawaiian and part-Hawaiian males have higher death rates than their female counterparts. However, when Hawaiian and part-Hawaiian males and females are compared to their U.S. all races counterparts, females are found to have more excess deaths than males. Most of these excess deaths are accounted for by diseases of the heart and cancers, with lesser contributions from cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus. Diseases of the heart and cancers account for more than half of all deaths in the U.S. all races population, and this pattern is also found in both the Hawaiian and part-Hawaiian populations, whether grouped by both sexes or by male or female. However, Hawaiians and part-Hawaiians have significantly higher death rates than their U.S. all races counterparts, with the exception of part-Hawaiian males, for whom the death rate from all causes is approximately equal to that of U.S. all races males. One disease that is particularly pervasive is diabetes mellitus, for which even part-Hawaiian males have a death rate 128 percent higher than the rate for U.S. all races males. Overall, Native Hawaiians die from diabetes at a rate that is 222 percent higher than for the U.S. all races. When compared to their U.S. all races counterparts, deaths from diabetes mellitus range from 630 percent higher for Hawaiian females and 538 percent higher for Hawaiian males, to 127 percent higher for part-Hawaiian females and 128 percent higher for part-Hawaiian males. (Id.) These findings clearly establish that the health status of Native Hawaiians is significantly worse than that of other U.S. population groups, and that in a number of areas, the evidence is compelling that Native Hawaiians constitute a population group for whom the mortality rate associated with certain diseases exceed that for other U.S. populations in alarming proportions. Native Hawaiians premise the high mortality rates and the incidence of disease that far exceed that of other populations in the United States upon the breakdown of the Hawaiian culture and belief systems, including the banning of the use of traditional healing practices, that was brought about by western settlement, as well as the influx of western diseases to which the native people of the Hawaiian Islands lacked immunities. In 1998, an organization of Native Hawaiian health care providers, Papa Ola Lokahi, updated the health care statistics from the original E Ola Mau report. Additionally Papa Ola Lokahi extrapolates the data that the Hawai`i State Department of Health annually gathers on Native Hawaiians from the Department's behavioral risk assessment and health surveillance survey. The findings from those assessments revealed that-- With respect to cancer, Native Hawaiians have the highest cancer mortality rates in the State of Hawai`i (216.8 out of every 100,000 male residents and 191.6 out of every 100,000 female residents), rates that are 21 percent higher than that for the total State male population (179.0 out of every 100,000 residents) and 64 percent higher than that for the total State female population (117.0 per 100,000). Native Hawaiian males have the higher cancer mortality rates in the State of Hawai`i for cancers of the lung, colon, rectum, colorectum, and for all cancers combined, and the highest years of productive life lost from cancer in the State of Hawai`i. Native Hawaiian females have the highest cancer mortality rates in the State of Hawai`i for cancers of the lung, liver, pancreas, breast, corpus uteri, stomach, colon, rectum, and for all cancers combined. With respect to breast cancer, Native Hawaiians have the highest mortality rates in the State of Hawai`i, and nationally Native Hawaiians have the third highest mortality rates due to breast cancer. Native Hawaiians have the highest mortality rates from cancer of the cervix and lung cancer in the State of Hawai`i, and Native Hawaiian males have the third highest mortality rates due to prostate cancer in the State. For the year 2000, Native Hawaiians had the highest mortality rate due to diabetes mellitus in the State of Hawai`i, with full-blood Hawaiians having a mortality rate that is 518 percent higher than the rate for the statewide population of all other races. In 1990, Native Hawaiians represented 44 percent of all asthma cases in the State of Hawai`i for those 18 years of age and younger, and 35 percent of all asthma cases reported, and in 1999, the Native Hawaiian prevalence rate for asthma was 69 percent higher than the rate for the total statewide population. With respect to heart disease, the death rate for Native Hawaiians is 68 percent higher than for the entire State of Hawai`i, and Native Hawaiian males have the greatest years of productive life lost in the State of Hawai`i. The death rate for Native Hawaiians from hypertension is 84 percent higher than that for the entire State, and the death rate from stroke for Native Hawaiians is 20 percent higher than for the entire State. Native Hawaiians have the lowest life expectancy of all population groups in the State of Hawai`i. Between 1910 and 1980, the life expectancy of Native Hawaiians from birth has ranged from 5 to 10 years less than that of the overall State population average, and the most recent data for 1990 indicates that Native Hawaiian life expectancy at birth is approximately 5 years less than that of the total State population. With respect to prenatal care, as of 1998, Native Hawaiian women have the highest prevalence of having had no prenatal care during their first trimester of pregnancy, representing 44 percent of all such women statewide. Over 65 percent of the referrals to Healthy Start in fiscal year 1996 and 1997 were Native Hawaiian newborns, and in every region of the State of Hawai`i, many Native Hawaiian newborns begin life in a potentially hazardous circumstance. In 1996, 45 percent of the live births to Native Hawaiians mothers were infants born to single mothers. Statistics indicated that infants born to single mothers have a higher risk of low birth weight and infant mortality. Of all low birth weight babies born to single mothers in the State of Hawai`i, 44 percent were Native Hawaiians. In 2000, Native Hawaiians had the highest number of fetal deaths in Hawai`i. Twenty-one percent of all fetal deaths in the State were associated with expectant Native Hawaiian mothers and 37 percent of those Native Hawaiian mothers were under the age of 25 years. These and other health status statistics contained in the findings section of S. 702 clearly establish that the health care challenges that the Native Hawaiian health care systems were established to address require reauthorization of the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act. Native Hawaiian Health Care Master Plan and Native Hawaiian Health Care Systems The concepts embodied in S. 702 are the result of the Committee's work with Native Hawaiian health care professionals and others who are dedicated to improving the health status of Native Hawaiians. It is based on the beliefs of those with whom the Committee has consulted, that to insure that Native Hawaiians are able to achieve the healthful harmony of the self (body, mind, and spirit) or lokahi, with others and all of nature, and to assure that Native Hawaiians are able to function effectively as citizens and leaders in their own homeland, there must be a restoration of cultural traditions, an integration of traditional healing methods in the health care delivery system, and a collective effort to restore to the Native Hawaiian, a sense of self-esteem and self-worth, for his or her culture, as well as for the individual. E Ola Mau, a group of Native Hawaiian health care professionals, proposed that this effort begin with the development of a health care master plan, based on a bio- psycho-socio-cultural-political model that would be aimed at identifying significant events and factors related to specific health care needs and issues. E Ola Mau proposed that this master plan be implemented at every societal level (individual, household, community, county, and state) in the Hawaiian Islands. It is its goal to have this Native Hawaiian way of dealing with health, eventually become an institutional part of the State's health policy for both Native Hawaiian and other citizens of the State of Hawai`i. After much debate and careful consideration in the Native Hawaiian community and amongst those concerned with the health status of Native Hawaiians, a consensus was reached that Papa Ola Lokahi, the Native Hawaiian Health Board, should be the mechanism through which Native Hawaiian health care systems would be developed, coordinated, administered, monitored, and continually revised to meet the changing health care needs of the Native Hawaiian population. Papa Ola Lokahi is currently composed of five organizations: (1) The Office of Hawaiian Affairs, an agency of the State which was established pursuant to the authority of amendments made to the Constitution of the State of Hawai`i in 1978 to assure the well-being and to advance the interests of Native Hawaiians; (2) E Ola Mau, a nonprofit organization of Native Hawaiian professionals dedicated to insuring that Native Hawaiians achieve a healthful harmony of self (body, mind, and spirit) with others and all of nature, and become productive citizens and leaders in their homeland; (3) Alu Like, a Federally-funded Native Hawaiian agency that promotes vocational training and the founding of community-based organizations that promote health, education, and economic development for Native Hawaiians; (4) The University of Hawai`i; and the (5) The Office of Hawaiian Health within the State Department of Health. Papa Ola Lokahi has assumed the primary responsibility of overseeing the development and maintenance of a Native Hawaiian Comprehensive Health Care Master Plan. Papa Ola Lokahi also is the entity responsible for certifying to the Secretary of Health and Human Services the qualifications and capabilities of Native Hawaiian organizations that petition the Secretary to carry out, pursuant to contracts with the Secretary, the provisions of the Act. The Native Hawaiian Health Care Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-579, 102 Stat. 2916, authorized Papa Ola Lokahi, the Native Hawaiian Health Board, to-- Designate a chairman and vice-chairman from among its member organizations and such other officers as may be deemed necessary to carry out its responsibilities under the Act; Adopt bylaws and such other internal regulations or procedures as may be deemed necessary to carry out its responsibilities under the Act; Certify to the Secretary that a Native Hawaiian organization meets the definition of ``Native Hawaiian organization'' as set forth in the Act; Certify to the Secretary that a Native Hawaiian organization has the qualifications and capacity to provide the services or perform contract requirements pursuant to a contract with the Secretary; Oversee the development of a comprehensive Native Hawaiian health care master plan; Assure the conduct of health status and health care needs assessments of Native Hawaiian communities desiring to participate in Native Hawaiian health care programs; and Coordinate the activities and functions of all Native Hawaiian organizations operating health care programs pursuant to contracts with the Secretary. The Native Hawaiian Health Care Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-579, 102 Stat. 2916 (Oct. 31, 1988) envisions a comprehensive health care system that is community-based, building upon the Native Hawaiian `ohana system\\1\\ and incorporating traditional healing (la `au lapa `au) practices with western medical services to provide a health care system that will be culturally sensitive and responsive to the needs of Native Hawaiian communities. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ The `ohana system is based upon the fundamental unit of societal interaction for Native Hawaiians in which a family or an organization is led by a haku (the recognized leader), whose function is to coordinate and facilitate the expertise and resources of the various households or affiliated organizations in order to accomplish a task or resolve a problem. The households or affiliated organizations are in turn led by a po`o (the head of the household or designated leader of the organization). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As originally enacted, Public Law 100-579 authorized the establishment of Native Hawaiian Healing Centers on each of the islands comprising the State of Hawai`i, upon the acceptance of and in consultation with the Native Hawaiian communities on those islands, and wherever possible, using existing health care facilities and health care providers now serving the Native Hawaiian communities on those islands. These centers were intended to lead and coordinate the development and implementation of a statewide Native Hawaiian health care system which would include: (1) a research and monitoring staff, state-certified neighborhood counselors, outreach workers and health educators, traditional Native Hawaiian healers, and Native Hawaiian cultural educators; (2) primary health care providers; (3) primary health care facilities, using existing health care facilities where practicable and acceptable to the local Native Hawaiian community; (4) participation by the State Department of Health, Office of Hawaiian Health in the provision of disease prevention and health promotion programs, as well as a multidisciplinary approach to Native Hawaiian health care which would include nursing, dental hygiene, nutrition education, maternal and infant child care education; and (5) other Federal, State, county, community, and private organizations and agencies that could provide services which meet the health care needs of their respective communities. The development of the master plan by Papa Ola Lokahi was intended to include: (1) Work with Native Hawaiian communities which support the establishment of a Native Hawaiian Health Center; (2) Conducting a community health needs assessment survey for participating communities; (3) Facilitating the development, establishment, and effective functioning of such Centers on the islands of O`ahu, Moloka`i, Maui, Hawai`i, Lana`i, Kaua`i and Ni`ihau; and (4) Coordinating the work of relevant agencies and organizations to provide participating communities with: (a) Direct health care services and health education, including maternal and child health care and mental health care; (b) Instruction in the Native Hawaiian language, cultural beliefs, and traditions with an emphasis on health concepts and practices; (c) Training and education of health care providers and educators and cultural educators in health promotion and disease prevention; (d) Basic and applied research and monitoring of Native Hawaiian health care approaches to validate outcomes and create standards of quality care; (e) Development of health care services, training and education that would have a Native Hawaiian perspective as its primary focus; (f) Development of Native Hawaiian community health counselors, outreach workers, educators, and community health aide training programs; (g) Prevention-oriented health care services in medical, dental, nutrition, mental health, and in other designated areas as needs assessments may identify as necessary; (h) Data collection related to prevention of diseases and illnesses among Native Hawaiians; (i) Medical and general health-related research into the diseases that are most prevalent among Native Hawaiians; (j) Mental health research in areas of mental health problems that are most prevalent in the Native Hawaiian population; (k) Ongoing health planning for further development of the Native Hawaiian health care system; and (l) The provision of health care referral services when certain health care services are not available within the Native Hawaiian Health Center. Following enactment of the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act, the Papa Ola Lokahi Board incorporated and began working with health care providers on each island on the development of a master plan and an island-specific plan for the provision of primary health care and health care referral services. Those involved in the planning effort ultimately determined that the health care needs of Native Hawaiians would be better served by the establishment of five Native Hawaiian health care systems which could be composed of as many health care centers as might be necessary to serve the health care needs of Native Hawaiians on each island. Accordingly, Papa Ola Lokahi certified to the Secretary that five health care systems qualified as Native Hawaiian organizations for purposes of entering into contracts with the Secretary, and plans for the provision of primary health care services or health care referral services were submitted to the Secretary in 1990. The first contract awards were 13 made in October of 1991, and since that time, the health care systems have been engaged not only in the implementation of the plans approved by the Secretary, but the provision of health care services. The plans for each health care system vary according to the availability of and access to existing health care resources on each island and the need for health care services. Currently, all five Native Hawaiian health care systems have become incorporated as 501(c)(3) non-profit health care organizations. In general, the capacity to provide critical health care services exists only on the island of O`ahu, and thus, it has long been the pattern that if a patient requires hospitalization and complex surgery or treatment, the patient would be referred to a health care provider on the island of O`ahu and would have to incur the costs associated with air travel to O`ahu. However, it is not uncommon that treatment requiring advanced medical technology must be secured in the continental United States. The Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act provides authority for the provision of health promotion, disease prevention, and primary health care services to Native Hawaiians who reside in the State of Hawai`i. Federal planning funds first became available in July of 1990. However, Papa Ola Lokahi incorporated in February 1989 and was able to initiate its organizing activities in July 1989 with funds provided by the Hawai`i State legislature. Between July 1989 and December 1990, informational meetings and organizational activities took place throughout the State, resulting in the establishment or recognition of the five Native Hawaiian health care systems which would assume the responsibility for providing services: (1) Ho`ola Lahui Hawai`i for Kaua`i and O`ahu; (3) Na Pu`uwai for Moloka`i and Lana`i; (4) Hui No Ke Ola Pono for Maui; and (5) Hui Malama Ola Na `Oiwi for Hawai`i. Papa Ola Lokahi provided planning funds and technical assistance to these five health care systems, which then developed their service plans from January through June 1991, applied for funding under the Native Hawaiian Health Care Act in July 1991, and were awarded service grants in October of 1991. The basic set of services that all five health care systems must provide include: (1) outreach services to inform Native Hawaiians of the availability of health services; (2) education in health promotion and disease prevention of the Native Hawaiian population by Native Hawaiian health care practitioners, community outreach workers, counselors, and cultural educators, whenever possible; (3) services of physicians, physicians assistants, nurse practitioners or, other health professionals; (4) immunizations; (5) prevention and control of diabetes, high blood pressure, and otitis media; (6) pregnancy and infant care; and (7) improvement of nutrition. In the initial stages, because the five health care systems needed to gain experience in managing health services and because of limited funds, each health care system concentrated on outreach, health assessments, case management, and disease prevention and health promotion activities, with the ultimate objective of providing the full range of health and medical services that are available through a typical primary health care center, and working with traditional healers so that their services would also be more readily available to Native Hawaiians. Now that the five island-wide Native Hawaiian health care systems are established and engaged in the provision of health care services, Papa Ola Lokahi's role is to provide technical support and training to the five health care systems, work with each of the systems to develop a statewide, cooperative Native Hawaiian health system, develop research activities and capacities within the five health care systems, and evaluate how well the objectives of the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act are being met. The goals and objectives, as well as the services provided by each of the five Native Hawaiian health care systems is contained in Appendix A of the committee report. Through the work of the five Native Hawaiian health care systems, on an annual basis, 20,000 Native Hawaiians continue to benefit from the range of health care services provided by the systems. Native Hawaiian Health Care Professions Scholarships The Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act also provides authority for the provision of scholarships to Native Hawaiians who are seeking higher education opportunities in the health care professions. The Native Hawaiian Health Scholarship Program has been administered by the Kamehameha Schools, but S. 702 will transfer administration of these scholarships to Papa Ola Lokahi. Scholarships awarded thus far have resulted in: bachelors of science degrees in nursing, clinical psychology doctoral degrees, dentists, dental hygienists, osteopathic physicians, allopathic physicians, masters degrees in public health, masters degrees in social work, nurse midwives, nurse practitioners, doctors of psychology, and registered nurses. Many of the scholarship recipients have completed their studies and their service payback requirements and are practicing in the Native Hawaiian community. Reauthorization Process In order to assure the maximum involvement of Native Hawaiians in the development of a bill to reauthorize the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act (the Act), from December of 1997 through January of 1998, eight island `aha (island-wide conferences) were held involving more than 1,200 individuals in an effort to identify the principle Native Hawaiian health and wellness issues and concerns. In March 1998, a statewide Native Hawaiian Health and Wellness Summit, Ka `Uhane Lokahi, was held on the island of O`ahu, bringing together more than 600 people to identify potential health and wellness issues and concerns. In January 1999, a Native Hawaiian Health Forum was convened to discuss major health care trends and strategies for health care and wellness developed by the indigenous peoples of North America and Aotearoa (New Zealand). In March 1999, the Executive Directors of the Native Hawaiian health care systems, the members of the Papa Ola Lokahi Board, and the Director of the Native Hawaiian Health Scholarship Program met to review the Act and to incorporate recommendations from the `aha, the summit, and the health forum for inclusion in a bill to reauthorize the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act. Thereafter, a series of public meetings were held to discuss and review a draft reauthorization bill and based upon the comments received, the bill was further refined and then circulated in the Native Hawaiian community. A final draft of the bill, incorporating and responding to recommendations received from the Native Hawaiian community, was submitted to the Congress. Summary of Major Provisions S. 702 extends the existing program authorities of the Act and authorizes appropriations in such sums as may be necessary through fiscal year 2009. The bill contains extensive findings on the current health status of Native Hawaiians including the incidence and mortality rates associated with various forms of cancer, diabetes, asthma, circulatory diseases, infectious disease and illness, and injuries, as well as statistics on life expectancy, maternal and child health, births, teen pregnancies, fetal mortality, mental health, and health professions education and training. The bill further refines the role of Papa Ola Lokahi and the Native Hawaiian health care systems, providing authority for the establishment of additional health care systems to serve the islands of Lana`i and Ni`ihau. The Board of Papa Ola Lokahi has been expanded to include the five Native Hawaiian health care systems, the Native Hawaiian Health Task Force, the Hawai`i State Primary Care Association (which represents the community health centers), the Native Hawaiian Physicians Association, and such other organizations as the Papa Ola Lokahi Board will admit based upon a satisfactory demonstration of a record of contribution to the health and well-being of Native Hawaiians. The 1992 amendments to the Act adopted the relevant health objectives of the U.S. Surgeon General's Healthy People 2000 objectives as goals to be met by the Native Hawaiian health care systems. S. 702 establishes new objectives that the Native Hawaiian health care systems must meet based on the objectives in the U.S. Surgeon General's Healthy People 2010. S. 702 proposes that the providers of health care services, including traditional Native Hawaiian healers, who provide services under the aegis of the Native Hawaiian health care systems be treated as members of the Public Health Service for purposes of Federal Tort Claims Act coverage (28 U.S.C. 1346(b) and 2671-2680). The bill also provides authorization for Papa Ola Lokahi to carry out Native Hawaiian demonstration projects of national significance in areas such as the education of health professionals, the integration of western medicine with complementary health practices including traditional Native Hawaiian healing practices, the use of tele-wellness and telecommunications in chronic disease management and health promotion and disease prevention, the development of an appropriate model of health care for Native Hawaiians and other indigenous people, the development of a centralized data base and information system relating to the health care status, health care needs, and wellness of Native Hawaiians, and the establishment of a Native Hawaiian Center of Excellence for Nursing at the University of Hawai`i at Hilo, a Native Hawaiian Center of Excellence for Mental Health at the University of Hawai`i at Manoa, a Native Hawaiian Center of Excellence for Maternal Health and Nutrition at the Waimanalo Health Center, a Native Hawaiian Center of Excellence for Research, Training, and Integrated Medicine at Moloka`i General Hospital, and a Native Hawaiian Center of Excellence for Complementary Health and Health Education and Training at the Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center. The Provision of Federal Programs to Native Hawaiians In the exercise of the plenary power vested in the Congress in Article I, section 8, clause 3 of the United States Constitution, the Congress has exercised its authority to address the conditions of the aboriginal, indigenous, native people of the United States, including the aboriginal, indigenous, native people of the states of Alaska and Hawai`i. More than one hundred and sixty Federal laws have been enacted to address the conditions of Native Hawaiians (see for example, S. Rep. No. 108-85). The authority of the Congress to enact legislation to address the conditions of Native Hawaiians is set forth more fully in Appendix B to the committee report. FEDERAL DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TO THE STATE OF HAWAII For the past two hundred and ten years, the United States Congress, the Executive Branch, and the U.S. Supreme Court have recognized certain legal rights and protections for America's indigenous peoples. Since the founding of the United States, Congress has exercised a constitutional authority over indigenous affairs and has undertaken an enhanced duty of care for America's indigenous peoples. This has been done in recognition of the sovereignty possessed by the native people-- a sovereignty which pre-existed the formation of the United States. The Congress' exercise of its constitutional authority is also premised upon the status of the indigenous people as the original inhabitants of this nation who occupied and exercised dominion and control over the lands over which the United States subsequently acquired jurisdiction. The United States has long recognized the existence of a special political relationship with the indigenous people of the United States. As Native Americans--American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians--the United States has recognized that they are entitled to special rights and considerations, and the Congress has enacted laws to give expression to the respective legal rights and responsibilities of the Federal government and the native people (see for example, S. Rep. No. 108-85). From time to time, with the consent of the affected States, the Congress has sought to more effectively address the conditions of the indigenous people by delegating Federal responsibilities to various states. In 1959, the State of Hawai`i assumed the Federally-delegated responsibility of administering 203,500 acres of land that had been set aside by Congress in 1921 for the benefit of the native people of Hawai`i under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act.\\2\\ In addition, the State agreed to the imposition of a public trust upon all of the lands ceded to the State upon admission.\\3\\ One of the five purposes for which the public trust was established is the ``betterment of the conditions of native Hawaiians[.]'' \\4\\ The Federal authorization for this public trust clearly anticipated that the State's constitution and laws would provide for the manner in which the terms of trust would be carried out.\\5\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ Id., Sec. 4; Haw. Const., Art. XVI, Sec. 7. \\3\\ Id., Sec. 5(f); Haw. Const. Art. XII, Sec. 4. \\4\\ Id., Sec. 5(f); Haw. Const. Art. XII, Sec. 4. \\5\\ Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In 1978, the citizens of the State of Hawai`i exercised the Federally-delegated authority by amending the State constitution in furtherance of the special relationship with Native Hawaiians. The delegates to the 1978 constitutional convention recognized that Native Hawaiians had no other homeland, and thus that the protection of Native Hawaiian subsistence rights to harvest the ocean's resources, to fish the freshwater streams, and to hunt and gather, as well as the protection of Native Hawaiians' rights to exercise their rights to self-determination and self-governance, and to preserve their culture and language, could only be accomplished within their native homeland, the present State of Hawai`i. Hawai'i's adoption of amendments to the State constitution to fulfill the special relationship with Native Hawaiians is consistent with the practice of other states that have established special relationships with the native inhabitants of their areas. Fourteen states have extended recognition to Indian tribes that are not recognized by the Federal government, and thirty-two states have established commissions and offices to address matters of policy affecting the indigenous citizenry.

S.702--Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Reauthorization Act of 2003 Summary: S. 702 would reauthorize the Native Hawaiian Health Care Program, funded from within the Health Resources and Services Administration's Consolidated Health Center Program, through 2009. The bill would authorize the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 2004 through 2009. Assuming the appropriation of the necessary amounts, CBO estimates that implementing S. 702 would cost about $5 million in 2004 and $53 million over the 2004-2009 period. (That estimate assumes that annual appropriations are adjusted for inflation. Without such adjustments, the six-year total would be $50 million.) The bill would extend provisions under section 224 of the Public Health Service Act to providers in Hawaiian health systems. That section authorizes settlements and awards for tort claims to be paid out of the Treasury's Judgment Fund. Those payments are considered direct spending, regardless of whether the health program involved is an entitlement program or subject to appropriation. CBO estimates those payments would total less than $500,000 in 2004 and less than $500,000 over the 2004-2009 period. S. 702 contains no private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). The bill would require the state of Hawaii to consult with Naive Hawaiians, Papa Ola Lokahi (an umbrella organization composed of groups involved in Native Hawaiian health), and health care organizations that provide services to Native Hawaiians before making policy changes or implementing new programs. That requirement would be an intergovernmental mandate as defined in UMRA, but CBO estimates that the costs of the mandate would be minimal and would not exceed the threshold established in that act ($59 million in 2003, adjusted annually for inflation). Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated budgetary impact of S. 702 is shown in the following table. The costs of this legislation would fall within budget functions 550 (health) and 800 (general government). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- By fiscal year, in millions of dollars-- ------------------------------------------------------- 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION \\1\\ With Adjustments for Inflation Native Hawaiian Health Center Program Spending Under Current Law: Budget Authority \\2\\................................ 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 Estimated Outlays................................... 7 4 * 0 0 0 0 Proposed Changes: Estimated Authorization Level \\3\\................... 0 9 9 10 10 10 10 Estimated Outlays................................... 0 5 9 9 10 10 10 Native Hawaiian Health Center Program Spending Under S. 702: Estimated Authorization Level....................... 9 9 9 10 10 10 10 Estimated Outlays................................... 7 9 9 9 10 10 10 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ This bill also would increase direct spending, but by less than $500,000 a year. \\2\\ The 2003 level is the amount appropriated for that year for the Native Hawaiian Health Care Program. \\3\\ The proposed changes include annual adjustments for inflation for the bill's authorizations of ``such sums as necessary.'' Without such inflation adjustments, the six-year totals of costs would be about $3 million lower. Note.--* = less than $500,000. Basis of estimate: For the purposes of this estimate, CBO assumes that the bill will be enacted by the end of fiscal year 2003 and that the necessary appropriations will be provided for each fiscal year. Spending subject to appropriation Native Hawaiian Health Care Program. S. 702 would authorize the appropriation of such sums as necessary for 2004 through 2009 for the extension of activities carried out under the Native Hawaiian Health Care Program. These activities include the provision of health care at Native Hawaiian health centers and health systems; granting scholarships to students dedicated to providing health care to Native Hawaiians; administration of the program; and the development of strategies to improve the health status of Native Hawaiians. The bill would authorize increasing from five to eight the number of health systems receiving grants, and would authorize the establishment of a fellowship program for health care workers. CBO estimates that these activities could be carried out with 2003 appropriation levels adjusted for inflation, plus additional funding for the increase in the number of health systems receiving grants. Those systems would be added to the program gradually over the next few years, according to information provided by Papa Ola Lokahi. Assuming the appropriation of $9 million in 2004, and adjustments for inflation in 2005 through 2009, CBO estimates the cost of these provisions would be $5 million in 2004 and $53 million over the 2004-2009 period. Direct spending Under current law, settlements and tort claims arising from the actions of licensed heath care providers in federally funded health centers are paid from the Treasury's Judgment Fund. The bill would expand that coverage to include tort claims arising from the actions of licensed providers within the Native Hawaiian health systems, as well as non-licensed providers and traditional Hawaiian health providers. Based on past experience with spending from the Judgment Fund for providers covered under section 224, as well as information on the number and license status of newly covered providers, CBO estimates the cost of this provision to be less than $500,000 in each year and less than $500,000 over the 2004-2009 period. Impact on state, local, and tribal governments: The bill would require the state of Hawaii to consult with Native Hawaiians, Papa Ola Lokahi, and health care organizations that provide services to Native Hawaiians before making policy changes or implementing new programs. That requirement would be an intergovernmental mandate as defined in UMRA, but CBO estimates that the costs of the mandate would be minimal and would not exceed the threshold established in that act ($59 million in 2003, adjusted annually for inflation). Impact on the private sector: S. 702 contains no private- sector mandates as defined in UMRA. Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Alexis Ahlstrom; Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: David Conway; and Impact on the Private Sector: Julie Lee. Estimate approved by: Peter H. Fontaine, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis. Executive Communications The Committee received no communications from the Executive branch of government on S. 702. Regulatory and Paperwork Impact Paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate requires each report accompanying a bill to evaluate the regulatory and paperwork impact that would be incurred in carrying out the bill. The Committee believes that S. 702 will have a minimal impact on regulatory or paperwork requirements.

Stevens, the United States Minister assigned to the sovereign and independent Kingdom of Hawai`i, [John L. Stevens,] conspired with a small group of non-Hawaiian residents of the Kingdom, including citizens of the United States, to overthrow the indigenous and lawful [Government] government of Hawai`i[.]; [(8) In] (13) in pursuance of that conspiracy[,]-- (A) the United States Minister and the naval representative of the United States caused armed [naval] forces of the United States Navy to invade the sovereign Hawaiian Nation in support of the overthrow of the indigenous and lawful Government of Hawai`i; and (B) after that overthrow, the United States Minister [thereupon] extended diplomatic recognition of a provisional government formed by the conspirators without the consent of the native people of Hawai`i or the lawful Government of Hawai`i, in violation of-- (i) treaties between the [two nations and of international law.] Government of Hawai`i and the United States; and (ii) international law, [(9) In] (14) in a message to Congress on December 18,1893, [then] President Grover Cleveland-- (A) reported fully and accurately on [these] those illegal actions[,]; (B) [and] acknowledged that by [these] those acts, described by the President as acts of war, the government of a peaceful and friendly people was overthrown[,]; and (C) [the President] concluded that a [``]`substantial wrong has thus been done which a due regard for our national character as well as the rights of the injured people required that we should endeavor to repair[''.]'; [(10)] (15) Queen Lili`uokalani, the lawful monarch of Hawai`i, and the Hawaiian Patriotic League, representing the aboriginal citizens of Hawai`i, promptly petitioned the United States for redress of [these] those wrongs and [for] restoration of the indigenous government of the Hawaiian nation, but [this petition was not acted upon.] no action was taken on that petition; (16) in 1993, Congress enacted Public Law 103-150 (107 Stat.1510), in which Congress-- (A) acknowledged the significance of those events; and (B) apologized to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the people of the United States for the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai`i with the participation of agents and citizens of the United States, and the resulting deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians to self- determination; [(11) In] (17) Hawai`i through [the Newlands] Resolution No. 55 (commonly known as the `Newlands Resolution') (30 Stat. 750), without the consent of, or compensation to, the indigenous people of Hawai`i or [their] the sovereign government [who were thereby] of those people; and (B) denied those people the mechanism for expression of their inherent sovereignty through self-government and self- determination[,] of their lands and ocean resources[.]; [(12) Through] (18) through the Newlands Resolution and the [1900 Organic Act, the United States] Act of April 30, 1900 (commonly known as the `1900 Organic Act') (31 Stat. 141, chapter 339), Congress-- (A) received [1.75 million] 1,750,000 acres of [lands] land formerly owned by the Crown and Government of the Hawaiian Kingdom; and (B) exempted the [lands] land from then- existing public land laws of the United States by mandating that the revenue and proceeds from [these lands] that land be [``]`used solely for the benefit of the inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands for education and other public purposes['']', thereby establishing a special trust relationship between the United States and the inhabitants of Hawai`i[.]; [(13) In] (19) in 1921, Congress enacted the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108, chapter 42), which-- (A) designated 200,000 acres of the ceded public [lands] land for exclusive homesteading by Native Hawaiians[,]; and (B) [thereby affirming] affirmed the trust relationship between the United States and [the] Native Hawaiians, as expressed by [then] Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane, who was cited in the Committee Report of the [United States] Committee on Territories of the House of Representatives [Committee on Territories] as stating, [``]`One thing that impressed me . . . was the fact that the natives of the islands [who are our wards, I should say, and] . . . for whom in a sense we are trustees, are falling off rapidly in numbers and many of them are in poverty.['']'; [(14) In] (20) in 1938, [the United States] Congress again acknowledged the unique status of the Native Hawaiian people by including in the Act of June 20, 1938 (52 Stat. 781[ et seq.]), a provision-- (A) to lease [lands] land within the extension to Native Hawaiians;

73 Stat.4), the United States-- (A) transferred responsibility for the administration of the Hawaiian [Home Lands] home lands to the State [of Hawai`i]; but (B) reaffirmed the trust relationship [which] that existed between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people by retaining the exclusive power to enforce the trust, including the power to approve land exchanges[,] and legislative amendments affecting the rights of beneficiaries under [such] that Act[.]; [(16) Under] (22) under the Act [entitled ``An Act to provide for the admission of the State of Hawai`i into the Union'', approved March 18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4)] referred to in paragraph (21), the United States-- (A) transferred responsibility for administration over portions of the ceded public lands trust not retained by the United States to the State [of Hawai`i];

(iii) to act as the lead State agency for matters affecting the Native Hawaiian people; and (iv) to formulate policy on affairs relating to the Native Hawaiian people; [(17) The] (24) the authority of the Congress under the [United States] Constitution to legislate in matters affecting the aboriginal or indigenous [peoples] people of the United States includes the authority to legislate in matters affecting the native [peoples] people of Alaska and Hawai`i[.]; (25) the United States has recognized the authority of the Native Hawaiian people to continue to work toward an appropriate form of sovereignty, as defined by the Native Hawaiian people in provisions set forth in legislation returning the Hawaiian Island of Kaho `olawe to custodial management by the State in 1994; [(18) In] (26) in furtherance of the trust responsibility for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians, the United States has established a program for the provision of comprehensive health promotion and disease prevention services to maintain and improve the health status of the Hawaiian people[.]; (27) that program is conducted by the Native Hawaiian Health Care Systems, and Papa Ola Lokahi; (28) health initiatives implemented by those and other health institutions and agencies using Federal assistance have been responsible for reducing the century-old morbidity and mortality rates of Native Hawaiian people by-- (A) providing comprehensive disease prevention; (B) health promotion activities; and (C) increasing the number of Native Hawaiians in the health and allied health professions; (29) those accomplishments have been achieved through implementation of-- (A) the Native Hawaiian Health Care Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-579); and (B) the reauthorization of that Act under section 9168 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act,1993 (Public Law 102-396; 106 Stat. 1948); [(19) This] (30) the historical and unique legal relationship between the United States and Native Hawaiians has been consistently recognized and affirmed by [the] Congress through the enactment of more than 160 Federal laws [which] that extend to the Native Hawaiian people the same rights and privileges accorded to American Indian, Alaska Native, Eskimo, and Aleut communities, including-- (A) the Native American Programs Act of 1974 [[42 U.S.C.A. 2991 et seq.]] (42 U.S.C. 2991 et Freedom Act [[42 U.S.C.A. 1996]] (42 U.S.C. 1996);

(D) Circulatory diseases.-- (i) Heart disease.--With respect to heart disease-- (I) the mortality rate for Native Hawaiians as a result of heart disease (372.3 out of every 100,000 residents) is 68 percent higher than the rate for the entire State (221.9 out of every 100,000 residents); and (II) Native Hawaiian males have the greatest years of productive life lost in the State, because Native Hawaiian males lose an average of 15.5 years and Native Hawaiian females lose an average of 8.2 years as a result of heart disease, as compared with 7.5 years for all males, and 6.4 years for all females, in the State. (ii) Hypertension.---With respect to hypertension-- (I) the mortality rate for Native Hawaiians as a result of hypertension (3.5 out of every 100,000 residents) is 84 percent higher than that for the entire State (1.9 out of every 100,000 residents); (II) Native Hawaiians have substantially higher prevalence rates of hypertension than-- (aa) those observed statewide; and and (bb) those of any other ethnic group in Hawai`i; and (III) the prevalence rate of hypertension for Native Hawaiians is 37.9 percent, 11 percent higher than that for all others in the State (34.1 percent).

Ho`ola Lahui Hawai`i's plans include establishing a health education component in kindergarten, elementary, and high schools, tailored to the physical and psychological needs of the particular age group. Island of O`ahu Ke Ola Mamo is committed to improving the health status of Native Hawai`ians on the island of O`ahu through the development of a system of culturally-competent services that build upon rather than duplicate the existing health care service delivery system. Through outreach referral and case consultation, Ke Ola Mamo's goal is the empowerment of Native Hawaiian families and individuals to access appropriate health care services; the development of partnerships with existing health care services in a collaborative effort to improve access to health care; and working with Native Hawaiian communities and neighborhoods to assist them in meeting their health care needs. In 1986, there were 137,481 Native Hawaiians living on the island of O`ahu, who comprise approximately two-thirds of the total Native Hawaiian population in the entire State of Hawai`i. The Native Hawaiian population living on O`ahu can be roughly divided into three equal groups by geographic location; those living on the leeward coast, including Pearl City; those living on the windward and north coasts; and those living in the urban Honolulu complex. There are estimated to be at least 20 distinct communities and neighborhoods where Native Hawaiian families reside. At the outset of its work, Ke Ola Mamo selected four of these communities to develop service delivery projects. Three projects involve rural communities: the Waimanalo community, the Wai`anae community, and the Ko`olauloa community. A fourth project is being proposed as a community education and planning process for the urban Honolulu communities with future service implementation proposals. Island of Moloka`i The goal of Na Pu`uwai is to raise the health status of the Native Hawaiian residents of the island of Moloka`i, including Kalaupapa, and the island of Lana`i to the highest possible level and to encourage the maximum participation of Native Hawaiians to achieve this goal. The strategy of the program is two-fold: (1) to develop a personalized schedule of recommended health care activities, referred to as a ``personalized health care plan'' for each client; and (2) to use case management methodologies as a behavioral intervention to assure client adherence to their ``personalized health care plan.'' To implement this strategy, the program: (1) conducts screening and enrollment for those who are self-referred, provider-referred, or recruited by staff; (2) conducts a health risk appraisal on each enrollee to assess current health maintenance status; (3) develops a personalized health care plan with each client, based on recommended primary, secondary, and tertiary health maintenance guidelines and the client's concerns and needs; (4) coordinates and provides health promotion and disease prevention programs and health screening; (5) provides clinic-based primary health care services; (6) provides multi-disciplinary case management services as appropriate, to enrolled participants; and (7) reassesses client status as dictated in the case management plan and conducts ongoing followup on all clients, case management and non-case management. Na' Pu`uwai's service delivery plan provides for (1) direct outpatient care services of a physician and nurse; (2) case management services of a social worker and multi-disciplinary case management team; (3) direct health education and health screening services; and (4) patient followup and outreach services. Island of Maui Hui No Ke Ola Pono, an association to strengthen and perpetuate life, is Maui's Native Hawaiian Health Care System, providing services that are culturally relevant to Native Hawaiians of Maui, including identification, treatment, control, and reduction of the incidence of preventable illnesses and conditions frequently occurring in the Native Hawaiian population. The services provided by Hui No Ke Ola Pono include health promotion and disease prevention; referrals for immunizations; improvement of nutrition; referrals for pregnancy and infant care; prevention and control of diabetes, high blood pressure, and middle ear infections; community outreach services; referrals to physician and nursing services; and education on traditional practitioner services. In addition, traditional Hawaiian healers provide the following services: ho`oponopono (family or group counseling); la`au lapa`au (traditional Hawaiian herbal medicine); and lomi lomi (Hawaiian massage therapy). Island of Hawai`i Hui Malama Ola Na `Oiwi (caring for our people) is the Native Hawaiian health care system for Native Hawaiians on the Island of Hawai`i. The program mission of Hui Malama Ola Na `Oiwi is to assist Native Hawaiians in restoring a high quality health care system by creating and developing a non-threatening healing environment inclusive of traditional health assistance and to provide and facilitate a process of awareness and addressing the health needs, both physical and spiritual, of Native Hawaiians. Hui Malama's objectives are to (1) promote physical, emotional, and spiritual health and well-being of Native Hawaiians on the island of Hawai`i; (2) assist and promote personal responsibility among Native Hawaiians toward making sound, informed decisions which would decrease unhealthy behaviors and reduce morbidity and mortality rates; (3) support and advocate the use of health care services that come from the traditions of the Native Hawaiian culture and of western science; and (4) work toward the establishment of primary health care centers in appropriate locations where quality primary care can be provided and where primary care services are not currently available. The death rates of Native Hawaiians exceed the death rates for all races in the United States caused by diseases of the heart, cancer, strokes, and diabetes. Achieving good health for Native Hawaiians appears difficult, but these diseases can be controlled through early detection, proper diet and treatment, and regular exercise. Hui Malama Ola Na `Oiwi provides the following services: (1) Outreach--enrolling participants in the program, assessing their health risk factors, assisting in securing medical insurance where needed, assisting in access to a physician, providing transportation to and from the physician for those who need it, and making home visits when necessary; (2) Health promotion and disease prevention-- providing education regarding the prevention and control of diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), use of tobacco, alcohol and other harmful drugs, sexually transmitted diseases, stress, cancer, the importance of sound nutrition habits, regular exercise, and proper maternal and infant care practices; (3) Primary health services--Hui Malama Ola Na `Oiwi assists patients in securing access to the primary health care services of a physician, a physician's assistant, or a nurse practitioner. APPENDIX B ---------- Constitutional Source of Congressional Authority The United States Supreme Court has so often addressed the scope of Congress' constitutional authority to address the conditions of the native people that it is now well- established.\\6\\ Although the authority has been characterized as ``plenary,'' \\7\\ the Supreme Court has addressed the broad scope of the Congress' authority.\\8\\ It has been held to encompass not only the native people within the original territory of the thirteen states but also lands that have been subsequently acquired.\\9\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\6\\ The power of the general government over these remnants of a race once powerful, now weak and diminished in numbers, is necessary to their protection. As well as to the safety of those among whom they dwell.

The rulings of the Supreme Court make clear that neither the conferring of citizenship upon the native people, the allotment of their lands, the lifting of restrictions on alienation of native land, the dissolution of a tribe, the emancipation of individual native people, the fact that a group of natives may be only a remnant of a tribe, the lack of continuous Federal supervision over the Indians, nor the separation of individual Indians from their tribes would divest the Congress of its constitutional authority to address the conditions of the native people.

Sandoval, 231 U.S. 28 (1913). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The ensuing course of dealings with the indigenous people has varied from group to group, and thus, the only general principles that apply to relations with the first inhabitants of this nation is that they were dispossessed of their lands, often but not always relocated to other lands set aside for their benefit, and that their subsistence rights to hunt, fish, and gather have been recognized under treaties and laws, but not always protected nor preserved. Some commentators have suggested that no other group of people in America has been singled out so frequently for special treatment, unique legislation, and distinct expressions of Federal policy. Although the relationship between the United States and its native people is not a history that can be said to have followed a fixed course, it is undeniably a history that reveals the special status of the indigenous people of this land. American laws recognize that the native people do not trace their lineage to common ancestors and, from time to time, our laws have in fact discouraged the indigenous people from organizing themselves as ``tribes.'' But this much is true--that for the most part, at any particular time in our history, the laws of the United States have attempted to treat the native people, regardless of their genealogical origins and their political organization, in a consistent manner. Organization as a Tribe and the Scope of Constitutional Authority It has been suggested that the scope of constitutional authority vested in the Congress is constrained by the manner in which the native people organize themselves. Under this theory, if the native people are not organized as tribes, then the Congress lacks the authority to enact laws and the President is without authority to establish policies affecting the native people of the United States. However, the original language proposed for inclusion in the Constitution made no reference to ``tribes'' but instead proposed that the Congress be vested with the authority ``to regulate affairs with the Indians as well within as without the limits of the United States.'' \\10\\ A further refinement suggested that the language read ``and with Indians, within the Limits of any State, not subject to the laws thereof[.]''.\\11\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\10\\ The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, Volume II, Journal Entry of August 18, 1787, p. 321. \\11\\ The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, Volume II, Journal Entry of August 22, 1787, p. 367. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The exchanges of correspondence between James Monroe and James Madison concerning the construction of what was to become Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution make no reference to Indian tribes, but they do discuss Indians.\\12\\ Nor is the term ``Indian tribe'' found in any dictionaries of the late eighteenth century, although the terms ``aborigines'' and ``tribe'' are defined.'' \\13\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\12\\ In his letter to James Monroe of November 27, 1784, James Madison observes, ``The foederal articles give Congs, the exclusive right of managing all affairs with the Indians not members of any State, under a proviso, that the Legislative authority, of the State within its own limits be not violated. By Indian[s] not members of a State, must be meant those, I conceive who do not live within the body of the Society, or whose Persons or property form no objects of its laws. In the case of Indians of this description the only restraint on Congress is imposed by the Legislative authority of the State.'' The Founders' Constitution, Volume Two, Preamble through Article 1, Section 8, Clause 4, p. 529, James Madison to James Monroe, 27 Nov. 1784, Papers 8:156-57; See also, James Monroe to James Madison, 15 Nov. 1784, Madison Papers 8:140. \\13\\ The term ``aborigines'' is defined as ``the earliest inhabitants of a country, those of whom no original is to be traced,'' and the term ``tribe'' is defined as ``a distinct body of the people as divided by family or fortune, or any other characteristic.'' A Dictionary of the English Language (Samuel Johnson ed., 1755). The annotations accompanying the term ``Indian'' in the 1901 Oxford dictionary indicates the use of the term as far back as 1553. Oxford English Dictionary (James A.H. Murray ed., 1901). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Native Hawaiians and the Meaning of ``Indian'' Whether the reference was to ``aborigines'' or to ``Indians'', the Framers of the Constitution did not import a meaning to those terms as a limitation upon the authority of Congress, but as descriptions of the native people who occupied and possessed the lands that were later to become the United States--whether those lands lay within the boundaries of the original thirteen colonies, or any subsequently acquired territories. This construction is consistent with more than two hundred Federal statutes which establish that the aboriginal inhabitants of America are a class of people known as ``Native Americans'' and that this class includes three groups--American Indians, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians. The unique native peoples of Alaska have been recognized as ``Indian'' and as ``tribes'' for four hundred years. The Founders' understanding of the ``Eskimaux'' as Indian tribes, and Congress' recognition of its power over Alaska Natives ever since the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment and the acquisition of the Alaskan territory, help illuminate Congress' power over, and responsibility for, all Native American peoples. The treatment of Alaskan Eskimos is particularly instructive because the Eskimo peoples are linguistically, culturally, and ancestrally distinct from other American ``Indians.'' Many modern scholars do not use the word ``Indian'' to describe Eskimos or the word ``tribe'' to describe their nomadic family groups and villages. The Framers, however, recognized no such technical distinctions. In the common understanding of the time, Eskimos, like Native Hawaiians, were aboriginal peoples; they were therefore ``Indians.'' Their separate communities of kind and kin were ``tribes.'' Congress' special power over these aboriginal peoples is beyond serious challenge. During the Founding Era, and during the Constitutional Convention, the terms ``Indian'' and ``tribe'' were used to encompass the tremendous diversity of aboriginal peoples of the New World and the wide range of their social and political organizations. The Founding generation knew and dealt with Indian tribes living in small, familial clans and in large, confederated empires. Native Alaska villages and Native Hawaiians residing in their aboriginal lands (i.e., the small islands that comprise the State of Hawaii) are ``Indian Tribes'' as that phrase was used by the Founders. The Framers drafted the Constitution not to limit Congress' power over Indians, but to make clear the supremacy of Congress' power over Indian affairs. The Congress has exercised the power to promote the welfare of all Native American peoples, and to foster the ever-evolving means and methods of self-governance as exercised by Native people. This history is accurately reflected in nearly two centuries of U.S. Supreme Court jurisprudence. Beginning with Chief Justice Marshall, the Supreme Court has recognized the power of the United States to provide for the welfare, and to promote the self-governance, of Indian peoples. This recognition of the right of the indigenous, native people of the United States to self-determination and self-governance is part of the structure of America's complex multi-sovereign system of governance. In the language and understanding of the Founders, ``tribes'' or ``peoples'' did not lose their identity as such when conquered or ruled by kings. Like other Native American people, Native Hawaiians lived for thousands of years as ``tribes,'' then as confederations of tribes, now as conquered tribes. All aboriginal peoples of the New World were ``Indians.'' That is what it meant to be an ``Indian.'' The Founders knew that Columbus had not landed in India or the Indies; Columbus's navigational error had been corrected, but his malapropism had survived. And so, in the words of one of the earliest English books about America, the native people were ``Indians,'' for the simple reason that ``so caule wee all of the --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\14\\ Gonzalo Fernandez de la natural hystoria de las Indias (1526), trans. by R. Eden (1955), in E. Arber, ed., The First Three English Books on America (Birmingham, Eng., 1885) (emphasis added). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Founding generation used ``tribes'' to denote peoples of like kind or kin. As used in the Constitution, the word ``tribe'' does not refer to some specific type of government or social organization. All Native American peoples were ``tribes,'' whether they lived in villages or spread out in vast federations or empires. ``Tribe'' and ``nation'' were used to refer not to governments, but to groups of people recognizing a common membership or identity as such. Application of the biblical concept of ``tribes'' to the ``Indians'' reflected the understanding that the natives of the New World were not one people, but many ``peoples,'' ``nations,'' or ``tribes''--terms used interchangeably well into the Nineteenth --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\15\\ Robert F. Berkhofer, Jr., The White Man's Indian 16 (1979). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Founders had seen analogies to the complex tribal history of the Bible. The Founders knew the native peoples evolved, united and divided in ever shifting forms of government. The native peoples had formed ``powerful confederac[ies],'' tribes united under common chiefs, and federations of tribes joined with other federations.\\16\\ The colonies and the States under the Articles of Confederation had repeatedly dealt with vast federations of tribes, including the ``Six Nations'' in the north and the ``Five Civilized Tribes'' in the south.\\17\\ The Indian peoples were ``tribes'' not because they formed any particular organization, but because they recognized themselves as distinct peoples, with cultures, languages and societies separate from each other and from the European invaders. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\16\\ Jefferson, Notes, at 221. \\17\\ See, e.g., Treaty with the Six Nations, Oct. 22, 1784 (treaty with the many tribes of Senecas, Mohawks, Onondagas, Oneida and Tuscarora), Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties 2:5-6; Treaty of Treaty of Forth McIntosh, Jan. 21, 1785 (treaty with the Wiandot, Delaware, Chippewa, and Ottawa ``and all their tribes''), in id. at 2:6-8; Treaty of Hopewell, Nov. 28, 1785 (treaty with all the ``tribes'' of the Cherokee), in id. at 2:8-11. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As Jefferson's ``Notes on the State of Virginia'' and other contemporary works show, the division of the world into ``European settlers'' and ``Indians'' was not essentially racial. The Indians were not a race, they were many peoples, thought to share diverse ancestry with peoples all over the world. The distinction between European and Native American peoples was political. The European settlers (who arrived with Royal charters) recognized the ``aboriginal peoples'' as separate nations--separate sovereigns with whom they would have to deal as one nation to another. Before and after the Constitution, the new settlers treated the Indian peoples as separate nations, with whom they made war, peace and treaties. The treatment of the aboriginal peoples under the Constitution was systematically and structurally distinct from the inhumane and unendurable treatment accorded to ``slaves.'' This distinctive nation-to-nation relationship survived the settlement of the West, the Civil War Amendments to the Constitution, and two hundred years of Congressional action and judicial construction. History of the Origins of the Constitutional Term ``Tribe'' The Articles of Confederation gave the Continental Congress power over relations with the Indians only so long as Congress' dealings with Indians within a State did not ``infringe'' that State's legislative power. This created constant friction over where the States' power ended and Congress' power began. The sole stated purpose of the Indian terms of the new Constitution was to eliminate any uncertainty as to Congress' supremacy. The Framers intended to grant Congress broad, supreme authority to regulate Indian affairs. The two references to ``Indians'' in the Constitution generated virtually no debate at any time in the Constitutional Convention. That relations with the Indians should be one of the Federal powers appears to have been universally accepted. The Framers sought only to make clear that Congress' power here was supreme. The Articles had given the Continental Congress ``sole and exclusive right and power'' of regulating relations with Indians who were ``not members of any of the states, provided that the legislative right of any state within its own limits be not infringed or violated.'' \\18\\ As Madison explained, this language created two major problems. First, no one knew when or whether Indians were ``members of states''; second, the grant to Congress of ``sole and exclusive power,'' so long as Congress did not ``intrud[e] on the internal right'' of States was ``utterly incomprehensible.'' The provision had been a source of ``frequent perplexity and contention in the federal councils.'' \\19\\ Capitalizing on the uncertainty, several states (Georgia, New York and North Carolina) had infringed Congress' power by making their own arrangements with local Indians. As a result, during the Constitutional Convention and Ratification, Georgia was in armed conflict, and on the verge of war, with the powerful Creek Nation. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\18\\ Articles of Confederation, Art.

Kaminiski, ed., 1983) (``Documentary History''), XV: 431. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The only debate on the issue in the Convention focused on the need for federal supremacy over the states. Madison objected early on to the ``New Jersey Plan'' on the ground that it failed to bar states from encroaching on Congress' power over ``transactions with the Indians.'' \\20\\ In August, Madison proposed that Congress be given the power ``[t]o regulate affairs with the Indians as well within as without the limits of the United States.'' \\21\\ Madison's proposal was submitted to the Committee on Detail without discussion. The Committee on Detail recommended that power over Indians be dealt with in the Commerce clause, which would provide Congress with power over commerce ``with the Indians, within the limits of any State, not subject to the laws thereof.'' The proposal provoked no debate. \\22\\ On August 31st, the Convention referred various ``parts of the Constitution'' (including the Commerce Clause) to a ``Committee of eleven,'' including Madison. \\23\\ Without recorded discussion, the Committee recommended that the language be simplified to commerce ``with the Indian tribes.'' \\24\\ The Convention accepted the recommendation without debate or dissent. \\25\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\20\\ Notes of James Madison,'' June 19, 1787, in The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, at 3:316 (Max Farrand, rev. ed. 1966) [hereafter, ``Federal Convention''] (``By the federal articles, transactions with the Indians appertain to Congress.

During the ratification debates, the new Constitution was defended on the ground that it gave Congress power over ``Indian affairs'' and ``trade with the Indians.'' \\26\\ In the only extended discussion of the issue during ratification, Madison used the phrases ``commerce with the Indian tribes'' and ``trade with Indians'' interchangeably; Madison explained that the purpose of the new provision was to eliminate the limitation on Congress' power over trade with the Indians living within the States. \\27\\ The notion that the reference to ``tribes'' was a limit on Congress' ability to deal with the native peoples is without support in history and is contrary to the only expressions of the Framers' original intent. The Constitution gave Congress power over the Indian peoples, however and wherever it found them. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\26\\ Federalist 40, in Documentary History, XV: 406.

Shortly after taking office, President Washington gave instructions to Commissioners to negotiate with the Creeks. It was, as noted, the war between the Creeks and Georgia that had fostered the apparently universal conclusion that the new Federal government must be given supremacy over Indian affairs. Washington instructed the Commissioners to determine the nature of the Creek's political divisions and governments, including ``[t]he number of each division''; ``[t]he number of Towns in each District''; ``[t]he names, Characters and residence of the most influential Chiefs--and . . . their grades of influence.'' And, most tellingly, the Commissioners were to learn ``[t]he kinds of Government (if any) of the Towns, Districts, and Nation.'' \\30\\ Washington, like other Founders, did not know how the Creek lived and how they governed themselves. But however the Indian peoples lived, and however they governed themselves, they were still Indian peoples and they were still subject to the supreme power of the Federal government over Indian tribes. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\28\\ ``An Act to regulate trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes,'' July 22, 1790, ch. 33, Sec. 4, 1 Stat. 137, in 1 Doc.

When they encountered unknown Indian peoples, the explorers were to learn the ``names of the nations''; ``their relations with other tribes or nations''; their ``language, traditions, monuments''; and the ``peculiarities in their laws, customs & dispositions.'' \\31\\ Like Washington, Jefferson knew there was much he and his fellow citizens did not know about the ``Indian'' peoples; but he intended to find out and to assert Federal authority over whatever he found. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\31\\ Thomas Jefferson, ``Instructions to Captain Lewis,'' June in Jefferson, Writings, supra, at 1126, 1128. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution It is inconceivable anyone thought that if Washington's Commissioners or Lewis and Clark found a native people living without ``chiefs,'' like many Eskimo, or under a King like Montezuma or Kamehameha, these people would be beyond Congress' power over Indian ``tribes'' or nations. Nor did the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment intend to eliminate Congress' special power to adopt legislation singling out and favoring Indians; they did not intend to alter the nation-to-nation relationships between the United States and the Indian peoples created by the Constitution. Indeed, the Framers of the Amendment were at pains to make certain that they preserved that structure. ``Indians'' are expressly singled out for special treatment by the text of the Amendment. In order to eliminate the morally repugnant language which counted slaves as three-fifths persons, the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment redrafted the apportionment clause. The Framers deleted the ``three-fifths persons,'' but retained the express exclusion of ``Indians not subject to tax'' (Amend. XIV, Sec. 1), because, while they intended to wipe out the badges and incidents of slavery, they intended to preserve the special relationship between the United States and the Indian people. Before and after the Amendment, Indians were not citizens of the United States, they did not have the right to vote, they did not count for purposes of apportionment, but they were subject to special legislation in furtherance of Congress' historic trust responsibilities. The only debate during the drafting and ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment was not about whether the special relationship with the Indian people should be preserved, but about how to make certain it was preserved. When one Senator suggested that specific reference be made excluding ``Indians'' from the citizenship clause, the Senator presenting the clause argued this was unnecessary. The Amendment provided citizenship only to persons ``within the jurisdiction'' of the United States,\\32\\ and Indian nations were treated like alien peoples not fully within the jurisdiction of the government: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\32\\ Similar limiting language occurs in the Equal Protection Clause. in the very Constitution itself there is a provision that Congress shall have power to regulate commerce, not only with foreign nations and among the States, but also with Indian tribes.

Globe, 39th Congress, 1st Sess. 2895. Congress debated what language to adopt in order to make certain that the special status of the Indian tribes was preserved.\\34\\ There was no support for, or consideration given to, eliminating the special relationship between the United States and the Indian peoples. The uniform intent was to preserve Congress' ability to decide when Indians would be granted citizenship, when Indians would be taxed, and when Indians would be subject to special legislation.\\35\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\34\\ See, e.g., Remarks of Sen. Cong., 1st Sess., 2895-2896 (1866) (``[Senator Howard] declares his purpose to be not to include Indians within this constitutional amendment. In purpose I agree with him. I do not intend to include them. My purpose is to exclude them''). \\35\\ Congress expressed the same intent in the Civil Rights Act that same year. The Act, granting citizenship to the emancipated slaves, specifically excluded ``Indians not taxed.'' Civil Rights Act, ch. 31, 14 Stat. 27 (1866). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- For nearly two hundred years, the Supreme Court has recognized the political distinction the Constitution draws between ``Indian tribes'' and all other people. The early opinions of Chief Justice John Marshall reflect the original intent of the Framers and lay the groundwork for the Supreme Court's jurisprudence. Marshall wrote that ``[t]he condition of the Indians in relation to the United States is perhaps unlike that of any other two people in existence.'' \\36\\ With deliberate irony, he called the Indian tribes ``domestic dependent nations.'' \\37\\ The Indian peoples had surrendered ``their rights to complete sovereignty,'' \\38\\, and yet they continued to be ``nations'' that governed themselves.\\39\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\36\\ Cherokee Nation v.

The Indian Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I., Sec. 3, cl. 8, and the Treaty Clause, art. II, Sec. 2, cl. 2, granted Congress broad power to regulate Indian affairs. These provisions permitted the United States to fulfill its obligations to the dependent Indian ``nations'' that were its ``wards.'' \\40\\ As ``guardian,'' Congress had both the obligation and the power to enact legislation protecting the Indian nations.\\41\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\40\\ Cherokee Nation, 30 U.S. (5 Pet.) at 17-18; Worcester, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) at 558-59. \\41\\ See Worcester, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) at 560-61; accord Cherokee Nation, 30 U.S. (5 Pet.) at 16 (``[t]hey look to our government for protection, rely upon its kindness and its power; appeal to it for relief to their wants''). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marshall defined ``Indians'' broadly to include all of the ``original inhabitants'' or ``natives'' who occupied America when it was discovered by ``the great nations of Europe.'' \\42\\ He also conceived of ``tribes'' in broad, inclusive terms. He used ``tribe'' and ``nation'' interchangeably: A ``tribe or nation,'' distinct from others''--a ``distinct community.'' \\43\\ Like the Founders, Marshall defined an ``Indian tribe'' as nothing more than a community, large or small, of descendants of the peoples who inhabited the New World before the Europeans. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\42\\ Johnson, 21 U.S. (8 Wheat.) at 572-74; Worcester, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) at 544 (1832) (Indians are ``those already in possession [of land], either as aboriginal occupants, or as occupants by virtue of a discovery made before the memory of man''). See also Johnson, 21 U.S. (8 Wheat.) at 575 (Indians in French Canada); id. at 581 (Indians in Nova Scotia); Id. at 584-87 (Indians in Virginia, Kentucky, the Louisiana Purchase, and Florida). Marshall noted the United States had dealt with variously organized ``tribes'' or ``confederacies.'' See id. at 546-49. \\43\\ Worcester, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) at 559, 561. See also Cherokee Nation, 30 U.S. (5 Pet.) at 20 (``an Indian tribe or nation within the United States''); Johnson, 21 U.S. (8 Wheat.) At 590 (``the tribes of Indians inhabiting this country''). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Although the aboriginal ``tribes'' or ``nations'' or ``peoples'' were defined in part by common ancestry, their constitutional significance lay in their separate existence as ``independent political communities,'' \\44\\. The ``race'' of Indian peoples was constitutionally irrelevant. Native peoples were ``nations,'' \\45\\ and the relationship between the United States and the natives reflected a political settlement between conquered and conquering nations. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\44\\ Id., at 559. \\45\\ Id., at 559-60. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Supreme Court has kept faith with Marshall's conception. The Indian nations have always been defined by ancestry and political affiliation. In the native cultures, the two are inextricably intertwined. The Supreme Court's definition is legal, and the Native American's self-definition is historic, religious or cultural; but the two reduce to the same elements: ``Indians'' are (1) the descendants of aboriginal peoples who (ii) belong to some Native American ``people,'' ``nation,'' ``tribe,'' or ``community,'' as the founding generation understood those terms.\\46\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\46\\ See, e.g., Montoya v. United States, 180 U.S. 261, 266 (1901) (``a body of Indians of the same or a similar race, united in a community under one leadership or government, and inhabiting a particular though sometimes ill-defined territory''); United States v. Candelaria, 271 U.S. 432, 442 (1926); see Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Sac & Fox Nation, 508 U.S. 114, 123 (1993); United States v. Antelope, 430 U.S. 641, 647 n.7 (1977) (individuals ``anthropologically'' classified an Indians may be outside Congress's Indian commerce power if they sever relations with tribe). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- These interwoven qualifications reflect the Supreme Court's consistent understanding that constitutionally-relevant Indian status, while based in part on ancestry, is a political classification.\\47\\ It is an individual's membership in a ``political community'' of Indians--even a community in the making--and not solely his or her racial identity, that brings him or her within Congress' broad authority to regulate Indian affairs.\\48\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\47\\ United States v. Antelope, 430 U.S. 641, 646-47 (1977). \\48\\ Id., at 646. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Indian Tribes and Blood Quantum Nor does the use of blood quantum as part of the formula to determine who is and is not a Native American constitute impermissible ``racial'' discrimination. The Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear that Indian tribes are the political and familial heirs to ``once-sovereign political communities''--not ``racial groups.'' \\49\\ The Court has long recognized that a tribe's ``right to determine its own membership'' is ``central to its existence as an independent political community.'' \\50\\ From time immemorial, Native American communities have defined themselves at least in part by family and ancestry.\\51\\ Kinship and ancestry is part of what it means to be an ``Indian.'' Indians by ancestry or blood is what the Framers meant by ``Indians.'' It is what Chief Justice Marshall meant by ``Indians.'' It is what the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment meant by ``Indians.'' This central conception of ``Indian'' identity is woven into the Constitution and the entire body of law that has grown up in reliance on that conception. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\49\\ Antelope, 430 U.S. at 646; see Fisher v.

A few tribes require as much as one-half degree of tribal blood * * *''); accord Felix S. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 22-23 & n.27 (1982 ed.). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Congressional authority to use such traditional requirements for tribal membership or benefits has never been doubted. In United States v. John, the Supreme Court approved Congress' establishment of an Indian reservation for the benefit of ``Chocktaw Indians of one-half or more Indian blood, resident in Mississippi.'' \\52\\ The Court unhesitatingly applied the definition of ``Indian'' that appears in the Indian Reorganization Act, which has governed Indian tribes since 1934: ``all other persons of one-half or more Indian blood.'' \\53\\ Similarly, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act's use of a blood quantum formula as one factor in determining ``native'' status is a valid method of defining those belonging to the group eligible for statutory benefits, and the use of the blood quantum ``does not detract from the political nature of the classification.'' \\54\\ The use of blood ties is integral to the nature of the political deal struck between the conquering Europeans and the native peoples, as they set out to maintain partially separate existences while inhabiting the same country. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\52\\ Id., 437 U.S. at 646. \\53\\ Id. at 650 (quoting 25 U.S.C.

Pierce, 694 F.2d 1162, 1168-69 n. 10 (9th Cir.1982) (noting absence of other practicable methods, like tribal rolls or proximity to reservations). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is not to suggest, however, that the Constitution imposes any minimum blood quantum requirement for tribal membership, and suggestions to the contrary have no legal or historical basis. The constitutional text and historic relationship gives Congress not just the ``right'' to discriminate between Native Americans and others, but the responsibility to do so. As the Supreme Court has long recognized, from the relationship between these former sovereign peoples and the ``superior nation'' that conquered them arises ``the power and the duty'' of the United States to ``exercis[e] a fostering care and protection over all dependent Indian communities within its borders. . . .'' \\55\\ Recently, the Supreme Court acknowledged the continued significance of this historic trust relationship.\\56\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\55\\ Kagama, 118 U.S. 375, 384-85 (1886) (emphasis added); See Seminole Nation v. United States, 316 U.S. 286, 296 (1942) (the government owes a ``distinctive obligation of trust'' to Indians). \\56\\ See Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Assn v. United States, 527 U.S. 173, 193 (1999) (recognizing ``special federal interest in protecting the welfare of Native Americans''). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Like the 556 Indian tribes currently recognized by the United States, Native Hawaiians are a group of people defined by their common descent from an ancestral class, each forming a distinct polity and having a unique historical existence. Any contemporary group whose members are defined by their lineal descendancy from a historically-defined class will necessarily share an ethnic identity with the original members of the historical class, even though intermarriage may attenuate the degree of blood quantum shared by the original historical class members. Nevertheless, a definition that is based primarily on the historical uniqueness of the original class is no more race-based than the definition of those who are members or citizens of the historic Indian tribes that greeted the first Europeans immigrants to this nation's shores. The Supreme Court has repeatedly applied the concepts of ``Indian'' and ``tribe'' to a wide variety of Native American communities, recognizing the constant evolution of Native community life and that the questions of whether and how to treat with these changing communities are assigned by the Constitution to Congress. In The Kansas Indians,\\57\\, the Court recognized that the Ohio Shawnees remained a ``tribe,'' even though tribal property was no longer owned communally and the tribe had abandoned Indian customs ``owing to the proximity of their white neighbors.'' \\58\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\57\\ 72 U.S. 737 (1866). \\58\\ Id., 72 U.S. at 755-57. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Fifty years later, the Supreme Court approved a similar tribal designation for the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico. After long experience under Spanish rule, the Pueblo Indians seemed little like the ``savages'' of James Fennimore Cooper. The Pueblo Indians lived in villages with organized municipal governments; they cultivated the soil and raised livestock; they spoke Spanish, worshiped in the Roman Catholic Church; and prior to the acquisition of New Mexico by the United States, they enjoyed full Mexican citizenship.\\59\\ Nevertheless, the Pueblo Indians lived in ``distinctly Indian communities,'' and Congress acted properly under the Indian Commerce Clause in determining that they were ``dependent communities entitled to its aid and protection, like other Indian tribes.'' \\60\\ For Native American ``communities,'' the Court held that ``the questions whether, to what extent, and for what time they shall be recognized and dealt with as dependent tribes requiring the guardianship and protection of the United States are to be determined by Congress. . . .'' \\61\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\59\\ See United States v.

Co., 221 U.S. 286, 315 (1911). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As indicated above, sixty years later, in United States v. John,\\62\\ the Supreme Court recognized Congress' authority to establish a reservation for the benefit of Choctaw Indians in Mississippi, even though (1) they were ``merely a remnant of a larger group of Indians'' that had moved to Oklahoma; (2) ``federal supervision over them had not been continuous''; and (3) they had resided in Mississippi for more than a century and had become fully integrated into the political and social life of the State.\\63\\ The Mississippi Choctaw were Indians. They had recently organized into a distinctly Indian community. The Court therefore deferred to Congress' determination that they were a ``tribe for the purposes of Federal Indian law.'' \\64\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\62\\ 437 U.S. 634 (1978). \\63\\ Id., at 652-53. \\64\\ Id., at 650 n.20, 652-53. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Similarly, the Supreme Court has recognized Congress' broad authority to deal with individual ``Indians.'' \\65\\ or large organizations comprised of numerous ``tribes.'' \\66\\ Congress may recognize new aggregations of Native Americans, so long as such legislation is rationally related to the fulfillment of Congress' trust obligation to the historic Indian peoples.\\67\\ Congress' treatment of the Alaska native people--including the establishment of unique regional corporations whose shareholders comprise numerous Native villages--has properly been upheld as within Congress' special power over and responsibility for the Native American peoples.\\68\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\65\\ United States v. Holliday, 70 U.S. (3 Wall.) 407, 417 (1865) (regulation of ``commerce with the Indian tribes means'' regulation of ``commerce with the individuals composing those tribes''); see Morton v.

Confederated Salish & Kootenai Tribes, 425 U.S. 463, 480 (1976). \\68\\ Although the Alaska natives' situation is ``distinctly different from that of other American Indians,'' Alaska Chapter, 694 F.2d at 1168-69 n.101, see Metlakatla Indian Community v. Egan, 369 U.S. 45, 50-51 (1962), it is ``well established'' Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts are ``dependent Indian people'' within the meaning of the Constitution. Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. United States, 248 U.S. 78, 87-89 (1918); see also Pence v. Kleppe, 529 F.2d 39 n.5 (9th Cir. ``the aborigines of America'' and includes Eskimos and Aleuts in Alaska); United States therefore, ``Indians''). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Citizens of the Kingdom of Hawai`i Contrary to well-established principles of Federal-Indian law that recognize the right of a tribe to determine its own members as a fundamental aspect of the tribe's sovereignty,\\69\\ some have argued that the Kingdom of Hawai`i somehow lost its ``native'' character because some non-Hawaiians became naturalized citizens of the Kingdom. This argument is used as the basis for asserting that Native Hawaiians cannot now be ``recognized'' as a native group with which the United States may maintain a special legal and political relationship.\\70\\ However, as evident from the preceding discussion of Supreme Court rulings and precedent, this argument lacks any constitutional basis. The Supreme Court has often decided cases relating to the status of non-Indians who had become members or citizens of Indian tribes,\\71\\ but the Court has never suggested that a tribal law that provides for the membership or citizenship in the tribe of previously non-tribal members renders those tribes or their modern-day successors ineligible for recognition as having a special legal and political relationship with the United States pursuant to the Indian Commerce Clause. Similarly, opposition to the recognition of a Native Hawaiian governing entity premised upon the attenuation of the blood quantum of its citizens lacks any historical or constitutional basis. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\69\\ Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49, 72 n.32 (1978). \\70\\ See, e.g., Stuart Minor Benjamin, Equal Protection and the Special relationship: The Case of Native Hawaiians, 106 Yale L.J. 537, 607-8 & n.287 (1996) (discussing this argument, while noting that ``[i]nclusion of some Westerners would not necessarily defeat a claim of tribal status'' as the Supreme Court has never directly addressed the question, and noting that ``some Indian tribes included Westerners. . . .''. \\71\\ See, e.g., United States v. Rogers, 45 U.S. (4 How.) 567 (1846); Boff v. Burney, 168 U.S. 218 (1897); Daniel Red Bird v. United States, 203 U.S. 76 (1906). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Many contemporary tribes define their citizenship or membership based upon lineal descendancy from a tribal roll, and the Congress has from time to time established criteria for membership in certain tribes.\\72\\ What neither the Congress nor the Supreme Court has done is to suggest that the Constitution imposes a blood quantum limitation or requirement on tribal citizenship. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\72\\ Public Law No. 129, Sec. Sec. 1-4, 34 Stat. 137, 137-38 (April 26, 1906) (setting forth enrollment criteria for members of the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Cherokee, Creek and Seminole Tribes of Oklahoma). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Significance of ``Federal Recognition'' It is important to recognize that the legal distinctions that have been drawn in contemporary times between Indian tribes that are ``acknowledged'' by the Department of the Interior \\73\\ or ``recognized'' by the Congress--tribes that have a direct government-to-government relationship with the United States and are thereby eligible for various Federal benefits--and Native American groups that are not so recognized and have no such government-to-government relationship, is a relatively recent phenomenon. ``[A] close scrutiny of the various executive orders, Congressional legislation, departmental policies, Solicitor's opinions, and judicial decisions since 1783 . . . discloses an astonishing oblivion of the need for an express declaration or statement regarding which Indian tribes were to be recognized, until the enactment of the Wheeler-Howard (Indian Reorganization) Act of 1934,'' \\74\\ thirteen years after the enactment of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act. In fact, there was no systematic procedure by which a Native American group could petition the United States for recognition until 1978, when regulations were promulgated to implement the Federal Acknowledgment process.\\75\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\73\\ See 25 CFR Part 83. \\74\\ William W. Quinn, Jr., Federal Acknowledgment of American Indian Tribes: The Historical Development of a Legal Concept, 34 Am. J. Leg. Hist. 331, 332 (1990) (citing 48 Stat. 984 (1934) (codified as amended at 25 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 461 et seq.)); see generally, William W. Quinn, Jr., Federal Acknowledgment of American Indian Tribes: Authority, Judicial Interposition, and 25 CFR Sec. 83, 17 Am. Indian L. Rev. 37 (1992); L.R. Weatherhead, What is an ``Indian Tribe''?--The Question of Tribal Existence, 8 Am. Indian L. Rev. 1 (1980). \\75\\ 25 CFR, Part 83. Quinn 1992, at 40-41. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- An administrative process for the acknowledgment of Native groups by the United States that was established almost twenty years after Hawaians admission to the Union could not have informed the provisions of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act nor the Hawai`i Admission Act and it is thus not surprising that the language of those Acts do not conform neatly with categorizations that had yet to be developed. Although the authority of Congress to formally ``recognize'' tribes through legislation is unquestioned, the Department of the Interior's regulations associated with the administrative process for the acknowledgment of tribes pursuant to 25 CFR Part 83 exclude Native Hawaiians from that process, and thus legislation is the only mechanism available to Native Hawaiians.\\76\\ The present legislation thus establishes no precedent applicable to groups eligible to apply for recognition under the existing administrative framework. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\76\\ See 25 CFR Sec. Sec. 83.1, 83.3 (administrative process available only to groups within the ``continental United States,'' defined as the ``contiguous 48 states and Alaska'').
