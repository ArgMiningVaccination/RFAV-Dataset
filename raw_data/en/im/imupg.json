WATMORE HEAD OF CONTRACTING ACTIVITY OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SUBJECT: Interim Contractor Health and Safety Guidance Related to COVID- 19 Vaccinations -Programs to Increase Participation Thank you all for your continued efforts to ensure an appropriate safety posture is put in place to prevent the spread of COVID -19 and other public health measures to reduce th e spread of the disease. The recent increased positivity rate and spread of the Delta variant across the country has resulted in unnecessary loss of life and increased health care costs. The Department of Energy (DOE ) and Office of Environment al Managem ent (EM) have not been spared loss of li fe due to COVID -19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) determined the best way to slow the spread of COVID -19 and prevent infection by the Delta variant or other variants is to be vaccinated. It is critical that both the federal government and its robust contractor workforce exercise all options to increase vaccination rates. On September 9, 2021, President Bid en issued two Executive Orders mandat ing that all federal and federal contractor s, as w ell as subcontractor employees be vaccinated . More detailed implementation guidance i s forth com ing from the Safer F ederal Workforce Task Force and m y office . Until su ch time, as the Head of C ontracting Activity (HCA) , I am issuing this interim guidance to authorize enhanced use of health and safety programs to rapidly increase vacci nation participation rate s. Previously, EM authori zed a consistent incentive of 4 hours administrative leave to obtain the vaccination (per dose ) for the emplo yee and to acco mpany a family member . This has not increased vaccination rates at EM sites to the maximum levels. Therefore, as Head of Contracting Activity , I am autho rizing an increase to 8 hours or one day (per dose) for the employee , proactively . This is within the general allo wability of costs for health clinics at Federal Acqui sition Regulation section 31.205- 13. In addition , I have determ ined that it is reasonable for EM co ntractors and subcontractors to grant their personnel who are working on site or on telework to be give n up to 8 hours administrative leave per dose to accompany family members to get vaccinated for COVID- 19. Use the de finition of family member at Title 5 Code of Federal Regulations 603.201 (Attachment 5) to implement this policy. The leave shall be coded consistent with the individual contractor's current Human Resourc e system and practices. The leave is not retroactive to those that have previously been vac cinated. Contractor and subcontract or personnel who are currently on le ave under the special leave authority in CARES Act section 3610 may not be granted additional leave for this purpose. 2 They may accompany family members to receive the v accine while on their paid \"stand by\" status. Contractor s may request approval from th e Contracting Officer for other health and safety related incentives to rapidly increase the participa tion rate and slow the spread of COVID- 19. In doing so, the contractor shall submit it s market research to demonstra te reasonableness of the request . Below is an example of recent Market Research : COVID- 19 Vaccination Incentives Employer Policy Loves Travel Shops & Country Stores $75 Arkansas State Empl oyees $100 Maryland State Employees $100 Bridgestone JBS USA (Meat Processor) $100 Walmart $150 Lidl (Grocery Chain) $200 Cigna Inc. $200 Houston Hospital System $500 Colorado Department of Corrections $500 Anne Arundel C ounty (MD) Employees $1000 Aldi (Grocery Chain) 2 hrs of pay McDonalds 4 hrs of pay Dollar General 4 hrs of pay Idaho State Employees 4 hrs of pay Target 4 hrs of pay Marriot International 4 hrs of pay Chobani 6 hrs of pay United Airlines 1 Day off American Airlines 1 Extra Vacation Day in 2022 Delta Airlines Raising Monthly Health Insurance Premium by $200 for Unvaccinated Employees MGM Re sorts Unvacci nated Employees Must Pay $15 Weekly for COVID Tests Hawaii State Employe es Unvaccinated Employees Must Pay for COVID Tests 20 Companies ( Currently Not Dis closed) Considering $20 -$50 Monthly Health Coverage Surcharge for the Unvaccinated Increasing health care premiums for unvaccinated and passing the testing cost on to the unvaccinated emp loyee are two trending areas. The requests shall comply with the F ederal Acquisition Regulation (FA R) and be aligned with health and safety perfor mance, rather than a perceived gift. A baseline vaccination rate for each contractor is being e stablished at the present time, whereby performance will be trended on a monthly basis. It is the Department' s intent to mea sure the contractor 's safety and health performance through the Performance Evaluation and Measurement P lan (PEMP) process, where by fee may be earned fo r exemplary health and safety per formance. 3 As stated previously, the costs of contractor eff orts to imp rove public health conditions on EM sites are allowable in keeping with the general allowability of costs for health clinics at Federal Acquisition Regu lation (FA R) sectio n 31.205- 13 and the terms and conditions of the contract . Previous HCA mem os also hav e used that cost pri nciple to support cos ts related to improving public health. This guidance is effect ive immediately .
