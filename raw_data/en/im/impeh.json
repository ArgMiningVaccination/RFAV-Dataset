Out with masking symptoms with medications, and in with treating the source of the problems with non-drug solutions. We can't wait to see what this year brings, but we know it will bring two things for certain that will be beneficial to everyone, chiropractors and patients \u2014 a COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. and around the world, and a renewed outlook on health and wellness for patients. Immune health A topic shared across age, race, gender and continents now due to COVID-19, the renewed interest in immune health won't be slowing down. Patients gave themselves a fast-track education in immune health last year in the midst of the pandemic, resulting in a more knowledgeable patient base that wants to maintain a heightened immunity for general illnesses, flus, and any other COVID-like viruses that we may see in the future. Nutrition outlets are reporting sales in the 200%+ range for vitamins and supplements, and likewise predict a new era for wellness and immunity strength. In this issue we examine some of the newly-established standards for immunity health, and how you can handle a touchy subject \u2014 dealing with patients whose weight issues interfere with chiropractic care and their general health, and make them more susceptible to disease and viruses like COVID-19. \"Unfortunately, many Americans entered the pandemic with immune systems that were already weakened \u2014 combined with the failure to implement necessary infection prevention measures consistently,\" writes our feature author Robert Silverman. \"This population group is at high risk for infection, severe possible illness and long-term impacts. Healthy people have robust immune systems. In our society, 72% of the population is overweight or obese \u2014 an epidemic within the pandemic.\"Looking forward What are your New Year's resolutions? In this issue we take a look at some that can benefit doctors of chiropractic both professionally and personally. Do you know what your \"MarTech stack\" looks like for your business? How about the benefits of measuring patient body composition and phase angle? If you missed The National in Orlando this past fall, we also feature a recap and photo spread of one of the largest chiropractic conventions in the industry. Late last year another congressperson jumped on board to officially support the Chiropractic Medicare Coverage Modernization Act under review in the U.S. Congress in a year chiropractic was designated an \"essential service.\" Next year, in addition to a Medicare breakthrough, could also include blanket chiropractic coverage for all military members and their families as opposed to only active duty. From a health care service perspective while emerging from a pandemic, chiropractic should continue to rise to new heights in 2021.

Here are a few tips for giving your practice more social exposure. 1. Maintain a strong presence. Creating social media pages for your practice is an important first step, but be active on them, too. Create regular posts, respond to clients' feedback and get them involved with your business, especially via Facebook and Instagram. 2. Promote brand awareness. Share pictures and videos to show the variety of services you provide. Mention the benefits of each product or service as well as treatment processes. Potential clients will see that you are a professional in the field and will prefer to visit your business over the competition's. 3. Improve communication. Staying in touch with clients is necessary to create a bond with them, but doing so after they've left your practice makes that bond last. In addition to posting about your offers and services on social, implement an email or text messaging system, which will allow you to send bulk messages to your clients. 4. Reward client loyalty. Create a loyalty program to give clients points for their purchases, which they can use to pick up rewards, such as a discount, at your practice. Your customers will enjoy earning points and associate your business with positive experiences, while you grow a strong foundation of loyal customers. \u2014 Juliusz Dzierlatka For more social media tips and advice, visit the \"Business Tips\" section of chiroeco.com.Each month we'll ask a new question on our Facebook page.

After more than four decades as a faculty member at Sherman College of Chiropractic, Associate Professor John H. Porter Jr., DC, retired Dec. 31. A 1977 Sherman College graduate, Porter joined the college in 1979 as a faculty member and has dedicated his years at the college to teaching the next generations of doctors of chiropractic as well as serving the local community through his private chiropractic practice as Spartanburg's second Black chiropractor. Porter announced his retirement during the college's annual employee service awards program on Nov. 19 among colleagues and friends. Having joined the faculty just six years after its founding, Porter has taught nearly every Sherman College student to walk its halls, leaving a lasting impression on many alumni. \"No doubt after 40-plus years of service, Dr. Porter could teach us all a thing or two about community, and about building a legacy,\" said Sherman College President Edwin Cordero, DC. In 2019, in celebration of his 40th year, Sherman College established a scholarship fund in Porter's name with the goal of lessening the financial burden faced by future chiropractic students. Two Dr. John H. Porter Jr. Scholarships have since been awarded, with one recent graduate already pursuing a career of service like Porter. For more information, visit sherman.edu.SCHOOL NEWS John H.

The researchers developed a model to test the effectiveness of measures such as physical distancing, masks or social bubbles when used in various settings. Their paper was published Nov. 19 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS). They introduce the concept of \"event R,\" which is the expected number of people who become infected with COVID-19 from one individual at an event. Tupper and Colijn look at factors such as transmission intensity, duration of exposure, the proximity of individuals and degree of mixing \u2014 then examine what methods are most effective at preventing transmission in each circumstance. The researchers incorporated data from reports of outbreaks at a range of events, such as parties, meals, nightclubs, public transit and restaurants. The researchers say that an individual's chances of becoming infected with COVID-19 depend heavily on the transmission rate and the duration \u2014 the amount of time spent in a particular setting. The model suggests that physical distancing was effective at reducing COVID- 19 transmission in all settings, but the effectiveness of social bubbles depends on whether chances of transmission are high or low.

Still helping out their neighbors during the global health pandemic, Habitat and NYCC students worked together to follow health guidelines and take extra precautions. For safety measures, most of the work this fall has been outside and volunteers wear masks and make sure to sanitize often. Sixth-trimester NYCC students are required to do five hours of community service and write a paper to reflect on their time spent volunteering. But for students, it's about more than the community service credit they earn; it's about the feeling of helping people in need and giving back to the community they live and learn in. NYCC students have been volunteering with Habitat for at least eight years. Recent projects in Seneca Falls had some students spreading gravel for a sidewalk at a home on E. Bayard St., while others helped build a shed on Tyler Ave. President of Habitat for Humanity of Seneca County Menzo Case said that student volunteers help them stay on time with their projects. \"Our experience with NYCC students is that they are willing to take on any task \u2014 demolition, building walls, putting in plumbing, wiring, roofing, you name it! They bring with them a willingness to learn and patience to work with both skilled and unskilled volunteers and family members,\" Case said.

Accessed May 8, 2020. https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/27-04-2020-who-timeline---covid-19AMERICA HAS SEEN TWO VIRAL PANDEMICS IN THE LAST CENTURY OR SO. The one that lives in many of our minds is the rapid spread of the coronavirus now known as COVID-19. First reported on Dec. 31, 2019, in Wuhan, China,1 this virus has made \"social distancing\" and \"safer at home\" common, everyday terms. The other occurred in 1918 and was caused by the H1N1 virus. That pandemic, which has since been dubbed the Spanish Flu, is credited with at least 50 million deaths worldwide, 650,000 of which were in the U.S.2 Add to this the thousands of deaths that occur annually from the latest flu3 and many people are now fearing when the next big viral infection could potentially hit. Who is most at risk of having not only more severe cases of influenza, but also of potentially dying from these bugs? At-risk demographics The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that those most at risk of developing flu-related complications and death include:4 \u0084Adults 65 and older \u0084People residing in a nursing home or long-term care facility \u0084Women who are pregnant \u0084Young children (under the age of two), especially those with neurologic conditions \u0084People with medical conditions that weaken their immune system, such as asthma, diabetes or cancer \u0084Those with body mass indexes (BMIs) that are 40 or higher \u0084Certain demographics, including American Indians and Alaska Natives Concerns over the impact that viruses can have on wellness have caused many Americans to look for ways to protect their own health. Based on the data, it appears that supplements are one of the preferred preventive choices. A spike in supplement use In the year preceding March 8, 2020, supplement sales increased roughly 6%.5 Yet, the sales growth for the week of March 8 alone \u2014 when the World Health Organization reported that concern about the coronavirus began to really ramp up6 \u2014 was 35%. Immune System Edit Series 18 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JANUARY 17, 2021 CHIROECO.COMMany of the products purchased during this timeframe are designed to target the immune system. On the list was vitamin C, vitamin D, and, the nutrient with the biggest one-week increase at 255%, zinc. Research has linked all of these vitamins and minerals to improved immunity. But one question we must ask is what are some of the most common reasons a person's immune system would be weakened? Top immune system threats Stress is one, with the American Institute of Stress reporting that 77% of the population reports that their levels of stress regularly manifest into physical symptoms such as fatigue, headache, upset stomach and muscle tension.7 Another immune system threat is not getting enough sleep. When you don't get ample rest, your body is unable to produce the number of cytokines necessary to protect itself from infection and inflammation. For some people, the problem lies with a poor diet. They aren't giving their body the nutrients it needs to function efficiently. Others are unable to store the nutrients taken in, resulting in a poorer immune response. Helping patients build immunity There are many dietary supplements you can recommend to patients who are most at risk of developing complications due to a viral infection and interested in bolstering their immunity. Some of the most beneficial include: Vitamin C - A 2017 article published in Nutrients shares that vitamin C boosts immunity by supporting cell-level function of the innate and adaptive immune systems.8 It also strengthens the skin's ability to fight off environmental pathogens. Vitamin D - Also in 2017, the BMJ published results of a meta- analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials involving 11,321 participants.9 After looking at the data, researchers noted that this vitamin helps protect against respiratory infections. Zinc - Research links zinc deficiency with severe immune dysfunction.10 Why? Its antioxidant properties aid in immune cell development and communication. It also plays an important role in inflammatory response. Melatonin - Melatonin is known for helping people get better sleep. Studies show that this nutrient also enhances the body's production of cytokines, ultimately boosting immunity.11 Curcumin - The immune system naturally increases inflammation to help the body heal. When this inflammation is long-lasting, it can be harmful. Curcumin helps reduce this type of inflammation by downregulating proinflammatory cytokines.12 As we continue to learn more about COVID-19, it's possible that more supplements will be added to this list. In the meantime, suggesting that patients start with these can help them better protect themselves against many different viruses, the coronavirus included, in addition to a healthy lifestyle. 7 \"What is stress?\" The American Institute of Stress.

COVID AND IMMUNITY: FOCUS ON THE HOST You can't control the virus, but you can control the host BY ROBERT G. SILVERMAN, DC, DACBN, MIN. AS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC CONTINUES INTO 2021, a strong immune system remains crucial for avoiding infection or fighting it off efficiently should it occur. Unfortunately, many Americans entered the pandemic with immune systems that were already weakened \u2014 combined with the failure to implement necessary infection prevention measures consistently. This population group is at high risk for infection, severe possible illness and long-term impacts. CHIROECO.COM JANUARY 17, 2021 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 21FEATURE STORY The immunity issue Healthy people have robust immune systems. In our society, 72% of the population is overweight or obese \u2014 an epidemic within the pandemic. These Americans are more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection because a primary pathway for the virus to enter the body is through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the surface of cells in the lungs, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, liver, gastrointestinal tract, brain, epithelial cells and fat cells. The primary role of ACE2 in the body is to break down angiotensin II (ANG II), a protein that increases blood pressure and inflammation. The SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to ACE2 receptors like a key into a lock. When the virus occupies the receptors, the effect of the enzyme on ANG II is blunted, leading to tissue injury, including damage to the epithelial cells that line blood vessels. Because fat cells have even more ACE2 receptors than lung cells, those with high adipose tissue levels are more likely to be infected. Once they are infected, they are more likely to need hospitalization, intensive care and possible intubation. They also have a higher risk of becoming \"long-haulers,\" people who have persistent ongoing symptoms from COVID-19. Although older adults, in general, are more likely to become severely ill with COVID-19, obese younger adults are just as much at risk. Obesity and COVID-19 Why is obesity at any age such a severe risk? Obese people may already have compromised respiratory function before infec - tion. At the same time, abdominal obesity can compress the diaphragm, lungs and chest capacity, reducing the lungs' ability to mobilize. Most significantly, obesity causes chronic low-grade inflammation and an increase in circulating proinflammatory cytokines. Preexisting inflammation plays a significant role in the worst COVID-19 outcomes. In addition to the widespread prevalence of overweight and obesity, roughly 6 of 10 Americans have an underlying chronic illness, such as metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes, that causes chronic low-grade inflammation. Chronic conditions related to excess weight are so common that only about 12% of adult Americans are metabolically healthy. The impact of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes on COVID-19 is apparent. Inadequately controlled blood sugar is a significant risk for more severe illness, increased need for medical interventions, and possible death. Neurological symptoms Those who need hospitalization for COVID-19 are very likely to suffer neurological complications during their illness. In one recent study of 509 patients hospitalized at the Chicago-based Northwestern Medicine health system, 82% developed neuro - logic symptoms, including muscle pain, headaches, dizziness, encephalopathy and brain fog. Altered brain function and encephalopathy affected 30% of the patients. The death rate in patients with encephalopathy was about 22%. The neurological impacts in COVID-19 have several potential causes. It's possible that the exaggerated cytokine response triggered by COVID-19 is to blame. Also possible, or in addition, In one recent study of 509 COVID-19 patients, 82% developed neurologic symptoms, including muscle pain, headaches, dizziness, encephalopathy and brain fog. CHRONIC CONDITIONS RELATED TO EXCESS WEIGHT ARE SO COMMON THAT ONLY ABOUT 12% OF ADULT AMERICANS ARE METABOLICALLY HEALTHY. 22 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JANUARY 17, 2021 CHIROECO.COMIn combining soothing botanicals with powerful antibacterial elements, we have perfected our original alcohol-based hand sanitizer that is tough on germs, yet gentle on your skin!

And because ACE2 receptors are found abundantly in the brain, including in the cerebral cortex, they may play a role in the cognitive deficits many patients develop. As the long-term neurologic and cognitive impacts of COVID-19 become more apparent, we're learning that brain fog doesn't only affect hospitalized patients. Whether or not they were hospitalized or were even seriously ill, any COVID-19 patient may experience a similar range of neurological problems, notably brain fog. Chiropractic and supplemental care for COVID-19 Chiropractic care is incredibly valuable for supporting the immune system and the central nervous system while attenu - ating the neurological manifestations of COVID-19. In the long run, weight loss and glycemic control are essential for reducing chronic inflammation and improving immunity. Amid a pandemic, however, at-risk patients need immediate, actionable steps to build immunity. A good starting point is immune-boosting supplements. Based on recent studies, patients who have been exposed to COVID-19 or have active infections should begin dosing with vitamin D3 or increase their dose to achieve a blood level of at least 30 ng/mL. A recent JAMA study looked at nearly 500 patients who had their vitamin D level measured in the year before taking a COVID-19 test. The relative risk of testing positive for COVID-19 was 1.77 times greater for patients with likely low vitamin D status than patients with possible, sufficient vitamin D status. Another recent study showed that of 191,000 patients positive for COVID-19, being deficient in vitamin D raised the risk of infection by 54.5%. Another potent antiviral supplement that may be particularly helpful against the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), found most abundantly in green tea. EGCG has been shown to bind to molecular docking sites on the virus and inactivate it. The hormone melatonin, often used as a sleep aid, also has powerful antiviral effects. A recent study showed that people who took melatonin supplements were 28% less likely to test positive for COVID-19. Other studies suggest that melatonin limits virus-related diseases and could be beneficial in COVID-19 patients, particularly for obese patients with type 2 diabetes, who are at high risk of severe illness and death. Curcumin, omega-3 benefits Curcumin, one of the polyphenolic compounds found in the spice turmeric, may help prevent and treat viral infection. Turmeric has long been used in Ayurvedic medicine as an antibiotic and antiviral. Recent research suggests that curcumin may prevent the SARS-CoV-2 virus from binding to the ACE2 receptor. This may be particularly helpful for avoiding organ damage to the kidneys and heart. Curcumin may also help prevent lung inflammation and damage by inhibiting inflammatory cytokines. Pro-resolving mediators, or PRMs, represent a portion of the omega-3 fatty acid spectrum that significantly reduces inflammation. PRMs downregulate inflammation without suppressing it. This helps the body maintain an effective immune response while potentially warding off the dangerous cytokine storm response that can be fatal in COVID-19 infection. Amid a pandemic, at-risk patients need immediate, actionable steps to build immunity. A good starting point is immune-boosting supplements. 6 OF 10 AMERICANS WITH AN UNDERLYING CHRONIC ILLNESS, SUCH AS METABOLIC SYNDROME OR TYPE 2 DIABETES. 24 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JANUARY 17, 2021 CHIROECO.COMREACH THEM WHEREVER THEY ARE FOR Stay in touch with your existing patients.

Brain fog, memory problems and headaches from COVID-19 neurological impacts can often be helped with lifestyle changes similar to the usual recommendations for chronic fatigue syndrome conditions. My recommendations include: A brain-healthy diet rich in leafy greens and omega-3 fatty acids Regular mild to moderate physical activity Stress reduction Sufficient or improved sleep Prebiotics and probiotics for improved gut health Help patients control the host While you can't control the virus, you can control the host. Lifestyle improvements should be strongly encouraged, in cluding a healthy, anti-inflammatory diet that is mostly plant- based. Those with metabolic issues should be helped to learn ways to control their glycemic load. In addition to all its other benefits, regular exercise has been shown to raise the production of the natural antioxidant extracellular superoxide dismutase (EcSOD), which helps prevent or reduce the severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). According to the CDC, between 20-42% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 will develop ARDS; approximately 45% of patients who develop severe ARDS will die. The disruption and stress of the pandemic have led to sleep problems for many. Because insufficient sleep disrupts the immune system by reducing the production of virus-fighting immune cells and proteins, adequate sleep is crucial for immune support. Patients should be aware of the importance of good sleep, and issues should be addressed with natural treatments. As chiropractors, we are best-suited to teach, coach and support our patient base toward these significant health- improving modifications. ROBERT G.

WITH 2021 HAVING FINALLY ARRIVED, and as we're adapting to the \"new normal,\" some things are not going to be all that new. Studies have shown that about 60% of Americans will have made a New Year's resolution. However, only a third of that population thinks achieving their goal will be an actual reality. Their honesty is appreciated ... but why go into anything with the mindset of failure? History shows that by February, 80% will have given up on their resolution. Congratulations are in order for the 8% who actually achieve their goal of maintaining their New Year's resolution. Finances and health are the top two categories for New Year's resolutions. The top New Year's resolutions for health are exercising, eating better and losing weight. Many will fail at achieving their goals, no matter what they may be. 28 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JANUARY 17, 2021 CHIROECO.COM*THESE STATEMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION.

A trainer is a great resource of accountability, as well as instruction. However, you, the chiropractor, are more vital. Health vs. wellness It's also important to help patients understand the difference between health and wellness. In short, health is a state of being, whereas wellness is the state of living a healthy life - style. Health refers to physical, mental and social well-being; wellness aims to enhance all those aspects. Wellness is an all-encompassing journey, not so much a fixed destination. Today's society yearns for wellness. The very foundation of chiropractic is of a complete wellness mindset. We are the only profession truly grounded in this principle. However, many patients will seek their new goals without our guidance. Speak up and inform patients you can help them actually achieve their goals by being S.M.A.R.T.E.R. Linking the kinetic chain What if you told your patients that every step and move they make could be helping their physical condition by activating their kinetic chain optimally? What if you told them that every step and move they make would be active rehab toward better posture, and every step and move they make would be fighting the constant impact of gravity; that with every step and move they make, they can overcome the negative impact of their physical repetitive stressors, whatever they may be, whether caused by work and/or their personal life? Adding onto this, what if you told your patients from the very beginning with complete confidence that with every step and move they make, they could have better balance, fewer injuries, improved strength, quicker healing time, more flexibility, and enhanced performance with an accelerated recovery? After hearing these profound and powerful statements of truth, most patients are intrigued, to say the least. Now you can educate them on how this is attainable. Share with them, \"The goal of the body is to keep your head straight.\" As we view our surroundings, more specifically the event horizon, we see straight lines. With that being said, we are typically standing Today's society yearns for wellness. The very foundation of chiropractic is of a complete wellness mindset.

Ideally, the feet and head are even, which means something in the middle has to give and will act/react to balance an imbalance. The feet are the foundation of the body. Negative effects of repetitive stress on the body are something everyone encounters. If deemed necessary, custom orthotics allow you to achieve a healthier gait by activating the kinetic chain properly. Even though custom orthotics are placed into your shoes, they actually influence all of the moving parts in your body; when your feet are properly stabilized, the rest of your body moves with greater ease and harmony. Orthotics greatly assist posture. If you are someone who slumps a great deal or favors one side over another, wearing orthotics with three-arch support will help correct your posture and movements. In our technological society, being able to assess dysfunction qualitatively and quantitatively is powerful. Scanning the entire foot 3-D foot scanning technology allows patients to understand the imbalances they may have and the impact those imbalances have on their body. Over- the-counter insoles initially cost less, but they only support one arch in the foot. If dysfunction is noted in either of the two remaining arches, over-the-counter insoles could actually cause more harm than good. Certain digital foot scanning technologies allow patients to immediately see their imbalances. You can build on that by educating them on how those imbalances affect their kinetic chain. Institute a program to educate your patients to be S.M.A.R.T.E.R. with their New Year's resolutions. Now is the time for you to develop relationships with as many personal trainers as you can. Recently, this industry has been hit hard. I recommend a three-month \"jump-start\" program. A unified front will make your patients feel more secure, as well as value your efforts for their care. The benefits are exponential for your practice. Your patients will appreciate you. Help patients jump back in Remember, the majority of the popu - lation who actually made a New Year's resolution is about to give up or already has. Now is the time to be proactive. Create a program after the fact, so they can jump right back in, but this time with your guidance. This will empower you and your office. Your patients will appreciate your active role in their care. Developing a program does not have to be difficult, especially if you have already established sound relationships with your local trainers. Provide weekly adjustments to make sure the patient's body is in line for the exercise program they're starting. Weekly adjustments will help their body adapt to new orthotics that much faster. Also, you can answer any questions they may have on diet modifications and make recommendations for supplementation. This can be something fun that you and your office develop, and it is very easy to implement. Your patients are already looking for this and just need your help so that they can achieve their goals by being S.M.A.R.T.E.R.

In my office, using a weight scale and a bioelectrical impedance analysis device is up there with the blood pressure cuff and pulse oxim - eter. Certain measurements I want on every patient. Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA), a method of assessing your body composition and measurement of body fat in relation to lean body mass, is an integral part of a health and nutrition assessment. It may be used to assess: Body composition (estimate) Fluid balance/distribution Cellular performance (cellular health analysis) The information it provides such as body composition, fluid distribution and phase angle help guide many of my treatment decisions. This test can be performed as often as necessary to document changes in body fat, lean muscle mass and phase angle. There is a code \u2014 A4556 BIA Electrodes (2 sets @ 15 each) \u2014 to bill and charge for the test/service. Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis for health and longevity BIA is a non-invasive, inexpensive and quick method to esti - mate body composition. Helping patients lose fat weight is something I particularly enjoy because obesity reduces a lifespan by 8-20 years. Improving a person's body composition is a health and longevity upgrade. One of the most interesting discoveries of my career has been the recognition that adipocytes (fat cells) produce inflammatory cytokines. Many patients come in complaining of multiple joint aches and pains; often these patients are 5-10% overweight, and this contributes to low-grade systemic inflammatory disease. Their joints are \"smoldering\" and need anti-inflammatory care. The \"overweight epidemic\" led me to hire a full-time person for fat loss, which complements my musculoskeletal rehab practice. My chiropractic practice includes: Making healthy food choices Preventing chronic disease formation Improving body composition Reducing body fat storage Increasing lean muscle mass Reducing inflammation Improving blood sugar management Reducing hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia Increasing exercise and physical activity via gentle movement therapy and strength training to prevent sarcopenia (loss of muscle) 34 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JANUARY 17, 2021 CHIROECO.COMBenefits of Mineralgia Safe, every day, long lasting relief from acute and chronic pain No Animal Testing, Vegan, Gluten and Paraben Free Wholesale pricing enables the doctor of chiropractic to sell the cream at a significant profit Can be used pre treatment or post treatment to increase efficacy of chiropractic adjustment and overall client satisfaction (800) 757-7582 info@mineralgia.com www.mineralgia.com/pages/wholesale GET YOURFREE SAMPLE TODAY!

Body Mass Index (BMI) BMI is commonly used as an index of body composition; however, it is not useful for measuring percentage of body fat or lean body mass. Patients with normal BMI may have sarco - penia or sarcopenic obesity. \"Weight and BMI do not evaluate body compartments and therefore do not reveal if weight changes result in loss of fat-free mass or gain in fat mass,\" ( J Amer Diet Assoc 2002;102(7):944-955). However, BIA is a reliable resource for assessing body composition, hydration status, tissue differentiation and cell membrane integrity, providing instantaneous in-office information. Why is body composition and BMI associated with increased risks? Because muscle mass is the #1 biomarker of aging . Hence, the higher the muscle mass the greater the longevity. Maintaining muscle mass is important for healthy aging and preventing: Sarcopenia Obesity Heart disease Type 2 diabetes Osteoporosis Measuring muscle mass improves patient motivation to put it on.On a cellular level, increased capillary permeability and disturbed cellular membrane metabolism (seen in septic patients) are responsible for extensive shifts in body fluids, expansion of interstitial space and abnormal hydration of the lipophilic part of the cellular membrane. A rapid change or inconsistent alteration in BIA test results may be due to hydration status, technical problems, or an effect from physiologic events (e.g. menstruation, irregular eating, exercise, skin temperature, etc.). Therefore, with repeat tests I try to do them around the same time and same day of the week. Tests can easily be performed on a weekly basis. Resistance Resistance is related to the body fluids (water and electrolytes) primarily in lean body mass (high-conducive, low-resistance pathways). It is the opposition of total body water (fluids) and electrolytes contained primarily in the body lean mass to the flow of an alternating current of low amplitude and high frequency (800 uA and 50 KHz). Resistance will change according to hydration status and is a reliable tool for accurate fluid management ( Surgery 1992; 112:502-508); ( Clin Nutr 2004;23:1430-1453). The higher the resistance, the greater the dehydration and muscle wasting for those with a low percentage of body water in their reduced lean body mass. A major decrease in resistance is interpreted as a great fluid retention. In a hospital setting among septic patients, those who develop renal failure and positive fluid balance display a direct relationship between body fluid gain in morbidity and mortality ( J Ren Nut 2016:26:391-395). Reactance Reactance is the capacitance produced by tissue interface and cell membrane. Cell membranes consist of a layer of noncon - ductive lipophilic material interposed between two layers of conducive molecules. Progressive reductions in resistance and reactance over successive measurements indicate fluid overload with positive fluid balance; a progressive increase indicates negative fluid balance (Piccoli et al 1995, Ho LT et al 1994).#1 MUSCLE MASS IS THE #1 BIOMARKER OF AGING. Metabolic syndrome is strongly associated with the onset of endothelial dysfunction, which may explain why type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for atherosclerosis. 36 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JANUARY 17, 2021 CHIROECO.COMFULL_Standard-Process-Ad_fnl.pdf 1 2020-11-17 4:35 PMReferences can be found online at chiroeco.com WELLNESS APPROACH Phase angle Phase angle is the ratio of reactance/resistance. Phase angle has been utilized to discriminate between normal subjects and patients, and between septic and non-septic critically ill patients. It indicates alterations in either body composition or in cellular membrane function. Phase angle varies between 3-15 degrees (the average is 5-7). In all of the hundreds of tests I have done over 25 years I rarely see anyone above 10. A low phase angle number (<5) or an unchanged value during a course of treatment suggests the treatment or care is not on the right track. Ott, et al. (1995) used phase angle as an important parameter for monitoring disease progression. Because it is a marker of how resilient the receptor sites are, with cells either living or dying, phase angle has even been used on HIV patients and critically ill patients to monitor progress; increased capillary permeability and disturbed cellular membrane metabolism (seen in septic patients) are responsible for extensive shifts in body fluids, expansion of interstitial space and abnormal hydration of the lipophilic part of the cellular membrane. Cell membranes Cell membranes consisting of a layer of nonconductive lipo - philic material interposed between two layers of conducive molecules behave as capacitors and generate the reactance that reflects alterations of the complex membrane integrity. I'm no electrical engineer, but I see how reactance, capacitance, cell membranes and phase angle are linked. Pro-inflammatory substances such as cytokines are known to affect the cellular membrane metabolism, body water, and presumably the reactance and phase angle. These substances are released in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), let alone severe ARDS or SARS. Alterations in the test may be due to hydration status, technical problems, or effect from physiologic events (e.g. menstruation, irregular eating, exercise, skin temperature, etc.). Try to do the test around the same time and same day of the week. Fat mass The adipose tissue (adipocyte) secretes resistin, which is an adipose tissue-specific factor inducing insulin resistance, linking diabetes mellitus to obesity. Adiponectin is an anti-inflammatory, insulin-sensitizing adipocytokine. Adiposity is a form of chronic, low-grade inflammation. A number of studies have demonstrated that increases in inflammatory mediators like IL-6 and hs-CRP are associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is strongly associated with the onset of endothelial dysfunction, which may explain why type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for atherosclerosis. Body Cell Mass (BCM) BCM is the metabolically active functioning tissue of the body. It is the protein-rich tissue. Loss of BCM (sarcopenia) is asso - ciated with a reduced quality of life, poor immune response, increased biological age, osteoporosis and impaired healing. It takes three times longer to accumulate BCM than to deplete it. To increase BCM you must remove catabolic factors (stress, anxiety, sedentary behaviors, insulin resistance, etc.), increase protein calories and introduce resistance training. Extra-Cellular Mass (ECM) includes fecal matter. Total Body Bioimpedance Analysis (TBBIA) correlates well with other measures of fluid balance, hematocrit and serum protein level (McDonald J.J., 1993). In part two on this topic I will discuss ways to improve cell membrane health. JEFFREY TUCKER , DC, is the current president of the ACA Rehab Council.

Implement these practices to raise your status in the local community. MARKETING MATTERS IF YOU ARE LIKE MOST CHIROPRACTORS you have three big fears \u2014 death, taxes and public speaking. However, I would like to add one more \u2014 marketing. Most chiropractors do not think about it, do not like to do it, and would rather have someone else take care of this crucial responsibility. Yet, if chiropractors are not keen to build business, then there is no patient to treat. It's a catch-22; it's like saying which is more important, the chicken or the egg? Develop a marketing mindset You must alter your mind from where you are today and shift toward business development. Admittedly this is no easy task, but it is imperative to make the shift so that your practice oper - ates from merely surviving to thriving. Think of it this way \u2014 marketing is around you each and every day. From the moment you awake until the moment you fall asleep you are immersed in marketing. You watch the news, open a box of granola, brush your teeth and get dressed. Just that minimal time introduces you to products and services delivered to you or purchased because of marketing and its related activities. Marketing is required to bring valuable BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH A MARKETING MINDSET Whether it's patients or other health care professionals, it should be top-of-mind BY DREW STEVENS TIME TO READ: 10-12 MIN. 40 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JANUARY 17, 2021 CHIROECO.COMMARKETING MATTERS products and services to you. After all, marketing is required to produce the acquisition and retention of patients. Further, marketing helps to provide you the products and services you want as well as need. None of these can happen unless you have a marketing mindset. Marketing is an information exchange meant to establish relationships so that patients understand value. Value in the marketing world, especially for medical professionals, is the relationship and trust built around the benefits of care and the sacrifice(s) necessary for the patient to receive these benefits. Value is not about quality, priority or anything else other than a set of philosophical and psychological inferences that create practice processes implementing patient satisfaction. And, in order to establish the set of processes, marketing uses a series of activities to institutionalize this philosophical attitude into the practice. Therefore, marketing requires a new mindset or quality, setting expectations, value, information, communication, feedback, idea exchange, and most importantly, patient service. The business of relationships A key aspect of the marketing mindset is building relation - ships. You are in the health care profession but pragmatically, to grow a thriving practice, you are in the business of relation - ships. To help nurture and grow your practice requires daily involvement with activities that bring you further into your local community so that your practice grows. More important than advertising, the key to establishing a practice based on value is relationships. Better-than-average chiropractors will help differentiate themselves by creating relationships to build distinction with the prospective patient. For example, one might argue that health care is a commodity business much like buying eggs at a local grocer or obtaining a haircut at a local barber. However, there is a reason why prospective patients shop in certain places \u2014 relationships. We can argue that there are some services such as laser, acupuncture, etc., that aid a practice because they are distinctive products and services. We might even argue that certain doctors can differentiate based on price, but the marketing mindset requires more of an intangible than tangible. Patients align products and services with a fee, therefore the value they associate is the exchange of the fee for the value (benefit) received. Coincidentally, this is the definition of selling. But suffice to say that the fee is related to the tangible gain. Therefore, these are commodities and they pay a fee. The doctor who is into relationships and creates a marketing mindset is different. The best patients do not associate a relationship and trust with a fee; its value is incalculable. Relationships, then, are intrinsic and no amount of money can be placed on trust and respect, and prospective patients would not dare place a fee on them. These relationships then become lifelong, downplaying barriers of resistance while also creating more awareness and brand for the doctor. Placing distinction in your marketing mindset To help you foster relationships, understand that personality and behavior must also be part of your overall systems. For example, I can take two different chiropractors and place them into the same medical professionals program. They attend the same classes, get the same grades, and even get the same grade on the exam. However, their relationships with patients are different based on their innate skills. There is nothing better for growing a profitable practice than a trusting patient who wants and needs your services. They believe in their heart you will get them out of immediate pain and mitigate that issue from returning. This is something not easily achieved by others \u2014 and this relationship must be guarded as if it is the Hope Diamond or Crown Jewels. Arguing with patients, treating them poorly, not returning calls; anything can sour a relationship that took years to build. Creating a mindset is not only worth it, it is the \"must\" of your practice. When you develop a mindset of value, of relationship and of desire, you build a wealth of opportunities both now and in the future. The 7 laws of building relationships with a marketing mindset Many will suggest relationship-building is based on personality and behavior. In fact, social scientists for years offered droves of research on how personality and behavior impact research. However, there are other areas that affect the manner in which people interact. More importantly, the following laws are concepts that must be top-of-mind as chiropractors seek to build trusting, long-lasting relationships with their prospective patients. There is too much competition and the internet makes it too easy to find another doctor or another way to ease back pain or stiffness. 42 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JANUARY 17, 2021 CHIROECO.COMProven outcomes Faster treatment times Better for your bottom line 2101ADDC MARKETING MATTERS 1. The Law of Value \u2014 With a wealth of competition, patients seek value so as to mitigate time and expense in seeking proper help. Value is the benefit patients receive from the trust and respect for service. In today's competitive market, value provides intrinsic fees for services as well as the differentiation of services. When chiropractors build value-based relationships there is a strong defense against most competitive pressures. 2. The Law of Constant Contact \u2014 Social media and relationship management software allow a multitude of ways to constantly remain in contact with present and former patients. Although trite, apply the saying, \"out of sight, out of mind.\" There is too much competition and the internet makes it too easy to find another doctor or another way to ease back pain or stiffness. When you remain in constant contact you offer differentiation from the doctor down the street, but also remain top-of-mind when patients require your services. 3. The Law of Testimonials and Case Study \u2014 There are times when contrary methods work better than conventional. Many doctors develop websites, blogs, Facebook pages, etc., telling stories and facts related to care. Many of these are not only ubiquitous in tone but also very prescriptive and do little for trust. Prospective patients desire to hear more about your care. With that in mind, it is best to collect and integrate into your marketing as many testimonials and case studies as possible. The implications include former patients boasting of your former efforts to new patients who desire to know how you can help them. Additionally, patients actually want to hear from others because the \"word of mouth\" marketing helps decrease barriers and build higher levels of trust and respect. 4. The Law of Short-term Transactions \u2014 If you are like many, your phone rings incessantly from cold callers who want to sell you goods you have little need for. Not only are these calls intrusive, they are transactional. Each person on the call is only interested in one thing \u2014 getting you to say yes to something before the end of the call. Doctors cannot perform in this manner. Each interaction, from meeting at a networking event to perhaps the report of findings, builds the trust factor. Each discussion helps continue discussion, which develops the relationship to influence the business aspects. The more chiropractors think of relationship continuance, the better for longer-term practice success. 5. The Law of Availability \u2014 Health care is a service-based business and most business in the United States is service. Yet The more chiropractors think of relationship continuance, the better for longer-term practice success.

There are too many in health care that conduct business similarly. Our \"mystery shops\" never cease to surprise our business in the different ways patients are often ignored. Therefore, be patient-service savvy. Ensure that all aspects of your practice engage in this important art to help you retain your most vital asset. 6. The Law of Community \u2014 Building community is a large factor for patient value. When others in the community know you more, they understand your practice, your methods and your values, and want to know you better. The only way to ensure that others know of your value is to get into the world and express it. Some of the best ways to assist you here will be getting involved in local community activities such as religious, athletic and civic. Many of these take very little time and money and will make you the \"Vicar of Value\" because of the awareness such volunteerism brings. You might make contributions, sponsor a local event or even offer to mail envelopes or lick stamps. No matter your involvement, large or small, your stewardship will be rewarding.7. The Law of Recommended Resources \u2014 Doctors need not always be the dictionary of answers. Being a valuable resource for additional health and wellness information will make you more valued with patients. They will honor the information you provide and appreciate your concern for their welfare. This alone will create in you a valuable asset. Be consistent, and relentless In order to prove successful and be a sustainable practice, it's crucial that your marketing is consistent and relentless. Research has proven that those chiropractors who continually practice marketing processes are much more successful. If you want a long-standing, profitable practice, take some time each day to implement some of these principles to improve your earnings, your revenues and your financial future.

Earlier in 2020, FCA made the decision to postpone its annual August convention to be able to provide the safest possible environment with proper social distancing and hygiene protocols. FCA put together a Safe Space 2020 Safe + Clean Plan, coupled with the Hyatt Regency Orlando's new Global Cleanliness Standards, to ensure the best possible well-being of all attendees. Vendors and attendees alike shared their delight at being able to gather safely in person. The Hyatt Regency Orlando brought back hundreds of veteran employees to facilitate this event, and they performed flawlessly. The premier event for chiropractic attracted some 2,000 attendees to its new hybrid format, including chiropractors, staff, students, notable speakers and exhibitors. While the event looked a little different, attendees still enjoyed the powerful energy and all the benefits they are accustomed to \u2014 150 hours of CEs to choose from, internationally-recognized speakers, various tracks and specialties, a 200-booth expo and more. New additions this year included a full virtual exposition and educational program which enabled classmates to engage with live learning in a whole new way. One attendee shared, \"I have been teaching remotely since March 16 and the FCA did just as well as the university I teach for in delivery of virtual or remote courses. Thank you!\"As a top meeting hub for the industry, the Foundation for Chiropractic Progress chose The National to debut one of five 30-second commercials that will be broadcast to shine a light on chiropractic during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. All were inspired and the commercial ignited great applause, drawing resounding jubilation from the crowd. As always, national leadership groups were also present and used The National as a meeting place, including The Summit, Foundation for Chiropractic Progress, Congress of Chiropractic State Associations and Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards. \"A big shout-out to our 2020 presenters who combined science with passion and provided practitioner action steps everyone could implement on Monday morning,\" said FCA President Brian Bickerton, DC. Whether in-person or virtual, The National provides each attendee a personal and custom experience that can't be found anywhere else. This is a top reason, attendees say, for coming year after year and why this event continues to stand strong, even in these times of challenge, to serve you best.

THE TAKEAWAY A weight-loss practitioner with more than two decades' experience offers proven ways to begin conversations and help overweight patients experience weight-loss success \u2014 and also add an additional revenue stream(s) to your practice. IT'S A NEW YEAR and you are positioned perfectly to help your overweight patients lose weight! It all begins with one respectful and caring conversation. As you are aware, about 70% of adult Americans are overweight (BMI >25) and of these, nearly 40% are considered obese (BMI >30). This extra weight puts them at risk for developing heart disease, type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, stroke and certain cancers.1 It has also been confirmed that being obese increases the risk of serious illness from COVID-192 \u2014 not to mention the adverse effects on their musculoskeletal system which you treat every day in your practice. If this wasn't enough, obesity and being overweight are the second leading preventable cause of death in the U.S.3 Weight loss success statistics Many will attempt weight loss on their own this year and hope - fully be successful. However, studies show that approximately 80% of people who make New Year's resolutions fail by the beginning of February, and sustained weight loss failure statis - tics are even worse. This serious epidemic requires the attention of all health care professionals with the desire, knowledge and skill to help make a difference. Especially since even modest, sustained weight loss of 5-10% can improve their overweight patients' health and reduce their comorbid risks. And yet, the conversation and effective treatment can be daunting and difficult, mainly due to potential barriers such as: Being unsure of how to begin the conversation Limited time to spend with each patient Minimal obesity training Inadequate resources for effective comprehensive counseling and treatment Fear of adversely affecting your provider-patient relationship Let's tackle this together. After working with weight-loss practitioners and overweight patients for nearly two decades, here are some proven ways to overcome these issues and effectively bridge the gap from initial conversation to helping your overweight patients experience weight-loss success with the potential added benefit of adding additional revenue stream(s) into your practice. 50 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JANUARY 17, 2021 CHIROECO.COM The End to Shrinking Reimbursement The End to Working Harder for Less Money Strong Reimbursement Low/No Competition Grateful, Under-Served Patients No Caps on Necessary Treatment Doctor Makes All Decisions Call 813-368-2184 or visit www.JoinFICFranchise.com for more informationChanging Lives of Patients and Chiropractors Be part of a fast-growing franchise that is helping meet needs in an under-served market nationwide.

Patients are often embarrassed to discuss their weight or sometimes tend to overcompensate with laughter or jokes. Ensuring your entire team is aware and respectful of such feelings will help your patients feel comfortable from their first phone call to your office and throughout their entire patient care experience. In addition, your office environment can help set you up for successful conversations. Having waiting room chairs that can support higher weight (without arms); a higher-capacity scale that is in a private area; pedestal toilets instead of wall-mounted; larger gowns as necessary in addition to any patient care equipment (i.e. blood pressure cuffs, massage and treatment tables) that can accommodate patients weighing 300+ pounds. Finally, avoiding such words as \"fat\" and \"obese\" is helpful as these carry negative connotations. Utilizing \"overweight\" or referring to BMI is typically better received. Bottom line, as with everyone (myself included), your overweight patients just want to be understood and cared for in a compassionate, accepting and pleasant way. They want to belong and feel as if they are being heard in a non-discriminatory way. They want to be respected and treated fairly without bias. Starting the conversation The first step is to get permission to talk about excess weight. Lack of permission can be viewed as being insensitive and potentially rude. You can broach the topic in a variety of ways, such as linking it to a problem or symptom they present with at the time of their visit or politely asking directly. Here are some examples: 5-10% MODEST WEIGHT REDUCTION THAT CAN IMPROVE OVERWEIGHT PATIENTS' HEALTH AND REDUCE COMORBID RISKS 52 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JANUARY 17, 2021 CHIROECO.COM \"Having excess weight can contribute to the pain you are experiencing. With your permission, can we talk about how weight management might help you with your pain?\" \"Helping you with your overall health is an important goal of mine. With your permission, can we talk about your weight today?\" Starting the conversation in this way can be an effective gateway to assess their concerns and goals. This will help you establish your plan of care and provide you with information to inspire them to consider beginning their weight-loss journey and help keep them motivated as they continue with their plan of care. Establishing a weight-loss plan The issue is much more than \"eating less and moving more\" \u2014 advice that often causes more harm than good. And at the risk of great debate and potential criticism, the weight-loss plan that is best for your patient is the one they can commit to doing (and does no harm). I have my own views regarding adequate protein/low carb; keto; intermittent fasting; VLCD; LCD; vegan; gluten-free and other available plans. However, no matter what, there must be a balance that is sustainable for your patient as well as comprehensive (i.e. nutrition, behavior and fitness-based) for long-term success. In addition, you must keep your patient engaged and accountable for best results. This may sound daunting and confusing, but the end goal can be accomplished in a variety of ways. Let's explore the options: 1. Create your own comprehensive weight-loss program that includes patient education, 1:1 coaching/accountability, behavior modification and fitness recommendations with or without insurance. It has never been as easy to create programs that are easily accessible online, on-site or as WELLNESS APPROACH Be sure to communicate with the patient's primary care provider.

Be sure to communicate with the patient's primary care provider. This increases your reach/exposure and demonstrates that you are committed to an optimal outcome for your patient. It is important to understand that if your patient isn't offered weight-loss support (or high-quality nutritional products) from you, they will seek it from another source, even if sub-standard. Make it engaging Adding weight-loss products and services can be a way to help your patients as well as create additional profitable revenue streams to your practice. From product sales to online programs and on-site support, the options are many. The important thing is to offer services that are effective, keep your patients engaged (and coming back) as well as create an ongoing referral source for you and your practice. Ongoing communication, marketing and motivation has never been as easy as it is today. Effective utilization of social media, weekly emails, text messaging and on-site promotion makes promotion of your services and products easy and very affordable. Your overweight patients trust you and need you now more than ever. It all begins with a conversation.

STARTING A NEW PRACTICE CAN BE BOTH EXCITING AND NERVE-WRACKING. The truth is, opening your own chiropractic practice requires a lot of guts. Sometimes being naive is a good thing, but when it comes to being able to pay the bills so you can take care of yourself while continuing to help more people, being prepared is a smart thing to do. Here's the Ultimate Guide to Opening a New Chiropractic Office: 1. Business plan and clear differentiator Every endeavor in life requires some sort of planning. Starting a new practice is no different than starting a new business. A practice needs to have an end goal, and the business plan sets a clear path for how to reach that goal. Be clear about your stance and purpose. What do you want your practice to stand for? What do you want to change about the health care system? A solid plan includes the purpose of your practice, including your mission, vision and values.The mission statement is one of the most essential things to be established before starting a chiropractic clinic, as it is going to be what sets the practice apart. Display it prominently and communicate it throughout everything you do with your verbal and written marketing. Do your market analysis and research An important part of a business plan is the market analysis. This includes conducting a thorough research of the area to choose a good location. A few key questions to answer are: \u0084Who is your ideal client? The depth of clarity that's important here is not just people with \"back pain and neck pain.\" Go deeper; describe the kind of person who would find this to be a pressing problem. It will be easier for you to attract patients this way. 56 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JANUARY 17, 2021 CHIROECO.COMPRACTICE CENTRAL \u0084What are their demographics? \u0084What is the competition doing? What is the patient experience like in other nearby clinics? Call surrounding clinics to get a sense of what they offer and what they charge, plus how phones are answered. \u0084What can you do to make the experience better (smoother, efficient, more friendly, work in your flair)? \u0084What is your competitive advantage? \u0084What's a great location with good foot traffic, visibility from the street, or in an area where other similar practices or medical practices are? Why be in an area where there are other practices? It means there's a need in that area. Alternatively, you can open up a practice where there are few or no other practices, but do your research to see if this is due to a lack of interest in chiropractic and the likelihood of more of an uphill battle to convince people to come. Answering these questions will help you avoid running into problems associated with them later. Management and operations Who is going to be on your team? What kind of staff do you need and in what order? How do you plan on managing your staff and developing your leadership skills? Many chiropractors start off as solo practitioners, but there are shortfalls to this approach. An important part of a business plan is the market analysis. This includes conducting a thorough research of the area to choose a good location. 58 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JANUARY 17, 2021 CHIROECO.COMPRACTICE CENTRAL 2. Financial Planning Starting a new office has costs associated with it, and what needs to be determined is how the costs are going to be covered. Once the business plan has been outlined and you determine how you are going to treat patients, it gets easier to solve this part of the equation. Start-up costs Start-up costs are the expenses incurred during the process of opening a new office. A quick Google search will show you that to start a new practice, you need a nice round figure of $100,000. This doesn't include monthly variable cost, wages, insurance, license renewal, rent, utilities, marketing costs, EHR/EMR, billing systems, etc. How do you make money? As health professionals, we go into this line of work to try to help as many people as we can. You won't find many chiro - practors who are doing it for the \"money.\" Not answering this question will lead to the practice's failure, rendering your goal of helping people futile. The quickest way to answer this question is by performing a break-even analysis. This will tell you exactly what you need to do in order to make your money back on your initial investment. The formula to follow is pretty simple: Break-Even Point = Fixed Costs/(Average Price \u2014 Variable Costs) Overestimating the amount of start-up capital needed is reasonable, as it can take some time before the practice begins to bring in sustainable income.Funding Chiropractors who are interested in opening a new office will be running a business. And just like any other business, it requires funding. This can prove difficult, especially if one has already racked up some tuition debt. Look into payment options that could make debt more manageable, including refinancing your school loans. Another way is partners or other sources of investments. A solid, complete pro forma can show investors why your practice is worth investing in and outline your funding requirements. Sometimes it may even be cheaper to buy into a practice that is growing or take over from someone who is retiring. 3. The logistics Licensing and registering the business As a DC, you know the kind of licensing you need to practice. If you wish to practice in the U.S., you must first go through the national board exam and go through the state's chiropractic board, in accordance with the laws where you want to practice. Nevertheless, you also need to register the business. The four main types are: Sole proprietorship; Partnership; Limited liability corporation (LLC); and Corporation. Each comes with its own different tax, income and liability impact on your practice. This can protect you from being held personally liable if the office is sued. Consider hiring a professional to do everything for you. Insurance \u2014 Any business, especially one in the line of treating patients and providing health care, is liable to lawsuits. Circumstances can be beyond our control sometimes and may lead to accidents. An insurance policy can protect your practice against these occurrences. Another thing to consider is the coverage to protect your office equipment and furniture, as well as patient records. Taxes \u2014 This is an obvious one, but a new office needs to register for a number of state and federal taxes before it can open for business. To do that, you need to obtain a tax ID, also known as an EIN, a number provided by the IRS to establish a business entity. $100,000 AMOUNT NEEDED TO START A NEW PRACTICE ACCORDING TO GOOGLE, NOT INCLUDING VARIABLE COST, WAGES, INSURANCE, LICENSE RENEWAL, RENT, UTILITIES, MARKETING COSTS, EHR/ EMR, BILLING SYSTEMS, ETC. Overestimating the amount of start-up capital needed is reasonable, as it can take some time before the practice begins to bring in sustainable income. 60 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JANUARY 17, 2021 CHIROECO.COMPRACTICE CENTRAL Big Rewards Low Cost SAVE TIME!

Build the right team for you Finding a new hire can mean great things for your practice, but it has to be the right hire. The ideal people can help your practice grow and run more efficiently and give you the freedom to focus on the aspects of your business that you're truly passionate about. Start by creating a task inventory of all the tasks you need to do in a week. Take note of which tasks you enjoy the most, and which ones are most draining. Those are the tasks you want to delegate to someone else. After growing a recruiting business to seven figures in five years, I have learned that it is equally important to note what you don't want in a hire. This will help improve your screening process and will help find the right people for your team to grow your practice quickly. One hot tip to consider when hiring: Avoid leading questions when you're interviewing so you can identify misalignment of values early on. Ask open-ended questions like: If you could design your workday however you'd like, what would you love to be doing on a typical day? What is important to you in what you are looking for? 5. Market and grow your practice to seven figures While trying to set up a new office and open your doors to new patients, chiropractors sometimes focus too much on promoting their new practice online. It is better to focus on one or two strategies that actually work. An evergreen strategy that will bring in a lot of patients early is collaborating with MDs and swaying them to refer patients to you as the DC to go to in the area. Also, you can bring a lot of attention to your practice through online speaking opportunities such as webinars and podcasts. These tips have helped many practitioners I have worked with grow their practice into six- to seven- figure income. Your unique plan There is no one plan that will work the same for everyone. The beauty of starting a new practice is that you get to create your own path and enjoy the journey. As businessman and activist Vernon Jordan once said, \"You are where you are today because you stand on somebody's shoulders. And wherever you are heading, you cannot get there by yourself. If you stand on the shoulders of others, you have a reciprocal responsi - bility to live your life so that others may stand on your shoulders.\" CHEN YEN is a national speaker and founder of Fill My Holistic Practice, providing introverted visionary chiropractors a step-by- step process and guidance on how to build a six- to seven-figure practice that runs without them.

BY KATHY MIEDEMA TIME TO READ: 9-11 MIN.PRACTICE CENTRAL THE TAKEAWAY Keeping up with rapidly-changing data and health guidelines, and often exceeding what guidelines call for with pre-screening, masks and cleaning can keep chiropractic offices and health centers ahead of the curve. OPENING YOUR OFFICE DURING A PANDEMIC provides a unique set of challenges, as public health information and guidelines seem to fluctuate almost daily. But health care offices and gyms and restaurants \u2014 many businesses \u2014 have started opening their doors again or are working hard to keep their doors open as they navigate our new and changing environment. What are they doing well? How can you replicate that in your own business? The health and safety of everyone who may be on the premises is the No. 1 priority. You want to serve members of your community and provide them with the care they need. How can we do that in a safe and comfortable environment? Considerations checklist For chiropractic offices, there are multiple areas to consider, including: Pre-screening before a patient visits Masks and social distancing while a patient is on-site Cleaning and disinfecting, especially high-touch areas, after a patient leaves Staying ahead of the curve means constantly monitoring and accommodating federal, state and local guidelines. These change as new information and rapidly changing data shape the way public health officials respond. Guidance for opening (or re-opening) is available through your county, your state and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). It's important to know what the requirements are for your own county or state, and to follow whichever requirements are stricter. How one health center handled a re-opening Early in the pandemic the Life West Health Center tempo - rarily closed to consider operations and procedures that were needed to remain open. The San Francisco Bay Area Life West Health Center, where senior students at Life Chiropractic College West practice their craft and work with the commu - nity, was already meeting with faculty and staff when the 64 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JANUARY 17, 2021 CHIROECO.COMIMMUNE SUPPORT YOUR PATIENTS TRULY NEED Call today for a FREE consultation with our clinical immune support specialist1-800-445-4647 www.systemicformulas.comOffer ends MARCH 31/2021 Zinc Vitamin C Copper Beta Glucan & More!

This area of the country has continued with stricter protocols than many areas, and as of November was still reopening very slowly. However, reopening as quickly as possible and as safely as possible immediately became the No. 1 goal for the health center. \"We quickly determined that we can't stay open without making accommodations, but we can't shut down and not serve our patients and interns,\" said Scott Donaldson, DC, vice president of clinical operations. \"If we can see non-COVID patients and keep them out of the emergency room and other doctor offices, we're providing an important service.\" Developing new protocols The next question was: How to do that safely and effectively? A team of staff and faculty began to work on developing new protocols, even before the order to do so came. The team included everyone from faculty doctors to staff working at the front desk. \"All those perspectives came together for a good plan,\" Donaldson said, although he stressed that what works for a large educational institution may not work for a smaller office. The health center was able to reopen a week later. The new protocols went above and beyond what the county was requiring. Later, when public health requirements changed, Donaldson said the health center was already taking the recommended extra precautions. Patient scheduling The team started by assessing how many people could be in the facility at once, but restricted the initial population in the building to less than what was recom - mended. That gave the health center time to test any protocols before an expanded population would be allowed inside. For example, when the health center first reopened, only five patients were allowed inside per floor at any given time. That meant making changes to the way patients were scheduled, as well as adjusting the schedule of the interns who were seeing them. The health center now allows up to 15 patient visits per floor at a time. Initially, the screener who was also stationed at the door used a handheld thermometer, but Donaldson said this led to longer lines as people waited to be screened and have their temperature taken. Now the health center uses an automated thermal scanner that takes the temperature of everyone walking in, then sounds an alarm if it detects an elevated temperature. That has eliminated some of the lines while still providing a temperature check along with the screening process. Reopening safely for the health center primarily meant limiting physical exchanges, but there were other components as well. New protocols included: Pre-screening questionnaire available online Temperature scan at the door Masks required for all New cleaning protocols, including sanitizing stations in between patients Rescheduling appointments so that there are fewer people in a space at a time Sanitizing stations set up throughout the space Signs and directional arrows to help control pedestrian traffic and maintain social distancing Exits and entrances blocked to manage the number of people in a space at any given time Cash and check payments no longer accepted at the front desk Scheduling process changes Schedule processing changes were very restrictive at first, Donaldson said, allowing only 30 minutes per patient. \"We're still sticking to that, with a few exceptions,\" he added. They opened a family room where people who already cohabitate can be seen together. The team included everyone from faculty doctors to staff working at the front desk. \"All those perspectives came together for a good plan.\" 25-30% INCREASED VOLUME OF PATIENTS SEEN DURING COVID WITH INCREASED ATTENTION TO SCHEDULING 66 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JANUARY 17, 2021 CHIROECO.COMPRACTICE CENTRAL Patients in the family room have an hour with an intern. \"That's worked well and we will probably keep that,\" he said. One of the benefits of changing the scheduling is that the health center estimates it has a 25-30% greater volume of patients than pre-COVID. Donaldson said that before the pandemic the health center would see about 180-200 patient visits per day. Now they are averaging between 200-260 per day. The key is how patients are scheduled. No more than 15 patient visits are allowed per floor at a time. But with more rigid scheduling, patients are able to spread out more evenly across the day, which has the added benefit of accommodating more patients. Before, interns scheduled their own patients, so health center spaces became crowded around noon and at 5 p.m., when the interns had a natural break in their day. Donaldson said the health center has a different call-back procedure now as well. Instead of calling to reschedule, the health center has instituted more of a check-in process with patients while they are sheltering in place. \"We check in, see how they're doing, keep that communications channel going so people who are sheltering in place can gauge when they might feel comfortable coming back in,\" he said. \"And for patients who hadn't been coming in, some of them came back after we checked in with them.\"Staying in compliance All these pieces made a difference in the larger reopening plan that came together, Donaldson said. \"It's still a team effort.\" The health center hasn't had issues with compliance and continues to issue regular reminders on masks, hand- washing and social distancing as part of their process. \"There was a very strong message from the team that these protocols must be in place if you want to see patients,\" Donaldson said. Patients, staff, faculty and interns have all taken the responses to the pandemic seriously. \"This is what works for us,\" he added. \"We're a large educational facility, and our discussion started with what is the responsible thing for us to do.\" KATHY MIEDEMA is a member of the marketing team at Life Chiropractic College West and the managing editor of the Life West Chiropractic Magazine.

CHIROECO.COM JANUARY 17, 2021 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 67SPONSORED BY :NEW PRACTITIONER U.S. COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE BEEN PUT THROUGH THE WRINGER IN 2020-21, transitioning to full-time online classes for students currently in school, and forecasting the financials if students do not return to campuses in the fall and all classes (that can) go virtual. \"There's no question this has been tough on teachers, students and parents,\" says Nicole Schulenburg, who performs public relations outreach for Logan University in Chesterfield, Mo. \"Online learning is the new reality that's here to stay.\" Online learning tips: From classroom to online Transitioning to the online environment has proven to be a huge adjustment for many students, according to education experts. \"Ask for help if you need it,\" says Stacia Rosen, academic success coach at Logan University. \"Participation in courses builds confidence in navigating the online environment. Reach out to your instructor if you have content-specific questions. Do you have a central point of contact such as an advisor or an academic success coach? If so, use them. Remember you're not alone. People want to see you succeed!\" Time management is arguably more critical in online learning than in the physical classroom environment. Students in the classroom are often taking notes or giving their full attention to the instructor without the option to \"rewind\" or play back a lecture. Students learning online have to learn to block out distractions in the home, or the lure of their phone or social media, or getting lost in searching the web for entertainment. \"The beauty of the online environment is the flexibility, but making good use of your time is key,\" Rosen says. \"Treat an online course just as you would a face-to-face course.\" Rosen has four online learning tips for time management: Use a planner; put it on the calendar; get detailed and break it down; generate a to-do list. Stay accountable To stay on task, Rosen recommends students connect with an \"accountability buddy\" in their class. \"Set time aside each week for a phone call or video chat to see if you've met the goals you've set aside each week and plan for the following week,\" she says. Online learning tips for accountability tasks can include: Set goals \u2014 Be sure to make them specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, time-based goals. Instead of, \"I'm going to get up early and study,\" be more specific. Set an alarm for 7 a.m. Get situated by 7:30 a.m. Reach chapter 3 in your textbook. Reward yourself when you do reach goals \u2014 Treat yourself to something from Amazon. Take a 30-minute nap. Watch a show on Netflix. Reward yourself with something you enjoy. Build deadlines \u2014 Things can quickly go awry when we don't give ourselves hard deadlines. Giving yourself a (realistic) specific date and time to complete a task can keep you on track.

This issue: CHIROPRACTIC AND STEM CELL THERAPY \"My personal opinion is the stem cells definitely help with the healing of the joint, but whatever caused that joint to degenerate prematurely is probably still going to be there. And it's the chiro - practic, it's the rehab, and the other services that help to repair that joint. And if you're not doing that, you're only doing part of the game ... I think this is going to be the biggest breakthrough in health care in any of our lifetimes. Of course, there's going to be people trying to cash in on it and make false claims, which gives the ability for people who aren't in this business and competing against it, like the pharmaceutical industry, to shoot arrows at this whole industry, which is why we try to get as much informa - tion out there as possible. Do your homework. Learn about this and understand how it works.\" \u2014 Michael Carberry, DC \"Regenerative medicine is the process of replacing or regen - erating cells and tissues to restore normal function. Initially popularized by professional athletes, these therapies have become mainstream.... Moving stem cell and regenerative medi - cine forward in the treatment algorithm may eliminate the need for other ineffective or potentially harmful therapies. These therapies provide new hope for patients whose only alternatives have been long-term medication, steroid injections, and costly and time-consuming surgery and rehab. Stem cell and regenerative medicine therapies may only be provided by licensed medical professionals following all appropriate rules and regulations. An understanding of these emerging therapies and the benefits they may provide is essential as the collaboration between doctors of medicine and chiropractic increases and we join forces to combat chronic pain, dysfunction and disease.\" \u2014 Mark Sanna, DC, ACRB LEVEL II, FICC \"Some chiropractic marketing groups created programs offering chiropractors a lucrative model including NPs/PAs and loose physician oversight. This model includes a non-surgical orthopedic treatment scheme with regenerative medicine products marketed as stem cells, when it's truly a non-living birth tissue product. Chiropractors can play a significant role in this treatment process by practicing excellent case management for recalcitrant orthopedic cases, and by ordering imaging and advising patients to consider the best non-surgical options. Then, by understanding how these cases are best managed, we can advise the patients about things to look for or be wary of when pursuing a stem cell treatment. Chiropractors can also play an integral role in the patient's preparation for and recovery from stem cell procedures. We can form a clinical alliance with the physicians trained in performing these procedures and provide pre-habilitation and rehabilitation for patients.\" \u2014 Abby Perone, DC, CES, CF-L1 \"For a chiropractor looking to make a referral for their patients to receive adult stem-cell therapy, you would think that the choice would be quite clear based on the fact that bone marrow harvesting requires a surgical procedure to open the hipbone. This can in some cases cause permanent pain at the site, vertebral misalignment due to the pressure exerted during the process, and even fracture of the hip. Alternatively, fat-derived adult stem-cell therapy is a simple procedure involving a small liposuction at the abdominal or flank area, in which a needle is placed subcutaneously. With manual suction and a bit of lidocaine, this can be accomplished in less than 30 minutes with minimal pain during and after the procedure. By contrast, a bone-marrow stem cell patient undergoes a surgical procedure that requires weeks if not months of healing time, whereas an adipose-tissue patient is able to drive home the same day. Given our understanding of human anatomy, spinal alignment, and the detrimental effects of spinal misalignment, why would a chiropractor choose to refer their patients to an invasive bone- marrow harvesting clinic for stem cell therapy?\" \u2014 Brent J.
