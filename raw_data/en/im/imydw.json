However, a combination of medications, home remedies, and self-care strategies, such as staying hydrated and applying ice, may help to keep gout in remission. [Gout](/articles/144827#treatment) is a form of inflammatory [arthritis](/articles/7621) that causes pain and discomfort, often in the toes, ankles, and knees. Making dietary changes can help people reduce their purine levels and the likelihood of having a gout flare. This article discusses several natural remedies for gout. Gout occurs when the body produces too much [uric acid](/articles/uric-acid-level). This acid is a byproduct of when the body breaks down purines found in foods. This excess uric acid forms crystals, which the body can deposit in all tissues. However, the crystals [mainly](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK546606/) The crystals can also form growths around affected joints, known as tophi. A person can manage a gout flare-up when it occurs and take self-care steps to prevent future flare-ups. The [Arthritis Foundation](https://www.arthritis.org/diseases/more-about/managing-a-gout-attack) suggests: - starting treatment immediately. A person should take any prescribed medication for gout as directed by their doctor. Alternatively, over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen, can help. - calling a doctor. They may prescribe a new medication. Getting treatment within 24 hours of the start of a flare can lessen its length and severity. - getting a cane. Walking with a cane can help keep pressure off the painful joint. - relaxing. Stress can trigger gout. Watching a movie, talking with a friend, reading a book, or listening to music can be a good distraction. If a gout flare-up is [accompanied by](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gout/) pain that is getting worse, a high temperature, nausea, and lack of appetite, a person should seek immediate medical attention. Home remedies for gout include: 1. Drinking plenty of water When a person has gout, they can experience significant swelling and inflammation. One of the ways to [reduce symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125106/) Increasing fluid consumption can kick-start a person's kidneys to release excess fluid, reducing swelling in a person with gout. Water is best. However, other clear fluids, such as [broths](/articles/323903) and herbal teas, are also good choices. People should avoid [alcohol](/articles/305062) and [sodas](/articles/is-soda-bad-for-you), which are high in purines. However, anyone with [congestive heart failure](/articles/156849) or [kidney disease](/articles/172179) should talk with their doctor before increasing their fluid intake.

Try applying an ice pack or other cold object wrapped in a thin towel for [20 minutes](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gout/) to help relieve pain. [Discover the best ways to make a cold compress here.](/articles/321950) 3. Reducing stress Stress can [worsen gout symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK546606/) [exercising](/articles/153390)if the pain does not limit movement - asking for [time off from work](/articles/stress-leave-from-work) [journaling](/articles/how-to-journal-for-anxiety)or reading a favorite book [meditating](/articles/320392) Getting enough rest can also help a person feel less stressed. [Discover the causes of stress and how it impacts the body here.](/articles/145855) 4. Elevating the affected joints Gout can cause pain and swelling, especially in the feet, hands, knees, and ankles. One way to [reduce swelling](https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/gout/) is by elevating the affected joints. This encourages blood and fluid to move away from the joint and back toward the heart. A person can also use an ice pack with elevation to reduce their gout symptoms. These two remedies form part of the [rest, ice, compression, and elevation](/articles/321469) (RICE) method. 5. Taking over-the-counter pain relievers While over-the-counter [naproxen sodium](/articles/324917) (Aleve), may not be \"natural,\" they are good options for [treating pain and inflammation](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gout/) due to gout. People should never take more than the recommended dose and always ask a doctor whether OTC medicines might interfere with their other medications. If OTC pain relievers do not help, a person may wish to ask a doctor about stronger prescription medications. 6. Drinking coffee Some people believe drinking coffee may decrease the risk of experiencing gout. A [2016 review and meta-analysis](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/6/7/e009809.full.pdf) showed that those who drank more coffee were less likely to have gout. This may be because coffee can lower uric acid levels. A further [2022 analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9190218/) However, just because the study showed a correlation between higher coffee consumption and a lower risk of gout, this does not mean that coffee caused the lower risk.

Eating a balanced diet A balanced diet containing a variety of nutrient-dense, minimally processed foods can [help lower](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125106/) can be benefit](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9459802/) [antioxidants](/articles/301506) that can help reduce inflammation. [Learn more about the best diet for gout here.](/articles/315732) 8. Drinking lemon water A [2015 study](https://search.proquest.com/openview/2c604825f13049ccea22ad50e2c41c1f/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=2041045) found that adding the juice of two freshly squeezed lemons to 2 liters of water each day reduced uric acid in people with gout. The researchers concluded that lemon water helps neutralize uric acid in the body, thus helping to reduce levels.

Limiting alcohol intake According to a [2021 study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10408398.2021.1911928), drinking heavily or regularly may increase a person's risk of gout. Beer is [high in purines](https://creakyjoints.org/about-arthritis/gout/gout-diet/alcohol-and-gout/), so avoiding it can benefit a person with gout. [Learn more about the link between beer and gout here.](/articles/beer-and-gout) 10. Avoiding high-purine meats Some meats contain high amounts of purines. Avoiding these might help to reduce a person's gout symptoms. Meats and fish that are high in purines [include](https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/healthy-living/nutrition/healthy-eating/which-foods-are-safe-for-gout): - bacon [turkey](/articles/285736.php) - veal - venison [organ meats](/articles/319229), such as liver - anchovies - sardines - mussels - herring [cod](/articles/324741) - haddock - trout [scallops](/articles/are-scallops-high-in-cholesterol) Doctors [may prescribe](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1521694221000619?via%3Dihub) medications to reduce symptoms of serious flares. These can include: [Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)](/articles/179211): NSAIDs such as [aspirin](/articles/161255)and [ibuprofen](/articles/161071)can reduce pain and inflammation from gout. - Colchicine: This medication helps stop uric acid from forming into crystals. Colchicine can help treat existing gout symptoms and help prevent future flares. [Corticosteroids](/articles/corticosteroids): Doctors may recommend oral or [IV](/articles/intravenous-injection)corticosteroids in cases where other medications have not reduced gout symptoms. These medications can reduce inflammation and pain. Rarely, doctors may recommend surgery to treat severe cases of gout. A person may be a candidate for surgery if gout causes extreme pain, a major abnormality, or there is a severe [infection](/articles/196271) at the site. [Surgery options](https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/gout/) for gout include: - Joint fusion: If chronic gout causes significant tissue damage, surgeons may fuse a joint together to stabilize it. - Joint replacement: Surgeons can remove affected joints and replace them with artificial structures. - Tophi removal: A surgeon can remove tophi in cases of severe discomfort, abnormality, or infection. What is the fastest way to get rid of gout at home? The fastest way to get rid of gout at home is to drink plenty of water, elevate and apply ice to the affected joint, reduce stress, and take over-the-counter pain relief such as ibuprofen. What can a person drink to flush out gout? It is beneficial for a person to [drink water](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125106/) [Refrain from](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9459802/) Gout flares can be painful and exhausting. Treatments, including home remedies, can reduce symptoms and help prevent future flares. Reaching or maintaining a moderate weight and exercising regularly can also help a person manage their condition. If a flare does not start to ease after 48 hours, a person should call their doctor to determine if they need further medical treatments. "}
