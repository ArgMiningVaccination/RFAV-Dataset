They both have an incredible aroma that is both powerful and satisfying. However, did you know that both of these spices have had a long tradition of being used for religious purposes? Believe it or not, vanilla and cinnamon are two of the most common scents used in spellwork. Their popularity as spell ingredients can be traced back to the earliest religious rituals and sacraments. Cinnamon Through the Ages [Cinnamon](https://www.originalbotanica.com/cinnamon-powder/) has a long medicinal and religious history, dating back to ancient times. In Egypt, cinnamon was used in the mummification process to preserve the body. In China, cinnamon was used for healing. Medieval physicians used cinnamon in medicines to treat coughing, hoarseness, and sore throats. Cinnamon was also valued for its anti-bacterial properties. The spice is found in the inner bark of the cinnamon tree. Cinnamonum Verum is considered the purest of the cinnamon species, while other species are more accurately referred to as \"cassia.\" Their flavors are subtly different, but there is no magical difference between the two. Both Cinnamonum Verum and cassia species are associated with fire and the sun. They are used most commonly in spells for prosperity, love, success, protection, strength, and healing. The History of Vanilla Vanilla is a member of the orchid family. The plant is native to South and Central America and the Caribbean. Vanilla is the second most expensive spice in the world because its production is so labor-intensive. The yellowish-green flowers of vanilla grow as a clinging vine, reaching heights of up to 300 feet. The first people believed to have cultivated vanilla were the Totonac tribe of Mexico. The Aztecs were introduced to vanilla when they conquered the Totonacs in the 15th Century. The Spanish later attained it when they conquered the Aztecs. The Aztecs considered vanilla a sacred herb and used it in ritual offerings, as a perfume, and for medicine. Vanilla is associated with water and Venus and is commonly found in soothing, calming, personal empowerment, good luck, and love rituals. Vanilla incense is burned to attract love, increase sexual desire, and improve the powers of the mind. Using Cinnamon and Vanilla Incense While it might seem that they are nearly opposites (fire and the sun versus water and Venus), these two herbs are often combined in spells for love and success. [Cinnamon incense](https://www.originalbotanica.com/cinnamon-incense-stick-10/) is incorporated into many prosperity and money spells.
