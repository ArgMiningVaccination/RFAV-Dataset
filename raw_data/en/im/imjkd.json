Healthy eating habits is one of the best ways to promote a long healthy life. Even when taking extra care into what you eat, your body may be missing some important nutrients. This is where vitamins and supplements come into play. With so many specialized diets people have today (Keto, Paleo, or Vegan for example) there's a significant need for the benefits vitamins and supplements provide. If you're familiar with nutritional supplementation, then you know there are an incredible amount of options. Probably too many! So we took it upon ourselves to narrow down the field just for you. We comprised a list of the top Naturopath recommended Vitamins and Supplements and why they are so important for your overall health. Iron Iron is an essential mineral for red blood cell production. Women, vegans, and vegetarians are especially prone to iron deficiency; women due to the loss of blood every month with menstruation, and vegan and vegetarians because of the lack of iron rich foods in the diet (ie. meat in particular). If you don't have enough iron in your body you can become anemic, which is a common cause of [low energy](https://juniperfamilyhealth.com/restoring-energy/). On the other hand, having too much iron can produce free radical activity (inflammation). Make sure to get a blood test from your health care provider to check your red blood cell count, hemoglobin and ferritin levels, before you take an iron supplement. For best absorption of the iron supplement, avoid taking it with calcium-rich foods (like milk or yogurt) instead take it with a high dose of Vitamin C. Vitamin C Vitamin C is the powerhouse of nutrients. It's found in many different types of foods as well as vitamin supplements. Vitamin C rich foods include peppers, broccoli, kale, papaya, oranges, strawberries and many more colourful fruits & vegetables. Taking Vitamin C helps support a healthy immune system, reduces oxidation in the body (ie. it's a powerful antioxidant), and promotes connective tissue health. Be cautious however. Taking too much Vitamin C (especially children) can cause diarrhea. So always follow the recommended dosage described on the bottle, or prescribed by your local Naturopath. Multivitamins Taking a daily multivitamin helps to ensure that you are getting the right nutrients your body needs. Think of a multi-vitamin as an insurance policy - it helps fill in the nutritional gaps in your diet to prevent nutrient deficiencies. When choosing a multivitamin, take the time to look at the ingredients. Physician grade multivitamins are free of dyes and fillers, and contain vitamin and mineral dosages that are well above the RDA. Look to see that your multi contains at least these doses of the following vitamins and minerals. Omega 3 Omega-3 fatty acids are essential to your overall health. Your body flat out needs them in order to function. There are 3 types of Omega-3's: [ ALA, EPA and DHA](http://alwaysomega3s.com/learn/epa-dha-ala-omega-3s), and each one has a variety powerful benefits to your body and your brain. Taking an Omega-3 supplement can help support optimal cholesterol levels, and improve skin & eye health. They've also been found to help fight depression, inflammation, improve bone & joint health, and reduce symptoms of ADHD in children. Fish oil supplements or a fish rich diet are great sources of Omegas. Other foods high in Omega 3's: Walnuts, Chia Seeds, Flax Seeds, or Hemp Hearts. Magnesium Magnesium is involved in over 300 biochemical functions in the body. It is needed for healthy muscle contractions, including contractions of the heart, and maintenance of healthy blood pressure. It is also crucial for nervous system and hormone health, bone mineral density, and maintaining healthy glucose and insulin levels. The body naturally loses magnesium stores every day from normal bodily functions like the heartbeat, hormone production and moving your muscles. It's a good idea to regularly replenish magnesium nutritionally. Foods like, spinach, quinoa, almonds, cashews, black beans, tofu and sesame seeds are all rich in Magnesium. Remember, when you are purchasing Vitamins and Supplements, not all are created equally. Certain brands are inexpensive because they're filled with cheap fillers and dyes. Make sure you read the labels, and talk to your local Naturopath about dosage recommendations.
