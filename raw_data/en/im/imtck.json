With COVID-19 and now cold and flu season upon us, staying healthy is doubly important. [Acupuncture](https://purelifeclinic.com/acupuncture/) can help with cold and flu prevention! Acupuncture helps defensive qi flow Regular acupuncture is known to boost immune system function. From a Traditional Chinese Medicine perspective, stuck or stagnant energy (also known as qi [pronounced \"chee\"]) causes pain and bodily dysfunction. Healthy qi flow is responsible for all proper physiological functions of the body, including maintaining our defensive qi/initial immune response. When we first get sick, it is because our defensive qi is not as strong as it needs to be, and a pathogen has invaded the body. Acupuncture, bodywork, and herbs remove the blockages, allowing qi to flow freely, and restoring and maintaining a strong defensive layer to prevent colds and flu. Factors that create qi stagnation include stress, insomnia, overexertion, and physical trauma. Acupuncture boosts the immune system From a more Western perspective, when something enters the body that it sees as \"the other\" or NOT the body (e.g., a harmful bacteria or virus), the body initiates the immune response, releasing cells and hormones to attack the pathogen and defend itself. When an acupuncturist inserts needles, this immune response occurs, because the body registers the needles as a foreign object that should not be there. However, the needles are sterile, and no bacteria or germs get into the body because of them. After about 30 minutes of relaxation, the acupuncturist removes the needles, and all the protective cells and hormones released in response to the needles can now attack any pathogen that flew below the radar or the body not yet detected. Acupuncture does more than prevent colds and flu Acupuncture has other positive side effects besides preventing colds and flu, including: - Deep relaxation - Better sleep - Improved digestion - Improved mood - Pain relief (of course) Acupuncture is wonderful as a preventative medical modality. There also are herbal formulas that can encourage healthy immune function as well, acting as \"treatment between treatments.\" We can also help you with food and lifestyle recommendations.
