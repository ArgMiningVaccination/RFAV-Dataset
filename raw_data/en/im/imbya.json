Untreated substance use disorders result in social and financial burdens on our communities due to related deaths, injury, illness, crime and loss of productivity. Behavioral health problems affect many of our nation's youth under the age of 18. Emotional disorders that co-exist with alcohol/substance abuse can result in high-risk behaviors. Common problems encountered among children and adolescents may include childhood depression, hyperactivity, attachment reactions, anxiety, phobias, family dysfunction and disruptive behavior. The Phoenix Area Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program promotes education for the prevention of substance abuse behavior. Intervention in the form of treatment at the appropriate level is another primary focus, with the Area Intervention Team also available for treatment placement of clients from within the treatment pool funds. Aftercare is another key element to the treatment of substance abuse, and a continuum of care must be provided for recovery to be successful for the client. Mental Health The Phoenix Area of the Indian Health Service (PAIHS) oversees the health care delivery to over 140,000 Native American users from 44 different tribes in the tri-state area of Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. The PAIHS utilizes an Integrated Behavioral Health approach which utilizes the best practices from the fields of Psychology, Social Work, and Alcohol/Substance Abuse. The Psychology services are delivered through IHS Psychology programs, Tribal Psychology programs, and/or Urban programs. Psychology services offered vary depending on the site. General services include psychotherapy (individual, couples, group, and family), psychological assessment (evaluation and testing), psychiatric medication (evaluation & treatment), crisis intervention, primary care consultation, prevention and health education, and consultation with social service departments/agencies. The PAIHS supports 13 service units; the largest is the Phoenix Indian Medical Center (PIMC). The Behavioral Health Department at PIMC provides a full range of services which includes psychology, psychiatry, social work, and alcohol/substance abuse professionals. The remainder of the Psychology programs within the Phoenix Area IHS provide outpatient psychology services. Generally these programs have between two to four licensed behavioral health providers to meet the community's needs. About half of the Psychology programs are operated directly by the IHS and the other half are tribally operated programs. The PAIHS serves over 45 different tribes, each with its own culture and customs. The Psychology programs recognize the value of each tribe's culture and customs. We work with the tribes to provide these services in a respectful and culturally competent manner in order to provide the individual with the most effective services available to them. Traditional medicine and practices are integrated into the Psychology services at many of the clinics. As our world becomes more complex and challenging our psychological health and well-being can be affected by these and many other stressors. Even the strongest among us can struggle with the psychological burdens of stress, depression, anxiety, and other emotional & physical sufferings. Research recognizes the unique burden Native American people in our country can face. In fact suicide completion among American Indian/Alaskan Native people can be (depending on the tribe) between 2 to 5 times higher than their non-native counterparts in the U.S. Other challenges such as domestic violence, homicide, depression, traumatic stress, and many types of abuse negatively affect our daily physical, emotional, and spiritual life. The Psychology programs in our area have highly trained and licensed mental health professionals available to help those in need. These professionals have routine quality assurance reviews, peer reviews, and all our direct care facilities are fully accredited by a major accrediting agency. The PAIHS has a number of behavioral health initiatives and strategies to address the physical, emotional, and spiritual challenges facing today's American Indian/Alaskan Native person. These activities include: - Phoenix Area Suicide Prevention Initiative utilizing \"best practice' strategies to address suicide in the PAIHS. These practices include: - Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST) - Question, Persuade, and Refer (QPR) - Assessing & Managing Suicide Risk (AMSR) - Native American Suicide Prevention Committee - Methamphetamine & Suicide Prevention Initiative (MSPI) - Domestic Violence Initiative - Phoenix Area Integrated Behavioral Health Initiative - Integration of Behavioral Health into the Primary Care Setting - Tele-Behavioral Health - Prescribing Psychologist program - PAIHS Behavioral Health Rapid Response Program.
