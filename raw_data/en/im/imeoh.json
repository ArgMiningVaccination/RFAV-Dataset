In this approach, the patient's own T-cells are targeted to bind to tumor cells through transgene-encoded chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). When expressed in T-cells, CARs efficiently redirect T-cell specificity and cytotoxicity to tumor cells in a mechanism that is independent of antigen processing. Through this approach, CAR T-cells overcome issues with immune tolerance and the requirement of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presentation of antigens. CARs are synthetic, engineered receptors that contain sequences that encode antibody-based recognition domains linked to intracellular T-cell signaling sequences. First generation CARs include an extracellular single chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from an antibody and directed against a tumor target antigen, linked to an intracellular CD3 signaling module. Second and third generation CARs have evolved to now include multiple co-stimulatory domains including, but not limited, to 4-1BB and CD28. Results from early clinical trials have established the therapeutic efficacy of CAR-T therapy in a number of cancers, including lymphoma (Till et al., \"CD20-specific adoptive immunotherapy for lymphoma using a chimeric antigen receptor with both CD28 and 4-1 BB domains: clinical chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (Porter et al., modified in chronic lymphoid leukemia.\" NEJM (2011):725-733), acute lymphoblastic (ALL) (Grupp antigen modified for acute lymphoid leukemia.\" NEJM 368 (2013):1509-1518), and neuroblastoma (Louis et al., activity and long-term date of chimeric antigen receptor-positive T-cells in patients with neuroblastoma.\" Blood 118 (2011):6050-6056), among others. In November 2014, the FDA granted orphan status to Juno Therapeutic, also recently received the designation from both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency. The University of Pennsylvania/Novartis's CTLO19 for ALL also received breakthrough status. Recently, CAR-T cells containing receptors targeting solid tumors such as melanoma and gastrointestinal tumors have been proposed. Mirzaei et al., \"Prospects for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells: A potential game changer for adoptive T cell cancer immunotherapy,\" Cancer Letters 380 (2016):413-423. CAR T-cell therapy is not, however, without significant side effects. Although most adverse events with CAR-T are tolerable and acceptable, the administration of CAR T-cells has, in a number of cases, resulted in severe systemic inflammatory reactions, including cytokine release syndrome and tumor lysis syndrome (Xu et al., \"Efficacy and safety of adoptive immunotherapy using anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor transduced T-cells: a systemic review of phase I clinical trials.\" Leukemia Lymphoma 54 (2013):255-260; Minagawa et al., \"Seatbelts in CAR therapy: how safe are CARS?\" Pharmaceuticals 8 (2015):230-249). For example, in 2010, two deaths were attributed to the development of cytokine release syndrome following administration of CAR T-cells in the clinical setting (Brentjens et al., \"Treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia with genetically targeted autologous T-cells: case report of an unforeseen adverse event in a phase I clinical trial.\" Mol. Ther. 18 (2010):666-668; Morgan et al., \"Case report of a serious adverse event following the administration of T-cells transduced with a chimeric antigen receptor recognizing ERBB2.\" Mol. Ther. 18 (2010):843-851). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is an inflammatory response clinically manifesting with fever, nausea, headache, tachycardia, hypotension, hypoxia, as well as cardiac and/or neurologic manifestations. Severe cytokine release syndrome is described as a cytokine storm, and can be fatal. CRS is believed to be a result of the sustained activation of a variety of cell types such as monocytes and macrophages, T-cells and B cells, and is generally characterized by an increase in levels of TNF and IFN within 1 to 2 hours of stimulus exposure, followed by increases in interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 and, in some cases, IL-2 and IL-8 (Doessegger et al., \"Clinical development (TLS) is a metabolic syndrome that is caused by the sudden killing of tumor cells with chemotherapy, and subsequent release of cellular contents with the release of large amounts of potassium, phosphate, and nucleic acids into the systemic circulation. Catabolism of the nucleic acids to uric acid leads to hyperuricemia; the marked increase in uric acid excretion can result in the precipitation of uric acid in the renal tubules and renal vasoconstriction, impaired autoregulation, decreased renal flow, oxidation, and inflammation, resulting in acute kidney injury. Hyperphosphatemia with calcium phosphate deposition in the renal tubules can also cause acute kidney injury. High concentrations of both uric acid and phosphate potentiate the risk of acute kidney injury because uric acid precipitates more readily in the presence of calcium phosphate and vice versa that results in hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, remia, and acute renal failure. It usually occurs in patients with bulky, rapidly proliferating, treatment-responsive tumors (Wintrobe M M, et al., \"Complications of Wintrobe's Hematology, 11th & Wilkins; Vol 11 (2003): 1919-1944). The dramatic clinical activity of CAR T-cell therapy necessitates the need to implement additional \"safety\" strategies to rapidly reverse or abort the T-cell responses in patients that are undergoing CRS or associated adverse events. Metabolic approaches including co-expression of T-cells upon treatment with ganciclovir. This approach is limited by the delayed kinetics of response and the potential for immunogenic reaction to HSV. Apoptosis promoting strategies have been developed in which a drug binding domain is expressed in frame with components of the apoptotic machinery, including Caspase 9 and FAS. This system allows for conditional activation of apoptosis upon administration of a small molecule inducer of dimerization. The effect is rapid, non-immunogenic, and reduces payload of transduced cells by 90%. Both approaches are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. While expression of \"suicide\" genes provides a mechanism to reverse the unwanted toxicities, both approaches are considered irreversible, effectively limiting any further therapeutic benefit to the patient. Other strategies for controlling CAR T-cell activation include separating dual costimulatory domains from the antigen-recognition domain, wherein stimulation of the CAR T-cell is controlled by a small-molecule drug\u2014rimiducid. These T-cells, known as GoCAR-Ts, can only be fully activated when they are exposed to both cancer cells and the drug. In addition, strategies incorporating bispecific CARs which includes a second binding domain on the CAR T-cell that can lead to either an inhibitory or amplifying signal, allows for decreased off-target effects, wherein the presence of one target protein leads to activation of the CAR T-cell while the presence of a second protein leads to inhibition. WO2016/115177 to Juno Therapeutics, Inc. titled \"Modified Hepatitis Post-Transcriptional Elements\" describes the inclusion of post-transcriptional regulatory elements (PREs) in administered proteins to hasten degradation by encouraging natural ubiquination of the protein and shorten half-life, including for example chimeric antigen receptors. The employed strategy, however, is not regulatable. It is an object of the present invention to provide effective reversible treatments which can modulate the activity of CAR T-cells and reduce adverse inflammatory responses.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Compositions, engineered cells, such as immune or immunostimulatory cells, and methods for mediating CAR immune effector cell stimulation, for example T-cell stimulation, through the incorporation of a heterobifunctional compound targeted protein, protein domain, or polypeptide sequence (the \"heterobifunctional compound targeting domain\" or \"dTAG\") within a synthetic chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) construct are provided that allows for reversible targeted protein degradation using a heterobifunctional compound (i.e., a heterobifunctional compound that binds to a ubiquitin ligase through its ubiquitin ligase binding moiety and also binds to the CAR that contains the dTAG through a dTAG Targeting Ligand in vivo, as defined in more detail below). Compared to modalities that incorporate suicide gene strategies which are used to rapidly induce cell death of, for example, CAR T-cells, the use of a heterobifunctional compound to target CAR ubiquitination and degradation within the CAR T-cell allows for reversible control of the CAR expression and in turn the T-cell response, while sparing the CAR T-cell itself. The dTAG can be used as a rheostat of CAR expression and, thus, CAR T-cell stimulation, affording the ability to regulate the expression of the CAR and degree of CAR T-cell responses by administration of the heterobifunctional compound, and regeneration of the CAR upon clearance of the heterobifunctional compound. Furthermore, by incorporating a heterobifunctional compound targeted protein within the CAR construct, adverse side effects associated with current CAR T-cell therapies such as inflammatory responses, including CRS, and metabolic responses, such as TIL, may be controlled through the administration of a heterobifunctional compound that controls CAR expression, all while allowing the CAR T-cell to retain its ability to reactivate upon reexpression of the CAR and clearance of the heterobifunctional compound. Therefore, in one embodiment, a method is provided that includes the steps of: - - (i) removing immune effector cells, for example T-cells, from a patient with a disorder of diseased cells that can be treated by increasing the ability of the patient's T-cells to recognize and bind to the diseased cells; - (ii) transforming the T-cells ex vivo by inserting a gene encoding a CAR having at least a sequence targeting a diseased cell surface antigen and an amino acid sequence that can be recognized by and bound to a dTAG Targeting Ligand of a heterobifunctional compound to form a CAR T-cell; - (iii) administering to the patient the autologous CAR T-cells; and then - (iv) administering to the patient, as needed, a heterobifunctional compound which binds to a) the dTAG and b) a ubiquitin ligase; in a manner that brings the dTAG (and thus the CAR) into proximity of the ubiquitin ligase, such that the CAR, or a portion thereof, is ubiquitinated, and then degraded by the proteasome. By degrading at least a portion of the cytoplasmic signaling domain of the CAR, the ability of the CAR to activate the immune effector cell, for example a CAR T-cell, is diminished. As contemplated herein, sufficient degradation of the CAR occurs wherein the CAR's signaling functionality is disrupted. As contemplated herein, the synthetic CARs of the present invention, which can be expressed by engineered cells for use in adoptive cell therapies, include an extracellular ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain having at least one intracellular signaling domain and a dTAG capable of being targeted and bound by a dTAG Targeting Ligand of a heterobifunctional compound, wherein the binding of the heterobifunctional compound to the dTAG leads to the degradation of the CAR through ubiquitination and ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The dTAG of the CAR is any amino acid sequence to which a heterobifunctional compound can be bound through its dTAG Targeting Ligand, which leads to ubiquitination and then proteasomal degradation of the CAR. Preferably, the dTAG should not interfere with the function of the CAR. In one embodiment, the dTAG is a non-endogenous peptide, leading to heterobifunctional compound selectivity and allowing for the avoidance of off target effects upon administration of the heterobifunctional compound. In one embodiment, the dTAG is an amino acid sequence derived from an endogenous protein which has been modified so that the heterobifunctional compound binds only to the modified amino acid sequence and not the endogenously expressed protein. In particular embodiments, the dTAGs for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, amino acid sequences derived from endogenously expressed proteins such as FK506 binding protein-12 (FKBP 12), other embodiments, dTAGs for use in the present invention may include, for example, a hormone receptor e.g. estrogen-receptor protein, androgen receptor protein, retinoid x receptor (RXR) protein, dihydroflorate (DHFR), including bacterial DHFR.

In certain embodiments, the one or more mutations of BRDT include a mutation of the W at amino acid position 50, a mutation of the V at amino acid position 56, a mutation of the L at amino acid position 63, a mutation of the W at amino acid position 293, a mutation of the V at amino acid position 299, or a mutation of the L at amino acid position 306. In a particular embodiment, the dTAG is derived from cytosolic signaling protein FKBP 12. In certain embodiments, the dTAG is a modified or mutant cytosolic signaling protein FKBP12. In certain embodiments, the modified or mutant cytosolic signaling protein FKBP12 contains one or more mutations that create an enlarged binding pocket for FKBP12 ligands.

In a particular embodiment, the dTAG is derived from an amino acid sequence, or fragment thereof of SEQ ID NO: 58. In a particular embodiment, the fragment thereof refers to the minimum amino acid sequence need to be bound by the heterobifunctional compound. In one embodiment, the dTAG is derived from any amino acid sequence described herein, or a fragment thereof, and the dTAG is capable of being bound by a corresponding heterobifunctional compound comprising a dTAG Targeting Ligand capable of binding the dTAG described herein. In one embodiment, the dTAG is amino acid sequence capable of being bound by a heterobifunctional compound described in As contemplated herein, the CARs of the present invention include an extracellular ligand binding domain capable of binding a targeted protein, typically an antigen, for example a tumor antigen. In one embodiment, the extracellular ligand binding domain is an antigen binding domain, for example, an antibody or an antigen binding fragment thereof. In particular embodiments, the antigen-binding fragment is a Fab or scFv. In one embodiment, the extracellular ligand binding domain is a ligand for a tumor marker, for example, a ligand that binds a marker expressed on the cell surface of a tumor, for example IL13 which binds to the IL13 receptor (IL13R) on glioma cells or heregulin which binds to erb B2, B3, and B4 on breast cancer cells. In one embodiment, the extracellular ligand binding domain targets a labeled or tagged protein or molecule, for example biotin or fluorescein isothiocyanate, which is bound to an antibody targeting a tumor expressed protein. For example, the extracellular ligand binding domain can target a label on a tumor-specific antibody, for example biotin, so that when the antibody-label binds to the tumor cell, the extracellular binding ligand of the CAR T-cell binds the label, activating the T-cell, and killing the tumor cell. In this regard, a \"universal CAR\" can be generated capable of binding any tagged or labeled antibody. See, e.g., Abate Daga et al., \"CAR models: next generation CAR modifications for enhanced T-cell function,\" Molecular Therapy-Oncolytics (2016)3:1-7. An exemplary illustration of such a strategy is depicted in In one embodiment, the antigen binding domain in the CAR binds to a tumor antigen, for example, a tumor antigen associated with a hematological malignancy or a solid tumor. Tumor antigens capable of being targeted by CAR T-cells are known, and include, for example, but are not (AFP), vimentin, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), surviving, mouse double 2 homolog (MDM2), kappa-light L1 cell adhesion molecule, oncofetal antigen (h5T4), TAG-72, VEGF-R2, and combinations thereof, as well as others described herein. Other antigens to which the antigen binding domain of the CAR can be directed include, but are not limited to, tissue or cell lineage specific antigens including, but not thereof. As contemplated herein, the CARs of the present invention include a transmembrane domain spanning the extracellular ligand binding domain and the at least one intracellular signaling domain. Transmembrane domains useful in the construction of CARs are known in the art, and can be derived from natural or synthetic sources. For example, transmembrane regions contemplated herein include, but are not limited to, those derived from (i.e. comprise at least the transmembrane region(s) of) the alpha, beta or zeta chain KIR2DS2. Alternatively the transmembrane domain in some embodiments is synthetic, for example, comprising predominantly hydrophobic residues such as leucine and valine. In some aspects, a triplet of phenylalanine, tryptophan and valine will be found at each end of a synthetic transmembrane domain. As further contemplated herein, the CARs of the present invention include at least one intracellular (or cytoplasmic) signaling domain. The intracellular signaling domain of the CAR activates at least one of the normal effector functions or responses of the immune cell. For example, upon binding of the extracellular ligand domain to a target antigen, the signaling domain may act to activate the CAR T-cell, for example, by inducing a function of a T-cell such as cytolytic activity or T-helper activity, including the secretion of cytokines or other factors. In some embodiments, the CAR includes an intracellular component of the TCR complex, such as a TCR CD3+ chain that mediates T-cell activation and cytotoxicity, e.g., the tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) domain CD3 zeta chain (CD3). Thus, in some aspects as contemplated herein, the antigen binding molecule is linked to one or more cell signaling domains. In some embodiments, cell signaling domains include CD3 transmembrane domain, CD3 intracellular signaling domains, and/or other CD transmembrane domains. In some embodiments, the CAR further includes a portion of one or more additional molecules such as Fc receptor , for example FcRI, CD8, CD4, CD25, or CD16. For example, in some aspects, the CAR includes a chimeric molecule between CD3-zeta (CD3-) or Fc one embodiment, the intracellular signaling domain is a Dap-12 derived signaling domain. Generalized examples of CARs having a dTAG capable of being bound by a heterobifunctional compound resulting in degradation of at least a portion of the CAR in combination with one or more signaling domains are illustrated in In some embodiments, the intracellular signaling domain or domains include the cytoplasmic sequences of the T-cell receptor (TCR), and in some aspects also those of co-receptors that in the natural context act in concert with such receptor to initiate signal transduction following antigen receptor engagement, and/or any derivative or variant of such molecules, and/or any synthetic sequence that has the same functional capability. In the context of a natural TCR, full activation generally requires not only signaling through the TCR, but also a costimulatory signal. Thus, in some embodiments, to promote full activation, a component for generating secondary or co-stimulatory signal is also included in the CAR. In other embodiments, the CAR does not include a component for generating a costimulatory signal. In some aspects, an additional CAR is expressed in the same cell and provides the component for generating the secondary or costimulatory signal. In some aspects, the cell comprises a first CAR which contains signaling domains to induce the primary signal and a second CAR which binds to a second antigen and contains the component for generating a costimulatory signal. For example, a first CAR can be an activating CAR and the second CAR can be a costimulatory CAR. In some aspects, both CARs must be ligated in order to induce a particular effector function in the cell, which can provide specificity and selectivity for the cell type being targeted. In one embodiment, the cell comprises a first CAR which contains signaling domains to induce the primary signal and a costimulatory ligand molecule to stimulate other immune cells. See, e.g., Abate Daga et al., \"CAR models: next generation CAR modifications for enhanced T-cell function,\" Molecular Therapy-Oncolytics (2016)3:1-7. An exemplary schematic of such a strategy is illustrated in In some embodiments, the CAR includes a signaling domain and/or transmembrane portion of a costimulatory receptor, such as CD28, 4-1BB, OX40, DAP10, and ICOS. In some aspects, the same CAR includes both the activating and costimulatory components; in other aspects, the activating domain is provided by one CAR whereas the costimulatory component is provided by another CAR or ligand recognizing another antigen. In certain embodiments, the intracellular signaling domain comprises a CD28 transmembrane and signaling domain linked to a CD3 (e.g., CD3-zeta) intracellular domain. In some embodiments, the intracellular signaling domain a chimeric CD28 and CD 137 (4-1BB, TNFRSF9) co-stimulatory domain, linked to a CD3 zeta intracellular domain. In some embodiments, the intracellular signaling domain comprises a chimeric CD28 or CD 137 (4-1BB, TNFRSF9) co-stimulatory domain. In embodiments, the comprises a chimeric CD28 and OX40 co-stimulatory domain. In some signaling domain comprises a chimeric CD27 co-stimulatory domain. In some embodiments, the comprises a chimeric CD27 and DAP10 co-stimulatory domain. In some embodiments, the CAR encompasses two or more costimulatory domain combined with an activation domain, e.g., primary activation domain, in the cytoplasmic portion. One example is a receptor including intracellular components of CD3-zeta, CD28, and 4-1BB. Other examples include a receptor including intracellular components of CD3-zeta, CD28, and OX40. As contemplated herein, the CARs of the present invention are expressed by an immune effector cell, for example a T-cell, and administered to a subject in order to treat a disease or disorder, for example, a cancer. Among the cell types that may be used to express the CARs of the present invention include, but are not limited to, T-cells, NK cells, CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ cells, and stem cells, such as an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS cell). In one embodiment, the cell is an autologous T-cell. In one embodiment, the cell shows anti-tumor activity when cross-reacted with a tumor cell containing an antigen capable of being bound by the extracellular ligand binding domain. Further contemplated herein is the use of heterobifunctional compound molecules capable of binding to the dTAG of the CARs of the present invention and inducing degradation through ubiquitination. By administering to a subject a heterobifunctional compound directed to a dTAG, the immune effector cell response can be modulated in a subject who has previously received an immune effector cell expressing the CARs of the present invention. The heterobifunctional compounds for use in the present invention are small molecule antagonists capable of disabling the biological function of the CAR through degradation. The heterobifunctional compounds for use in the present invention provide prompt ligand-dependent target protein degradation via chemical conjugation with derivatized phthalimides that hijack the function of the Cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Using this approach, the CARs of the present invention can be degraded rapidly with a high specificity and efficiency. The heterobifunctional compounds that can be used in the present invention include those that include a small molecule E3 ligase ligand which is covalently linked to a dTAG Targeting Ligand through a Linker of varying length and/or functionality as described in more detail below. The heterobifunctional compound is able to bind to the dTAG and recruit an E3 ligase, for example, via binding to a Cereblon (CRBN) containing ligase or Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) to the CAR for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Moreover, by combining the chemical strategy of protein degradation via the bifunctional molecules of the present application with the effectiveness of CAR T-cell therapy, the activity of the CAR T-cell, and thus the side effects, can be regulated in a precise, temporal manner by rapidly turning on and off ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation of the CAR. Examples of heterobifunctional compounds useful in the present invention are exemplified in detail below.

These aspects particularly include the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, cervical carcinoma, osteosarcoma, glioblastoma, lung cancer, melanoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, salivary gland cancer, endometrial cancer, colon cancer, renal cell carcinoma, ovarian cancer, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, leukemia, and lymphoma. Examples of cancer targets for use with the present invention are cancers of B cell origin, particularly including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In one embodiment, a method is provided that includes at least the steps of: - - (i) removing immune effector cells, for example T-cells, from a patient with a disorder of diseased cells that can be treated by increasing the ability of the patient's T-cells to recognize and bind to the diseased cells; - (ii) transforming the T-cells ex vivo by inserting a gene encoding a CAR having at least a sequence targeting a diseased cell surface antigen and an amino acid sequence that can be recognized by and bound to a dTAG Targeting Ligand of a heterobifunctional compound to form a CAR T-cell; - (iii) administering to the patient the autologous CAR T-cells; and then - (iv) administering to the patient, as needed, a heterobifunctional compound which binds to a) the dTAG and b) a ubiquitin ligase; in a manner that brings the dTAG (and thus the CAR T-cell) into proximity of the ubiquitin ligase, such that the CAR is ubiquitinated, and then degraded by the proteasome. In one embodiment, a method is provided that includes at least the steps of: administering to a patient as needed, a heterobifunctional compound; wherein the patient has a disorder of diseased cells that can be treated by increasing the ability of the patient's immune effector cells, for example T-cells, to recognize and bind to the diseased cells; wherein the patient has previously been administered autologous immune effector cells, for example, CAR T-cells, which have been transformed ex vivo by inserting a gene encoding a CAR having at least a sequence targeting a diseased cell surface antigen and an amino acid sequence that can be recognized by and bound to a dTAG Targeting Ligand of a heterobifunctional compound to form a CAR T-cell; wherein the heterobifunctional compound is capable of binding to a) the dTAG and b) a ubiquitin ligase in a manner that brings the dTAG (and thus the CAR) into proximity of the ubiquitin ligase, such that the CAR is ubiquitinated, and then degraded by the proteasome. The invention includes compositions and methods for mediating CAR T-cell stimulation through the incorporation of a heterobifunctional compound targeted protein or heterobifunctional compound tag, collectively referred to as a dTAG, within a synthetic chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) construct that allows for reversible targeted protein degradation using a heterobifunctional compound. The CARs of the invention are useful in treating cancer including but not limited to hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. The present invention includes a strategy of adoptive cell transfer of T-cells transduced to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) having a dTAG that is capable of being bound by a heterobifunctional compound, which, upon contact with the heterobifunctional compound, is degraded by the ubiquitin proteasomal pathway. CARs are molecules that combine antibody-based specificity for a desired antigen (e.g., tumor antigen) with a T-cell receptor-activating intracellular domain to generate a chimeric protein that exhibits a specific anti-tumor cellular immune activity. The present invention relates generally to the use of T-cells genetically modified to stably express a desired CAR having a dTAG. T-cells expressing these CARs are referred to herein as CAR T-cells or CAR modified T-cells. Preferably, the cell can be genetically modified to stably express an antibody binding domain on its surface, conferring novel antigen specificity that is MHC independent. In some instances, the T-cell is genetically modified to stably express a CAR that combines an antigen recognition domain of a specific antibody with an intracellular domain having a dTAG in a single chimeric protein. In one embodiment, the CAR of the invention includes an extracellular domain having an antigen recognition domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. In one embodiment, the transmembrane domain that naturally is associated with one of the domains in the CAR is used. In another embodiment, the transmembrane domain can be selected or modified by amino acid substitution to avoid binding of such domains to the transmembrane domains of the same or different surface membrane proteins to minimize interactions with other members of the receptor complex. In one embodiment, the transmembrane domain is the CD8 hinge domain. With respect to the cytoplasmic domain, the CAR of the invention is designed to include at least one signaling domain and a heterobifunctional compound targeted protein (dTAG). The heterobifunctional compound targeted protein of the CAR is any amino acid sequence to which a heterobifunctional compound can be bound, leading to the degradation of the CAR when in contact with the heterobifunctional compound. Preferably, the dTAG should not interfere with the function of the CAR. In one embodiment, the dTAG is a non-endogenous peptide, leading to heterobifunctional compound selectivity and allowing for the avoidance of off target effects upon administration of the heterobifunctional compound. In one embodiment, the dTAG is an amino acid sequence derived from an endogenous protein which has been modified so that the heterobifunctional compound binds only to the modified amino acid sequence and not the endogenously expressed protein. The signaling domain can be any suitable signaling domain capable of activating the T-cell, domain, which can be by itself or be combined with any other desired cytoplasmic domain(s) useful in the context of the CAR of the invention. In one embodiment, the cytoplasmic domain of the CAR can be designed to further comprise a second signaling domain, for example, the signaling domain of or any combination thereof. For example, the cytoplasmic domain of the CAR can include but is not limited to CD3-zeta, 4-1BB, and/or CD28 signaling modules and combinations thereof. The generation of CAR T-cells is known in the art. For example, see Wang et al, \"Clinical manufacturing of CAR T cells: foundation of a promising therapy,\" Oncolytics (2016)3:1-7 (and incorporated herein). In general, the CAR T-cells of the invention can be generated by introducing a lentiviral vector including a desired CAR, for example a CAR comprising anti-CD19, CD8 hinge and transmembrane domain, human CD28 and CD3zeta signaling domains, and a FKBP* dTAG into the cells. The CAR T-cells of the invention are able to replicate in vivo resulting in long-term persistence that can lead to sustained tumor control, and are subject to modulation of activation via administration of a heterobifunctional compound. In one embodiment, genetically modified T-cells expressing a CAR for the treatment of a patient having cancer or at risk of having cancer are administered using lymphocyte infusion. Autologous lymphocyte infusion is used in the treatment. Autologous PBMCs are collected from a patient in need of treatment and T-cells are activated and expanded using the methods described herein and known in the art and then infused back into the patient. In yet another embodiment, the treatment of a patient at risk of developing CLL is provided. The invention also includes treating a malignancy or an autoimmune disease in which chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy in a patient results in significant immunosuppression in the patient, thereby increasing the risk of the patient of developing CLL. The invention includes using CAR T-cells that express a CAR containing a dTAG. The CAR T-cells of the invention can undergo robust in vivo CAR T-cell expansion and can establish targeted antigen-specific memory cells that persist at high levels for an extended amount of time in blood and bone marrow. In some instances, the CAR T-cells of the invention infused into a patient can be modulated by administering to the subject a heterobifunctional compound that is capable of binding the dTAG on the CAR, resulting in degradation of the dTAG and a down regulation of the CAR T-cell activation without destroying the CAR T-cell.Terminology Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.

Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs) The CARs of the present invention are characterized in that they include an extracellular ligand binding domain capable of binding to an antigen, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain in this order from the N-terminal side, wherein the intracellular domain includes at least one signaling domain and a dTAG. (a) Extracellular Domain The CARs of the invention include an extracellular target-specific ligand binding domain, for example an antigen binding moiety. The choice of moiety depends on the type and number of ligands that define the surface of a target cell. For example, the extracellular ligand binding domain may be chosen to recognize a ligand that acts as a cell surface marker on target cells associated with a particular disease state. Thus examples of cell surface markers that may act as ligands for the extracellular ligand binding domain in the CARs of the present invention include those associated with viral, bacterial and parasitic infections, autoimmune disease, and cancer cells. In one embodiment, the CARs of the invention can be engineered to target a tumor antigen of interest by way of engineering a desired antigen binding moiety that specifically binds to an antigen on a tumor cell. In the context of the present invention, tumor antigen refers to antigens that are common to specific types of cancer. The antigens discussed herein are merely included by way of example. The list is not intended to be exclusive and further examples will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art. Tumor antigens are proteins that are produced by tumor cells that elicit an immune response, particularly T-cell mediated immune responses. The selection of the antigen binding moiety of the invention will depend on the particular type of cancer to be treated. Tumor antigens are well known in the art and include, for example, a glioma-associated antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen tumor antigen comprises one or more antigenic cancer epitopes associated with a malignant tumor. Malignant tumors express a number of proteins that can serve as target antigens for an immune attack. These molecules include but are not limited to tissue-specific antigens such as MART-1, tyrosinase and GP 100 in melanoma and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in prostate cancer. Other target molecules belong to the group of transformation-related molecules such as the oncogene HER-2/Neu/ErbB-2, Erb-B3, Erb-B4. Yet another group of target antigens are antigens such as idiotype immunoglobulin constitutes a truly tumor-specific immunoglobulin antigen that is unique to the individual tumor. B-cell differentiation antigens such as CD19, CD20 and CD37 are other candidates for target antigens of these antigens (CEA, HER-2, CD19, CD20, idiotype) have been used as targets for passive immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies with limited success. The type of tumor antigen referred to in the invention may also be a tumor-specific antigen (TSA) or a tumor-associated antigen (TAA). A TSA is unique to tumor cells and does not occur on other cells in the body. A TAA associated antigen is not unique to a tumor cell and instead is also expressed on a normal cell under conditions that fail to induce a state of immunologic tolerance to the antigen. The expression of the antigen on the tumor may occur under conditions that enable the immune system to respond to the antigen. TAAs may be antigens that are expressed on normal cells during fetal development when the immune system is immature and unable to respond or they may be antigens that are normally present at extremely low levels on normal cells but which are expressed at much higher levels on tumor cells. Non-limiting examples of TSA or TAA antigens include the following: mutated tumor-suppressor genes such as p53, Ras, HER-2/neu; unique tumor antigens an embodiment, the antigen binding moiety portion of the CAR targets an antigen that includes but is not limited like. In one embodiment, the antigen binding moiety portion of the CAR targets a particular cell surface molecule on a cell, wherein the cell surface molecule is associated with a particular type of cell, for example a cluster of differentiation molecule. Depending on the desired antigen to be targeted, the CAR of the invention can be engineered to include the appropriate antigen bind moiety that is specific to the desired antigen target. For example, if CD19 is the desired antigen that is to be targeted, an antibody or antibody fragment, for example a scFv for CD19 can be used as the antigen bind moiety for incorporation into the CAR of the invention. In one embodiment, the antigen binding domain is comprised of a scFv. Single chain antibodies refer to antibodies formed by recombinant DNA techniques in which immunoglobulin heavy and light chain fragments are linked to the Fv region via an engineered span of amino acids. Various methods of generating single chain antibodies are known, including those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,694,778; Bird (1988) Science 242:423-442; Huston et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883; Ward et al. (1989) Nature 341:544-546; Skerra et al. (1988) Science 240:1038-1041. In one embodiment, the extracellular ligand binding domain binds a label or tag, for example biotin or fluorescein isothiocyanate, wherein biotin or fluorescein isothiocyanate is bound to an antibody capable of binding a molecule on the surface of a tumor cell. In one embodiment, the extracellular ligand binding domain binds a marker associated with a particular cell or disease state, for example IL13R. In one embodiment, the extracellular ligand binding domain binds to a cluster of differentiation molecule associated with a particular cell. (b) Transmembrane Domain The CARs of the present invention can be designed to include a transmembrane domain that is fused to the extracellular domain of the CAR. In one embodiment, the transmembrane domain that naturally is associated with one of the domains in the CAR is used. In some instances, the transmembrane domain can be selected or modified by amino acid substitution to avoid binding of such domains to the transmembrane domains of the same or different surface membrane proteins to minimize interactions with other members of the receptor complex. The transmembrane domain may be derived either from a natural or from a synthetic source. Where the source is natural, the domain may be derived from any membrane-bound or transmembrane protein. Transmembrane regions of particular use in this invention may be derived from (i.e. comprise at least the transmembrane region(s) of) the alpha, beta or zeta chain transmembrane domain may be synthetic, in which case it will comprise predominantly hydrophobic residues such as leucine and valine. Preferably a triplet of phenylalanine, tryptophan and valine will be found at each end of a synthetic transmembrane domain. Optionally, a short oligo- or polypeptide linker, preferably between 2 and 10 amino acids in length may form the linkage between the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic signaling domain of the CAR. A glycine-serine doublet provides a particularly suitable linker In one embodiment, the transmembrane domain in the CAR of the invention is derived from the CD8 transmembrane domain. In some instances, the transmembrane domain of the CAR of the invention comprises the CD8 hinge domain. Further, in the CAR of the present invention, a signal peptide sequence can be linked to the N-terminus. The signal peptide sequence exists at the N-terminus of many secretory proteins and membrane proteins, and has a length of 15 to 30 amino acids. Since many of the protein molecules mentioned above as the intracellular domain have signal peptide sequences, the signal peptides can be used as a signal peptide for the CAR of the present invention. (c) Intracellular Signaling Domain The intracellular signaling domain, or cytoplasmic signaling domain, used interchangeably herein, of the CAR of the invention is responsible for activation of at least one of the normal effector functions of the immune cell in which the CAR has been placed. The term \"effector function\" refers to a specialized function of a cell. Effector function of a T-cell, for example, may be cytolytic activity or helper activity including the secretion of cytokines. Thus the term \"intracellular signaling domain\" refers to the portion of a protein which transduces the effector function signal and directs the cell to perform a specialized function. While usually the entire intracellular signaling domain can be employed, in many cases it is not necessary to use the entire chain. To the extent that a truncated portion of the intracellular signaling domain is used, such truncated portion may be used in place of the intact chain as long as it transduces the effector function signal. The term intracellular signaling domain is thus meant to include any truncated portion of the intracellular signaling domain sufficient to transduce the effector function signal. Examples of intracellular signaling domains for use in the CAR of the invention include the cytoplasmic sequences of the T-cell receptor (TCR) and co-receptors that act in concert to initiate signal transduction following antigen receptor engagement, as well as any derivative or variant of these sequences and any synthetic sequence that has the same functional capability. It is known that signals generated through the TCR alone may not be sufficient for full activation of the T-cell and that a secondary or co-stimulatory signal may also be required. Thus, T-cell activation can be said to be mediated by two distinct classes of cytoplasmic signaling sequence: those that initiate antigen-dependent primary activation through the TCR (primary cytoplasmic signaling sequences) and those that act in an antigen-independent manner to provide a secondary or co-stimulatory signal (secondary cytoplasmic signaling sequences). Primary cytoplasmic signaling sequences regulate primary activation of the TCR complex either in a stimulatory way, or in an inhibitory way. Primary cytoplasmic signaling sequences that act in a stimulatory manner may contain signaling motifs which are known as immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs or ITAMs. Examples of ITAM containing primary cytoplasmic signaling sequences that are of particular use in the invention include those derived from TCR zeta, FcR gamma, FcR the cytoplasmic signaling molecule in the CAR of the invention comprises a cytoplasmic signaling sequence derived from CD3 zeta. The cytoplasmic domain of the CAR can be designed to comprise the CD3-zeta signaling domain by itself or combined with any other desired cytoplasmic domain(s) useful in the context of the CAR of the invention. For example, the cytoplasmic domain of the CAR can comprise a CD3 zeta chain portion and a costimulatory signaling region. The costimulatory signaling region refers to a portion of the CAR comprising the intracellular domain of a costimulatory molecule. A costimulatory molecule is a cell surface molecule other than an antigen receptor or their ligands that is required for an efficient response of lymphocytes to an antigen. Examples of such that specifically binds with CD83, and the like. Thus, any of the costimulatory elements known in the art as useful in the construction of CARs are within the scope of the invention. The cytoplasmic signaling sequences within the cytoplasmic signaling portion of the CAR of the invention may be linked to each other in a random or specified order. Optionally, a short oligo- or polypeptide linker, preferably between 2 and 10 amino acids in length may form the linkage. A glycine-serine doublet provides a particularly suitable linker. In one embodiment, the cytoplasmic domain is designed to comprise the signaling domain of CD3-zeta and the signaling domain of CD28. In another embodiment, the cytoplasmic domain is designed to comprise the signaling domain of CD3-zeta and the signaling domain of 4-1BB. In yet another embodiment, the cytoplasmic domain is designed to comprise the signaling domain of CD3-zeta and the signaling domain of CD28 and 4-1BB. In some embodiments, the intracellular signaling domain comprises a chimeric CD28 and OX40 co-stimulatory domain. In some signaling domain comprises a chimeric CD27 co-stimulatory domain. In some embodiments, the a chimeric CD27 and DAP10 co-stimulatory domain. (d) Heterobifunctional Compound Targeted Protein (dTAG) As contemplated herein, the CAR of the present invention has a heterobifunctional compound targeted protein (dTAG) that locates in the cytoplasm. The dTAG of the CAR is any amino acid sequence to which a heterobifunctional compound can be bound, leading to the ubiquitination and degradation of the CAR when in contact with the heterobifunctional compound. Preferably, the dTAG should not interfere with the function of the CAR. In one embodiment, the dTAG is a non-endogenous peptide, leading to heterobifunctional compound selectivity and minimizing off target effects that might occur if a heterobifunctional compound targets an endogenous protein. In one embodiment, the dTAG is an amino acid sequence derived from an endogenous protein which has been modified so that the heterobifunctional compound binds only to the modified amino acid sequence and not the endogenously expressed protein. In one embodiment, the dTAG is an endogenously expressed protein. Any amino acid sequence domain that can be bound by a ligand for use in a heterobifunctional compound can be used as a dTAG as contemplated herewith. In particular embodiments, the dTAG for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, an amino acid sequence derived from an endogenously expressed protein such as FK506 binding protein-12 (FKBP 12), transcriptional a variant thereof. As contemplated herein, \"variant\" means any variant comprising a substitution, deletion, or addition of one or a few to plural amino acids, provided that the variant substantially retains the same function as the original sequence, which in this case is providing a ligand for a heterobifunctional compound. In other embodiments, a dTAG for use in the present invention may include, for example, a hormone receptor e.g. estrogen-receptor protein, androgen receptor protein, retinoid x receptor (RXR) and variants. Some embodiments of dTAGs can be, but are not limited to, those derived from Hsp90 inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors, compounds targeting Human BET Bromodomain-containing proteins, compounds targeting cytosolic signaling protein FKBP12, HDAC inhibitors, human lysine methyltransferase inhibitors, angiogenesis inhibitors, immunosuppressive compounds, and compounds targeting the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR).

In one embodiment, the dTAG is derived from the amino acid sequence: Heterobifunctional compounds capable of binding to the amino acid sequences, or a fragment thereof, described above can be generated using the dTAG Targeting Ligand described in Table T. In one embodiment, the CAR contains a dTAG derived from an amino acid sequence described above, or a fragment thereof, and is degraded by administering to the subject a heterobifunctional compound comprising a dTAG Targeting Ligand described in Table T. In one embodiment, the CAR contains a dTAG derived from an amino acid sequence described above, or a fragment thereof, and is degraded by administering to the subject its corresponding heterobifunctional compound, which is capable of binding to the to the dTAG described in the CAR, for example a heterobifunctional compound described in Nucleic Acid Encoding CAR The present invention provides a nucleic acid encoding a CAR as described herein. The nucleic acid encoding the CAR can be easily prepared from an amino acid sequence of the specified CAR by a conventional method. A base sequence encoding an amino acid sequence can be readily obtained from, for example, the aforementioned amino acid sequences or publicly available references sequences, for example, NCBI RefSeq IDs or accession numbers of GenBank, for an amino acid sequence of each domain, and the nucleic acid of the present invention can be prepared using a standard molecular biological and/or chemical procedure. RefSeq IDs for commonly used CAR domains are known in the art, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 9,175,308 (which are incorporated herein by reference) discloses a number of specific amino acid sequences particularly used as CAR transmembrane and intracellular signaling domains. As one example, based on the base sequence, a nucleic acid can be synthesized, and the nucleic acid of the present invention can be prepared by combining DNA fragments which are obtained from a cDNA library using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The nucleic acids of the present invention can be linked to another nucleic acid so as to be expressed under control of a suitable promoter. Examples of the promoter include a promoter that constitutively promotes the expression of a gene, a promoter that induces the expression of a gene by the action of a drug or the like (e.g. tetracycline or doxorubicin). The nucleic acid of the present invention can be also linked to, in order to attain efficient transcription of the nucleic acid, other regulatory elements that cooperate with a promoter or a transcription initiation site, for example, a nucleic acid comprising an enhancer sequence or a terminator sequence. In addition to the nucleic acid of the present invention, a gene that can be a marker for confirming expression of the nucleic acid (e.g. a drug resistance gene, a gene encoding a reporter enzyme, or a gene encoding a fluorescent protein) may be incorporated. One example of a suitable promoter is the immediate early cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter sequence. This promoter sequence is a strong constitutive promoter sequence capable of driving high levels of expression of any polynucleotide sequence operatively linked thereto. Another example of a suitable promoter is Elongation Growth Factor-1 (EF-1). However, other constitutive promoter sequences may also be used, including, but not limited to the simian virus (SV40) early promoter, mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter, MoMuLV promoter, an avian leukemia virus promoter, an Epstein-Barr virus immediate early promoter, a Rous sarcoma virus promoter, as well as human gene promoters such as, but not limited to, the actin promoter, the myosin promoter, the hemoglobin promoter, and the creatine kinase promoter. Further, the invention should not be limited to the use of constitutive promoters. Inducible promoters are also contemplated as part of the invention. The use of an inducible promoter provides a molecular switch capable of turning on expression of the polynucleotide sequence which it is operatively linked when such expression is desired, or turning off the expression when expression is not desired. Examples of inducible promoters include, but are not limited to a metallothionine promoter, a glucocorticoid promoter, a progesterone promoter, and a tetracycline promoter. The present invention contemplates a composition comprising the nucleic acid of the present invention as an active ingredient, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are well known to a person skilled in the art. Examples of the pharmaceutically acceptable excipients include phosphate buffered saline (e.g. 0.01 M phosphate, 0.138 M NaCl, 0.0027 M KCl, pH 7.4), an aqueous solution containing a mineral acid salt such as a hydrochloride, a hydrobromide, a phosphate, or a sulfate, saline, a solution of glycol or ethanol, and a salt of an organic acid such as an acetate, a propionate, a malonate or a benzoate. An adjuvant such as a wetting agent or an emulsifier, and a pH buffering agent can also be used. As the pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, excipients described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Pub. Co., N.J. (1991)) (which is incorporated herein by reference) can be appropriately used. The composition of the present invention can be formulated into a known form suitable for parenteral administration, for example, injection or infusion. Further, the composition of the present invention may comprise formulation additives such as a suspending agent, a preservative, a stabilizer and/or a dispersant, and a preservation agent for extending a validity term during storage. The composition may be in a dry form for reconstitution with an appropriate sterile liquid prior to use. For fine particle-mediated administration, a particle such as a gold particle of a microscopic size can be coated with a DNA. When the nucleic acid of the present invention is introduced into a cell ex vivo, the nucleic acid of the present invention may be combined with a substance that promotes transference of a nucleic acid into a cell, for example, a reagent for introducing a nucleic acid such as a liposome or a cationic lipid, in addition to the aforementioned excipients. Alternatively, a vector carrying the nucleic acid of the present invention is also useful as described later. Particularly, a composition in a form suitable for administration to a living body which contains the nucleic acid of present invention carried by a suitable vector is suitable for in vivo gene therapy. A composition that includes the nucleic acid of the present invention as an active ingredient can be administered for treatment of, for example, a cancer [blood cancer (leukemia), solid tumor etc.], an inflammatory disease/autoimmune disease (asthma, eczema), hepatitis, or an infectious disease the cause of which is a virus such as influenza and HIV, a bacterium, or a fungus, for example, a disease such as tuberculosis, MRSA, VRE, or deep mycosis, depending on an antigen to which a CAR encoded by the nucleic acid binds. A composition comprising the nucleic acid of the present invention as an active ingredient can be administered, by any desired route, including but not limited to, intradermally, intramuscularly, lymph vessel, by parenteral administration, for example, by injection or infusion, although the administration route is not particularly limited. Immune Effector Cells Expressing CARs Immune effector cells expressing the CAR of the present invention can be engineered by introducing the nucleic acid encoding a CAR described above into a cell. In one embodiment, the step is carried out ex vivo. For example, a cell can be transformed ex vivo with a virus vector or a non-virus vector carrying the nucleic acid of the present invention to produce a cell expressing the CAR of the present invention. The nucleic acid encoding the CAR of the present invention can be inserted into a vector, and the vector can be introduced into a cell. For example, a virus vector such as a retrovirus vector (including an oncoretrovirus vector, a lentivirus vector, and a pseudo type vector), an adenovirus vector, an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector, a simian virus vector, a vaccinia virus vector or a sendai virus vector, an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) vector, and a HSV vector can be used. Preferably, a virus vector lacking the replicating ability so as not to self-replicate in an infected cell is preferably used. In addition, a non-virus vector can also be used in the present invention in combination with a liposome and a condensing agent such as a cationic lipid as described in WO 96/10038, WO 97/18185, WO 97/25329, WO 97/30170, and WO 97/31934 (which are incorporated herein by reference). The nucleic acid of the present invention can be also introduced into a cell by calcium phosphate transduction, DEAE-dextran, electroporation, or particle bombardment. For example, when a retrovirus vector is used, the process of the present invention can be carried out by selecting a suitable packaging cell based on a LTR sequence and a packaging signal sequence possessed by the vector and preparing a retrovirus particle using the packaging cell. Examples of the packaging cell include PG13 (ATCC CRL-10686), (PNAS 85 (1988):6460-6464). A retrovirus particle can also be prepared using a 293 cell or a 293T-cell having high transfection efficiency. Many kinds of retrovirus vectors produced based on retroviruses and packaging cells that can be used for packaging of the retrovirus vectors are widely commercially available from many companies. In the step of introducing a nucleic acid into a cell, a functional substance for improving the introduction efficiency can also be used (e.g. WO 95/26200 and WO 00/01836 (which are incorporated herein by reference)). Examples of the substance for improving the introduction efficiency include a substance having ability to bind to a virus vector, for example, fibronectin and a fibronectin fragment. Preferably, a fibronectin fragment having a heparin binding site, for example, a fragment commercially available as RetroNetcin (registered trademark, CH-296, manufactured by TAKARA BIC INC.) can be used. Also, polybrene which is a synthetic polycation having an effect of improving the efficiency of infection of a retrovirus into a cell, a fibroblast growth factor, V type collagen, polylysine or DEAE-dextran can be used. In one aspect of the present invention, the functional substance can be used in a state of being immobilized on a suitable solid phase, for example, a container used for cell culture (plate, petri dish, flask or bag) or a carrier (microbeads etc.). In order to assess the expression of a CAR polypeptide or portion thereof, the expression vector to be introduced into a cell can also contain either a selectable marker gene or a reporter gene or both to facilitate identification and selection of expressing cells from the population of cells sought to be transfected or infected through viral vectors. In other aspects, the selectable marker may be carried on a separate piece of DNA and used in a co-transfection procedure. Both selectable markers and reporter genes may be flanked with appropriate regulatory sequences to enable expression in the hosT-cells. Useful selectable markers include, for example, antibiotic-resistance genes, such as neo and the like. Reporter genes are used for identifying potentially transfected cells and for evaluating the functionality of regulatory sequences. In general, a reporter gene is a gene that is not present in or expressed by the recipient organism or tissue and that encodes a polypeptide whose expression is manifested by some easily detectable property, e.g., enzymatic activity. Expression of the reporter gene is assayed at a suitable time after the DNA has been introduced into the recipient cells. Suitable reporter genes may include genes encoding luciferase, beta-galactosidase, Ui-Tei et al., 2000 FEBS Letters 479: 79-82). Suitable expression systems are well known and may be prepared using known techniques or obtained commercially. In general, the construct with the minimal 5 flanking region showing the highest level of expression of reporter gene is identified as the promoter. Such promoter regions may be linked to a reporter gene and used to evaluate agents for the ability to modulate promoter-driven transcription. The cell expressing the CAR of the present invention is a cell in which the nucleic acid encoding a CAR described above is introduced and expressed by the cell. The cell of the present invention binds to a specific antigen via the CAR, and then a signal is transmitted into the cell, and as a result, the cell is activated. The activation of the cell expressing the CAR is varied depending on the kind of a host cell and an intracellular domain of the CAR, and can be confirmed based on, for example, release of a cytokine, improvement of a cell proliferation rate, change in a cell surface molecule, or the like as an index. For example, release of a cytotoxic cytokine (a tumor necrosis factor, lymphotoxin, etc.) from the activated cell causes destruction of a target cell expressing an antigen. In addition, release of a cytokine or change in a cell surface molecule stimulates other immune cells, for example, a B cell, a dendritic cell, a NK cell, and a macrophage. In order to confirm the presence of the recombinant DNA sequence in the cell, a variety of assays may be performed. Such assays include, for example, \"molecular biological\" assays well known to those of skill in the art, such as Southern and Northern blotting, RT-PCR and PCR; \"biochemical\" assays, such as detecting the presence or absence of a particular peptide, e.g., by immunological means (ELISAs and Western blots) or by assays described herein to identify agents falling within the scope of the invention. An immune effector cell such as lymphocytes including but not limited to lymphocytes, T-cells, T helper cells, killer (NK) cells, natural killer T (NKT) cells, mast cells, dendritic cells, killer dendritic cells, or B cells derived from a mammal, for example, a human cell, or a cell derived from a non-human mammal such as a monkey, a mouse, a rat, a pig, a horse, or a dog can be used. For example, a cell collected, isolated, purified or induced from a body fluid, a tissue or an organ such as blood (peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood etc.) or bone marrow can be used. A peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), an immune cell (a dendritic cell, a B cell, a hematopoietic stem cell, a macrophage, a monocyte, a NK cell or a hematopoietic cell (a neutrophil, a basophil)), an umbilical cord blood mononuclear cell, a fibroblast, a precursor adipocyte, a hepatocyte, a skin keratinocyte, a mesenchymal stem cell, an adipose stem cell, various cancer cell strains, or a neural stem cell can be used. In the present invention, particularly, use of a T-cell, a precursor cell of a T-cell (a hematopoietic stem cell, a lymphocyte precursor cell etc.) or a cell population containing them is preferable. Examples of the T-cell include a CD8-positive T-cell, a CD4-positive T-cell, a a cytotoxic T-cell, and a tumor infiltrating lymphocyte. The cell population containing a T-cell and a precursor cell of a T-cell includes a PBMC. The aforementioned cells may be collected from a living body, obtained by expansion culture of a cell collected from a living body, or established as a cell strain. When transplantation of the produced CAR-expressing cell or a cell differentiated from the produced CAR-expressing cell into a living body is desired, it is preferable to introduce the nucleic acid into a cell collected from the living body itself or a conspecific living body thereof. In one embodiment, the CAR expressing cell is a T-cell isolated from a subject for autologous therapy. Typically, prior to expansion and genetic modification of the T-cells of the invention, a source of T-cells is obtained from a subject. T-cells can be obtained from a number of sources, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells, bone marrow, lymph node tissue, cord blood, thymus tissue, tissue from a site of infection, ascites, pleural effusion, spleen tissue, and tumors. In certain embodiments of the present invention, any number of T-cell lines available in the art, may be used. In certain embodiments of the present invention, T-cells can be obtained from a unit of blood collected from a subject using any number of techniques known to the skilled artisan, such as Ficoll separation. In one preferred embodiment, cells from the circulating blood of an individual are obtained by apheresis. The apheresis product typically contains lymphocytes, including T-cells, monocytes, granulocytes, B cells, other nucleated white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. In one embodiment, the cells collected by apheresis may be washed to remove the plasma fraction and to place the cells in an appropriate buffer or media for subsequent processing steps. In one embodiment of the invention, the cells are washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In an alternative embodiment, the wash solution lacks calcium and may lack magnesium or may lack many if not all divalent cations. Initial activation steps in the absence of calcium may lead to magnified activation. As those of ordinary skill in the art would readily appreciate a washing step may be accomplished by methods known to those in the art, such as by using a semi-automated \"flow-through\" centrifuge (for example, the Cobe 2991 cell processor, the Baxter CytoMate, or the Haemonetics Cell Saver 5) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After washing, the cells may be resuspended in a variety of biocompatible buffers, such as, for example, Ca2+-free, Mg2+-free PBS, PlasmaLyte A, or other saline solution with or without buffer. Alternatively, the undesirable components of the apheresis sample may be removed and the cells directly resuspended in culture media. In another embodiment, T-cells are isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes by lysing the red blood cells and depleting the monocytes, for example, by centrifugation through a PERCOLL gradient or by counterflow centrifugal elutriation. CD45RO+ T-cells, can be further isolated by positive or negative selection techniques. For example, in one embodiment, T-cells are isolated by incubation such as DYNABEADS\u00ae M-450 CD3/CD28 T, for a time period sufficient for positive selection of the desired T-cells. In one embodiment, the time period is about 30 minutes. In a further embodiment, the time period ranges from 30 minutes to 36 hours or longer and all integer values there between. In a further embodiment, the time period is at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 hours. In yet another preferred embodiment, the time period is 10 to 24 hours. In one preferred embodiment, the incubation time period is 24 hours. For isolation of T-cells from patients with leukemia, use of longer incubation times, such as 24 hours, can increase cell yield. Longer incubation times may be used to isolate T-cells in any situation where there are few T-cells as compared to other cell types, such in isolating tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from tumor tissue or from immune-compromised individuals. Further, use of longer incubation times can increase the efficiency of capture of CD8+ T-cells. Thus, by simply shortening or lengthening the time T-cells are allowed to bind to the CD3/CD28 beads and/or by increasing or decreasing the ratio of beads to T-cells (as described further herein), subpopulations of T-cells can be preferentially selected for or against at culture initiation or at other time points during the process. Additionally, by increasing or decreasing the ratio of anti-CD3 and/or anti-CD28 antibodies on the beads or other surface, subpopulations of T-cells can be preferentially selected for or against at culture initiation or at other desired time points. The skilled artisan would recognize that multiple rounds of selection can also be used in the context of this invention. In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to perform the selection procedure and use the \"unselected\" cells in the activation and expansion process. \"Unselected\" cells can also be subjected to further rounds of selection. Enrichment of a T-cell population by negative selection can be accomplished with a combination of antibodies directed to surface markers unique to the negatively selected cells. One method is cell sorting and/or selection via negative magnetic immunoadherence or flow cytometry that uses a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies directed to cell surface markers present on the cells negatively selected. For example, to enrich for CD4+ cells by negative selection, a monoclonal antibody cocktail typically includes antibodies to CD14, CD20, CD11b, CD16, HLA-DR, and CD8. In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to enrich for or positively select for regulatory T-cells which typically express CD4+, CD25+, CD62Lhi, GITR+, and FoxP3+. Alternatively, in certain regulatory cells are depleted by anti-C25 conjugated beads or other similar method of selection. For isolation of a desired population of cells by positive or negative selection, the concentration of cells and surface (e.g., particles such as beads) can be varied. In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to significantly decrease the volume in which beads and cells are mixed together (i.e., increase the concentration of cells), to ensure maximum contact of cells and beads. For example, in one embodiment, a concentration of 2 billion cells/ml is used. In one embodiment, a concentration of 1 billion cells/ml is used. In a further embodiment, greater than 100 million cells/ml is used. In a further embodiment, a concentration of cells of 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 million cells/ml is used. In yet another embodiment, a concentration of cells from 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 million cells/ml is used. In further embodiments, concentrations of 125 or 150 million cells/ml can be used. Using high concentrations can result in increased cell yield, cell activation, and cell expansion. Further, use of high cell concentrations allows more efficient capture of cells that may weakly express target antigens of interest, such as CD28-negative T-cells, or from samples where there are many tumor cells present (i.e., leukemic blood, tumor tissue, etc.). Such populations of cells may have therapeutic value and would be desirable to obtain. For example, using high concentration of cells allows more efficient selection of CD8+ T-cells that normally have weaker CD28 expression. In a related embodiment, it may be desirable to use lower concentrations of cells. By significantly diluting the mixture of T-cells and surface (e.g., particles such as beads), interactions between the particles and cells is minimized. This selects for cells that express high amounts of desired antigens to be bound to the particles. For example, CD4+ T-cells express higher levels of CD28 and are more efficiently captured than CD8+ T-cells in dilute concentrations. In one embodiment, the concentration of cells used is 5\u00d7106/ml. In other embodiments, the concentration used can be from about 1\u00d7105/ml to 1\u00d7106/ml, and any integer value in between. In other embodiments, the cells may be incubated on a rotator for varying lengths of time at varying speeds at either 2-10\u00b0 C. or at room temperature. T-cells for stimulation can also be frozen after a washing step. Wishing not to be bound by theory, the freeze and subsequent thaw step provides a more uniform product by removing granulocytes and to some extent monocytes in the cell population. After the washing step that removes plasma and platelets, the cells may be suspended in a freezing solution. While many freezing solutions and parameters are known in the art and will be useful in this context, one method involves using PBS containing 20% DMSO and 8% human serum albumin, 7.5% DMSO or other suitable cell freezing media containing for example, Hespan and PlasmaLyte A, the cells then are frozen to 80\u00b0 C. at a rate of per minute and stored in the vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen storage tank. Other methods of controlled freezing may be used as well as uncontrolled freezing immediately at 20\u00b0 C. or in liquid nitrogen. In certain embodiments, cryopreserved cells are thawed and washed as described herein and allowed to rest for one hour at room temperature prior to activation using the methods of the present invention. Also contemplated in the context of the invention is the collection of blood samples or apheresis product from a subject at a time period prior to when the expanded cells as described herein might be needed. As such, the source of the cells to be expanded can be collected at any time point necessary, and desired cells, such as T-cells, isolated and frozen for later use in T-cell therapy for any number of diseases or conditions that would benefit from T-cell therapy, such as those described herein. In one embodiment a blood sample or an apheresis is taken from a generally healthy subject. In certain embodiments, a blood sample or an apheresis is taken from a generally healthy subject who is at risk of developing a disease, but who has not yet developed a disease, and the cells of interest are isolated and frozen for later use. In certain embodiments, the T-cells may be expanded, frozen, and used at a later time. In certain embodiments, samples are collected from a patient shortly after diagnosis of a particular disease as described herein but prior to any treatments. In a further embodiment, the cells are isolated from a blood sample or an apheresis from a subject prior to any number of relevant treatment modalities, including but not limited to treatment with agents such as natalizumab, efalizumab, antiviral agents, chemotherapy, radiation, immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate, and FR901228, and These drugs inhibit either the calcium dependent phosphatase calcineurin (cyclosporine and FK506) or inhibit the p70S6 kinase that is important for growth factor induced signaling (rapamycin) (Liu et al., Cell 66 (1991):807-815; Henderson et al., Immun 73 (1991):316-321; Bierer et Opin. Immun 5 (1993):763-773). In a further embodiment, the cells are isolated for a patient and frozen for later use in conjunction with (e.g., before, simultaneously or following) bone marrow or stem cell transplantation, T-cell ablative therapy using either chemotherapy agents such as, fludarabine, external-beam radiation therapy (XRT), cyclophosphamide, or antibodies such as OKT3 or CAMPATH. In another embodiment, the cells are isolated prior to and can be frozen for later use for treatment following B-cell ablative therapy such as agents that react with CD20, e.g., Rituxan. In a further embodiment of the present invention, T-cells are obtained from a patient directly following treatment. In this regard, it has been observed that following certain cancer treatments, in particular treatments with drugs that damage the immune system, shortly after treatment during the period when patients would normally be recovering from the treatment, the quality of T-cells obtained may be optimal or improved for their ability to expand ex vivo. Likewise, following ex vivo manipulation using the methods described herein, these cells may be in a preferred state for enhanced engraftment and in vivo expansion. Thus, it is contemplated within the context of the present invention to collect blood cells, including T-cells, dendritic cells, or other cells of the hematopoietic lineage, during this recovery phase. Further, in certain embodiments, mobilization (for example, mobilization with GM-CSF) and conditioning regimens can be used to create a condition in a subject wherein repopulation, recirculation, regeneration, and/or expansion of particular cell types is favored, especially during a defined window of time following therapy. Illustrative cell types include T-cells, B cells, dendritic cells, and other cells of the immune system. Whether prior to or after genetic modification of the T-cells to express a desirable CAR, the T-cells can be activated and expanded generally using methods as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Publication No. 20060121005. Generally, the T-cells of the invention are expanded by contact with a surface having attached thereto an agent that stimulates a CD3/TCR complex associated signal and a ligand that stimulates a co-stimulatory molecule on the surface of the T-cells. In particular, T-cell populations may be stimulated as described herein, such as by contact with an anti-CD3 antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, or an anti-CD2 antibody immobilized on a surface, or by contact with a protein kinase C activator (e.g., bryostatin) in conjunction with a calcium ionophore. For co-stimulation of an accessory molecule on the surface of the T-cells, a ligand that binds the accessory molecule is used. For example, a population of T-cells can be contacted with an anti-CD3 antibody and an anti-CD28 antibody, under conditions appropriate for stimulating proliferation of the T-cells. To stimulate proliferation of either CD4+ T-cells or CD8+ T-cells, an anti-CD3 antibody and an anti-CD28 antibody. Examples an anti-CD28 antibody include 9.3, B-T3, XR-CD28 (Diaclone, Besancon, France) can be used as can other methods commonly known in the art (Berge et al., Transplant Proc. 30(8) Exp. (1999):53-63). In certain embodiments, the primary stimulatory signal and the co-stimulatory signal for the T-cell may be provided by different protocols. For example, the agents providing each signal may be in solution or coupled to a surface. When coupled to a surface, the agents may be coupled to the same surface (i.e., in \"cis\" formation) or to separate surfaces (i.e., in \"trans\" formation). Alternatively, one agent may be coupled to a surface and the other agent in solution. In one embodiment, the agent providing the co-stimulatory signal is bound to a cell surface and the agent providing the primary activation signal is in solution or coupled to a surface. In certain embodiments, both agents can be in solution. In another embodiment, the agents may be in soluble form, and then cross-linked to a surface, such as a cell expressing Fc receptors or an antibody or other binding agent which will bind to the agents. In this regard, see for example, U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 20040101519 and 20060034810 for artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPCs) that are contemplated for use in activating and expanding T-cells in the present invention. In one embodiment, the two agents are immobilized on beads, either on the same bead, i.e., \"cis,\" or to separate beads, i.e., \"trans.\" By way of example, the agent providing the primary activation signal is an anti-CD3 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof and the agent providing the co-stimulatory signal is an anti-CD28 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof; and both agents are co-immobilized to the same bead in equivalent molecular amounts. In one embodiment, a 1:1 ratio of each antibody bound to the beads for CD4+ T-cell expansion and T-cell growth is used. In certain aspects of the present invention, a ratio of anti CD3:CD28 antibodies bound to the beads is used such that an increase in T-cell expansion is observed as compared to the expansion observed using a ratio of 1:1. In one particular embodiment an increase of from about 1 to about 3 fold is observed as compared to the expansion observed using a ratio of 1:1. In one embodiment, the ratio of CD3:CD28 antibody bound to the beads ranges from 100:1 to 1:100 and all integer values there between. In one aspect of the present invention, more anti-CD28 antibody is bound to the particles than anti-CD3 antibody, i.e., the ratio of CD3:CD28 is less than one. In certain embodiments of the invention, the ratio of anti CD28 antibody to anti CD3 antibody bound to the beads is greater than 2:1. In one particular embodiment, a 1:100 CD3:CD28 ratio of antibody bound to beads is used. In another embodiment, a 1:75 CD3:CD28 ratio of antibody bound to beads is used. In a further embodiment, a 1:50 CD3:CD28 ratio of antibody bound to beads is used. In another embodiment, a 1:30 CD3:CD28 ratio of antibody bound to beads is used. In one preferred embodiment, a 1:10 CD3:CD28 ratio of antibody bound to beads is used. In another embodiment, a 1:3 CD3:CD28 ratio of antibody bound to the beads is used. In yet another embodiment, a 3:1 CD3:CD28 ratio of antibody bound to the beads is used. Ratios of particles to cells from 1:500 to 500:1 and any integer values in between may be used to stimulate T-cells or other target cells. As those of ordinary skill in the art can readily appreciate, the ratio of particles to cells may depend on particle size relative to the target cell. For example, small sized beads could only bind a few cells, while larger beads could bind many. In certain embodiments the ratio of cells to particles ranges from 1:100 to 100:1 and any integer values in-between and in further embodiments the ratio comprises 1:9 to 9:1 and any integer values in between, can also be used to stimulate T-cells. The ratio of anti-CD3- and anti-CD28-coupled particles to T-cells that result in T-cell stimulation can vary as noted above, however certain preferred values include 1:100, preferred ratio being at least 1:1 particles per T-cell. In one embodiment, a ratio of particles to cells of 1:1 or less is used. In one particular embodiment, a preferred particle:cell ratio is 1:5. In further embodiments, the ratio of particles to cells can be varied depending on the day of stimulation. For example, in one embodiment, the ratio of particles to cells is from 1:1 to 10:1 on the first day and additional particles are added to the cells every day or every other day thereafter for up to 10 days, at final ratios of from 1:1 to 1:10 (based on cell counts on the day of addition). In one particular embodiment, the ratio of particles to cells is 1:1 on the first day of stimulation and adjusted to 1:5 on the third and fifth days of stimulation. In another embodiment, particles are added on a daily or every other day basis to a final ratio of 1:1 on the first day, and 1:5 on the third and fifth days of stimulation. In another embodiment, the ratio of particles to cells is 2:1 on the first day of stimulation and adjusted to 1:10 on the third and fifth days of stimulation. In another embodiment, particles are added on a daily or every other day basis to a final ratio of 1:1 on the first day, and 1:10 on the third and fifth days of stimulation. One of skill in the art will appreciate that a variety of other ratios may be suitable for use in the present invention. In particular, ratios will vary depending on particle size and on cell size and type. In further embodiments of the present invention, the cells, such as T-cells, are combined with agent-coated beads, the beads and the cells are subsequently separated, and then the cells are cultured. In an alternative embodiment, prior to culture, the agent-coated beads and cells are not separated but are cultured together. In a further embodiment, the beads and cells are first concentrated by application of a force, such as a magnetic force, resulting in increased ligation of cell surface markers, thereby inducing cell stimulation. By way of example, cell surface proteins may be ligated by allowing paramagnetic beads to which anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 are attached (3\u00d728 beads) to contact the T-cells. In one embodiment the cells (for example, 104 to 109 T-cells) and beads (for example, DYNABEADS\u00ae M-450 CD3/CD28 T paramagnetic beads at a ratio of 1:1) are combined in a buffer, preferably PBS (without divalent cations such as, calcium and magnesium). Again, those of ordinary skill in the art can readily appreciate any cell concentration may be used. For example, the target cell may be very rare in the sample and comprise only 0.01% of the sample or the entire sample (i.e., 100%) may comprise the target cell of interest. Any cell number is within the context of the present invention. In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to significantly decrease the volume in which particles and cells are mixed together (i.e., increase the concentration of cells), to ensure maximum contact of cells and particles. For example, in one embodiment, a concentration of about 2 billion cells/ml is used. In another embodiment, greater than 100 million cells/ml is used. In a further embodiment, a concentration of cells of 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 million cells/ml is used. In yet another embodiment, a concentration of cells from 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 million cells/ml is used. In further embodiments, concentrations of 125 or 150 million cells/ml can be used. Using high concentrations can result in increased cell yield, cell activation, and cell expansion. Further, use of high cell concentrations allows more efficient capture of cells that may weakly express target antigens of interest, such as CD28-negative T-cells. Such populations of cells may have therapeutic value and would be desirable to obtain in certain embodiments. For example, using high concentration of cells allows more efficient selection of CD8+ T-cells that normally have weaker CD28 expression. In one embodiment of the present invention, the mixture may be cultured for several hours (about 3 hours) to about 14 days or any hourly integer value in between. In another embodiment, the mixture may be cultured for 21 days. In one embodiment of the invention the beads and the T-cells are cultured together for about eight days. In another embodiment, the beads and T-cells are cultured together for 2-3 days. Several cycles of stimulation may also be desired such that culture time of T-cells can be 60 days or more. Conditions appropriate for T-cell culture include an appropriate media (e.g., Minimal Essential Media or RPMI Media 1640 or, X-vivo 15, (Lonza)) that may contain factors necessary for proliferation and viability, including serum (e.g., fetal bovine or human serum), TNF- or any other additives for the growth of cells known to the skilled artisan. Other additives for the growth of cells include, but are not limited to, surfactant, plasmanate, and reducing agents such as N-acetyl-cysteine added amino acids, sodium pyruvate, and vitamins, either serum-free or supplemented with an appropriate amount of serum (or plasma) or a defined set of hormones, and/or an amount of cytokine(s) sufficient for the growth and expansion of T-cells. Antibiotics, e.g., penicillin and streptomycin, are included only in experimental cultures, not in cultures of cells that are to be infused into a subject. The targe T-cells are maintained under conditions necessary to support growth, for example, an appropriate temperature (e.g., 37\u00b0 C.) and atmosphere (e.g., air plus 5% CO2). T-cells that have been exposed to varied stimulation times may exhibit different characteristics. For example, typical blood or apheresed peripheral blood mononuclear cell products have a helper T-cell population (TH, CD4+) that is greater than the cytotoxic or suppressor T-cell population (TC, CD8+). Ex vivo expansion of T-cells by stimulating CD3 and CD28 receptors produces a population of T-cells that prior to about days 8-9 consists predominately of TH cells, while after about days 8-9, the population of T-cells comprises an increasingly greater population of TC cells. Depending on the purpose of treatment, infusing a subject with a T-cell population comprising predominately of TH cells may be advantageous. Similarly, if an antigen-specific subset of TC cells has been isolated it may be beneficial to expand this subset to a greater degree. Further, in addition to CD4 and CD8 markers, other phenotypic markers vary significantly, but in large part, reproducibly during the course of the cell expansion process. Thus, such reproducibility enables the ability to tailor an activated T-cell product for specific purposes.

The CAR-expressing cells of the invention may also serve as a type of vaccine for ex vivo immunization and/or in vivo therapy in a mammal. Preferably, the mammal is a human. With respect to ex vivo immunization, at least one of the following occurs in vitro prior to administering the cell into a mammal: i) expansion of the cells, ii) introducing a nucleic acid encoding a CAR to the cells, and/or iii) cryopreservation of the cells. The CAR-expressing cells of the present invention can be administered either alone, or as a pharmaceutical composition in combination with diluents and/or with other components such as IL-2 or other cytokines or cell populations. Briefly, pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may comprise a target T-cell population as described herein, in combination with one or more pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable carriers, diluents or excipients.

The scaling of dosages for human administration can be performed according to art-accepted practices. Heterobifunctional Compounds As described above, the CARs of the present invention include an intracellular heterobifunctional compound binding moiety or domain that provides a ligand for a targeting heterobifunctional compound. By including a dTAG in the CAR construct, the CAR as expressed by the CAR expressing cells can be readily and rapidly degraded upon exposure to a heterobifunctional compound, which utilizes the ubiquitin proteasomal pathway to degrade the CAR. In this way, administering a heterobifunctional compound targeting a specific dTAG within a CAR allows for the modulation of the activation of the CAR expressing cell, as degradation of the CAR or a portion thereof within the CAR expressing cell prohibits activation signaling from occurring. This strategy can be utilized to modulate the activation of the CAR expressing cell, for example, to lessen the activation of the CAR expressing cell in order to reduce adverse inflammatory responses. Furthermore, by utilizing a heterobifunctional compound strategy, the CAR expressing cell is spared. Strategies harnessing the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP) to selectively target and degrade proteins have been employed for post-translational control of protein function. Heterobifunctional compounds, are composed of a target protein-binding ligand and an E3 ubiquitin ligase ligand. Heterobifunctional compounds, are capable of induced proteasome-mediated degradation of selected proteins via their recruitment to E3 ubiquitin ligase and subsequent ubiquitination. These drug-like molecules offer the possibility of reversible, dose-responsive, tunable, temporal control over protein levels. An early description of such compounds was provided in U.S. Pat.

It will also be appreciated that certain of the heterobifunctional compounds of the present application can exist in free form for treatment, or where appropriate, as a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof. According to the present application, a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative includes, but is not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, salts of such esters, or a pro-drug or other adduct or derivative of a compound of this application which upon administration to a patient in need is capable of providing, directly or indirectly, a heterobifunctional compound as otherwise described herein, or a metabolite or residue thereof. As used herein, the term \"pharmaceutically acceptable salt\" refers to those salts which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of amines, carboxylic acids, and other types of compounds, are well known in the art. For example, S. M. Berge, et al. describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in J Pharmaceutical Sciences 66 (1977):1-19, incorporated herein by reference. The salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the heterobifunctional compounds of the application, or separately by reacting a free base or free acid function with a suitable reagent, as described generally below. For example, a free base function can be reacted with a suitable acid. Furthermore, where the heterobifunctional compounds of the application carry an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may, include metal salts such as alkali metal salts, e.g. sodium or potassium salts; and alkaline earth metal salts, e.g. calcium or magnesium salts. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid or malonic acid or by using other methods used in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically Representative alkali or alkaline earth metal salts include sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and the like. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, when appropriate, nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations formed using acceptable ester\" refers to esters that hydrolyze in vivo and include those that break down readily in the human body to leave the parent heterobifunctional compound or a salt thereof. Suitable ester groups include, for example, those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable aliphatic carboxylic acids, particularly alkanoic, alkenoic, each alkyl or alkenyl moiety advantageously has not more than 6 carbon atoms. of particular esters include formates, acetates, propionates, prodrugs\" as used herein refers to those prodrugs of the heterobifunctional compounds of the present application which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the issues of humans and lower animals with undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of the application. The term \"prodrug\" refers to compounds that are rapidly transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound of the above formula, for example by hydrolysis in blood. A thorough discussion is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Edward B. Roche, ed., Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, (1987), both of which are incorporated herein by reference. As described above, the pharmaceutical heterobifunctional compound compositions of the present application additionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which, as used herein, includes any and all solvents, diluents, or other liquid vehicle, dispersion or suspension aids, surface active agents, isotonic agents, thickening or emulsifying agents, preservatives, solid binders, lubricants and the like, as suited to the particular dosage form desired. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sixteenth Edition, E. W. Martin (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., (1980)) discloses various carriers used in formulating pharmaceutical compositions and known techniques for the preparation thereof. Except insofar as any conventional carrier medium is incompatible with the compounds of the application, such as by producing any undesirable biological effect or otherwise interacting in a deleterious manner with any other component(s) of the pharmaceutical composition, its use is contemplated to be within the scope of this application. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; talc; excipients such as cocoa butter and waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil; safflower oil, sesame oil; olive oil; corn soybean oil; glycols; such and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, particular, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables. The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use. In order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension or crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues. Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this application with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound. Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The active heterobifunctional compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active heterobifunctional compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose and starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as in normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such as magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.

The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable topical formulation\", as used herein, means any formulation which is pharmaceutically acceptable for intradermal administration of a compound of the application by application of the formulation to the epidermis. In certain embodiments of the application, the topical formulation comprises a carrier system. Pharmaceutically effective carriers include, but are not limited to, solvents (e.g., alcohols, poly alcohols, water), creams, lotions, ointments, oils, hypotonic or buffered saline) or any other carrier known in the art for topically administering pharmaceuticals. A more complete listing of art-known carriers is provided by reference texts that are standard in the art, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th Edition, (1980) and 17th Edition, (1985), both published by Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. In certain other embodiments, the topical formulations of the application may comprise excipients.

Suitable solubilizing agents include, ammonium cyclodextrins, benzyl benzoate, lecithin, and polysorbates. Suitable skin protectants that can be used in the topical formulations of the application include, but are not limited to, vitamin E oil, allatoin, dimethicone, glycerin, petrolatum, and zinc oxide. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable topical formulations of the application comprise at least a compound of the application and a penetration enhancing agent. The choice of topical formulation will depend or several factors, including the condition to be treated, the physicochemical characteristics of the inventive compound and other excipients present, their stability in the formulation, available manufacturing equipment, and costs constraints. As used herein the term \"penetration enhancing agent\" means an agent capable of transporting a pharmacologically active compound through the stratum corneum and into the epidermis or dermis, preferably, with little or no systemic absorption. A wide variety of compounds have been evaluated as to their effectiveness in enhancing the rate of penetration of drugs through the skin. See, for example, Maibach H. I. and Smith H. E. (eds.), Percutaneous Penetration Enhancers, CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, Fla. (1995), which surveys the use and testing of various skin penetration enhancers, and Buyuktimkin et al., Chemical Means of Transdermal Drug Permeation Enhancement in Transdermal and Topical Drug Delivery Systems, Gosh T. K., Pfister W. R., Yum S. I. (eds.), Interpharm Press Inc., Buffalo Grove, Ill. (1997). In certain exemplary embodiments, penetration agents for use with the application include, but are not limited to, triglycerides (e.g., soybean oil), aloe compositions (e.g., aloe-vera gel), ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, N-methylpyrrolidone. In certain embodiments, the compositions may be in the form of ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. In certain exemplary embodiments, formulations of the compositions according to the application are creams, which may further contain saturated or unsaturated fatty acids such as stearic acid, acid, cetyl or oleyl alcohols, and stearic acid being particularly preferred. Creams of the application may also contain a non-ionic surfactant, for example, polyoxy-40-stearate. In certain embodiments, the active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic formulation, eardrops, and eye drops are also contemplated as being within the scope of this application. Additionally, the present application contemplates the use of transdermal patches, which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms are made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. As discussed above, penetration enhancing agents can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel. It will also be appreciated that certain of the heterobifunctional compounds of present application can exist in free form for treatment, or where appropriate, as a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof. According to the present application, a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative includes, but is not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, salts of such esters, or a prodrug or other adduct or derivative of a compound of this application which upon administration to a patient in need is capable of providing, directly or indirectly, a compound as otherwise described herein, or a metabolite or residue thereof. Methods of Modulating CAR Expressing Cell Activity In general, methods of using the heterobifunctional compounds for modulating the activity of a CAR expressing cell as described in the present application comprise administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a heterobifunctional compound of the present application, wherein the heterobifunctional compound is administered in an amount sufficient to induce degradation of the CAR. In certain embodiments, heterobifunctional compounds are useful to modulate or downregulate the activation of the CAR expressing cell, for example a CAR T-cell, for example by degrading the intracellular signaling pathway of the CAR and thus reducing, for example, the release of cytokines by the CAR T-cell due to its activated state. In certain embodiments, according to the methods of treatment of the present application, levels of the CAR in the CAR expressing cell are modulated by contacting CAR expressing cells with a heterobifunctional compound, as described herein. Thus, in another aspect of the application, methods for the modulating of the activity of a CAR expressing cell, for example a CAR T-cell, are provided comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a heterobifunctional compound to a subject in need thereof. In certain embodiments, a method for the modulation of a CAR expressing cell, for example a CAR T-cell, is provided comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of heterobifunctional compound, or a pharmaceutical composition comprising heterobifunctional compound to a subject in need thereof, in such amounts and for such time as is necessary to achieve the desired result. Preferably, the heterobifunctional compound is administered orally or intravenously. In certain embodiments of the present application a \"therapeutically effective amount\" of the heterobifunctional compound is that amount effective for reducing the activity of a CAR expressing cell so that an adverse inflammatory or immune response is modulated or reduced. The heterobifunctional compound s, according to the method of the present application, may be administered using any amount and any route of administration effective for modulating the activity of a CAR expressing cell. The exact amount required will vary from subject to subject, depending on the species, age, and general condition of the subject, the activity of the CAR expressing cell, the particular CAR expressing cell, and the like. In certain embodiments of the present application a \"therapeutically effective amount\" of the heterobifunctional compound is that amount effective for reducing the levels of CARs in a CAR expressing cell. The heterobifunctional compounds of the application are preferably formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. The expression \"dosage unit form\" as used herein refers to a physically discrete unit of therapeutic agent appropriate for the patient to be treated. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the heterobifunctional compounds and compositions of the present application will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient or organism will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the adverse CAR expressing cell inflammatory response; the activity of the specific heterobifunctional compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific heterobifunctional compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific heterobifunctional compound employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts (see, for example, Goodman and Gilman's, \"The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics\", Tenth Edition, A. Hardman and L. Limbird, eds., McGraw-Hill Press, (2001):155-173, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Furthermore, after formulation with an appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in a desired dosage, the pharmaceutical compositions of this application can be administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, or drops), bucally, as an oral or nasal spray, or the like, depending on the severity of the infection being treated. In certain embodiments, the heterobifunctional compound may be administered at dosage levels of about 0.001 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg, or from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. It will also be appreciated that dosages smaller than 0.001 mg/kg or greater than 50 mg/kg (for example 50-100 mg/kg) can be administered to a subject. In certain embodiments, heterobifunctional compounds are administered orally or parenterally. Heterobifunctional compounds (e.g., the bifunctional compounds), once produced, can be characterized using a variety of assays known to those skilled in the art to determine whether the compounds have the desired biological activity. For example, the molecules can be characterized by conventional assays, including but not limited to those assays described below (e.g., treating cells of interest, such as MV4-11 cells, human cell line MM1S, or a human cell line MM1S that is deficient in cereblon, with a test compound and then performing immunoblotting against the indicated proteins such as BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4, or treating certain cells of interest with a test compound and then measuring BRD4 transcript levels via qRT-PCR), to determine whether they have a predicted activity, binding activity and/or binding specificity.

Upon receiving the CAR T-cell, subjects are monitored for development of CRS and other associated toxicities. Subjects suffering from CRS or other CAR T-cell associated toxicities are administered an effective amount of a heterobifunctional compound, for example dFKBP* which targets the dTAG of the exemplary ERB2-CAR-dTAG of SEQ ID NO: 22.

Upon reversal of CRS and/or other associated toxicities, administration of dFKBP* can be withdrawn and CAR re-expression on T-cells monitored by FLOW Cytometry.Example 3 The dTAG is predicated on the selectivity of FKBP* specific ligands over endogenous, wild type FKBP. In 293 T cells expressing wild type FKBP 12 or FKBP*, dFKBP7 induces targeted degradation only in FKBP* expressing cells. An immunoblot of cells treated with bi-functional molecules described in the present invention was performed. 293FT cells (CRBN-WT or CRBN/) expressing either HA-tagged FKBP12WT or FKBP* were treated with indicated concentrations of dFKBP7 for 4 hours. CRBN-dependent degradation of FKBP* and not FKBPWT confirms selective activity of dFKBP7 for mutant FKBP*.Example 4 In an effort to identify potent and selective dFKPB heterobifunctional compounds, high throughput measurements of targeted FKBP* degradation were measured by surrogate levels of luciferase. Here, FKBP* is exogenously expressed as a multicistronic transcript nano luciferase (NLuc) and firefly luciferase (FLuc) that allow for cell normalized quantification of FKBP* protein levels. Degradation of FKBP* is measured as a signal ration (Nluc/Fluc) in wild type ( In 293T cells expressing wild type FKBP12 or FKBP*, treatment with dFKBP7 and dFKBP13 induces targeted degradation only in FKBP* expressing cells. Isogenic 293FT cells (CRBN-WT or CRBN/) were engineered to express either FKBP12WT or FKBP*. Cells were treated with 100 nM of either dFKBP7 or dFKBP13 for 4 hours before lysates were prepared for western immunoblot analysis. CRBN-dependent degradation of FKBP* and not selectivity of dFKBP7 and dFKBP13 for mutant FKBP*.Example 6 In an effort to define the optimal concentration of dFKB13 heterobifunctional compounds to induce degradation of FKBP*, degradation was measured upon treatment with increasing concentrations of dFKBP13. Isogenic 293FT cells (CRBN-WT or CRBN/) were engineered to expressed HA-tagged FKBP*. Cells were treated with the indicated dose of dFKBP13 for 4 hours before lysates were prepared for western immunoblot analysis. These data confirm dose- and CRBN-dependent degradation of HA-tagged FKBP* by dFKBP13.Example 7 To evaluate the kinetic control of targeted degradation FKBP*, dFKBP13 was administered by increased duration. 293FT cells (CRBN-WT) were engineered to express HA-tagged FKBP*. Cells were treated with 100 nM dFKBP13 for the indicated times. Cells were harvested and protein lysates immunoblotted to measure the kinetics of HA-tagged by dFKBP 13.Example 8 293FT cells (CRBN-WT) were engineered to Cells were Carfilzomib (proteasome Lenalidomide (CRBN binding ligand) for two hours prior to a 4 hour treatment with dFKBP13. Lysates were prepared and western immunoblot analysis performed. Degradation of HA-tagged FKBP* by dFKBP13 was rescued by the proteasome inhibitor Carfilzomib, establishing a for inhibitor MLN4924 rescued HA-tagged excess dFKBP13-dependent degradation, confirming the requirement of CRBN engagement for degradation.Example 9 The CAR-dTAG fusion protein is expressed on the membrane of T-cells to form a functional CART-dTAG. The addition of the heterobifunctional compound described in the present invention (dFKBP) leads to efficient and targeted E3 ligase mediated degradation of the CAR via the proteasome. The removal of the dFKBP heterobifunctional compound results in the reactivation of CAR expression. This figure illustrates the principle behind the rheostat mechanism described in the present invention to chemically control CAR levels while leaving the T-cell unaffected.Example 10 Jurkat T-cells were transduced with lentivirus expressing CD19-CAR-dTAG. Cells were selected with blasticidin and expanded. Stable expression of CD19-CAR-dTAG in Jurkat cells was confirmed by anti-HA western immunoblotting of whole cell lysates.Example 11 In an effort to define the optimal concentration of bifunctional molecules to induce degradation of CD19-CAR-dTAG, degradation was measured upon treatment with increasing concentrations of dFKBP7 and dFKBP13. Jurkat T-cells were engineered to express CD19-CAR-dTAG. Cells were treated with the indicated dose of dFKBP7 or dFKBP13 for 4 hours before lysates were prepared for western immunoblot analysis. These data confirm dose-dependent degradation of CD 19-CAR-dTAG in Jurkat T-cells.Example 12 To evaluate the kinetic control of targeted degradation of CD19-CAR-dTAG, a fixed concentration of bi-functional molecules dFKBP7 and dFKBP13 were administered at a fixed concentration for increased duration. Jurkat T-cells were engineered to express CD19-CAR-dTAG. Cells were treated with 250 nM dFKBP7 or dFKBP13 for the indicated time before lysates were prepared for immunoblot analysis. These data confirm time-dependent degradation of CD 19-CAR-dTAG Jurkat T-cells.Example the kinetics of protein following targeting degradation with dFKBP7. Jurkat T-cells engineered to express CD19-CAR-dTAG were treated with 250 nM of dFKBP7 for 4 hours. The dFKBP7 was then removed from the Jurkat cells via washouts and the re-expression of CD19-CAR-dTAG was monitored by immunoblot analysis at the indicated time points. Data suggest that CD19-CAR-dTAG protein levels recovered following removal of dFKBP7.Example 14 Example 15 To test the general utility of the dTAG technology across several protein types, the indicated proteins fused to the dTAG in MV4; 11 leukemia cells were expressed. Upon treatment with the indicated dFKBP bifunctional molecules (dFKBP7 and dFKBP13), targeted protein degradation was observed as measured by western blot. Cells were treated for 16 hours with indicated concentrations of FKBP* selective heterobifunctional compounds and degradation was observed with nanomolar concentrations.Example 16 In N-terminal dTAG-KRAS, dFKBP7 treatment resulted in potent degradation as well as a downstream decrease in p-AKT signal suggesting the biological relevance of overexpressed dTAG fusion proteins. Cells were treated with 500 nM dFKBP7 for the indicated time. Cells were harvested and immunoblotted to measure degradation of FKBP*-KRAS and downstream surrogates of signaling (e.g. pMEK and pAKT). Overexpression of dTAG KRAS resulted in the activation of the relevant downstream signaling pathways as an observed increase in p-AKT signal as measured by western blot.Example 17 In an effort to identify the best performing dFKBP molecule, dTAG-KRAS degradation was profiled across a series of dFKBP molecules. Western blotting of NIH3T3 cells expressing dTAG-KRASG12V were treated with 1 M of the indicated dFKBP heterobifunctional compounds for 24 hours. Cells were harvested and immunoblotted to measure degradation of FKBP*-KRAS and downstream surrogates of KRAS signaling (e.g. pMEK and pAKT). The data suggest that dFKBP9, dFKBP12, and dFKBP13 induce potent degradation of FKBP*-KRAS and dTAG-KRAS concentrations. Western of NIH3T3 cells expressing FKBP* fused to the N-terminus of KRAS treated with the indicated concentrations of dFKBP13 for 24 hours. Cells were harvested and immunoblotted to measure degradation of FKBP*-KRAS and downstream surrogates of KRAS signaling (e.g. pMEK and pAKT). The data suggest that dFKBP13 induces potent degradation of FKBP*-KRAS and inhibits downstream signaling potently with an IC50 >100 nM.Example 19 To evaluate the kinetic control of targeted degradation of dTAG-KRAS, dFKBP13 was administered by increased duration. Western blotting of NIH3T3 cells expressing FKBP* fused to the N-terminus of KRAS treated with 1 M dFKBP13 for the indicated time. Cells were harvested and immunoblotted to measure degradation of FKBP*-KRAS and downstream surrogates of KRAS signaling (e.g. pMEK and pAKT). The data suggest that dFKBP13 induces potent degradation of FKBP*-KRAS and inhibition of downstream signaling as early as 1 hour post treatment.Example 20 Morphological changes were observed in NIH3T3 cells upon overexpression of dTAG-KRAS as shown by phase contrast imaging. Upon treatment with dFKBP13 for 24 hours, cells morphologically revert back to the wild type (DMSO control) state.Example 21 The ATPlite 1-step luminescence assay measures cell proliferation and cytotoxicity in cells based on the production of light caused by the reaction of ATP with added luciferase and D-luciferin. A decrease in signal indicates a reduction in cell number. To evaluate the effect of dFKBP13 on proliferation in NIH3T3 cells expressing dTAG-KRAS, viability was assessed by surrogate measurements of ATP levels. Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of dFKBPs for 72 hours and cell viability was measured using an ATPlite assay.
