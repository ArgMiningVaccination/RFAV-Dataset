We recorded this episode in Brazil, where we first launched the podcast back in 2020. In this episode we got a chance to sit down with Alec Zeck to discuss his newest project and labor of love, The End of Covid educational series. Alec details how he became a personality in the health space of social media and where that path has taken him over the last several years. We then dive in on his newly released educational series called \"The End of Covid\" where he hopes to put virology and the policies of infectious disease to bed, once and for all. It was interesting to hear from somebody who also had personal experiences that motivated him to use the voice he has to make as much change as possible. And his team of collaborators is top shelf, as well. We hope you enjoy this conversation as much as we did. Alec's Bio: Alec Zeck received his B.S. in Systems Engineering from the United States Military Academy at West Point. He is a speaker, writer, podcaster, and former Army Captain. He is the former Executive Director and Founder of Health Freedom for Humanity, the founder of The Way Forward, and Producer of The End Of COVID series.

We also remember Dr. Rashid Buttar who we followed long before the pandemic in Autism circles. He recently passed away after claiming he'd been poisoned as a result of his beliefs around the pandemic and shots.

Many said it would never launch and that its founder, Richard Heart, is the ultimate scammer. But nearly 2 years later and Pulsechain has launched as of last Friday, May 12th. We talk about how we experienced the long wait and why we think the release is worth noting and should be watched going forward. Has Richard done something that hasn't been done before? Its early on but the outlook is good from what we are hearing. We look at how we were introduced to Richard's projects and how the crypto landscape has two faces that we all need awareness to. Only time will tell if Richard Heart has a real hit on his hands but we are listening closely for sure.

What's it all about and can we learn about ourselves from how we consume the world changing at a staggering pace? What is in store for us when everything can be faked? When nothing is able to be trusted, no one is willing to trust anything. ChatGPT is the app of the day but AI is popping up everywhere. Should it be embraced or are we giving up on what makes humanity unique and beautiful? We dive in and even have a chat with the former President himself. Donald Trump. Well, a version of of him at least.

She has a passion for working with parents and children, inspiring the most natural child development to take form. She runs the beautiful Hummingbird pre-school as well as Presence Consulting, teacher parents and educators around the world Waldorf curriculum for an Anthroposophical perspective. In this episode we discussed the teachings of Rudolf Steiner, the true meaning of the word education - the Latin word for education means \"to draw what is within you\". We also discuss the essentials of Eurythmy, the topic racism and gender dysphoria, the challenges in mainstream Waldorf education settings and the affects of the pandemic in education as a whole. We also got to explore the nature of our reality, Steiner's predictions for these times, and our purpose in this plane. She founded the Hummingbird Waldorf Inspired pre-school - operating in Sandpoint Idaho. She also offers consulting services and Eurythmy lessons.

But after Joe Biden's election victory, we didn't hear much more from it. Maybe the social media algorithm stopped favoring it or maybe the election outcome had disappointed those that had been creating content around it. Whatever the case, we wondered if it was still a thing and what were the thoughts of those still participating in it. Thanks to one of our listeners, we got introduced to Dr. Heath Motley. Dr. Motley is an accomplished Chiropractor now living abroad in the Philippines and he also operates a Q-oriented Patriot Telegram group under the name \"Madonna English\". We figured if anyone could bring us up to speed on Q, it would be him. He also wrote a very compelling paper back in 2001 titled, \"HIV - The Achilles Heel of AIDS\" that has some interesting tie-ins with the Pandemic we just experienced. The conversation is an interesting and lively one for sure. We definitely came away hearing about some ideas we hadn't been familiar with before and we learned that Q is still around. Join us to hear what Dr. Motley has to say.

Politics in those larger cities definitely played a role. We thought that politics in small towns would be more in our favor, especially in areas with strong Christian values. What we learned was that there was still a major divide even in a small community. But that divide was more focused around people who were born and raised in the area vs people that transplanted into the area. We discuss that divide with our guest, Steve Fioravanti. Steve ran for County Commissioner in our area and although he won the Republican Primary in the Spring of 2022, he lost to the Primary-losing incumbent Commissioner, who ran as an independent write-in candidate and squeaked out a win in the November election. It was an interesting race leading up to the election and an unexpected election experience for a lot of people in the community, including us. Steve Fioravanti's Bio: Steve is the Leader of the area chapter of the John Birch Society, Republican Candidate for County Commissioner, member of corporate America for over 30 years and a husband and proud father of 4 grown children.
