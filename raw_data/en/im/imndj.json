Keep reading this blog if you want to benefit from it and find out all about it! Ayurveda is a sacred therapeutic science that originated in India more than 5000 years ago. This alternative medicine or traditional medicine unites the elements of nature in our body for different benefits, uses and the way the body reacts. Ayurveda means science of life or wisdom, it has its origin in Indian Sanskrit and comes from the words Ayus (life) and Veda (knowledge). The Ayurvedic doctrine has the concept of the 3 doshas: vata, pitta and kapha, which come from the five elements of nature: earth, water, fire, air and space. These doshas are very important for a healthy life, they are independent and need to be connected, only then a complete well-being of body, mind and soul will be achieved. Here we show you what each of them means: Vata: Changes, movement - Air and ether Pitta: Transformations, dynamics - Water and Fire Kapha: Structure, organisation - Water and earth In order to eliminate any imbalance in the body, Ayurvedic massages can be performed with special Ayurvedic oils (vegetable oils or [essential oils](https://mediterraneanspirit.es/en/what-are-essential-oils/)). An Ayurvedic massage, in contrast to a classical massage, not only takes into account muscles and tissues, but also acts on the nervous system. Ayuveda focuses on physical, emotional, spiritual and mental aspects of health and illness. It has also been recognised by the WHO (World Health Organisation). Ayurvedic cosmetics do not contain preservatives or chemicals and use 100% natural ingredients (oils, plants, flowers, fruits...). Ayurvedic cosmetics are usually natural and organic and have certificates such as EcoCert or BDIH. According to Ayurveda, there are 3 types of skin: Vata skin: It is usually sensitive to cold, has a tendency to premature skin ageing, dehydration and closed pores. Pitta skin: It is very sensitive to the sun, it is easily irritated, has a light complexion with freckles and has a tendency to acne. Kapha skin: Oily skin, with blackheads and sensitive to the sun. Here are some reasons why choosing Ayurvedic skincare is a good choice: The most commonly used ingredients in Ayurvedic cosmetics are: These natural beauty products are used as a base for soaps, creams and body massages. The best known are sesame oil, coconut oil and avocado oil. Both avocado oil and sesame oil are used for hair care and coconut oil is widely used in home cosmetics. Some, such as [rosehip oil](https://mediterraneanspirit.es/en/5-incredible-benefits-of-rosehip/) or [almond oil](https://mediterraneanspirit.es/en/benefits-of-sweet-almond-oil/) or [olive oil](https://mediterraneanspirit.es/en/olive-oil-cosmetic-properties-and-benefits/) are recommended for pitta skin type because they nourish and protect the dermis and finally hazelnut oil or jojoba oil are often used for kapha skin type.

From these two components we obtain biphasic products, a mixture of aqueous and oily products. They are used as [make-up removers](https://mediterraneanspirit.es/en/types-of-makeup-removers-for-face-and-eyes/) and provide nourishment and hydration. Pure essential oils are highly concentrated so very little is added, they are not greasy and dilute very well in creams. The most commonly used are basil, ginger, sweet oranges (used in [our moisturising face serum](https://mediterraneanspirit.es/en/product/anti-aging-facial-serum-vitamin-c/)), frankincense or cinnamon, patchouli, ylang-ylang, damask turmeric, peppermint and black pepper.
