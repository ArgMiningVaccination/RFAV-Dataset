Identification of factors which contribute to delay in receipt of immunisation will help in developing targeted interventions. This study examined prospectively factors contributing to delay in the commencement o f infantimmunisation inBenin City, Nigeria.This was a cross -sectional descriptive study of 153 consecutive mothers of infants presenting for their first immunisation at the Institute of Child Health ChildWelfare Clinic of the University of Benin , BeninCity.Reasons for not presenting in the first 24 hours were ascertained and associations between various factorsand delay in commencement of immunisation were examined. Of the 153 mothers only 2 (1.3%) brought their babies for immunisation within 24 hou rs of birth while 66 (43.1%) brought their babies in the first week of life. The most cited reason (30.3%)for not presenting within 24 hours of birth was that BCG ,one of the immunisation s that should be given at birth is given only on a specificday. Mothers who did not kno w thatimmunisation should co mmence at birth (P=0.0054) ,thosefrom lowsocioeconomic class (P=0.0056) and those with less than 12 years of s chooling (P=0.0001) were significantly less likely to bring their babies for immunisation in the first week of life. Delive ry outside of health facilitieswas also associated with later presentation for immunisation (P=0.0069) .In conclusion, t here is significant delay in the receipt of birth doses of immunisation . Change in clinic practices to ena ble daily immunisation as well as education of health care personnel on the importance of timely commencement of immunisation will ensure timeliness of receipt of birth doses of vaccines . ____________________________________________________________________ ________________ Keywords: factors, delay, commencement, immunisation ,infants, Nigeria Introduction Timeliness in the receipt of immunisation ensures that chi ldren are protected as early as possible from vaccine preventable diseases (Lumanet al., 2002).Delay in commencement of immunisation results in children being susceptible for varying periods of time and they may acquire vaccine preventable infections before they commence immunisation .Such pools of susceptible individuals havebeenknown to contrib ute to epidemics (NVAC,1991). Delay in the commencement of an immunisation series may also lead to delays in the completion of the series (Yusufet al.,2000;Sadoh & Eregie,2009a).Delays in the commencement of child immunisation have been reported glob ally. In the United States of America studies have shown that even though vaccination coverage rates are high only few children receive their vaccination on time (Lumanet al.,2005).In another study in the same country, 12.6% of the studied children were identified to have started immunisation late (Feemster et al.,2009).A study of timeliness of childhood vaccination in 31 low and middle income countries reported substantial vaccination delays (Akmatov & Mikolajczyk ,2012). In Uganda less than half of all children receive dall vaccines within the recommended time (Babiryeet al.,2012). In Nigeria it is recommended that infants receive the first dose of hepatitis B ,Oral Polio and BCGvaccines atbirth(NPHCDA, 2009).Failure of timely initiation of vacc ination in infants has been reported in Sadoh & Eregie, 2008; Olusanya, 2010) .Odusanya (2000) reported wide variations in age at receipt of BCG of between 0 and 225 days and in that study only *Correspondence: Ayebo E. Sadoh; Email: ayebosadoh@yahoo.comTanzania Journal of Health .6 Volume 1 5, Number 3,July 2013 226% of children receive dall their va ccines within the recommended period. Sadoh & Eregie (2008) reported thatonly 2of 512childrenstudiedreceived the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine in the first day of life and17.8%in the first week of life. In another study that examined the causes of delay in the receipt of BCG, about one -thirdof the studied infants were delayed beyond 3 months for the receipt of BCG(Olusanya ,2010). In that study t hefactors associated with delay in comm encement of BCG immunisation were being born outside of hosp ital,under nutrition , lack of antenatal care and multiple gestations .Severe neonatal jaundice was associated with decreased odds of delay in the receipt of BCG (Olusanya ,2010). Some studies have suggested that timeliness of receipt of vaccines be a par t of the assessment of immunisation programmes (Hull & McIntyre, 2006 ;Lumanet al.,2005;Akmatov et al., 2008). Infact,the World Health Organization suggests that the timely delivery of the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine be a performanc e indicator f or hepatitis B immunisation programmes (WHO, 2009a).For appropriate and targeted interventions to be developed to improve timeliness in the initiation and receipt of vaccines it is important to identify the contributing factors. These factors may vary bet ween countries and between regions in the same country. In Nigeria earlier studies on timeliness were either retrospective (Sadoh & Eregie ,2009a) or did not inquire from mothers the reasons for delay (Olusanya ,2010).Theobjective of this study was to pr ospectively assess the factors that contribute to delay in commencing immunisation among children in Benin City in Nigeria . Materials and Methods Study area The study was carried out at the Child Welfare clinic of the Institute of Child Health, Universit y of Benin, Benin City between December 2010 and June 2011 . TheChild Welfare clinic of the Institute of ChildHealthoffers services to the inhabitants of Benin City, the capital of Edo State, Nigeria. The services offered include immunisation s, growth mo nitoring, nutrition education and general health education. About 1 ,000 babies receive their immunisation s in this facility yearly. Sample size and data collection The respondent s were mothers of infants being evaluated for serological markers of hepatit is B. The sample size was determined using the formula n=z2pq d2 where:n= the desired sample size ;z= the standard normal deviate set at 1.96 which corresponds to 95% confidenc e interval ;p= the proportion in the target population estimated to be positive for the hepatitis B surface antigen( estimated to be 10.8% using the prevalence found in an earlier study (Abiodun & Okolo,1991) in Benin City, Nigeria, the study locale) ;q= 1.0-p;d= degree of accuracy desired which is 0.05 .This gave a minimalsample size of 148.03 . Consecutive m others of infants presenting for their first immunisation who consented to participate in the study were interviewed. Socio-demographi c data such asdate of birth of the infant, sex of the infant, maternal age, paternal age, maternal education, paternal education, maternal occupation, paternal occupation, parity of mother receipt of antenatal care for the index child and place of deliver y were obtained. The outcome variable was the age in days at presentation for first immunisation . Determinant factors included the knowledge of mothers about recommended age for commence ment of childhood immunisation , the source of such knowledge and socio -demographic factors. Mothers who did not bring their infant for immunisation within 24 hours of birth were asked the reason (s)for the delay.Tanzania Journal of Health Research Doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/thrb.v15i3 .6 Volume 1 5, Number 3,July 2013 3Data analysis Data was entered into an SPSS version 13 spreadsheet. Analysis was done using the same soft ware and Graphpad Instat 3. Data was summari zed into frequency distribution tables.Associations between categorical variables were tested using Chi square test and Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Level of significance was set at p<0.05. Socioeconomic class w as determined using the educational level and occupation of both parents of each child as described by Oyediji et al. (1985). Scores were awarded for the occupation and the educational level of the parents. The mean of the four scores (two for the mother a nd two for the father) to the nearest whole number was the social class assigned to the child. The minimum mean score was 1 corresponding to social class 1 while the maximum mean score was 5 corresponding to social class 5 .

The mean age of fathers was 36.0\u00b17.4years(range=19-59years).The mean parity of the mothers was 2.7\u00b11.7with a rangeof 1 to 10. Of the 153 mothers, 141(92.2%) received antenatal care. Of the 148 mothers wh o responded to the question on why the children were not brought for immunisation earlier, 47 (30.3%) said they had to wait for the day when BCG is given at the immunisation clinic (BCG is given only on Fridays in the immunisation clinic)(Table2). Of the mothers studied 41( 26.8%) knew that immunisation should commence at birth while 74(48.4%) feltimmunisation should commence within the first week of life. A bout a third of the mothers 32 (20.9%) did not know the age at commencement of immunisation for infants.Mothers who knew that immunisation should commence at birth were more likely to present within the first week of life than those who didn't have the knowledge (P=0.0054) (Table 3).

Eight(12.5%) mothers who werealsoclassified as having received their information from the health care system were health care workers. The source of the i nformation about age at comme ncement of immunisation wasnot significantly associated with whether the infants received their first immunisation in the first wee k of life or later (P=0.5588). Nine(75%)of the babies in socioeconomic class (S EC)1 presented within the first week of life compared to 13 (52%)of 25 in SE C2, 30(50%) of 60 in SE C3and 11(25%) of44 in SEC4. The difference in presentation based on SE Cwas significant (P=0.0056).Tanzania Journal of Health Research Doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/thrb.v15i3 .6 Volume 1 5, Number 3,July 2013 5Table 4: Relationship between source of information on when t o commence immunisation and age at presentation for first immunisation Age at presentation (days)Health care system Intuition Media/Books Family/Friends P-value N % N % N %N % 7 30 46.9 11 39.3 3 75.0 6 40.0 >7 34 53.1 17 60.7 1 25.0 9 60.00.5588a Total 64 28 4 15 aChi square Of the mothers delivering in a health facility ,50% brought their infants for immunisation within the first week of life compared to 20.7%of those who delivered outside a health facility. This difference was stati stically significant (P=0.0069).Mothers who had beyond secondary education were more likely to bring their infants for immunisation in the first week of life compare d tothose with secondary or below secondary education (P=0.0001). Discussion In this st udy asignificant proportion of thechildren werepresentedlate for immunisation s scheduled to be received at birth. This finding is similar to previous findings although there was a reduction in the number of children presenting after the fourth week inthis study compared to earlier studies (Sadoh & Eregie ,2009a; Olusanya ,2010).The median age at presentation was 9 days (1.3weeks) which is less than the 2. 1weeksreported for low and middle income countries (Akmatov & Mikolajczyk ,2012).There has bee n progress in immunisation activities in many of these countries (Machingaidze et al.,2013)such that the reported median may no longer be representativ e. The mean age at presentation inthis study was lower than the 26 daysfrom an earlier study in BeninCity suggesting an improvement in timeliness (Sadoh & Eregie ,2008).Majority of the children presented within the first two weeks of life. Th enational guidelines (NPHCD,2009),recommend that the birth dose oforal polio vaccine must be given before 2 weeksof life.This may have been misinterpreted and misunderstood by mothers. There is thus a need for emphasis on the receipt of birth doses soon after birth. The implication of delays in receipt of immunisation is that the children may acquire the target infections before the infant receives the requisite immunisation . This is especially important for vertical transmission of hepatitis B which is preventable by prompt administration of the birth dose within 24 hours of birth (WHO,2001). The vaccination schedules in health facilities contributed to delays in commencement of vaccination in this study. Although this may bejustified for vaccines whose vials may be used once after opening, there is a need to address this situation including increasing the nu mber of days in a weekfor vaccination with particular vaccines (such as BCG). BCG is given only on Fridays in the immunisation clinic where the study was carried out. In most other immunisation clinics in Benin City BCG is given only on specific days. Alt hough 80% of the babies were born in health facilities only two infants commenced immunisation before leaving the hospital where they were born. They had only receivedBCG and not hepatitis B. Th is means that health care workers are not immunizing infants born in their facilities. Similarobservation ha s been reported previously (Sadoh & Eregie ,2009b). Thisdoesnot only contribute to the observed delays but also to missed immunisation opportunities in some infants as their birth in a health facility may b e their only contact with the formal health care setting.This study also showed that babies delivered in a health facility were more likely to commence immunisation in the first week of life. This seeming incongruence is probably attributable to a lack o f emphasis on timel y administration of vaccines at birth while promoting immunisation .Tanzania Journal of Health Research Doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/thrb.v15i3 .6 Volume 1 5, Number 3,July 2013 6Lack of knowledge on the age at which immunisation should commence and the place of immunisation suggest that health care workers are not providing adequate information at antenatal clinicsand maternity wards as over 90% of the mothers received antenatal care while over 80% of the mothers had their deliveries in health facilities. In a review of the grey literature (WHO,2009b), health workers were noted to \"often commun icate little and poorly with mothers so that many leave not knowing when to return.\" Some of the mothers in this study also did not seem to appreciate the importance of immunisation as they gave such excuses as wanting to restand waiting to circumcise theinfant as reasons for the delay in bringing their infants for immunisation .Waiting to circumcise male infants (usually done on the seventh day of life) may have contributed to females being brought earlier for immunisation .Health care workers can correc t such impressions by emphasizing the importance of immunisation during contacts with mothers either antenatally or post delivery and duringimmunisation sessions. It is important that mothers obtain correct immunisation information as they may disseminate such information especially to mothers who neither receive antenatal care nor deliver in a health facility. The role of husbands in the care of children was bro ught to the fore as a few mothers indicated the absence of their husbands as the reason forpresenting late fo rimmunisation . Some of the delay was also due to maternal illness. Fathers could have brought the infants for immunisation in these instances. Encouraging fathers to be more involved in child care may improve the timeliness of uptake of immunisation . Several factors were found in this study to be associated with delay in receipt of birth doses ofimmunisation . Mothers who did not kno w thatimmunisation should commence at birth were less likely to bring their infants for immunisation in thefirst week of l ife. High socioeconomic status, having a maternal education above secondary school and delivery in a health facility were significantly associated with receiving immunisation in the first week of life. These factors have previously been iden tifiedas being associated with timeliness of receipt Since timeliness of immunisation especially birth doses is important in the prompt and effective prevention of someperinatal infections, it is important to proffer solutions to mitigate delays. Appropriate health education with emphasis on receipt of birth doses within 24 hours of birth should be carried out. The importance of immunisation should also be emphasized in such health education activities. The importance of antenatal care and immunisation session health education activities as well as health care workers as sources of health care information is demonstrated in this study as majorit y of the mothers got their information from health care related sources. This finding is similar to that of a study from south western Nigeria where about two thirds of the mothers studied obtained information on immunisation from the antenatal clinics (Adeyinkaet al.,2009). In Libya more than half of mothers of completely immunized children got immunisation information from a health worker (Bofarraj,2011).Mothers who got their information from the media and books (although small in num ber)also tended to bring their babies early for immunisation . This finding is similar to that in a multilevel analysis of factors associated with low immunisation coverage in Sub - Saharan Africa which showed that access to the media reduced the odds of the child being unimmunized. (Wiysonge et al., 2012). Studies have shown varying effect sof education on immunisation coverage. In a study from the United States of America ,maternal collegeeducation was positively associated with timeliness (Lumanet al.,2005). This is in keeping with findings in this study. Education of the girl child beyond secondary level is important. Also the content of such educ ation should include important hea lth topics such as immunisation , receipt of antenat al care as well as delivery with a skill ed birth attendant.Tanzania Journal of Health Research Doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/thrb.v15i3 .6 Volume 1 5, Number 3,July 2013 7It is possible that some factors contributing to delay in initiation of immunisation may not have been explored because this study is facility based. A major strength of this study is that it is prospective thus reducing the possibility of recall bias. Also this study ascertained from mothers the reasons for delay and not just examining association of factors with delay. This study has shown that many of the studied infants didnot commence immunisation early with resultant delays in re ceipt of birth doses of recommended vaccines. A major contributory factor is in the implementation of immunisation activities such that certain immunisation s are only given on specific days. It is recommended that health care personnel be educated on the n eedtoorganize immunisation activities to allow for daily immunisation s.The need for immunisation of babies born at health facilities at birth should also be emphasized.
