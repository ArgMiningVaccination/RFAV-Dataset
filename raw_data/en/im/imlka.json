Increasing evidence reveals that an estimated 10-50% of those previously infected with COVID-19 face a longer-term or long-term health impact and/or chronic debilitation that in many cases comes and goes in waves. This phenomenon has already been referred to as a pandemic within the pandemic. The broad-based and long-term impact of COVID Long Haulers have also holds the potential to change our world and modern society, lasting through the following three outlined speculative trends: (1) The coronavirus crisis has widened novel and already existing inequalities, of which the rather surprising finance performance versus real economy liquidity constraint gap led to unequal emotional and socio- psychological crisis fallout propensities. Corporate governance and political economy power dynamics may shift in the eye of Long Haulers' relation to work and a healthy, productive environment. Employers will likely face pressure to create a safe and secure working environment but also have rising tort liability risks that may be mitigated by hiring health consulting agents. Proactive care for maintaining a healthy workforce and the overall long-term well-being of employees, including preventive care in teams, will become an essential corporate feature to attract qualified labor, whose bargaining power increased in the eye of labor shortages in direct contact industries and positions.

I. INTRODUCTION The novel coronavirus that first emerged in 2019 is perhaps the most unexpected global shock in the modern era. COVID-19 dramatically changed behavioral patterns around the world and will have a lasting impact on society.1 By now, over 250 million recorded infections2 have caused over 5 million 1.See ECONOMICS IN THE TIME OF COVI D-19 (Richard Baldwin & Beatrice Weder di Mauro eds., 2020), https://cepr.org/sites/default/files/news/COVI D-19.pdf [https://perma.cc/G3X7- QUN5 ] (giving a general overview of the crisis and economic fallout). 2.This figure includes multiple infection counts but excludes those infected, who did not test for a COVI D-19 infection.2022] GENERATION COVID-19 LONG-HAUL 49 documented deaths3 in more than 220 countries and territories around the globe.4 According to estimates, the actual number of infections is four to thirteen times the reported and recorded case numbers.5 Without even considering the variants that have emerged, early scientific estimates predicted that about 80% of the world's population would get infected with the virus at some point, with the greatest impact in densely populated areas.6 With the initial virus being replaced by different variants, epidemiologists increasingly believe that all human beings will have touchpoints with COVID at some point in their lives.7 Over the course of the spread of the novel coronavirus, people around the world have become aware that taking preventive measures can limit the spread of the deadly and debilitating virus - including social distancing and social contact tracking, collective and individual hygiene, preventive healthcare and foresighted nutrition, as well as vaccination and medication.8 The further the 3.Mortality count varies by country, but in general includes all who were tested as infected at the moment of death. The figure does not count for death due to coronavirus externalities, such as suicide without infection, those who died without having COVI D-19 but did not get medical attention, or help due to hospital capacity constraints or delayed medical attention. 4.See Coronavirus Cases, WORLDOMETER, Study Estimates US COVI D-19 Infections May Be 4 Times Higher Than Reported, CNN (Jan. 5, 2021, 11:14 by the Numbers: Why the Pandemic is 10 Times Worse Than You Think, NPR (Feb. 6, Much Higher Than Reported Cases in Parts of U.S., Study Shows, N.Y.

From 10% to upwards of 50% of those previously infected with COVID develop long-term symptoms of the disease, which are often diffuse, come in waves, and - to this day - are not well understood.9 Some of these ongoing long-haul patients seem to recover completely, but simply take more time to do so than the average fourteen-day recovery period. On the other hand, some patients still struggle a long time after their initial infection - potentially due to an immune system reaction and an overactivation of the body's unspecific immune system and/or an awakening of an autoimmune disease or other previous infections (causing complications such as shingles).10 With this broad-based and long-term impact on the status of health of society in mind as a driver of societal well-being and productivity, and with no direct cure against the long-term implications of COVID-19 at hand yet, we can say that COVID-19 will be the most impactful external shock triggering lasting change in our lifetimes.11 From the history of humankind and the knowledge about previous diseases, we can draw the inference that crises have always been turning points and ultimate spring feathers of lasting societal development.12 This Article argues that 19, 2021, at 99-104; see also Rita Rubin, As Their Numbers Grow, COVID-19 \"Long Haulers\" Stump Experts, 14 J.

The large- scale dimension of COVID-19 infections around the world is underscored by an estimated 10-50% of those previously infected with COVID-19 facing some kind of longer-term or long-term health impact and/or chronic debilitation that is currently not well-understood by the medical profession.13 Given the worldwide spread of the virus and that the demographic likelihood to become a COVID Long Hauler peaks in the 30-50 years of age bracket, we can predict a large-scale, long-term and global impetus of COVID long-haul induced change. This Article argues that the phenomenon of long-haul COVID has the potential to transform our world and modern society. With attention to other historical examples - such as the post-World War II era - we speculate about three potential major developments. The presence of a generation of COVID Long Haulers has the potential to change the law, economics, and governance through the following predictive and debatable trends: (1) In the overall economy, the COVID-19 crisis with lockdowns and urgent healthcare needs has produced a major consumption shift that has produced winning and losing industries. The finance world has largely been able to avoid harm by diversifying and flexibly replacing winning for losing industries in well- managed portfolios, as well as by shorting and hedging of sectors with a prospective loss during the crisis. At the same time, the real economy has often been hit by bankruptcy and liquidity constraints that played out in harmful choices and negative socio-psychological fallouts. All of this has widened an exacerbating finance performance versus real economy gap. Corporate and political power dynamics may shift in light of Long Haulers' relation to work and their appreciation of a healthy environment to be productive. Employers will likely face pressure to create a safe and secure working environment. Employers may also have rising tort liability risks that may be mitigated by hiring health consultants. Pro-active care for maintaining a healthy workforce and the overall long-term well-being of employees, including preventive care in teams, will become an essential corporate feature to attract qualified labor, whose bargaining power increases in the eye of labor shortages in human-facing industries and positions.14 https://www.oekowellness.de/laenderuebergreifende-konzerenz-zum-thema-system-change-die- chance-der-transformation-des-gesundheitswesens-14-07-2020/ [https://perma.cc/CU7 9; Searing, supra note 9. 14.Teresa Ghilarducci, Are Firms Causing People to Quit?

Generation COVID-19 Long-Haul will likely turn to digitalization and may erode resistance against artificial intelligence taking over tasks previously performed by humans. (2) Artificial intelligence, robotics, and big data offer essential complements and insights to substitute for long-haul attention and productivity deficits that may occur in waves. COVID-19 Long Haulers may embark on an artificial intelligence revolution triggered by medical self-monitoring, constant health status tracking, and real-time scanning of their environment for harmful aerosols with IT solutions. The social media instant information exchange may also lead to a democratization of healthcare information without medical professionals as gatekeepers. Long COVID patients are a self-identified disease group as Long Haulers have already found themselves in online self-help groups - such as Survivor Corps - for quick and unbureaucratic information exchange about an emerging group phenomenon. Social online media platforms served as easy remedies during a time when a surge of severe COVID cases precluded COVID hospitalization. The congested situation in intensive care units around the world has driven a trend of COVID long-haul patients becoming citizen scientists who bundle decentralized information on their health status and potential remedies in online social media forums in order to inform the medical profession about newly emerging trends. The rise in medical self-help and mutual support will have profound implications for the regulation of the medical profession and will likely boost alternative medicine and over-the-counter drugs. Implicit monopolization of pharmaceutical markets and biased subscription favoritism may become harder when access to healthcare information and medication remedy but also side effects become more transparent in the digital age. At the same time, however, in the instant online exchange of sensitive information about one's health status, citizen scientists are particularly vulnerable in terms of their privacy and potentially susceptible to online marketing campaigns under medically impaired conditions. The legal profession at the forefront, but also regulatory agencies overseeing the market and society at large will have to find solutions to protect Long Haulers in their public disclosure of sensitive information online over time. (3) With reference to historical precedents of the past, Generation COVID Long-Haul partially being recognized as a disability may result in increased pressures to reform social, healthcare and retirement systems on a large scale. Especially when considering the relatively young age of COVID-19 long-hauling onsets, which is currently estimated to peak around the ages of 30 to 50, the long- term impetus of this usually highly productive part of society being slowed and/or weakened will be substantial when considering the expected decline in tax revenue from this age group's working income. Given that around 70 to 75% of Long Haulers are currently estimated to be female, but also taking into account that about one third of all Long Haulers' hefty-coronavirus-stimulus-11598440184 [https://perma.cc/Z35G-VVXA ].2022] GENERATION COVID-19 LONG-HAUL 53 symptoms come in waves during debilitating COVID long-haul episodes, the future analysis of macroeconomic aggregates and policy impacts is likely to reflect a more diversified gender-sensitive and temporal view of social preferences under unpredictably changing conditions.15 Future economic policy research may be inspired by the legal concept of disparate impact, which could help elucidate the aggregate production function calculus as the standard measure of economic growth. It could also inform a more diversified and individual intertemporal discounting function. Behavioral insights on navigating a turbulent world with attention deficits and under uncertainty about health status conditions may become fundamental for developing an idea of the economic benefits of rest by incorporating preferences for minimalism in a complex world longing for recovery. Speculating about these potential future trends lies at the core of navigating through a turbulent time with vigilance. After all, history offers a vital account of multiple records when crises, upheaval and periods of severe social and economic disruptions and their following recovery periods became essential turning points for lasting societal change and spring feathers of eventual betterment. Overall, these consequences allow us to draw larger lessons for law, governance, and economic analysis. In the future, we may see a reconfiguring of institutions in many jurisdictions and a different understanding of health and well-being contributing to a more behaviorally informed economic profession. Social and economic phenomena, such as corporate governance, are sometimes analogized to biological evolution.16 As the shock of the pandemic had an immediate effect on all countries around the world, COVID-19 long-haul is likely to change the larger economic environment and societal structure of modern democracies for years to come. We can expect COVID-19 and a growing pandemic of long-term debilitated to cause substantial changes in corporate governance and related fields that will have a lasting impact for our future to come. Thus, as long-haul symptoms persist, we are likely to see direct and indirect persistent effects in the future. Taking this net of diverse effects together, the Article ends with public policy recommendations and guidance for implementation paying attention to contemporary and anticipated long-haul patterns and trends. In the wake of ambitious bailout and recovery plans, a law and economics view could highlight necessary disparate impact facets of economic fallouts to a common crisis that should be considered when choosing capital transfer targets strategically and driven by fairness mandates and with a 15.Rubin, supra note 8. 16.See Martin Gelter & Julia M.

All measures laid out18 point toward fundamental societal changes.19 Governments around the globe have therefore set out on a course to avert the negative impetus of the COVID-19 pandemic economic shock.20 This Article aims to address these major trends and developments that are unique features of the COVID-19 crisis to highlight their relevance in determining future-oriented policies and multifaceted recovery aid.21 Overall, we argue that the COVID-19 pandemic, as the most massive exogenous shock and subsequent policy changes in relation to a drastic long-term health status shift of major parts of the productive workforce and society, has the potential to change many aspects of the individual consumer, the family compound, societal care systems, and economic incentives for market actors and industries. Paying attention to anticipated disruption fallouts will aid governments around the world in confronting the crisis but also to reinterpret the way we produce, consume and - most importantly - live our lives productively, healthily, and within a fair society that acts in harmony with the environment. By learning from our history, and in particular from the resilience exposed to previous crises, we will hopefully emerge from COVID-19 stronger as a society in the long term and with gifts of better lives for future generations to come.22 This Article proceeds as follows. Part 2 describes the impact of the external shock of COVID-19 on humankind with particular attention to the COVID long- haul phenomenon. Part 3 explores three long-haul trends. First, section 3.1 discusses governance and political economy power dynamic shifts in view of Long Haulers' relation to work, paying attention to an unprecedented demand for a healthy productive workplace environment.

COVID-19 The new Coronavirus (also referred to as \"SARS-CoV-2,\" or \"COVID-19\") is an infectious disease that was first diagnosed in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.23 First in January of 2020, international entities, foremost the World Health Organization, were alarming about COVID-19 and subsequently declared the state of emergency with international relevance. By March 2020, COVID-19 was recognized as the outbreak of a global pandemic.24 As of the end of 2021, over 250 million infected cases are known and over 5 million COVID-19 induced deaths have been recorded in over 220 countries and national entities in all World Health Organization territories.25 Actual infection rates may be higher, adding from 5% to 30% more infected to the reported numbers.26 COVID-19 causes blood vessel changes that affect people in different ways, ranging from no symptoms to mild cases and severe illness and death. Symptoms may appear at different times, either immediately or - as most infected report - within several days. Incubation time intervals range from 2-14 days or 4-6 days depending on COVID-19 variants - but also some mild cases have been reported to cause health impairment a long time after the initial infection. Some cases of infection turn out to be relatively mild but tend to exhibit often seemingly unrelated symptoms appearing months after the initial infection. These so-called COVID-19 Long Hauler cases often show widespread and diffuse symptoms coming on and off in waves. To this day, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\") continues to update the list of COVID-19 induced symptoms and related 23.Timeline: WHO's COVI D-19 Response, WORLD HEALTH ORG., Undercounting of COVI D-19 Cases in U.S., Other Countries Estimated via Model, SCIENCEDAILY (Feb. 8, 2021), https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/02/210208142434.htm [https://perma.cc/4HJV-P8UQ].56 INDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW [Vol. 19:47 health complications as well as psychological impairments.27 The most common signs of a COVID-19 infection are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Other symptoms often noticed include shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, muscle aches, chills, sore throat, running nose, headaches, and chest pain. Addi tional COVID-19 impairments include loss of taste or smell, congestion, nausea, vomiting diarrhea, confusion, sleepiness, insomnia, skin, gum, and tongue outbreaks.28 Depending on age and pre-existing conditions, COVID-19 can lead to acute complications such as organ failure, cytokine storms, blood clots, and septic shock.29 Of the over 250 million COVID-19 individuals reported to have been infected, 99.4% appeared to have had only mild conditions, and only 0.6% are/were considered seriously and/or critically ill.30 Of the reported closed COVID-19 infection cases so far, in 2% the COVID-19 disease led to death, while 98% of the infected are considered to have recovered from acute symptoms.31 Why any particular patient falls into either of these groups of immune responses to COVID-19 is yet unclear, but certain disease trajectory propensities seem to depend on gender, age and pre-existing conditions. Moreover, the viral load exposure to the virus and other infections influence the course of the disease alongside a range of genetic predispositions and environmental pre-COVID episodes.32 The COVID-19 fatality rate varies between 2.8% for male and 1.7% for female patients.33 As for the COVID-19 fatality rate by comorbidity, pre-existing conditions increase the death rate to 10.5% across cases of cardiovascular diseases, 7.3% for diabetes, 6.3% for chronic respiratory diseases, 6% for hypertension, and 5.6% for cancer.34 Underlying conditions and pre-existing health impairments - such as, for instance, diabetes, lung disease, cancer, immunodeficiency, heart diseases, hypertension, asthma, kidney disease, and GI/liver diseases - appear to play a major role in determining the outcome likelihoods of a COVID-19 infection.35 Nutrition and prevention influence the disease trajectory and sickness outcome, as do precautions and vigilance, such as being vaccinated against COVID-19, targeted medication, not getting exposed to a high viral load, and avoiding 27.Post-COVID Conditions: Information for Healthcare Providers, CTRS.

In addition, the multiple COVID variants existent by now impact the transmission likelihood and trajectory of the disease in symptoms and outcome differently.36 B. Potential Long-Haul Impact of COVID-19 In about 10-50% of those symptomatically or asymptomatically previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, impairment continues long after the infection - in some cases even after having been tested negative for COVID-19.37 Long COVID, also known as post-COVID-19 syndrome, post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (\"PASC\"), chronic COVID syndrome (CCS) and long-haul COVID is a persisting convalescence period after a coronavirus disease 2019 infection.38 Post-COVID conditions comprise a wide range of new, returning and/or ongoing health problems that individuals can experience four or more weeks after the first infection.39 So-called COVID-19 Long Haulers face impairment lasting more than 4-12 weeks after exposure to the virus. The degree, duration and frequency of impairment varies - some face constant issues, while it is estimated that around one third of COVID Long Haulers face recurrent waves of symptoms after their initial infection.40 The range of long COVID symptoms is wide and diffuse. Survey data collected early on by a self-organized Facebook Long Hauler group called Survivor Corps consisting of 1567 respondents struggling with long-term COVID identified almost 100 long-haul effects that include fatigue (100% previously- COVID-infected survey takers reported it as a recurrent symptom), muscle or body aches (66.8%), shortness of breath or difficulty breathing (65.1%), difficulty concentrating or focusing (59%), inability to exercise or be active (58.5%), headache (57.6%), difficulty sleeping (49.9%), anxiety (47.6%), memory problems and dizziness (41.9%) among the top long-haul symptoms.41 Follow-up studies revealed a cluster of symptoms ranging from chest pain and cough, dyspnea and cough, anxiety and tachycardia, abdominal pain and nausea as well as lower back pain or joint pain.42 The list of symptoms is still being updated while the CDC issued guidelines call for empathy with Long Haulers.43 36.Id. 37.Hart, supra 32; Post-COVI & PREVENTION, Patients Were 2021), https://www. many-long-haul-covid-19-patients-were-asymptomatic-during-initial-infection Post-58 INDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW [Vol. 19:47 Longer lasting COVID-19 symptoms appear to come in waves, can be wide- ranging, and include - by now - over 200 different symptoms, such as cognitive dysfunction, numbness or tingling, loss of taste, smell and other senses like hearing and vision, muscle pain, tinnitus, heart rate and blood pressure issues, inflammation, joint pain, gastrointestinal discomfort, insomnia, depression and anxiety but also dermatological anomalies mainly in the gum, hands, fingers, feet and toes.44 From the physical but also the psychological standpoint, COVID long- haul impairment is reported to be particularly challenging.45 The etiology of COVID-19 Long Haulers currently appears to fall in three major - partially overlapping - groups of health problem clusters: (1) those with strong infection cases and long-term organ or tissue damage, (2) those with initially mild cases that develop waves of obscure symptoms that either resemble inflammatory and/or autoimmune diseases, and/or (3) neurological impairments that bleed into a traumatized psychological state.46 Recovery remains unclear but for irreversible damage, such as scars on lungs, and damage to the heart tissue, transplantations appear the most promising long- run remedy. As for remainders of the virus and the immune system still working on clearing all body parts of the previous virus invasion, symptoms will likely be curable over time and may come and go, such as in herpes, shingles, Ebola, or malaria. Recurrent waves of weakness may persist for a long period of time for this cluster of COVID Long Haulers but appear to have an overall upwards trajectory of recovery.47 For patients with overshooting immune activation, like Lyme disease or virologically-triggered rheumatoid arthritis, immunosuppressants may aid but may create long-term disabling conditions if considering the relatively young age of COVID long-haul onset. The demographic impact of long-haul COVID appears to fall disproportionally heavily on 30-50 years young females with a mean age of around 42 years at the time of their initial infection.48 The average COVID Long Haulers are in their late thirties and early forties, with females making up an COVI D Conditions, supra note 38. 44.Alicia Ault, Are (July 12, SCIENTIA MORALITAS CONF.

Generation COVID-19 Long-Haul A recent study of 6,500 COVID Long Haulers estimated that 10-30% of all infected individuals have the potential to become Long Haulers suffering from lasting effects of a previous COVID infection and continuous disability and/or waves of recurrent symptoms,53 which include fatigue, headaches and breathing problems as well as a set of debilitating memory fog and emotional distress.54 Research estimates that from about 10% upwards to up to 50% of those exposed to COVID-19 patients will become Long Haulers, and that 80% of the world population will be infected with COVID at a certain point in their lives.55 Consequently, the world faces a potential Long Hauler population ranging from over 600 million to more than three billion Long Haulers worldwide in the decades to come.

A rather unexpected effect during the recovery from the first economic shock was the blatantly unequal performance of financial markets compared to actual economic performance. This disjunction between financial markets on the one hand, and real economic activities on the other hand, already emerged as a trend in the 1990s, in the United States in particular in the aftermath of financial market deregulation.101 Financial performance began to diverge massively from the real economy in 2008/ 09, but the greatest divergence so far was brought about by the Coronavirus crisis, which widened the gap between top performance of financial markets and negative socio-economic fallout in the real economy.102 The finance-real economy gap widened as the finance world could reallocate funds quickly, while the real economy saw liquidity crunches in the wake of lockdowns and consumption drops resulting in closures and bankruptcies echoing in bottlenecks for private households. Since the onset of a lasting crisis, the novel coronavirus caused a dramatic downturn for general consumption and service sector industries.103 Mobility, trade and tourism including gastronomy plummeted, even though these sectors usually persist during system-inherent downturns as the freshly laid off typically spend novel-won-leisure time on service sector goods, enjoying vacations, lifestyle entertainment, put-off healthcare and well-being.104 Yet in the case of the Coronavirus crisis, the lockdowns and social distancing put a halt to leisure consumption.

Social distancing led to temporary business closures accompanied by massive layoffs - particularly in the service sector, gastronom y, and tourism industries. Unemployment increased up to 70% in the mid-career segment of these industries.105 Forty million European workers were switched to short-time schedules to keep them at work.106 This so-called Kurzarbe it labor protection plan encourages firms to reduce work hours instead of laying off or furloughing workers.107 The OECD and Bloomberg estimate that 19% of workers were furloughed in the UK, 23% in Germany, and 41% in France.108 In more market- oriented territories, the impact was more severe.109 For example, in Great Britain unemployment jumped to 5.4%, and in the United States to 8.9%.110 Coupled with individual households being under lockdown, consumption dropped by 46% in China, 97% in Germany, and 20% in the United States, as well as 78% in the UK in the early months of the pandemic.111 The financial world is flexible to exchange COVID-affected industries - such as petroleum, public transport, and the aviation and leisure sectors, such as international hospitality and gastronomy - for COVID-winning industries - such as pharmaceuticals and emergency care, digital communication, fintech, online retail, used automotives, and interior design with an emphasis on healthy living.112 To a certain extent, this happens automatically, in particular when badly performing firms drop out of an index (and hence out of index funds) but also in well-maintained sophisticated portfolios. Moreover, portfolio managers can diversify risks ex ante, which is why losses from badly performing firms in certain industries will be balanced by gains in winning industries that grew during the pandemic.113 On the individual firm level, financial managers can benefit from losses in firms by shorting their stock and hedging based on derivatives to avoid exposure to possible declines. For the finance world, it is thus possible to turn losses in the real econom y into financial gains. Finance professionals were in a better position to recover once the crisis hit, and certain consumption propensities became apparent.

For instance, the Financial Times Stock Exchange Index, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nikkei plummeted in the first quarter of 2020 drastically.114 At the same time, Deutsche Bank saw rising earnings after the onset of the Coronavirus crisis in Europe of even up to 43% or 2.4 billion euros in its investment branch in the third quarter of 2020.115 The Standards and Poor's (\"S&P\") 500 recovered half of its pre-COVID value in only three months after the crisis hit New York and regained pre-pandemic levels by June 2020 to reach all-time highs from August 2020 and is exhibiting continuously rising trends.116 Digitalized cryptocurrencies and crowdfunding now also allow investors to further benefit from a crisis of social distancing, bottlenecks, and trade frictions. In all these features, the strong contrasts between COVID-19 winners and losers widened an already existing gap between financial markets and the real economy, which will likely exacerbate the longer the COVID-19 crisis continues. Not only will differences in the infection risk and the possibility to prevent disease and/or a mild sickness between the two sectors determine continuously rising levels of inequality. In addition, the number of individuals suffering from COVID long-haul symptoms and their belonging to particular social strata will further exacerbate inequality.

In addition to between-country gaps and industry inequality in recovery from the crisis, COVID-19 will likely affect power dynamics between employers and employees in light of long-term COVID disability and debilitation. When going back in the history of humankind, the 14th century black death great plague caused about one third of the known population to decease. Previous pandemics already created labor shortages and drivers of mechanization to replace human labor power. Scarce labor increases the bargaining power of workers, but also sets trends to protect human health and replace human capital by mechanization into motion.117 Labor relations and political dynamics between employers and employees may also shift because of Long Haulers' relation to work. The longe r people will be sickened by the virus or experience debilitation after an infection, the more consistently they will avoid contagion risks, for example working in an office with multiple people. The scarcer productive labor power will become, the more likely we will see an appreciation for a healthy productive environment. Professions with less infection risk will draw those entering the labor force for the first time. Imagine the tough decision to become a nurse or doctor, and contrast this with training to become a lawyer or IT expert with the ability to work remotely from home. COVID-19 and the fact that young individuals can end up with a lifetime of debilitation even after mild infections at a young age may alter students' professional preferences and career choices. 2.Deurbani zation Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, a deurbanization trend has evolved.

Fearing litigation risk and public pressure, firms will likely be reluctant to force their employees to remain at a desk in a corporate headquarter housed in a congested power city that remains a hotbed of disease as travelers from around the world keep flying in and out. The Doughnut Effect is believed to be a lasting trend due to remote work conditions and social distancing preferences.130 Deurbanization has already affected market equilibria. For example, the price of used cars rose over the course of the pandemic due to a higher demand in suburban areas and uncertainty about how long people will stay away from large cities.131 Supply chain shortages of new cars from international markets, such as Asia, contributed to price increases in used vehicles.132 Within cities, this massive relocation trend first will continue to drive inequality. Relocation quickly to a more pleasant environment and the flexibility to work online appear as prerogatives of the rich, while those left in metropolitan areas are often unable to afford a second country residence. This is true even more so where, for example, unskilled service workers in metropolitan areas are dependent on consumption by the wealthy.133 John Maynard Keynes' multiplier effect, which is in this case based on the rich spending money that trickles down to other layers of the economy and society, has been shifting from the city to the suburbs.134 In a longer time perspective, however, deurbanization also raises the hope to alleviate social upward mobility inequality, which appears to be more strongly accentuated in cities.

The longer COVID exists and the more people will become affected, the less complex the working and daily world will have to become.

The coronavirus crisis has highlighted the importance of prevention as a necessary prerequisite for health in general medicine. Self-conscious prevention and the general status of the immune system have proven to be decisive prerequisites for whether a COVID-19 infection turns out to have a severe or only a mild disease trajectory.181 Even when an initial coronavirus infection is mild, among about 10-50% of those previously infected the body becomes symptomatic in the long term, with the immune system becoming unbalanced and/or overshooting.182 The diffuse symptoms of long COVID are not yet fully understood, as there may be a complex interplay with genetic predispositions and environmental circumstances. While the waves of symptoms faced and recovery of COVID-19 Long Haulers are still not clear, recent evidence suggests that external and synthetic influences can trigger an overshooting immune reaction that causes harm to one's own body.183 Scholars have therefore suggested that Long-Haul patients and chronic disease sufferers will become aware of and hypersensitive to their surroundings, resulting in a preference for balance and harmony with the natural environment rising.184 Generation COVID-19 long-haul will likely shift towards a healthy lifestyle with awareness for environmental balance. Attention to protect the environment but also caution to avoid drug residues in the groundwater will spring out from the wish to create a non-stressful surrounding without environmental stressors and/or inflammation triggers. With international trade still being in a downturn and international value chains becoming riskier and more expensive, consumers attuned to their surroundings have developed an interest in shopping locally.185 First attempts to leadership/workplace-voice.html [https://perma.cc/RF4A-KG2L] (last visited Sept. 10, 178.Id. 180.Emma Harrington & Natalia Emanuel, 'Working' Remotely?

With people enjoying time off work in their Ecowellness hubs, low-paying service industry jobs with high human touchpoints - such as nursing, flight attendants, restaurant waiters, etc. - will face massive staffing shortages. Labor supply shortages have and will continuously increase labor bargaining power and drive-up worker salaries but may also increase corporate social responsibility pressures to create a positive work-life balance in harmony with nature. 4.Socio-Psychological Evolution Impacting Labor Dynamics Speculation about prehistoric situations where humans survived in caves serves as a useful analogy for lockdowns. Researchers at the University of Vienna study the group dynamic and socio-psychological impact of crises as a driver of human advancement.186 As these researchers outline, seclusion in caves held enormous potential for human and societal development, which may also apply regarding COVID.187 During periods when natural disasters made exterior living conditions dangerous, paleolithic humans developed so-called \"cave competencies.\" These key competencies grew when people had to seclude themselves from society - e.g., during natural disasters, volcanic eruptions, but also during seclusion of later-following pandemics, such as the great plague of the 14th century. Historically, crises often became hallmarks of societal advancement after all.188 Times of societal pressure often advanced to shock therapies pushing humankind toward social advancement, for some parts due to a stark natural selection effect.189 \"Cavers\" were more likely to estimate risks and imagine future consequences, and they were able to maintain a natural circadian rhythm without being guided by changes in natural light.190 Psychologically stronger, more self-reflective and cooperative individuals with better sensitivity to the passage of time, a better ability to discount risk over time, and with better social competencies had a natural advantage when caving together.191 According to this theory, humans in seclusion learned to live by themselves and handle their emotions during stress, but also developed better imagination.192 Drawing inferences from the potential rise of \"cave competences\" during the Steam Has Gone Out of Globalisation, supra note 122; Multinational Companies Are Adjusting to Shorter Supply Chains, supra note 122. 186.See J\u00fcrgen Grimm, Conspiracy Theories in Times of Crises: Methods and Results of an Online Survey, U. VIENNA [Vol. 19:47 currently ongoing pandemic, pro-active care for maintaining a healthy workforce will become an essential corporate feature to attract qualified labor, whose bargaining power has already increased because of labor shortages in human- facing industries and positions.193 The long-haul prospect and prolonged COVID pandemic has raised U.S. job openings to historic highs and the share of U.S. corporations not being able to fill positions has increased to 15%, which accounts for a record highest rate ever measured.194 At the same time, more workers are quitting with the job quit rate at an all-time high at 2.7% in June 2021.195 Long COVID will likely drive this power dynamic shift even further and extend it to other indus tries, once natural supply-demand dynamics in the labor market kick in. The overall long-term well-being of employees including preventive care in teams will become a key issue and competitive advantage to attract a productive workforce for employers of tomorrow. Learning-in-teams to prevent virus contagion will become a new endogenous growth factor when considering the risk of long-term debilitation of trained key personnel after a COVID-19 infection.196 Future employers will likely naturally but also will have to develop empathy and a holistic understanding of health. In work teams responsible self-care of prevention in harmony with society and the environment will prevail. A shared culture of group prevention efforts will play a key role. Salutogenesis funded and supported by the employer nurturing a healthy and ecologically harmonious lifestyle will be a future competitive advantage in the labor market that helps attract scarce labor. Working from home will have changed employees to become more independent and sensitive to personal time, but they will also be more focused on the health and well-being of their immediate surroundings.197 In light of growing concerns over COVID long-haul risks but also addressing the newest findings about the interaction of environmental influences on long- haul conditions, employers will likely have a pioneering first mover advantage if they pay attention to the holistic expertise for prevention standards. For instance, quick and accurate COVID tests, screening of employee healthcare status but also providing a safe and secure work environment will be crucial. This means that the environment will be constantly monitored for harmful influences. 193.Whelan, supra note 14. al., supra note 98. 197.Recognizing the Duty of the Federal Government to Create a Green New Deal, H.R. 109, 116th Cong.

Legal implications, insurance coverage in the entire social compound but also privacy considerations when dealing with sensitive personal health status information in the workforce over time are rising legal, economic, discriminatory, and ethical challenges that may imply risks such as discrimination, litigation and erosion of the social glue. Multi-faceted predicaments will likely arise in the shadow of all these novel developments for Generation COVID Long-Haul. Salutogenic prevention is currently imbued in the work cultures. Governmental support in large-scale regulation and subsidies could support prevention and holistic healthcare.200 The non-specific immune system response to COVID in Long Haulers will require workplaces to be in harmony with the environment. Long Haulers will strive to eliminate stress, which will also require society to limit weather-related problems in light of climate change. Current levels of global warming are causing weather extremes, which can exacerbate unnecessary stress levels. All such wide-scale transformation can be guided by the Green New Deal and the European Sustainable Taxonomy targeted at stabilizing a favorable climate and livable environment based on classifying indus tries and policies' effects on human health and well-being.201 Public crowd events will likely also require more precaution and an implicit understanding of care for others' well-being. Civil networks, independent scientists and favorable framework conditions in line with the \"Green Deal\" pledge can change entire communities and revive the self-determined idea of health in harmony with the environment during our turbulent time.202 198.Salzburg European Declaration from the Gasteinertal, 197; see also Pargendler, supra note 197 (providing a historical overview of UN initiatives relating to ESG, particularly climate change); Letter from Members, Earthworks, supra note 197; H.R.

Digitalization and Democratization of Healthcare Information 1.Isolation of Generation Lockdown and the Digitalization Boom As discussed in section 3.1.4, in the history of humankind, the ability to use imagination and to innovate often prospered when humans were isolated during times of crises. Not to idealize COVID lockdowns or envisioning flying to Mars these days, the novel Coronavirus pandemic has shock-forced Generation COVID Lockdown to socially-distance as never before during modernity.203 As the fear of a virus contagion through human contact led to lockdowns in all major economies around the globe, the power of digitalization became the source of touchpoint-less contact with the social compound during the pandemic. In modern COVID 'caves,' imagination is currently stimulated in virtual online worlds that reached unprecedented sophistication during the crisis.204 While many COVID Long Haulers locked their doors to keep out aerosols and the actual physical surroundings' importance faded, laptop window s to the world became the most important ever-open gate to escape, communicate and socialize at any given time of day or night.205 The economic recovery after COVID-19 is expected to be digital.206 The longer and riskier a COVID infection risk is perceived to prevail, the more will society adjust to digitalized interaction and truly global information exchange.207 COVID-19 accelerated an already ongoing digitalization disruption.208 Algorithms, robotics, and big data insights have experienced more widespread use and general acceptance within society during the COVID-19 crisis.209 Digitalization accounts for a booming industry in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The already pre-pandemic existing gap between e-skilled and e-unskilled workers based on novel technology adoption has widened since the outbreak of COVID.211 The worldwide lockdowns, social distancing, and remote work solutions in all major economies increased a worldwide rapid adoption of instant communication tools, social engagement, and entertainment platforms.212 The COVID-induced deurbanization described in section 3.1.2. was therefore not comparable to a ruralization. People in the suburbs or in smaller towns did not give up luxuries of metropolitan areas, such as the exchange of goods, services, and ideas in highly specialized markets with diverse market actors. Today's cosmopolitan luxury shifted into virtual online spaces as COVID-19 unprecedentedly expanded the reach of the online tech world. Physically distant, we became digitally closer. Data traffic increased around the world but also in speed.213 An online multitasking workforce gained global reach, while technology reduced bureaucracy.214 Digitalization affected all industries and is expected to revolutionize medical care of the future.215 Historically, ancient epidemics were turning points that eventually fostered innovation in mechanization given human labor shortages and reductions in productive capacity.216 Persistent and recurring COVID-19 lockdowns in combination with the potential for reinfection among already traumatized Long Haulers will likely turn society more and more toward digitalization for purposes of social interaction, information exchange, productivity, and entertainment.217 210.See Charles I.

Robots have also taken on everyday supply chain tasks, such as self-driving trucks, shelving groceries, administering checkouts or delivering items with drones.221 In the household, robots are becoming useful as cleaning, cooking and household devices. During the pandemic, more and more decision making became outsourced to algorithms. In the future lawyers, doctors, finance professionals and secretary tasks are expected to become more and more replaced by computers and artificial intelligence.222 Digitalization could also come in handy in the search for practical disability support for Long Haulers. Artificial Intelligence, robotics and big data may offer essential complements to fill in for long-haul attention and productivity deficits gaps that may occur in waves. Robotics and automated computer systems promise to help COVID Long Haulers navigate through complex situations of information overload.223 Artificial Intelligence could offer the opportunity to aid Long Haulers in dealing with a complex world when waves of fatigue set in unexpectedly and unpredictably.

To prevent future pandemics, mobile monitoring and digital health resource tracking will play an unprecedented role. Thanks to new technologies for self-motivated health monitoring, it is currently possible for everyone to track their health independently and change their lifestyle over a longer time horizon self-determined. Individualized health status apps are currently being developed to track body functions and detect virus infections in real-time. Big data that is used to obtain objective disease risk and outcome trajectories every person faces can aid in optimizing one's lifestyle and health to prevent negative lifestyle choice consequences early on.227 Currently emerging innovations in this realm include real-time monitoring of the immune system and microchips for tracking biomarkers. Big data and the use of Bluetooth technology for a cartography of healthcare devices are prospectively used to overcome bottlenecks allocation problems and combat the misuse of resources.228 Digitization enables access to medical information worldwide without the risk of corruption by creating telehealth services and allowing users to gather preliminary information in internet forums. Insights derived from massive amounts of data can be used for widescale prevention, diagnosis and healing. New technologies can now relate personal symptom prevalence to psycho-social tendencies and general environmental influences and risk factors in order to redefine salutogenesis truly holistically.229 In light of the enormous potential to digitally monitor and track healthcare statuses worldwide and over time, big data offers an enormous potential to detect the outbreak of pandemics early on but also the possibility to capture widespread health trends and group reactions. COVID-19 Long Haulers may trigger large-scale societal trends by initiating a widespread Artificial Intelligence revolution that will comprise IT solutions for medical self-monitoring, constant health status tracking and real-time scanning of the environment for harmful influences. New possibilities for data storage and 224.Ivan Stevanovic, Free Appointment Scheduling Software: Our Top Picks, SMALL GENIUS, (Dec. 30, 2021), https://www. smallbizgenius.net/free-appointment-scheduling-software/ INDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW [Vol. 19:47 evaluation open up previously unforeseen ways to allow users of social networks to develop holistic healthy lifestyles and take measures to prevent illness.230 As never before in the history of humankind, individuals are now monitoring their health status in real time and find themselves online to evaluate medical goods and services together. Already now during the ongoing pandemic, COVID Long Haulers began to seek fast, easy and truly global access to information about potential remedies for their condition, which are typically not provided by standard medical care.231 Long Haulers have already found themselves in online self-help groups - such as the Facebook Survivor Corps - or decentralized information exchange - such as the Patient Research COVID-19 platform, a patient-led research collaborative232 - for quick and unbureaucratic information exchange about an emerging group phenomenon. Social online media platforms were instrumental in detecting that COVID may cause a long-lasting health effect that may kick in with an even longer time lag than the standard incubation time and may show surprising body and psychological changes. Social online media captured this trend early on. In digitalized platforms, Long Haulers gathered information self-determinedly in online surveys during a time when COVID emergency hospitalization was precluded by a surge of severe COVID cases. In the future, instant information exchange on social media may also lead to a democratization of healthcare information without medical professionals as gatekeepers. Fear of attending hospitals or seeking medical aid at potential viral transmission points has already created a wave of telemedicine and online healthcare information exchange. Especially in the Long Hauler segment, where novel, diffuse and often unclarified symptoms appear in waves, laypeople are already turning to fast and easy information exchange in online social media self- help groups, such as the Facebook Long Hauler Survivor Corps groups. These groups serve as open forums to discuss potentially unfamiliar symptoms. As the list of COVID Long-Haul long-term debilitation continues to expand, Long Haulers are in the search for fast relief online. Social media networks provide widespread options for gathering and strategically collecting crowd opinions on Long COVID remedies but also provide socio-psychological support from fellow sufferers. Guided lifestyle monitoring in a social self-help group can strengthen self-confidence and social cohesion in online forums. These Long Haulers meet online to discuss their pressing symptoms and to crowdsource information on currently evolving trends in medical care in order to then inform scientists based on their amalgamated narrative data.233 In this service, COVID Long Haulers see themselves as citizen scientists who organize 230.Id. 231.Basu, supra 233.Amy Dockser Marcus, Covid-19 Patients Are Doing Their Own Research, WALL ST.

This tendency toward bottom-up information gathering is a form of crowdsourcing of information on COVID-19 and its unforeseen long-term consequences. These introspective observer positions of self-determined patients sometimes appear in a more informed position than the medical sector. Their remaining online not only lifts pressure from currently overwhelmed medical personnel in hospitals. In their fast and unbureaucratic exchange and in their role as informants to government officials responsible for health and well-being, Long Haulers have become a self-determined and highly engaged crowd information source for fast problem-solving that can relieve the general health system. This trend captures a newly developing online democratization of healthcare information. 3.Alternative Medicine and Ecowellness Trends for Prevention The rise in medical self-help online and mutual support will have profound implications for the regulation of the medical profession. COVID Long Haulers tend to stretch cure options for alternative medicine solutions that rebalance their stressed immune systems. In online forums and digitalized exchange, Long Haulers guide a holistic, democratic expansion of the repertoire for healing and prevention.236 The widening of discussion forums about the social representations of COVID-19 symptoms could instigate a transformation of the health system. Alternative remedies that can restore balance and a natural immune system reset but also harmony with the environment have already been identified as possible cures for Long COVID. Acupuncture, intermittent and therapeutic fasting, herbal alternatives and dietary supplements - such as yogurts for pre- and pro-biotics - but also yoga and meditation are already booming trends in COVID long-haul online internet forums.237 These easily understood alternative means 234.Interdisciplinary, Multimedia Conference, supra note 12. 235.Id.

For instance, fasting as abstaining from food is often sidelined in the range of options presented to patients. While the reasons for this remain opaque, one can only speculate about the economic incentives of the food and pharmaceutical industry. Reducing one's calorie intake has a different economic impact than a break-through medication that can have extraordinarily high sales margin, as pharmaceuticals are typically on top of the price mark-up range per industry. A healthy diet, yet, also has a lower carbon footprint than the marketing of new drugs, which often require chemicals and trials that may end up as non-excludable debris in the drinking water. Dieting may also have less unexpected externalities and risks if done with caution than new drug trials. The lobbying of the pharmaceutical industry and the incentives sometimes set by professional groups may influence the opinion of medical professionals. Discussing fast remedies online with similarly affected patients, portrays the information sharing among fellow COVID Long Haulers more innocently and certainly filled with more empathy for fellow sufferers. In the end, COVID Long Haulers are undergoing a shared struggle that is not well understood and sometimes not recognized by professionals as such yet. Because long-term COVID sufferers are often rather young, long-term medication would not only cause the known side effects, such as collateral organ damage, but also possible psycho-social consequences such as stigmatization and psychological trauma of despair and misunderstanding by the medical profession. Alternative medicine and information exchange online appears as an at least considerable option. The projected growing number of chronically long-term disabled COVID Long Haulers and those with autoimmune system imbalances increases the importance and value of preventive medicine with a long-term impact. Alternative remedies offer the potential to reset the immune system and create harmony with the environment. Preventive and alternative medicine are inclusive alternatives that also integrate the big picture of external environmental conditions. Chronic diseases and their therapy can be treated most successfully if the diverse and changing spectrum of health and disease is understood from the point of view of systems biology and with regard to the natural and social environment as a source of calming factors or stressors. Big data gathering and crowdsourcing of information enables to integration of a wide-range data in exploratory analysis to understand systems change avenues. Holistic process- oriented systems also integrate traditional healing methods as well as the humanities, psychosomatics, spirituality, and art.238 The longer the COVID pandemic endures, and the deeper the long-haul crisis runs through society, the more alternative solutions shared online are expected to gain ground in the overall spectrum of remedies available to Long Haulers. The rise in medical self-help and mutual support will have profound implications for the regulation of the medical profession and will likely boost alternative medicine 238.Interdisciplinary, Multimedia Conference, supra note 12.2022] GENERATION COVID-19 LONG-HAUL 89 and over-the-counter remedies. Implicit monopolization of pharmaceutical markets and biased subscription regimes may become harder when access to healthcare information and medication remedy but also drug performance and side effects become more transparent in crowdsourcing of information on drugs in the digital age. In the future, COVID Long Haulers may shift focus from seeking treatment in emergency situations toward prevention. As Long Haulers face recurrent flare- up episodes of symptoms, they will naturally develop an appreciation for foresighted medical care, hence prevention. We already now experience a trend of COVID Long Haulers being extraordinarily cautious and anxious about getting sick again. Promoting prevention and general healthcare in the future in a more decentralized way will likely shift the political economy power dynamics between patients and doctors but also the healthcare framework surrounding medical care. Self-determined information exchange about prevention may ennoble humans with feelings of internal self-control. Long-haul patients as experts of their own emerging disease, demand to become patients as partners within the medical care.239 A more egalitarian access to preventive health rather than finding oneself debilitated and confronted in an emergency care hierarchy dependent on life-saving support of doctors can build a more informed, rational, and strategic decision-making path.240 Preventive protection and general salutogenesis will become features of success for individual lives, families, corporations and whole societies of the future, who may have a more egalitarian access to health and well-being as a common good through online access to medical information.241 4.Ethical Predicaments in the Democratization of Healthcare Information Online In the current formation of ethical standards for Artificial Intelligence and big data, these novel technologies and the insights derived from them offer enormous benefits for society. At the same time, ethical predicaments arise out of the use of these novel technologies that potentially infringe on laws and human beings and impose risks to societal welfare.242 A stakeholder survey conducted in November 2019 revealed that perceived risks in the use of big data in healthcare include data misuse and leakage leading to privacy infringements, as well as biases and errors. Big data insights open gates for differential health care pricing, stigmatization, social stratification, 239.Harvard T.H.

International big data exchange could set standards for future pandemic prevention but shoul d also provide big data privacy protection and legal anti- discrimination means against misuse of sensitive information that leads to stigmatization of vulnerable patients' exposure of their conditions. Instant online exchange of sensitive information about one's health status makes citizen scientists particularly vulnerable in terms of their privacy and potentially susceptible to online marketing campaigns under medically impaired conditions. But also the long-term impact of publicly disclosed sensitive information that is shared bit-by-bit online over time appears sensitive and not foreseen in humans, especially likely in the impaired.245 In the digital age, it is difficult to estimate what effects the piecemeal sharing of private information will have over time, when, for example, personal health information disseminated in an internet forum is absorbed into large datasets. If information is analyzed and displayed in relation to other individuals' performance, a combined dataset could open gates for discrimination and stigmatization.

Digital online working conditions that make individual living conditions transparent emphasize social hierarchies in our work-related interactions and may further transpire differences in social status in business and educational settings. New approaches to teaching and learning have highlighted novel inequalities - such as disparities in the private spaces and access to digitalization benefits as well as internet infrastructures and favorable time zones. As access to healthcare and education have become pegged to virtual experiences, we need to rethink the democratization of internet access and online availability. Inequality divides opening - based on the online access and technology affinity determining the availability of health care, education and emotional well-being - should become subject to policy intervention in order to avert societal downfalls that leave behind welfare potential in education and learning. Taxing internet generated gains could provide the fiscal space to offset online inequalities in granting access, tools and capabilities for underprivileged segments and train COVID long-hauling in conscientiously using new technologies.249 5.Online Education Prospe cts COVID-19 revolutionized the education sector for digital learning and hybrid online solutions.250 With COVID-19 requiring social distancing and Long COVID being a potential debilitation disability for younger population groups, education professionals had to rethink learning operations, teaching methods, and examination standards.251 With most university campuses around the world undergoing a speedy transition to online teaching and remote learning during the pandemic,252 it has become a certainty that hybrid learning and online classwork can be longer-lasting advantages that may also hold innovation potential to alleviate inequality. Especially with information rising about the long-term 247.See Julia M. Puaschunder, Dignity and Utility of Privacy and Information Sharing in the Digital Big Data Age, 5 INT'L J. COMM. & MGMT.

For the education world, the devastating pandemic also brought along enormous innovation, flexibility, and inequality alleviation potential: Disruptive technology use adopted in record speed during the pandemic will enable universities in the future to cater education to the whole world at low cost. Online learning offers students flexibility without considering their location or timeframe to study in a particular country if no relocation or visa to enter the country to study is required. Generation COVID-19 Lockdown and Long-Haulers now will likely continuously put pressure on universities to offer hybrid education in larger international network consortia. Students from all over the world could thereby flexibly take courses in large international education hubs with participating institutions being far spread out around the world. The actual on-site work of universities and research institutions will likely be focused on research, while learning will more likely happen online in the virtual space. Networks that allow sharing resources within a larger consortium of universities around the world and within different industries or governments will likely take over. Virtual meetings will provide the luxury of guest speakers granting a truly international outlook. Digitalization disruption may also become a vehicle for upward social mobility that opens access to elite education without the need for a visa and the financial means for relocation and housing. Without these costs, students will also be free to study longer and put together more diverse curricula over time and across institutions. Education of the future could thus become truly global, tailored to individual interests and needs, life-long and catered to current developments. Online education can thereby become the great equalizer that international development has been searching for decades.253 Future partnerships of the technology sector and universities could extend the spectrum of hybrid teaching in international educational consortia. Global access to online education could become an international development transformation game changer. With the currently ongoing digitalization disruption requiring increasingly e- skills and the labor market has become truly global in the digital economy, the time for sophisticated and individualized e-education appears to have come.254 Access to virtual conso rtia will enable students to cherry-pick a personalized curriculum based on interests and independent from the physical locations. A new cadre of individualized and highly-specialized graduates could emerge after the pandemic that could select catered studies based on their needs and wants during different stages of their careers. For this model to work, institutional openness to collaborate on a truly global level has to be emphasized. The online teaching option will likely lead to market segmentation between high-end physical learning experiences and low-cost online experiences. The division between these categories will likely depend on the field of study. 253.Corey Robin, The Pandemic is the Time to Resurrect the Public University, NEW YORKER (May 7, 2020), https://www.

Disability awareness and compassion will become key elements and qualifications of future successful educational institutions, but also essential social skills one can pick up in flexible learning and testing schemes as a necessary future social skill for a future fruitful career. While the affordability of entering virtual educational spaces could become great equalizer through affordable education around the globe. At the same time, too many students acquiring degrees could lead to an education boom and degree inflation. This may lead - in the long run - to a discreditation of already-existing degrees or at least a two-tier system, in which some gained a real-world education and others fully virtual ones. Online education must define the highest quality standards and monitoring control to compensate for the missing real in-person learning and on-campus networking. If students do not need to be physically present on campuses and given the COVID long-haul risk, young adults may likely stay longer with their parents. A generation that can miss campus experiences may grow up with a different mindset than those who spent time around people of their own age. It may not be a bad thing to stay longer under the protection of older generations, as children of older parents have a propensity to be successful in educational settings and career-wise. But with Generation Lockdown, there is the risk of social isolation, heightened levels of depression and a generation scared of social contact in contrast to students who have had the real-world learning experience. Lowering the cost of education also holds the potential to lift the educational debt that puts generation internship into a prison of debt from which they often cannot escape even long after graduation. Virtual learning experiences may also free students from social-psychological burdens and problems created by peer pressure in an on-campus educational environment. Introvert people are expected to actually benefit from virtual settings. In order to take advantage and seize the opportunity of online learning world, but also to avoid problems arising from virtual realities, society together may work towards flourishing virtual spaces that uphold a healthy online exchange grounded in mutual respect. Ennobling learning ethics of inclusion will embrace diversity. Overall, virtual online education offers to imbue more social upward mobility into education.

Social, Healthcare and Retirement Reform 1.Recognition of Long-Haul COVID as a Disability Since the outbreak of COVID-19, COVID Long-Haul awareness has been growing steadily. In July 2021, U.S. President Joseph Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris announced that some impaired Long Haulers would be recognized as disabled.257 In speedy response to the Long COVID pandemic, the United States Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services in cooperation with the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice have put forward guidance on Long COVID as a disability.258 Joint guidance from the United States Departments of Health and Hum an Services and Justice acknowledges that long COVID can be considered a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Long COVID is also recognized as disability in regards to the anti-discrimination provisions in the Rehabilitation Act and the Affordable Care Act.259 As the U.S. Department of Health & Hum an Services (\"HHS\") explains, long COVID can be recognized as a disability unde r Titles II (state and local government) and III (public accommodations) of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\").260 In addition, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,261 and Section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act apply.262 Each of these federal laws is intended to protect individuals with disabilities from discrimination.263 These mandatory protections apply even during emergencies and cannot be waived.264 According to the HHS, Long COVID can be considered as a disability under the sections listed above if an impairment following an infection substantially 257.Rubin, supra note 8; Press Release, President Joe Biden, note 54. 258.Guidance on \"Long COVI D\" as a Disability Under the ADA, Section 504, and Section 1557, U.S. DEP'T HEALTH & HUM. SERV., Wheeler, Long Covid's Catch-22: Too Sick to Work, Yet Not Quite Disabled, BLOOMBERG L. (Nov. 18, 2021, 4:00 note 258. 264.Id.2022] GENERATION COVID-19 LONG-HAUL 95 limits one or more major life activities. Moreover, individuals with a record of such an impairment and persons regarded as having such an impairment also qualify as disabled.265 Relevant major life activities include (but are not limited to) \"caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, sitting, reaching, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, writing, communicating, interacting with others, and working. The term also includes the operation of a major bodily function, such as the functions of the immune system, cardiovascular system, neurological system, circulatory system, or the operation of an organ.\"266 The HHS further advises that \"[t]he term \"substantially limits\" is construed broadly under these laws and should not demand extensive analysis. The impairment does not need to prevent or significantly restrict an individual from performing a major life activity, and the limitations do not need to be severe, permanent, or long-term. Whether an individual with long COVID is substantially limited in a major bodily function or other major life activity is determined without the benefit of any medication, treatment, or other measures used by the individual to lessen or compensate for symptoms. Even if the impairment comes and goes, it is considered a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when the impairment is active.\"267 COVID-19 Long Haulers are therefore \"entitled to full and equal opportunities to participate in and enjoy all aspects of civic and commercial life.\"268 This implies that businesses, state or local governments will have to \"operate to accommodate a person's long COVID-related limitations.\"269 \"For people whose long COVID qualifies as a disability, these changes, or 'reasonable modifications,' may include\" access to goods and services, flexible timing and adjusted testing as well as granted assistance by human, animal, device and technology.270 The HHS guidance addresses only the definition of disability under these laws.271 The recently-issued guidelines do not fully \"cover other definitions of disability or eligibility requirements such as those necessary to qualify for Federal 265.Id. See, e.g., 42 19:47 benefit programs under Social Security.\"272 The full legal status and policy guidelines on long COVID are currently formed and expected to be adjusted and fortified as society learns more about COVID-19 and its long-term effect on human health, well-being and productivity. To qualify for Social Security disability insurance, a condition must meet the agency's definition of a disability.273 Under the SSA's rules, the disabling condition or symptoms also have to have lasted, or be expected to last, for a year or result in death.274 A person who has limitations resulting from long Covid and meets or is expected to meet the duration requirement, \"could be found disabled if their limitations equal a medical listing or if the combination of those limitations and vocational factors prevent them from performing substantial gainful activity.\"275 Already now, literature emerges that claims that some of the COVID long haul conditions are hard to prove, and insurers can still set limits on benefits awarded to disabled COVID Long Haulers.276 Protection from discrimination and the provision of public accommodations thus still leave many too sick to work without secured financial disability protection.277 To this day, Long COVID is not on the Social Security Administration's list of disabling medical conditions.278 So far, the nation's biggest private long-term disability insurers also tend not to acknowledge that long COVID can cause long-term disability.279 It appears problematic that some of the most debilitating symptoms or the infection are still hard to prove and there needs to be an associated functional limitation that impacts the ability to do a particular job or work in general.280 General problems are the relatively low acceptance rate of Social Security disability benefits claims - on average 66% of the claims were denied in the period between 2009 and 2018.281 It can also take three to five months on average for the Social Security Administration to make a decision about pending claims.282 In addition, even if successful, the social security benefits are in general often economically 'sticky,' meaning too slowly valorized to adjust to inflation. In 2020, as the pandemic took hold, U.S. health insurance companies declared they would cover 100% of the costs for COVID treatment, waiving copays and expensive deductibles for hospital stays that frequently range into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.283 But then in 2021, insurers have Full COVI D Coverage Are Over. Insurers Are2022] GENERATION COVID-19 LONG-HAUL 97 started to cancel full COVID care coverage during sickness and restore deductibles and copays that leave acute COVID patients with enormous medical bills.284 So while large insurance companies waived cost-sharing for Coronavirus care in 2020, it has sprung back in 2021 with most insurers having reinstated copays and deductibles for COVID patients, in many cases even before vaccines became widely available.285 Not only is the time of infection an inequality driver, there is also a lack of uniformity in COVID insurance practices between insurers and regions, which opens an uneven burden between patients across the country, varying widely by healthcare plan and geography.286 According to The Washington Post, patients in the same hospitals and in the same ICU units could be facing completely different financial burdens.287 With no federal mandate for insurers to cover all the costs for COVID treatment, it remains at the discretion of insurers how much they support COVID patients and Long Haulers.288 And the reintroduc tion of cost-sharing mainly affects people with private or employer- based insurance.289 Private insurance coverage for COVID Long Haulers is also insofar unstable as it can be approved at first but later cut off.290 Documentation is also often hard to obtain in an overflowing healthcare system and long waiting periods for poorly understood long haul issues. With reference to historical precedents of the past, Generation COVID Long-Haul partially being recognized as a disabled group may result in increased spending pressures and reform needs of the social, healthcare and retirement systems on a large scale. 2.Impact on Retirement Systems and Financ ial Markets: Historical Parallels When considering the relatively young age of the onset long-haul COVID-19, which is currently estimated to be most likely during the ages of thirty to fifty with a peak around the early to mid-forties, the long-term impetus of this usually highly productive part of society being slowed and/or weakened will be substantial when considering the dimensions of widespread infections if COVID turns endemic and the expected tax revenue from this age group's working income over time.291 The fact that a significant proportion of the population will Restoring Deductibles and Copays, Leaving Patients with Big Bills, WASH.

As an analogy for the current situation, there are historical precedents in the first half of the 20th Century after World War II, when social benefits and retirement schemes changed drastically in post-war European social democracies. Since the outbreak of the Coronavirus comparisons have been made to 'war economies.'292 It was during the post-World War era that the funding schemes for the current social and pension system were set on a course in many war-struck countries in Europe that lasts until today. There are essentially two models for retirement systems (regardless of whether they are public or private), namely the funded model and the pay-as-you- go (\"PAYGO\" ) model. Under the funded model, retirement savings are set aside for the future and typically invested in the capital market.293 In the PAYGO model, funds are paid out to beneficiaries at the same time as they are collected from the contributions of current workers. A key advantage of the PAYGO systems - at least from the short-term political perspective - is that funds are immediately available to meet urgent demands of populations, especially after crises or when there is an unexpected surge of population segments being in pressing need for welfare insurance payments. Continental European countries - such as Germany and France, to give two examples - historically introduced their retirement systems mainly as funded systems that would rely on savings dedicated to retirement. In the German pension system, which was set up in 1889, the funding principle never worked for extended periods.

Politically significant groups and a large body of young voters had to be met, including relatively young war veterans, those impoverished after industry and economic shocks, stock market crashes and wars. Across countries, the nature of these PAYGO systems meant that relatively few private funds were available for investment in capital markets. Stock markets remained small throughout the second half of the 20th Century, and firms financed themselves mainly internally through growth or bank loans where external finance was needed. Research in political science, law, and finance shows that PAYGO systems have small capital markets and concentrated ownership structures.314 Generation COVID Long-Haul could have a similar impact on financial systems. The longer COVID-19 persists and society is figuring out remedies to avoid, mitigate and adapt to the disease, the more people will classify for COVID Long Haulers and the more pressure to provide substantial assistance and integration in society for them will mount. If a significant proportion of the productive population is unable to work, political pressure to find funding to provide a decent standard of living for these groups will invariably develop. Organized interest groups of COVID Long Haulers will arise, and this time social online media will likely play a significant role. The COVID long-haul cohort spans different socio-economic groups, which means that large proportions of the electorate with different social backgrounds will likely sympathize with their plight. Long Haulers are typically relatively young and at an age where they will (discussing the Vichy regime's possible intent to gain the support of the working class). 312.Ordonnance du 30 d\u00e9cembre 1944, Ordonnance du 4 octobre 1945, Ordonnance du 19 octobre 1945. 313.ANNE-MARIE GUILLEMARD, AGING AND THE WELFARE-STATE CRISIS 53, 65 (2000) (quoting a supporter of the PAYGO as saying \"[i]t is therefore absolutely vital to replace this system with a pay-as-you-go plan that allows the real resources to be shared constantly among all members.\"); see also Anne Lavigne, Pension Funds in France: Still a Dead End?, 28 GENEVA PAPERS ON RISK & INS. 127, 136 (2003) (suggesting the destruction of pension wealth in the 1930s left the French skeptical toward pension funds); Kathryn L.

Long COVID is also more likely to occur in females, who account for over 70% of Long Haulers. Like veterans, widows and refugees after World War II, their decent standard of living will likely have to be provided for and/or substituted by the government out of funds generated by current workers. After World War II, German economists endorsed the \"Mackenroth formula,\" according to which current economic surpluses must cover all current retirement expenses.315 As the pressure to pay our funds to Long Haulers increases, this will also mean that fewer funds will be available for saving and investment instead of being transferred and paid out as they are generated. For retirement funding, social systems and financial markets the described potential funding scheme changes likely mean that there will be less saving to cover future expenses. Productive, high-income earners will be more highly taxed, or a larger amount of funds will have to be diverted to government-run retirement systems, such as social security in the United States. In consequence, a smaller amount of funds will be available for personal retirement saving for these individuals. On the margin, amounts available for investment in the capital market will diminish, comparable to the situation in countries that opted for a PAYGO system after World War II. The funding gap will depend on the number of Long Haulers in the population that leave the labor force permanently but also on the savings of Long Haulers. Already now, many 401(k) plans contain only woefully inadequate amounts of savings.316 The market impact of COVID-19, as well as the fact that many will withdraw money from pension plans early after the disruption of their livelihood,317 will likely mean that the percentage of workers with inadequate retirement savings will increase. Females and minorities may be disproportionately negatively affected in the long run, while their savings dissipate in expected inflation and negative interest rate climates.318 In this process, median voter preferences will likely shift away from emphasizing the protection of shareholders.319 315.See Hockert, supra note 297. 316.E.g., TERESA GHILARDUCCI & TONY JAMES, RESCUING RETIREMENT: A PLAN TO GUARANTEE RETIREMENT SECURITY FOR ALL AMERICANS 3, 31-36 (2020); Brian Anderson, Index Reveals Americans' Heightened Worries Around Retirement, 401K SPECIALIST MAG., (July 21, https://401kspecialistmag.com/index-reveals-americans-heightened-worries-around-retirement [https://perma.cc/8ZN6-WX27]; Gelter 16. 317.In addition, CARES ACT \u00a7 2202 permits early distributions from retirement plans without a tax penalty under certain circumstances. 318.Monique Morrissey, The State of American Retirement Savings, ECON.

Current governmental and governance COVID rescue and recovery aid started since the United States economy fell into recession in February 2020 in the wake of the news over COVID-19 and an evolving worldwide pandemic. Since the onset of the economic crisis in the fallout of the pandemic, the U.S. federal government responded with extensive fiscal stimulus packages and emergency relief. The U.S. Congress passed four special appropriations laws for the federal government to use in relief efforts, of which the largest was the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\"CARES\") Act, which provides approximately 2.08 trillion U.S. dollars in unprecedently highest governmental aid in North American history.320 These funds are directly or indirectly allocated towards industries and institutions that work on the recovery of COVID-19 Long Haulers or re-integration into a newly emerging workforce post-COVID-19. Future generations are likely to be affected by the economic recovery after the COVID-19 external shock - given the large amount of economic post-COVID-19 rescue and recovery packages that are funded on debt.321 Governmental efforts were coupled with the Federal Reserve taking monetary stimulus measures to stabilize and boost the economy in incremental interest rate cuts and discount rate drops down to 0.25%, and a Federal Reserve repurchase agreement interest rate of 0%.322 Lending programs, loans and asset purchases were part of a 700 billion USD quantitative easing plan323 with repurchasing options, as well as bonds financing and regulation changes, which are all meant 320.CORONAVIRUS AID, RELIEF, AND ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT (CARES) ACT OF 2020, PUB.

But also, industry-specific inflation patterns as well as urban- versus-rural disposable income differences in the wake of ambitious bailout and recovery plans should be considered when choosing bailout targets wisely to uplift those with a disproportionate burden.350 As blatantly visible among COVID Long Haulers, the remission potential being age-dependent but also the gender propensity to become a COVID Long Hauler being skewed towards females puts a disproportionately heavy burden on specific societal cohorts and gender groups. Transfer payments between COVID winners and losers but also redirection of funds for those in need based on a legal disparate impact analysis will hopefully be at the core of international COVID rescue and recovery. In the evaluation and monitoring of these unprecedentedly large amounts of governmental stimulus, economic bailout and rescue packages, socio-economic attention should also be paid to the intergenerational inequality entailed in leaving a massive wave of debt to future generations.351 The rescue and recovery funds based on bonds funded via debt may also include future welfare targets to steer 346.Gelter & Puaschunder, supra note 16. 347.These could be used for investments in clean energy innovations, for instance, such as decentralized energy grids enabled via solar panels or ecologically-harmonious infrastructures in the sharing economy.

In lieu, future world inhabitants may inherit a favorably stable climate thanks to dramatic market changes and lifestyle shifts towards harmony with the environment our generation has taken in the eye of recovering from a global pandemic.352 4. Impact on Healthcare Markets In alleviating the COVID-19 long-haul crisis, interdisciplinary viewpoints could also integrate the widespread impact COVID-19 will likely have on healthcare. The trend toward vaccinations reducing the risk of severe COVID-19 infection trajectories but also information exchange online about long-haul symptoms persisting after mild infections may shift future medical attention to focus on chronic diseases instead of just treating acute consequences. Precautious medical intervention through vaccinations focused on a highly complex and fragile individual immune system could also be extended with insights about the unspecific immune system.353 The current societal discussion and policy intervention makes it apparent that society is vulnerable when reducing the potential for diversification.354 In light of the fact that viruses constantly mutate, a wide range of remedies need to be developed in the future, including tools to detect viral loads and precautious interventions in the environmental setting. A symptom-centered approach often does not cure the underlying chronic disease. Focusing merely on treating symptoms and/or suppressing the body's immune response to treat autoimmune diseases, which some Long Haulers are experiencing, implicitly produces unnecessary suffering.355 Individual health, monetary and social costs occur when individuals wait with prevention until symptoms flare up or autoimmune imbalances cause damage to healthy parts of the body. But also, global costs for medication rise as large amounts of CO2 and environmental pollution occur because of drug development. Medication may also become ineffective if widespread population resistance against its effects builds up. Persistent drug use from an early age may also cause organ impairment, drug addiction and a respective number of chemical residues in the groundwater.

Attention will be paid to the environmental impact on health, but also vice versa the effect of healthcare on the environment. Holistic salutogenesis could help find a well-rounded understanding of why environmental stressors may cause long-term debilitation in chronic diseases. Living in harmony with the external environment could be integrated into the strengthening of recovery medicine in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis. In all of this, the COVID-19 pandemic may herald a legal and regulatory revolution for the general healthcare and well-being of people in line with the biological limits of a fragile planet. In addition to focusing on symptom relief, already now there seems to be an appreciation of emphasizing alternative treatments promoted in Long Hauler online Survivor Corps support groups.356 As discussed in section 3.2.4, a trend towards life-long prevention and holistic medical care with respect for the power of a healing harmony with the environment are likely to follow. The next revolution in healthcare may feature a 'greening' of lifestyles in healthy nutrition as holistic preventive care that can have faster individual results than large-scale economic greening projects, such as outlined in the United States Green New Deal and the European Green Deal.357 Governmental approaches that target large-scale industry redefinition or a future planned greening of industries, such as the planned transition from heavy industries to renewables, can thereby be complemented by broad-based individual lifestyle changes that matter not only to individuals becoming free of COVID long-haul symptoms caused by external stressors and environmental irritation, but also on its larger dimension in the social compound and over time to future generations.358 For instance, human eating habits and nutrition choices make up an estimated 30-40% of the CO2 pollution if the combined regionality, seasonality and food waste are all taken into consideration.359 5.Law & Econom ics of Rest, Recovery, and Minimalism As for a scientific system change, the field of economics is dominated by the aim to maximize profits with a focus on financial wealth accumulation. Health - as the topic of our time - has gained unprecedented attention that will likely grow as the numbers of Long Haulers swell. With broad-based infection of an endemic virus and with its long-term impetus, COVID-19 could become a means to redefine health and well-being as a primary goal of the economy, ecology and politics.360 356.See Yang Yang et al., Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Treatment of Patients Infected with 2019 - New Coronavirus (SARS -CoV-2): A Review and Perspective, 16 INT'L J.

In all of these prospective trends, the 21st century may turn out to be an unprecedented time of dis-economics that values everything contrary to the neoclassic idea of economics guiding on productivity, maximization and efficiency striving.362 Neoclassical axioms of business, finance and economic research have a limited understanding of health and well-being.363 Traditional economic growth theories considered capital and labor as essential push factors for every economy.364 Exogenous growth theory is centered on exogenous shocks. New technology innovations or natural crises - such as pandemics - are captured as major drivers or downturns of economic growth. Economic theory tries to measure the impact of economic driver triggers and exogenous shocks on capital and labor productivity.365 Endogenous growth theory draws attention to dynamic interactions between capital and labor but also endogenous growth derived from ideas, innovation and learning.366 Growth concepts were opened up for innovation generated in productive group interaction and learning in teams inside firms, learning-by-doing while performing tasks and learning-by-using of new technology.367 361.Davis et al., supra Evsey D.

HOWITT, ENDOGENOUS GROWTH112 INDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW [Vol. 19:47 The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus heightened attention to hygiene and healthcare. Applying exogenous growth theory, the health risk exposure to the exogenous shock of COVID-19 differs between employees, firms, industries, environments, and countries. Health of labor capital but also a risk-free working culture and environment are expected to become essential features of a vital workplace. Precaution, exposure, and long-term health care are also industry specific. All these variables will likely become new determinants of countries' comparative advantages that overall drives economic growth in a COVID-19- struck economy.368 In endogenous growth theory terms, team hygiene and group monitoring of the collective health status but also learning-to-preventing holds future economic growth potential.369 Applications of growth models adjusted to COVID-19 should also include inequality of growth in the digital age, which will likely rise as the COVID recovery will be digitalized.370 One can therefore hope for an economic renaissance that will emerge after COVID-19 with a focus on the economics of health and well-being. Preventive care and productivity will likely become subject areas that gain attention. In light of COVID-19 long-haul episodes of rest and recovery as well as debilitation changing erratically and unpredictably, economics could also inform a more diversified and individual intertemporal discounting function. Behavioral insights on how to navigate a turbulent world with attention deficits and under uncertainty about health status conditions may become fundamental for developing an idea of the economic benefits of rest.371 Preferences for minimalism will likely gain popularity in a turbulent world longing for recovery. In the distribution of COVID-19 relief, a system change may be accomplished when being guided by the interdisciplinary insights of 'Law and Economics' that in particular can address the disparate impact of the disease in order to derive targeted inequality alleviation strategies. As interpreted by the federal courts, a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits employment discrimination, may be shown by establishing \"that an employment practice or policy has a disproportionately adverse effect on members of the THEORY (1998); Neville Francis & Valerie A.

With a generation of COVID-19 Long Haulers affecting age and gender groups differently, being more likely occurring in thirty to fifty-year-old females, one could draw inspiration from the concept of disparate impact. While Long Haulers are not as such a protected class, certain demographic groups, particularly middle-aged females, appear to be more likely affected by COVID-19 in the long run. Employment policies that affect those afflicted with propensities for developing Long Haul COVID more than others could indirectly violate the disparate impact standard. For instance, if employers order returns to workplaces, this could imply a disproportionate risk and impact on the likelihood to develop COVID Long Haul for middle-aged females. The density and likelihood of being exposed to the virus may also play a role in particular human contact-facing industries. Future economic policy research should be informed by legal expertise on the disparate impact, which could open up the black box of the neoclassical aggregate economic functions calculus as a measure of economic growth. The combined expertise of Law and Econom ics in their unique interaction may shed light on disparate impacts of disease, public health and economic relief measures. This may lead to an interdisciplinary framework for crisis alleviation through redistribution that in combination can set the course for a better future in a more compassionate and inclusive world. IV. OUTLOOK TOWARD FUTURE RESEARCH AND POLICY We have argued that COVID-19 as a 'polycrisis' results in long-term societal changes that can broadly be summarized in a drive to preventive healthcare and a more whole-rounded recovery spectrum, digitalization aiding to fill human gaps, as well as deurbanization into agro-hoods with closeness to nature. The socio-economic impetus of a Long-Haul wave on the general healthcare, workforce and the overall societal socio-economic system in the decades to come will likely boost real-time self-monitoring of the personal healthcare status, flourish eco-wellness nutrition lifestyle change trends and require a reorganization of social welfare systems and rethinking of an economic appreciation of deurbanization, rest and calm in corporate conduct and economic calculus. On the legal level, long COVID-19 may result in class actions against employers or those responsible for 'superspreader' events. Disability status claims, as well as healthcare and pension reform needs will arise in light of the relatively young age of Long Haulers being focused on recovery and rest rather than economic productivity, which may change productivity and tax revenue substantially. Artificial intelligence, robotics, and big data insights to fill productivity gaps in humans with brain fog and cognitive impairment that comes and goes in waves are likely coming advancements to well-roundedly aid and 372.E.g., E.E.O.C. v. Sambo's of Georgia, Inc., 530 F. Supp. 86, 92 (N.D. Ga. 1981).114 INDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW [Vol. 19:47 integrate Long Haulers in society. The rights of vulnerable populations turning to online social forums to discuss their impairment problems will have to be defended in the years to come as these citizen scientists sacrifice privacy and put themselves at risk of manipulation and discrimination. The envisioned future online forums to discuss and interact must be designed with caution, connecting us for collective information exchange fueled by emotional participation in common platforms that uphold dignity in privacy and appreciation for a respective communication culture. The beauty of enjoying lavish network effects and delving into world-wide collective emotional feasts also bears a responsibility to worship our common virtual luxury temples together wisely, conscientiously, and sustainably. Big data in the healthcare sector should only be used with caution, such as in targeted information releases, to avoid discrimination. For instance, only anonymized data slices should be made available to the public in order to prevent stigmatization and discrimination based on predictable prevalence propensities within population groups or certain living areas. Taxation of data transfer revenues will grant the fiscal space to offset losses and the social costs of market distortions caused by new technologies taking over human tasks and entering the workforce in the medical marketplace. Tax revenue would also aid in guiding citizens to become more self-determined, mature, and decisive about healthcare prevention in early-on education programs that sensitize the population about potential downsides of open information exchange online. Preventative healthcare measures taken while still in a healthy state are cheaper and preferable to first symptom-centered emergency room treatment. Prevention gives people long-term flexibility through self-chosen behavioral changes. The ongoing prevention revolution will also lead to a self-determined democratization of the health system in the global development of humankind. From an economics perspective, firms will have to become resilient to the crisis, and consequently engage in long-term conversations about prevention, health, and precaution with their workforce. The unevenly distributed effects of the crisis and the growing income gap between financial market profit opportunities and real-world payment bottlenecks have increased harmful behavior such as an unhealthy diet, medication abuse and drug consumption as well as socio-psychological suffering in population groups that were already weakened before the crisis. Social inequality and the unequal effects of rising inflation and long-term low interest rates reinforce the desire for a fair social compound in harmony with the environment. The existing trends toward attention to inequality, social justice and climate change risk will accelerate the tendency toward a broadening of corporate purpose toward stakeholderism, which has already begun in the past years.373 This will especially come to life in high 373.See Catherine C.

The pandemic will change the way individuals consume in line with a more environmentally conscientious lifestyle aiding on sustainability, which will bottom-up influence the corporate world. With the COVID-19 crisis having inspired millions of workers to chase meaning in work, the time for 'passion economies' has come.374 COVID triggered widespread attention to a healthy and consumption-conscientious way of living. This also goes hand-in-hand with sustainability pledges as green food choices often meet the criteria of ecological and CO2-friendly production. COVID-19 increased the call for firms and institutional investors to pay attention to healthy lifestyles that foster prevention and help reduce the spread of the pandemic.375 With the wider stakeholder community paying attention to ethical considerations of the asset issuing entities, socially responsible investment and divestiture from environmentally-harmful actions will rise.376 Corporations may also have to give in to stakeholder pressures advocating for corporations to serve the greater good and wider stakeholder community. Socially responsible investment and carbon divestiture are effective corporate strategies against the backdrop of a warming globe. Empirical research already found that corporate social engagement was associated with corporate financial performance and positively related to long-term investments via litigation risk minimization, branding and widespread community support.377 Corporations that opt for early withdrawal may enjoy first-mover advantages in signaling pro-active ethical leadership in an already ongoing transition to renewable energy. In addition, such firms may qualify to issue climate bonds,378 thus reducing firms' costs of capital allowing them to use the green finance taxonomy as a strategic, entrepreneurial move.379 Further, corporations remaining et al., Climate Change Challenges for Central Banks and Financial Regulators, 8 NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE 462 (2018). 374.David Vallance, My Pandemic Pivot: How Crisis Inspired Millions to Chase Meaning in Their Work, DROPBOX BLOG (Aug. 31, 2021), https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/work-culture/my- IDIOT'S GUIDE TO SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTING: PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR VALUES ARE (2008). 377.See Tae Hee Choi & Jinchul Jung, Ethical Commitment, Financial Performance, and Valuation: An Empirical Investigation of Korean Companies, 81 J.

Government bailout packages are likely to be financed over the long term by the historically lowest, never-so-long-low key interest rates. Low key interest rates will continue to allow the capital market to flourish. But this is based on the cost of a weakening of the potential of the interest rate as a monetary policy tool, which the economist John Maynard Keynes described as a \"liquidity trap.\"380 The low interest rate policy brings along long-term external financing of past ideas, which impairs the flexibility of investors to finance future-oriented innovations and may hold back societal progress. Low interest rates on savings accounts in the real economy keep people trapped in the debt financing of past dreams. Household debt traps are causing massive psychosocial burdens. A so-called 'deaths of despair' trend is already noticed in the US for mid-career death spikes induc ed by alcoholism, drug use and suicide.381 The strong contrasts between COVID-19 winners and losers as well as the deep gap between strongly-positive financial market developments and the negative performance of the real economy induc ed by lockdowns, which is currently exposing the real economy to a wave of private bankruptcies and liquidity bottlenecks, therefore call on governments around the world to reboot financial markets to return to be a service industry - to serve the real economy. In this sense, the generally low interest rate creates a situation that the financial world lives at the expense of the real economy. Governance to overcome potential social friction - due to the strong polarization of financial profits sponsored by low key interest rate policy and the real economy financial constraints - points at taxing the COVID-profit industries, especially digitization winners, which could create fiscal space for redistributing some of the economic gains to industries that clearly lose from COVID-19. Taxation of digitalized economic growth during our forced digitalization disruption could provide the necessary redistribution funds to back the liquidity- dried real economy, which also faces exposure to liability risks of superspreader infection events and a propensity to higher human touchpoint frequency. Governments can also bring back the financial world in the service of improving and stabilizing the real economy in a stricter separation between investment and consumer banks, which already began in the course of the regulations following the 2008/ 09 recession. Central banks could offer diversified interest rates. Low key interest rates for driving innovation and economic growth in the financial sector could refund higher interest rates for the real economy savings for consumers in order to avert socio-psychological frictions from individual over-indebtedness in households. Online currencies, such as the currently planned European Central Bank digital currency, could help a transparent use of the currency over time to strictly divert interest rate profits and 380.KEYNES, supra note 134. 381.ANNE CASE & ANGUS DEATON, DEATHS OF DESPAIR AND THE FUTURE OF CAPITALISM (2020). 2022] GENERATION COVID-19 LONG-HAUL 117 avoid arbitrage or interest rate swapping. Mutual collateral insurance between the financial world and the real econom y would also be possible in order to spread risk. Bonds could be used to enable innovations, while repayments should be redistributed to the real economy. In addition, banks could be encouraged to use the current profits for future large-scale investments that add societal long-term value. For example, large construction projects but also innovation in research and development are valuable macroeconomic multipliers that can benefit society as a whole in the short and especially the long term.382 Governments and intergovernmental bodies, as well as the European Union as a supranational organization, have the long-term vision and financial freedom to operate on deficits but also the regulatory means to enact large-scale redistribution and long-term wealth creation in grand investments for the future. Neoclassical ideas of business, finance and economic research are limited in their understanding of health and well-being. Traditional economic growth theories considered capital and labor as essential growth factors for every econom y. The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus heightened attention to hygiene and healthcare. According to exogenous growth theory, the health risk exposure to the exogenous shock of COVID-19 differs between employees, firms, industries, environments, and countries. Health of human capital but also a risk- free working culture, environment, industry, and country will permit flourishing and growth in a COVID-19-struck economy. In endogenous growth theory terms, team hygiene and group monitoring of the collective health status but also learning-to-preventing hold future economic growth potential. Applications of COVID-19 adjusted growth models should also include inequality of growth in the digital age. While standard economic cycle theories primarily focus on describing economic correlates of booms and busts, less attention is paid to socio-economic correlates and collective fallouts of inflation expectations and interest rate pressures. Inflation has progressively entered the prevailing narrative among the people of our times.383 An expected longer-lasting inflationary pressure within society, corporations and consumers will also mean a long-hauling effect of a disproportionately heavy impact of inflation on the most vulnerable populations.384 Further, we are currently experiencing the longest-ever period of a low interest rate regime. This fosters capital flow for innovation in the finance world, while it disincentivizes household savings and decreases private consumers' resiliency. When it comes to the discussion of inflation induced in the economy by quantitative easing to pay for the rescue of the economy and uphold decent living conditions and social standards for everyone in an inclusive society, we have to acknowledge the differentiated effect of inflation on different social strata and subsequently following propensities of different social groups in order 382.KEYNES, supra note 134. 383.May Research Letter: The 3 Pillars CRESCAT CAP.

The role of socio-economic correlates and socio-psychological fallouts from economic cycles, however, has not gotten enough attention in scholarship. Likewise, policy proposals do not yet fully reflect these behavioral dynamics and interactive effects. This information is yet fundamental to understanding the collective moods in society during a crisis and the individual well-being adjacent to it that differs heavily between different social groups. The need to find a collective long-haul solution within the social compound and specific focus on disparate impacts of the crisis and its recovery on certain societal classes have not yet been recognized in the wealth of writings on Federal Reserve and Central Bank interventions, which range from fiscal and monetary policies, including interest rates to direct monetary stimulus such as quantitative easing. Law and economics scholars and practitioners could fill this gap, which is currently also gaining attention from the COVID Long Hauler Survivor Corps online. Studying the effect of economic correlates to shape decisions about one's own lifestyle over time and in the eye of prospective long- term life changing effects of COVID-19 could be a fundamental impetus for future legal research, jurisprudence, and legal practice. All these endeavors will hopefully provide guidance on how to control future external shocks in humane- led responses that improve the overall well-being of society. In handling the crisis with respect for legal advancement, economic behavioral shifts and disparate- impact conscientious policymaking, this generation can establish a lasting legacy as a gift to future generations in the form of collective knowledge on how to overcome a global crisis wisely with social justice sensitivity and compassion. V. CONCLUSION The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is an external shock to all world societies with lasting implications. Given the size, scope and impetus of the pandemic that is expected to generate a wave of COVID-19 Long Haulers as implicit agents of change, the crisis holds the potential to affect our world and modern society permanently. This Article highlighted three prospective trends that will likely shape our future world to come. Speculating about these potential changes lies at the core of navigating through a turbulent time with vigilance. After all, history offers a vital account of multiple records when crises, upheaval and periods of severe social and economic disruptions and their following recovery periods became essential turning points for lasting societal change and spring feathers of eventual betterment and comprehensive social advancement. 385.Jacob Passy, An Inflation Storm is Coming for the U.S. Housing Market, MARKETWATCH (July 13, 2021), https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/realestate/an-inflation-storm-is-coming-for- the-u-s-housing-market/ar-AAKWtdx?ocid=msedgntp [https://perma.cc/SNL8-D2SW]; Cassim et al., supra note 20; Press Release, President Joe Biden, supra note 20. 2022] GENERATION COVID-19 LONG-HAUL 119 Overall, capturing the contemporary trends and societal tendencies as well as their long-term consequences allows us to draw larger lessons for law, gove rnance, and economic analysis. In the future, we may see a reconfiguration of institutions in many jurisdictions and a different understanding of health and well-being in the larger environmental context contributing to a more behaviorally informed economic profession. Aspects of economic development - such as corporate governance - have often been analogized to biological evolution.386 As the shock of the pandemic had an immediate effect on all countries around the world, the long-term COVID- 19 long-haul impact is likely to change the larger legal frameworks and economic environment but also societal structure of modern democracies for years to come. While corporate governance evolved gradually since World War II in most Western jurisdictions,387 COVID-19 may trigger leaps in social and economic structures and institutions around the world that create a long run trajectory of system change. As long as long-haul symptoms persist in a growing body of previously infected, we are likely to see direct and indirect persistent effects in the future. In light of the potential of the Coronavirus to create an endemic threat and a wave of long-term debilitated COVID-19 Long Haulers, the governance and power dynamics in modern workplaces are expected to shift lastingly. Attention to a healthy productive environment as well as long-term prevention and healthcare focus will likely become essential features of tomorrow's corporate world. Employers are already facing pressure to create a safe and secure working environment but are also concerned about liability risks considering potential long-term disability arising from unsafe working conditions. These economic and legal costs may be outsourced to outside agencies - such as insurers, healthcare consultants, the government or intergovernmental bodies, as well as the European Union as a supranational organization. City scaping and modern inner architecture will become attuned to these preferences. Firms may work closely with government regulators to adapt to changing trends. Pro-active care for maintaining a healthy workforce and benefits that target the overall long-term well-being of employees including preventive care in teams, will become an essential corporate feature helping employers to attract qualified labor, whose bargaining power increases in the eye of labor shortages, especially in human- facing industries and positions exposed to high levels of personal interaction. COVID Long Haulers may help trigger an Artificial Intelligence revolution featuring self-monitoring and constant health status tracking. Artificial Intelligence, robotics and big data offer essential complements to fill in for long- haul attention and productivity deficits gaps that may occur in waves. Decentralized healthcare information will undergo democratization as online self- help groups bundle information on individuals' health status and discuss potential remedies free from bribery and corruption or market distortions. This trend will likely put patients and medical professionals on a more equal footing when 386.Gelter & Puaschunder, supra note 16. 387.Id.120 INDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW [Vol. 19:47 discussing diagnoses and treatment. Easier access to information will offer a cheaper alternative than seeking out doctors. Decentralized information gathering online with fellow patients will also eliminate the danger of corruption and discrimination in access to medical information. Equal access and online transparency will introduce an even greater level of quality control into the medical profession as already existing. Crowdsourcing of remedy options will also likely extend the overall range of recovery aid options for both preventative and therapeutic healthcare. At the same time, large-scale online information exchange about medical conditions and potential remedy alternatives are rather novel phenomena and therefore hardly regulated. Online crowdsourcing of information also opens gates to critical biases against those publicizing their health status online, as well as a risk of deception and fraud committed to a highly vulnerable population. Online sharing of sensitive information opens privacy concerns for a vulnerable and impaired group. This necessitates the creation of legal and regulatory frameworks to prevent abuse of online forums for marketing purposes at the expense of the well-being of susceptible patients and impaired individuals in physical and emotional pain or debilitating conditions. Long-term deliberations and hyperbolic discounting should be integrated into academic and political debates in order to protect individuals when innocently sharing medical information and compassionately seeking or extending non-medically trained help. Generation COVID Long-haul partially being recognized as disabled creates pressure to reform social, healthcare and retirement systems. Given waves of debilitation in a crisis-struck world, in which larger inequality gaps opened, the time for a disparate impact analysis of public policies has come in order to strategically focus rescue and recovery aid. Legal and economic endeavors of the future should establish guidelines for a more diversified reflection of contemporary trends in order to channel governmental rescue and recovery efforts to those in need at the right time. The field of Law and Economics can provide the necessary interdisciplinary viewpoints and synergy potential to evaluate the disparate impact of the crisis and its remedy efforts within society. Public policy recommendations and implementation guidance should particularly emphasize contemporary and anticipated long-haul patterns and trends. In the wake of ambitious bailout and recovery plans, a law and economics view could highlight necessary disparate impact facets of the economic fallouts to a common crisis. The unequally distributed economic gains and losses resulting from the pandemic should become the basis of redistribution efforts. Behavioral economics insights could aid in understanding the socio-economic and psychological disparate impetus of the crisis. Only a diversified analysis with respect to race, age, gender, heritage, wealth, and income brackets allows choosing capital transfer targets strategically. All analysis and redistribution efforts should be driven by fairness mandates and guided with a long-term view in mind. As for scientific advancements, Generation COVID Long-Haul has the potential to imbue minimalism, rest and recovery as central axioms into a refocused economic calculus. Behavioral insights and leadership theories may inspire economic theory and policy modelling for attention to well-timed minimalism, rest, and recovery. In the scientific community, there is currently a2022] GENERATION COVID-19 LONG-HAUL 121 heightened concern overreaching tipping points and irreversible lock-ins regarding global warming. The direct consequences of climate change, such as severe weather disasters, are additional external stressors for a cohort longing for rest and recovery. Both trends are interconnected and will likely be integrated into holistic preventive medicine models of the future. Healthy nutrition changes resulting in a greening diet that is anti-inflammatory can also help achieve climate goals better than prolonged human physical suffering in the wake of chronic diseases, economic unproductivity of long-term debilitation and ecological overexploitation by enriching groundwater with excessive drug consumption waste. A humane and environmentally-friendly transformation - through the establishment of agro-hood Ecowellness hubs that practice a healthy lifestyle together in a growing community of like-minded individuals will likely continue to thrive in the future. This soft transformation of society could become a more powerful wave than a shock therapy of industry transitioning for the sake of greening the economy that may lead to short-term bottlenecks, unemployment and social frictions on top of taking too long to catch the closing time window to act on climate change. Regarding healthcare changes, a cadre of chronically debilitated and sick will lead to a drive to alleviate chronic diseases. Already now, the United States Congress approved 1.15 billion USD in funding over four years for the United States National Institute of Health to support research to understand and cure the prolonged health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infections.388 Among the symptoms investigated by researchers, chronic fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath and memory fog range among the top mentions of chronic COVID-19 symptoms. By drawing public attention, the prevalence of these symptoms will likely create pressure to find remedies and generate compassion for those affected in society. Immune system related research and attention to the unspecific immune response based on activation levels but also inflammatory misfunctioning in autoimmune diseases will likely gain a greater emphasis in science as well, when considering the current state-of-the-art knowledge on the long-term effects reported by COVID Long Haulers.389 Anot her trend of the post-COVID world that will likely persist is the self- monitoring and self-measurement of body functions. Artificial intelligence support in monitoring and self-testing kits has gained unprecedented momentum in record speed during the COVID pandemic. With the general population partially being concerned about visiting medical facilities as potential virus transmission points and in some cases having particularly asked to stay away from attending a hospital for care during the pandemic, new online consultation revolutions in telemedicine but also online forums have started, which are likely 388.Francis S. Collins, NIH Launches New Initiative to Study \"Long Kolata, You're Missing But Is 'Rewilding' the Way to Get Them Back?, N.Y.

A wave of Long Haulers following after patients suffering from acute disease will likely continuously exacerbate these trends. In the end, telemedicine can also spread access to affordable healthcare around the world and could become a game changer for international development. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a trend to relocate from large metropolitan areas to more rural ones for the sake of social distancing. In places closer to nature, people have reconnected with the environment during a crucial time in light of climate change. Today, there is a heightened demand for climate stabilization featuring concerted mitigation and adaptation efforts. Creative Ecowellness communities pursuing a sustainable lifestyle may emerge as innovations of our time by paying tribute to health and well-being within the given natural constraints of our ecological limits. Future cities may also see ecological pricing reforms that contribute to the trend toward environmentalism. Active cityscape projects may feature strategies such as forestation or commercial plants to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere but also behavioral changes.390 Already now, we can identify a trend towards individualized cars and further behavioral changes will likely force transportation to become more hygienic and individualized.391 Lastly, the cities of tomorrow will likely feature intergenerational conscientiousness in protecting older and low immune system risk groups from contagious diseases, but also protect COVID long-haul risk groups among middle-aged females.392 Corporate settings, industry demands, and economic growth will likely stem from attuning to these Ecowellness trends and sustainable lifestyles in the future. In light of the elevated risk for females to become COVID Long Haulers, employers could voluntarily become more willing to grant females more flexibility for home office workplace solutions and digitalized interaction opportunities, or may be forced to do so by legal action, as they will take into consideration discrimination and long-term risk calculus. All these developments will likely enrich our post-COVID society in a sustainable, healthy, and humane- 390.Jo\u00e3o Paulo Braga et al., It Could Go Like 2020), https://www. zeit.de/ autoren/B/Joao-Paulo_Braga/ [https://perma.cc/R6KK-Z8NN]; Nikolaj Skydsgaard, World's Largest Plant Capturing (Sept. 8, 2021), https://www.reuters. com/business/environment/worlds-largest-plant-capturing-carbon-air-starts-iceland-2021-09-08/ [https://perma.cc/Q6FE-Z9YR]; Agance France-Presse, World's Biggest Machine Capturing Carbon from Air Turned on in Iceland, GUARDIAN (Sept. 8, 2021), https://www. theguardian.com/ environment/2021/sep/09/worlds-biggest-plant-to-turn-carbon-dioxide-into-rock-opens-in-iceland- orca [https://perma.cc/MGX9-TSLW].

On a more global macro-economic level, the Green New Deal and European Green Deal as post-COVID-19 recovery paths forward include sustainability pledges. A sustainable finance taxonomy may also innovatively include healthcare reforms and governmental funding of long-term health pledges in order to cater to a wave of COVID-19 Long Haulers. Attention to the integration of Artificial Intelligence into healthcare and medicine should be coupled with the insights of a cadre of those periodically suffering from long-haul symptoms. Novel technologies come in handy in particular for those who wish to track their health in real time and those who have unstable conditions and are facing waves of symptoms and recurring disability. Artificial Intelligence could be integrated to provide support when patients face difficulty that may set on unpredictably and/or periodically. Human-Artificial Intelligence compatibility will be key in navigating obscure symptoms and complex waves of multi-organ functionality deficiencies. Big data insights will enable researchers and physicians to find patterns and clusters in waves of complex symptoms. In the future, the 21st century may well come to be seen as an unprecedented time of anti-economics that valued everything contrary to the neoclassic idea of economics of productivity, maximization, and efficiency. With this generation of COVID-19 Long Haulers, who are around a median age in their 30s, 40s and 50s, a dramatic shift in demand for health, minimalism and rest is predicted to emerge. In particular COVID Long Haulers appear to have a preference for unwinding speed and avoiding mental overload. While standard neoclassical economic theory is based on the belief that efficiency maximization stemming from productivity gains and activation level increases is the ultimate preference of all individuals, COVID Long Haulers may develop - for the first time in economic history - a large-scale demand for attention to disability, rest and relaxation and thereby drive a trend of the economics of unwinding into slowness. In a generation of COVID-19 Long Haulers, a dramatic demand for health, minimalism and rest is predicted to emerge. Maximization of productivity driven industries in business, finance and economics do not account for minimalism. There is little appreciation for rest in finance and economics. Foremost, behavioral economics started to address cognitive overload and decision-making failures in a too complex world for the human mind bound by cognitive overload. Behavioral health efforts could address these trends of attention to health, minimalism and rest and cooperate with the COVID-19 Long Haulers generation that may change society lastingly. Legal professionals will address issues resulting from the presence of a growing cohort of long-haul sufferers in the workforce. Drawing from behavioral insights, the laws of human productivity after rest will have to be better understood. The same is true for differences in time discounting over life stages. The role of critical life events of a COVID infection to lastingly change life perspectives and decision making will need to be better understood and more accurately described by sciences investigating the family, the workforce but also economic variables. With Long Haulers facing trends of changing health conditions, nove l workforce uncertainty will become a topic of discussion for corporate governance and business contingency planning. Flexibility and124 INDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW [Vol. 19:47 compassion will likely become the essential leadership qualifications in tomorrow's workplace, in which Long Haulers are prone to face fast-paced symptoms and work capability changes. The newly imposed obligation of corporations to ensure a healthy work environment will likely remain in place after the pandemic and will be coupled with certain rights of employers to monitor and track the health status of the workforce as well as force vaccination and other prevention and precaution mandates upon workers. Corporate management will have to become attuned to the health situation of employees and will likely divide capital into artificial intelligence and a more unpredictable human workforce with an appreciation for rest and relaxation. New activation studies will be needed and will have to be guided by behavioral specialists that identify the right balance between work and rest. These studies will likely be inspired by activation research such as the Yerkes-Dodson law, which predicts the individual activation level.393 Similar research could capture the overall immune system status to determine individual potentials and avoid overstimulation of the immune response leading to potential work deficiencies and quality of life impairments after a COVID infection. All these trends in the economics of unwinding, relaxation and rest will likely become major drivers of a new revolution in economics that shifts attention away from profit maximization, productivity, and speed to focus on minimalism, relaxation and rest. Previously avoidable states of rest, inaction and unproductivity that were deemed as problematic will be seen as a desired luxury outcome. The maximization of minimalism is likely to become a trend that will change the way society produces, consumes, and gratifies. Artificial Intelligence and robotics could keep an economic growth level while human beings start focusing on relaxation and letting go. Legal scholarship can add to this trend in carving out the borderlines of rest and recovery and establishing social norms in workspaces and protect from discrimination of resting individuals, but also in other contexts, such as public spaces, public transportation, and commercial settings. Space for individualized healthcare monitoring and testing has already been demanded and will likely continue to gain further attention as we recover from the pandemic with a growing population that will need to engage in continuous healthcare status tracking. In view of the long-term effects of the Coronavirus crisis and the growing climate change threats, a change in values will likely take place in the course of a modern renaissance that tackles the crisis of our lifestyles - if humans feel they have become detached from the environment and in light of our recovering bodies and fellow human longing for long-haul rest and recovery. The interdisciplinary field of Law and Economics is predestined to play a pioneering role in the governance of changing societal values that can bring about an improvement in social and cultural prosperity via the detour of a global crisis. Law and Economics of the future can harness a mental rebirth based on novel and exciting opportunities and positive societal advancements that come out of the 393.See Robert M. Yerkes & John D.
