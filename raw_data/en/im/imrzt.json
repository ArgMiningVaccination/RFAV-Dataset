Every year the charitable organization, based in California, designs and publishes a '40s-style pin-up calendar modeled after World War II-era pin-ups popular with troops. Except these pin-ups aren't movie stars. They all are military veterans from different branches of the service who have moved on to other successful careers. A casting call went out last spring and three San Diego area women are among the chosen models: U.S. Army veteran Claudia Padilla, a diesel mechanic who was deployed to Iraq in 2005-'06; U.S. Coast Guard retiree Lucy Love, who spent 14 years as a response ashore officer specializing in emergency management, and Megan Fenyoe, a mental health therapist formerly with the U.S. Air Force. Pin-Ups for Vets was born in 2006 when California resident, Gina Elise, while not a veteran herself was struck by the number of U.S. troops coming back from Iraq in need of medical care. \"I felt very strongly that I wanted to do something to support them,\" said the Claremont resident. So that is what she did. She launched a nonprofit that, with the help of volunteers, donates rehab equipment, sends care packages, sponsors makeovers for spouses of deployed service members and conducts a good will tour visiting hospitalized military and vets around the country. Due to COVID-19, this year's tour was cancelled, and calendars and notes of appreciation are being mailed instead. Fenyoe, 33, now lives in Mission Valley and is working as a civilian mental health therapist. She has started her own nonprofit organization, I Am Enough. She also is raising money to build an emergency shelter and transition home in San Diego for abused women and children. \"I love what Pin-Ups for Vets is doing with the calendar and giving power to women,\" she said. \"We don't give enough attention to women vets and the sacrifices they have made.\" Padilla, of Vista, described her involvement in the calendar as an \"empowering experience.\" She has started a general engineeering/contracting business with a partner and is anxious to personally reach out to veterans when volunteer visits are allowed in the hospitals after the pandemic subsides. Love, 39, while serving in the Coast Guard for 14 years, was stationed in several different states. She spent nearly two years traveling around Southeast Asia assisting various countries as part of a Department of Defense disaster response team. Love recently retired, moved to San Marcos and now is pursuing a medical degree in acupuncture and Chinese medicine with the goal of using her medical training to help serve veterans. The calendar pin-ups were interviewed remotely Monday by the TV newsmagazine, \"Inside Edition,\" for an upcoming nationwide broadcast. All of the calendar pin-ups have done amazing things post-military service, Elise stresses. \"We constantly get emails from mothers and grandmothers about how these ladies are inspiring their daughters.\" Never too old: It's not often that a 99-year-old person gets a college doctoral degree. Enter retired Navy Radm. Doniphan Shelton, 99. He was awarded his honorary Ph.D. in National University's virtual graduation ceremony live-streamed on Sept. 25. The university's president, David Andrews, aimed to please. He came to Shelton's Del Mar home to do the honors in person. The ceremony was videotaped and aired during the college's recent graduation ceremony. Adm. Shelton's bio, as well as his tireless campaign to nominate retired World War II Navy Capt. E. Royce Williams for a Medal of Honor, were submitted to the university for doctoral degree consideration by Shelton's colleagues at the American Legion Post 416 in Encinitas. \"My mother was an English teacher,\" said a smiling Shelton as he accepted the degree. \"I'm sure she's looking down on this with "}
