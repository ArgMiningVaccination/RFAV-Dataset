The evidence required to determine whether an individual has an exemption from immunisation requirements is outlined later in this topic. Note: Between 1 July 2012 and 31 December 2015, different approved exemptions were applied to [FA](/family-assistance-guide/acronyms#fa) payments ( [8.1.2](/family-assistance-guide/8/1/2)). The following recognised immunisation providers ( [1.1.R.09](/family-assistance-guide/1/1/r/09)) are eligible to certify that a child is medically contraindicated or that a child does not require immunisation because the child has developed a natural immunity: - a general practitioner that is vocationally registered, or a fellow of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP), or Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine (ACRRM) - a paediatrician - a public health physician - an infectious diseases physician, or - a clinical immunologist. Approved exemptions from immunisation A child has an approved exemption from FTB Part A immunisation requirements where: - the child has a medical contraindication - the child has natural immunity - the child is a part of an approved vaccine study - the vaccine is temporarily unavailable - the child is vaccinated overseas, or - the Secretary has determined that the child meets the immunisation requirements. Medical contraindication Only recognised immunisation providers listed above are eligible to certify that a child does not require immunisation because the child has a medical contraindication to vaccination. The certification of a medical contraindication must be made in the form and manner and be accompanied by any documents required by Centrelink. A certification of a medical contraindication must be made through the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) site or on the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) Immunisation medical exemption form ( [IM011](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-03/im011-2303en-f.pdf) PDF, 148kB). Example: A child who suffers from anaphylaxis following a previous dose of the relevant vaccine. If so, a recognised immunisation provider may certify that immunisation is medically contraindicated on the approved form. Natural immunity Only recognised immunisation providers listed above are eligible to certify that a child does not require immunisation because the child has developed a natural immunity. The certification of natural immunity must be made in the form and manner and be accompanied by any documents required by Centrelink. The certification of natural immunity must be made through the AIR site or on the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) Immunisation medical exemption form (IM011). Generally, a natural immunity exemption will only be applied to a specific antigen (not the whole schedule). A natural immunity exemption should be applied for life (based on the clinical assessment of a recognised immunisation provider). Example: A child who has previously contracted measles may have developed a natural immunity to contracting the disease again and therefore, does not need to be immunised against measles again. Approved vaccine study A child meets the immunisation requirements if the child is a participant in a vaccine study approved by a Human Research Ethics Committee registered with the National Health and Medical Research Council. Temporary unavailability of vaccine Where a child is not vaccinated as required and the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer has declared that the relevant vaccine/s (or all vaccines) are temporarily unavailable the child is considered to meet the immunisation requirements, provided the child has received all other relevant vaccinations. A child meets the immunisation requirements on this basis only until such time as the vaccine becomes available. Act reference: [FAAct](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00490) section 6(4) Temporary unavailability of vaccine Children vaccinated overseas A child who was vaccinated in another country meets the immunisation requirements if a recognised immunisation provider determines that the vaccinations match the Australian childhood schedule (birth to 4 years) and records this information on the AIR. Act reference: [FAAct](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00490) section 6(5) Child vaccinated overseas Secretary may determine a child meets immunisation requirements The table below details circumstances where the Secretary can determine a child meets the immunisation requirements: |Exception/exemption||Circumstances| |Refusal of consent to vaccination|| violence|| | |Permanent humanitarian visa holder|| | |Unacceptable risk of harm to child or another person|| | Act reference: [FAAct](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00490) section 6(6) Secretary's decision [Family Assistance (Immunisation Principles and Vaccination Schedules) Determination 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/F2018L00876) Policy reference: FA Guide [2.1.3.10](/family-assistance-guide/2/1/3/10) FTB immunisation requirements Evidence required to determine exception/exemption The table below explains the required evidence to determine whether an individual has an exemption from immunisation. |Exception/exemption||Evidence required| | | Medical contraindication Natural immunity | | |Approved vaccine study|| | |Temporary unavailability of vaccine|| | |Child overseas|| | |Refusal of consent to vaccination|| | |Risk of family violence|| | |Permanent humanitarian visa holder|| | |Unacceptable risk of harm to child or a person administering the vaccination|| | Act reference: [FAAct](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00490) section 6 Immunisation requirements [Family Assistance (Immunisation Principles and Vaccination Schedules) (DSS) Determination 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/F2018L00876) Policy reference: FA Guide [1.1.I.10](/family-assistance-guide/1/1/i/10) Immunisation requirements (FTB, CCS), [1.2.1](/family-assistance-guide/1/2/1) Family tax benefit (FTB) - description "}
