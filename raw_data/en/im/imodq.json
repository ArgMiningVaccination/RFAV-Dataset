In Chinese culture, qi (or chi) is the energy of the universe. It flows through all living beings and connects us energetically, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Here is a primer on this powerful animating force and how to work with it to stay healthy. Advertisement What is chi? The simple definition of chi is life force, or energy. Chi is not a substance but a power\u2014like an electric current that lights a bulb. The character for chi () means \"energy'' or \"essence.\" It depicts air with a pot of rice within and represents transformational power. Think of it like a seed that can be dormant for years but still have life force within it, just waiting to be awakened by dirt, water, and sunlight. Chi is best understood in relation to [yin and yang](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/yin-and-yang-meaning). The principles of yin and yang theory are based on dynamic balance via the movement of chi energy. Chi is invisible, only seen through the influence it has on living beings and material forms. Magnets are an example of chi in accordance with yin and yang: One side is north; the opposing side is south. They push and pull, but when spun together they are a generator of electricity. In [traditional Chinese medicine](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/traditional-chinese-medicine) (TCM), it is believed that all vital functions within the body are also governed by the changes and movements of different types of chi, including Yuan chi (primary chi), Zong chi (chest or lung), Ying chi (nutritive), and Wei chi (defensive chi). Chi is thought to run through energy pathways in the body known as meridians. When the body is out of balance, TCM practitioners look at what symptoms are occurring and what chi pattern is presenting itself. Advertisement The history of chi. The character for chi is depicted on [Oracle bones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_bone_script)\u2014a Chinese script that dates back to the second millennium B.C., indicating that chi was already a familiar concept back then. Though the concept of chi originates from China, it is recognized throughout Asia and connected to spiritual observation such as Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism, and other practices of enlightenment. It is nearly impossible to pinpoint \"when\" the concept of chi was fully integrated into a belief system, as there is no record of it not existing. Why is chi energy important? Simply put: Without the flow of chi, there would be no life. Here's what makes this principle so important: - For our health: It is thought that chi must be able to flow freely in order for health and wellness to occur. [The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2287209/) [1](#citations)(237 B.C.) states \"Where there is free flow, no pain. Where there is pain, no free flow.\" Promoting the free flow of chi and blood is a guiding principle in Chinese medicine. - For our surroundings: The art and science of [feng shui](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/feng-shui-for-every-room-in-your-home)seeks to achieve a free flow of chi in the environment.

According to Chinese medicine, we are born with a set amount of essence, called jing (prenatal chi), and that must last us a lifetime. Activities such as overworking, stressing, and \"abusing\" the body will burn this essence and shorten the life span. When we get stressed, our nervous system goes into fight-or-flight mode, tapping into the adrenal glands. If the body does not quickly return to a rest-and-digest state, the flow of chi is disrupted. This can lead to chi stagnation, which leaves the whole body feeling swollen and stiff. Here are a few signs that your chi is out of balance: - You stay up late and do not sleep well during the night (yin and yang are reversed). - You work too much and do not allow enough time for your body to heal. - You indulge in nutrient-poor foods and alcohol. - You have emotional irritability and anger. - You feel burnout. - You have low energy and fatigue. - You gain weight easily. - You have irregular menstrual cycles. - You have body aches and pains.
