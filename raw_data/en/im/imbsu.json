All babies are different and develop at their own special pace, so try not to worry if your baby isn't doing all of these things just yet. You'll probably notice these changes soon. [More on infant development](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/structured-content/normal-growth-and-development-infants-and-toddlers-181739). Whooping cough Whooping cough is on the rise in the U.S. [Whooping cough](http://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/structured-content/whooping-cough-pertussis-683522), also called pertussis, is a contagious disease that spreads easily through coughing. A person of any age can catch whooping cough. However, it can be life-threatening for babies 6 months and younger, since it can interfere with breathing or make infants cough so much they can't breathe. The good news is that staying current with immunizations can prevent whooping cough and keep your baby safe. How can I protect my baby from whooping cough? - All adults who come into close contact with your baby should get the Tdap booster shot, including parents, grandparents, and day care workers. - Make sure that older siblings or other children in close contact with the baby have received their booster shot. Protect infants by ensuring that older children get their Tdap booster beginning at 11 years of age. - Make sure your baby is up-to-date with recommended immunizations. - If you are not sure if you and your family members have been properly vaccinated against whooping cough, check your immunization records by viewing your [Preventive Health Reminders](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/applogin/?callbackUrl=/ncal/healthreminders/&fragmentUrl=/reminders) online through your physician's [home page](http://www.kp.org/mydoctor). - Learn more about keeping your baby healthy with [well baby visits and immunizations](http://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/mdo/presentation/conditions/conditionpage.jsp?condition=Health_Topic_Well_Baby_Visits_and_Immunizations.xml#sectionUrl%7C/ncal/mdo/presentation/conditions/conditionpage.jsp%7CWellBabyVisits(Checkups)). Talk to your doctor about what is right for you and your family so that you can protect your baby against whooping cough. Also, remind others to cover their mouths when they cough and to wash their hands often. Breast milk: the ideal nutrition for your baby Breast milk is the best food for babies during the first 6 months of life. It provides all the nutrition your baby needs. Your body will produce more milk as your baby's needs increase, so keep eating a healthy, balanced diet, drinking lots of water, and taking your prenatal multivitamin. - If you're breastfeeding exclusively (no formula), now's the time to start giving your baby vitamin D drops (400 IU). - Hopefully you and your baby have settled into a comfortable breastfeeding routine. If so, it's okay to start giving your baby a pacifier or a bottle of pumped breast milk if you'd like. - While breastfeeding is a great way to feed and bond with your baby, it is possible to experience challenges. Alert us about any trouble you're having right away by calling the Advice and Appointment line at 1-866-454-8855. See the article on [Common Breastfeeding Challenges](http://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/structured-content/common-breastfeeding-challenges-807518) for more information. About formula - If you cannot or choose not to breastfeed, iron-fortified formula is the recommended substitute. The good news is that there is really very little difference among formula brands. They all have the appropriate amounts of calories, vitamins, and minerals. - The two basic types of formula are based on either cow's milk or soy protein. Most pediatricians recommend starting with a cow's milk-based formula. If you believe the formula doesn't agree with your baby, talk to your pediatrician. Soy formula may be an alternative for babies who can't tolerate cow's milk. More information on [choosing a formula](http://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Choosing-a-Formula.aspx). - Make sure to keep enough formula on hand. Most 1-month-old babies average anywhere from 20 to 30 ounces of formula each day. Whether you're breastfeeding or bottle feeding - Continue to feed your baby \"on demand.\" Let your baby decide how often and how much to eat. Usually, breastfed babies at this stage of growth need to eat about 8 to 12 times a day. For formula-fed, it's around 6 times every 24 hours. - Babies are very good at letting you know when they're full: your baby will turn away from the nipple, close his or her mouth, and seem interested in things other than eating. Don't force your baby to finish the breast or bottle. - Almost all babies spit up at times.

Help your baby sleep safe and sound Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), or \"crib death,\" is the sudden and unexplained death of an infant under 1 year of age. Learn how you can help prevent SIDS and keep your baby safe. What is SIDS? How common is it? About 1 in 5,000 babies in the United States dies of SIDS every year. SIDS is the leading cause of death in infants 1 to 12 months of age, though it most commonly occurs between 2 and 4 months of age. The death is sudden and usually occurs while the baby is asleep. The cause of SIDS is unknown, but there are ways to reduce your baby's chance of dying of SIDS. What can I do to prevent SIDS? One of the most important things you can do to help reduce the risk of SIDS is to put your baby on his back to sleep. This alone can lower the risk of SIDS by 15 to 20 percent. It's still important to give your baby supervised \"tummy time\" every day to help strengthen his or her arm and leg muscles. But for sleeping, at night and for all naps, your baby should always be on his back. More ways to reduce the risks of SIDS: - Place your baby on a firm mattress or bedding to sleep. Babies should never sleep on a waterbed, sheepskin, pillow, or other soft surface. - Sleep in the same room with your baby, but not in the same bed. Your baby should sleep in a safe crib or bassinet nearby. - Keep soft materials, such as pillows, blankets, bumper pads, or stuffed toys out of your baby's bed to avoid the risk of smothering. - Do not use infant sleep positioners. These are devices designed to maintain a side- or back-sleeping position. Babies have suffocated, prompting federal safety agencies to issue warnings and recalls. - Make sure that your baby's face and head stay uncovered during sleep. On chilly nights, dress your baby in a warm sleeper or sleep sack. - Keep the room where your baby sleeps ventilated by using a fan or keeping a window open. - Don't let your baby get too hot. Dress him with the same amount of clothes that you're wearing when it's warm out. - Consider giving your baby a pacifier when you put him to sleep. After your baby falls asleep, don't re-insert the pacifier into his mouth if it falls out. Don't force your baby to take a pacifier if he doesn't want it. - Don't let anyone smoke around your baby. If you smoke and are looking to quit, Kaiser Permanente has resources, medications, and classes to help. For information, go to [kp.org/quitsmoking](https://members.kaiserpermanente.org/kpweb/entryPage.do?cfe=428&rop=MRN). - Check to see that your crib is Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association (JPMA) certified. Do not use a crib with drop sides. For more, see [crib safety and new crib standards](http://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/New-Crib-Standards-What-Parents-Need-to-Know.aspx). - If someone else takes care of your baby, make sure your caregiver is aware of these recommendations.

Medical experts are constantly reviewing the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. Giving your child the right vaccinations at the right time provides the best prevention for certain diseases. Why should I immunize my baby? Diseases like measles, whooping cough, and chicken pox are still common in our communities but are preventable with vaccination. Kids who are not immunized can become very sick from these diseases and infect others. The single best way to prevent these and other illnesses, like the flu, is by getting your child immunized. What shots are recommended? When will my baby have them? Several immunizations are recommended, starting at your baby's 2 month well-check. Find all the details about your child's immunization schedule in this article on [Immunizations For Young Children](http://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/structured-content/immunizations-shots-for-babies-and-young-children-27471). I have heard that vaccination causes autism. Is this true? No. While autism is a serious public health concern, vaccines do not cause it. Over the last decade, the rates of autism have risen dramatically in many countries, including the U.S. Some people have claimed that vaccines are the cause. However, hundreds of studies have shown no evidence that any vaccine or combination of vaccines causes autism. Do not postpone or avoid vaccines for your child. If you're concerned about autism, talk to your pediatrician to learn more, or [read about autism on our website](http://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/structured-content/autism-spectrum-disorder-asd-in-children-853117). Is there still mercury in the vaccines? No, all vaccines currently being given to children under 3 years old are FDA-approved and thimerasol-free (contains no mercury). The only vaccine presently containing thimerasol is the flu shot for adults and older children. Studies have shown no connection between thimerasol and autism. Can I split up some of the vaccines rather than give all scheduled immunizations at once? There is no benefit to splitting up the vaccines. Not following the vaccination schedule could mean your child is not well protected against certain diseases. Splitting up vaccines may also require your child to get more shots later. Your child's immune system is capable of accepting a far greater number of antigens than are given during the first two years through vaccines, even if they were all given at once. Your child's health and safety are important to us -- and to you! Stick with the recommended immunization schedule for the best protection. Where can I get more information about immunizations? Crying or colic? Babies cry for many reasons. They cry when they are uncomfortable, hungry, tired, in pain, bored, or just overstimulated. Many babies cry for several hours at night and nothing seems to help. Often, this is referred to as colic. How do I know if it's colic? Colic isn't a disease, but rather a condition that consists of inconsolable crying, usually at night. Unlike other types of crying, colic usually follows the \"rule of three\": - It starts in the first 3 months after birth. - It lasts for more than 3 hours at a time. - It happens more than 3 days a week. It is common to feel scared, upset, or frustrated when you cannot comfort your baby. The good news is that colic goes away as your baby matures. In most babies, it almost always ends by the fourth month or sooner. What causes colic? Doctors aren't sure what causes colic. In the past, people thought it was caused by pain from digestive problems. However, we now know that the inconsolable crying we call colic is: - Not related to digestive problems. - Not caused by pain or illness. - Not your fault or your baby's fault. Some babies do have digestive issues that can cause crying. Some are sensitive to dairy or other foods in a breastfeeding mom's diet (or sensitive to milk or soy protein in their formula). However, these babies tend to cry more than average throughout the day instead of just at night. If you're concerned that your baby may have digestive issues, talk to your pediatrician. What helps? Some studies show that babies who are carried more during the day (in a front pack or sling) cry less at night. Sometimes a wet diaper can make a baby fussy. Make sure that your baby's diaper is clean. Make sure that your baby isn't too hot or cold or simply bored. Try swaddling your baby, especially at naptime and at night. Some babies feel secure when they are wrapped up snugly. Try rocking your baby. Placing the baby stomach down over your knee or forearm may also help. Or calm your baby with a walk outside or a ride in the car. Placing your baby near the hum of a clothes dryer, dishwasher, or bubbling aquarium may be soothing. Although no single method works every time to relieve colicky babies, there are many things you can try. Be creative and persistent, and remember this won't last forever. How long will this last? Colic goes away as the baby matures and almost always ends by the fourth month. In the meantime, try some of the techniques in this article to soothe your baby. And remember to soothe yourself, too. Ask for help, or take turns caring for your colicky baby so you and your partner can each take a break. If you are concerned about your baby's crying, or are having difficulty coping, contact your pediatrician for advice and support.

Adjusting to life with the demands of a new baby is a big change. As much as you love your baby, you're probably coping with a lot of other feelings right now. Your baby needs a lot of your attention, which means less time for yourself and your partner. Add in lack of sleep, cabin fever, and no time to take a shower, and you have a recipe for stress. What helps? If you're feeling isolated: - Get out of the house. Whether it's a walk around your neighborhood, a trip to the park, or a visit with friends or family, it can help you feel less alone. - Talk to your partner or others close to you about how you're feeling and ask for assistance. - Make an effort to meet other new parents -- they're dealing with the same issues you are. Sign up for a [parenting class or support group](https://members.kaiserpermanente.org/kpweb/classes/entrypage.do?rop=MRN) at your local Kaiser Permanente facility, or look for a community group near you. If you're feeling overwhelmed: - Remind yourself that you're dealing with a lot and that this intense time won't last forever. - Remember to be easy on yourself. No one expects you to be perfect. Ask for what you need -- whether it's emotional support, help with chores and errands, or help caring for other children. - Carve out some time for yourself by having someone watch the baby while you rest, take a walk, or do something nice for yourself for a few hours. If you're feeling sad, anxious, or hopeless: - Mood changes are normal during the first few weeks, but sometimes these feelings may last longer and can be more intense. These could be symptoms of postpartum depression. - Talk to your doctor right away if your symptoms are severe or go on for more than a few weeks. [Postpartum depression](http://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/mdo/presentation/conditions/conditionpage.jsp?condition=Condition_Pregnancy_and_Depression_-_ObGyn.xml) is treatable. We're here to help. For partners: preparing to return to work Leaving your little one to go back to work can be a tough transition, and you may find yourself distracted as you shift gears back into your work routine. - Find ways to stay connected during the day. It can help to call or email your partner or care provider to check in and see how things are going. Keep pictures of your partner and baby near your phone or on your desk as a reminder of what you have to come home to. - Coping with sleep deprivation can be especially tough once you're back at work. If you have the opportunity, try to take a brief nap during your lunch break. Even if you don't sleep, resting in a quiet place (such as your car) can help you make it through the day. - Adjusting to your new role as a parent is a process. Remember that your role in the family is different now, and that your partner is going through a similar shift. Keep the lines of communication open and find new ways to stay connected and close. Read more about the family adjustment and [shift in roles](http://members.kaiserpermanente.org/kpweb/healthency.do?hwid=ty6171\u00a7ionId=ty6176&contextId=ty6171&rop=MRN). Common questions What are the top safety tips for babies this age? In addition to putting your baby on his back to sleep, make sure you're following the recommendations below. Car seats: Your child should always ride in a rear-facing car seat until they are at least two years of age or exceed the seat manufacturer's highest height or weight limits. Make sure the seat is properly installed in the back seat and use it for every ride. The [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](http://www.safercar.gov/) site includes safety tips, a buying guide, and videos on correct installation. Visit [Seatcheck.org](http://www.seatcheck.org/) to find a child seat safety inspection station near you and get help installing and using child safety seats. You can also call 1-866-SEAT-CHECK to find an inspection station or to make an appointment to have your seat inspected. It's best to buy a new car seat or a seat owned by someone you know, so you can verify that it hasn't been in an accident. If you're borrowing a car seat or have purchased a used seat, check the date on the seat to make sure it is not expired (most seats last around 6 years) and check the manufacturer's website to make sure it has not been recalled. Cigarette smoke: Do not allow anyone to smoke around your baby. Your home, car, and other places that your baby stays should also be smoke free. If you or your partner wants help to quit, we can help. Take a look at our [resources](http://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/mdo/presentation/conditions/conditionpage.jsp?condition=Health_Topic_Tobacco_-_How_Quit_-_Staying_Healthy.xml) for more information. Prevent burns: Turn your water heater temperature down to warm or low (less than 120 degrees). Don't warm bottles in the microwave as hot milk can burn your baby's mouth. To avoid the risk of falls, never leave your baby alone on a bed, sofa. Always keep one hand on your baby. Never leave your child alone with any animal, even family pets. Learn to recognize signs of aggression in your pets and take action if you're concerned. How can I get my baby to start taking a bottle? Some babies will take a bottle right away. Others can be very picky depending on the nipple, the time of day, or what's in the bottle. Trying something new with your baby, like starting a bottle, often is easier earlier in the day rather than later when baby and parents are more tired. Help the baby make the transition. Have your partner or another family member try to give the bottle instead of Mom. Some babies become so attached to Mom that they will refuse a bottle from her. Try not to be discouraged if it takes a few attempts; your baby will get the hang of it. Anything left in the bottle after an hour should be thrown away, as bacteria starts to form. Don't put it back in the refrigerator to save for later. How and when do I pump and store breast milk? You may find it easier to pump right after a feeding, since the milk is already flowing, or you may find that between feeds works better. If you are returning to work, you'll want to pump on a regular schedule when you would normally feed your baby at home. This helps prevent engorgement (swollen breasts) and keeps up a regular supply of milk. Breast milk can be stored at room temperature for about 6 to 8 hours (if it's cooler than 72 degrees), in the refrigerator for up to 7 days, and in the freezer for several months. Thaw frozen milk in the refrigerator and use it within 7 days. Don't re-freeze it. And remember: don't warm milk or bottles in the microwave. Hot milk can burn your baby's mouth. When can I travel/fly with my baby? While full-term, healthy babies can fly safely right away, it isn't necessarily a good idea. The air on planes is recirculated, making it is more likely that you and your baby may be exposed to airborne viruses. Baby's immune systems are still developing, so it's better to wait for several months before taking your baby on a plane. If your baby was premature or has a heart condition, check with your pediatrician before traveling. More on [flying with an infant](https://members.kaiserpermanente.org/kpweb/healthency.do?hwid=uf9033&rop=MRN). Is it okay to pierce my baby's ears? Ear piercing is an important part of many cultures and family traditions. However, it also has health risks. Any type of puncture wound can be a risk for tetanus (lockjaw), so make sure to keep the piercing clean and let your doctor know if the hole becomes red or swollen. If you do decide to have your baby's ears pierced, we recommend waiting until she is 6 months old and has had her third round of immunizations. Also, make sure to choose earrings the baby cannot pull out, as this can be a choking hazard. Your next appointment Your baby's next check-up with your pediatrician is at 2 months, and will receive immunizations at this visit. To prepare for this visit, take a few minutes to learn more about the recommended vaccines and why they are so important. Please review the following information and let your doctor know if you have any questions or concerns.
