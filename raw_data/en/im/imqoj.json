Together we are helping to keep our community safe and healthy... Under-reporting of COVID-19 cases jeopardizes the health and safety of our community Cabrillo College is required by the Division of Occupational Safety and Health of California to report all COVID-19 campus exposures to all potential close contacts. A close contact is anyone who shares the same air space for a cumulative time of 15 minutes or more, regardless of distance, with an infectious person who later tested positive for COVID-19. Anyone who tests positive would have been infectious during the 48 hours prior to the onset of symptoms or when the positive test was taken- whichever came first. Therefore, it is vital that all positive COVID-19 cases and campus exposures get reported to Krista Kaschalk, Manager, COVID-19 Response and Compliance at 831-234-5804 or email at [krkascha@cabrillo.edu](mailto:krkascha@cabrillo.edu)and/or Student Health Services at 831-479-6435 or email at [healthservices@cabrillo.edu](mailto:healthservices@cabrillo.edu)in a timely manner. To keep our campus safe, contact tracing must be conducted promptly and notifications must be sent as soon as possible. Timely campus exposure notifications also significantly help reduce the likelihood of an outbreak on campus. All aspects of case investigations and contact tracing are confidential. Students are encouraged to reference course syllabi and email professors to inform them that they will be unable to participate in in-person academic activities while isolating due to a recent positive COVID-19 test. Academic accommodations are made for students in these circumstances. Please report all COVID-19 cases to Krista Kaschalk, Manager, COVID-19 Response and Compliance at 831-234-5804 or email at [krkascha@cabrillo.edu](mailto:krkascha@cabrillo.edu) and/or [Student Health Services](https://www.cabrillo.edu/student-health-services/) at 831-479-6435 or email at [healthservices@cabrillo.edu](mailto:healthservices@cabrillo.edu) and follow Cabrillo's isolation guidance below: Everyone, regardless of vaccination status, previous infection, or lack of symptoms, who test positive for COVID-19 must: Stay home for at least 5 days after start of symptoms (Day 0) or after date of first positive test (Day 0) if no symptoms). Isolation can end after Day 5 if: Symptoms are not present, or are mild and improving; AND You are fever-free for 24 hours (without the use of fever-reducing medication). If fever is present, isolation should be continued until 24 hours after fever resolves. If symptoms, other than fever, are not improving, continue to isolate until symptoms are improving or until after Day 10. If the confirmed case has severe symptoms, or is at high risk of serious disease or has questions concerning care, they should contact their healthcare provider for available treatments. Infected persons should wear a well-fitting mask around others for a total of 10 days, especially in indoor settings. After you have ended isolation, if your symptoms recur or worsen, get tested again and if positive, restart isolation at Day 0. As of fall semester 2023, Cabrillo College is aligning isolation recommendations for those who test positive for COVID-19 based on the [California Department of Health COVID-19 isolation recommendations.](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Isolation-Quarantine-QA.aspx) Cabrillo College is a mask-friendly environment. However, wearing a high-quality mask along with immunization, self-testing, and physical distancing helps protect yourself and others by reducing the chance of spreading COVID-19. Please respect the choices of others.

Cabrillo College continues to strongly encourage immunization against COVID-19 for all students, faculty, and staff. However, the COVID-19 vaccine is no longer required. Information on current COVID-19 vaccine recommendations can be found at the [CDC's COVID-19 Vaccines page.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html) CDC's [COVID-19 Hospital Admission Levels by County](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/covid-by-county.html) On 8/9/23, the Santa Cruz County COVID-19 Hospital Admission Level is reported as Low Cabrillo removes vaccination requirement for students, faculty, and staff effective spring semester 2023 To align with [COVID-19 Guidance for Institutions of Higher Education](https://www.acha.org/documents/Resources/Guidelines/ACHA_COVID_Considerations_for_IHEs_Fall_2022.pdf), and because it presents an inequitable barrier to entry for students, Cabrillo College has removed the vaccination mandate for students, faculty, and staff (effective spring semester 2023). Cabrillo College continues to strongly encourage vaccination against COVID-19 for all students, faculty, and staff. Information on current vaccine recommendations can be found at the [CDC's COVID-19 Vaccines page](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html) Q: WHAT MUST I DO IF I HAVE TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVID-19? A positive test result requires self-isolation and immediately contacting Krista Kaschalk, Manager, COVID-19 Response & Compliance at [krkascha@cabrillo.edu](mailto:krkascha@cabrillo.edu) or by calling 831-477-3274 or 831-234-5804 OR contacting Student Health Services via Stay home for at least 5 days after start of symptoms (Day 0) or after date of first positive test (Day 0) if no symptoms).

[Learn more about Isolation and Precautions for People with COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html) Q: WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19? Fever, chills, headache, cough, muscle or body aches, fatigue, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, congestion or runny nose, sore throat. A symptom that seems to be unique to COVID-19 is loss of taste or smell [https://covid19.ca.gov/long-covid/](https://covid19.ca.gov/long-covid/)Long COVID It is required to stay home from work or school if you have experienced any of the above- described symptoms in the last 48 hours The best way to accurately determine whether you have COVID-19 is to get tested Wear a mask around others if you have respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, runny nose, and/or sore throat) Q: WHAT MUST I DO IF I HAVE SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19? Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms, regardless of vaccination status or previous infection, is required to : Stay home from campus and test as soon as possible to determine infection status. Knowing one is infected early during self-isolation enables (a) earlier access to treatment options, if indicated (especially for those who may be at risk for severe illness), and (b) notification of exposed persons (close contacts) who may also benefit by knowing if they are infected. Remain in isolation while waiting for testing results. If not tested, continue isolating for 5 days after the day of symptom onset (Day 0) and not return to campus until Day 6 and symptom-free or nearly symptom-free. Q: WHAT MUST I DO IF I HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO COVID-19? If you were exposed to COVID-19 in one of your classes, you'll get an email from the College with specific instructions about what to do depending on whether you were a close contact or indirect contact. If you have questions about receiving this notice, please contact Manager, COVID-19 Response & Compliance, Krista Kaschalk at [krkascha@cabrillo.edu](mailto:krkascha@cabrillo.edu) or 831-477-3274; 831-234-5804. First, determine if you are close contact or an indirect contact: Close Contact: If you shared the same indoor airspace with someone (e.g., home, clinic waiting room, airplane, etc.) for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period (for example, three individual 5-minute exposures for a total of 15 minutes) during an infected person's (laboratory-confirmed or a clinical diagnosis) infectious period- you are considered a Close-Contact. Indirect Contact: If you entered a space where a COVID-19 positive individual had been present in the past 24 hours, you may be considered an Indirect Contact. Infectious Period: \u00bb For COVID-19 cases with symptoms, from two days before the onset of symptoms until 10 days have passed (or five days if the employee tests negative on day five or later) and 24 hours have passed without a fever, without the use of fever-reducing medications, and symptoms have improved. It is required to wear a mask for a full 10 days even if testing negative on day 5. \u00bb For COVID-19 cases without symptoms, from two days before test specimen was collected through 10 days (or through day 5 if the employee tests negative on day five or later). If someone in your household has tested positive, there are specific recommendations for this situation. Please the FAQ what must I do if someone in my household has tested positive for COVID-19 below. Q: WHAT MUST I DO IF I AM CONSIDERED A CLOSE CONTACT TO COVID-19? Obtain testing within 3-5 days after your last exposure, with day zero being the most recent date of exposure If you have been infected with and recovered from COVID-19 within the prior 30 days, you do not need to be tested unless symptoms develop Cabrillo's COVID-19 policy requirement under this circumstance is to wear a mask around others for a total of 10 days after exposure; continue to mask well after the 10 days have passed. You may obtain a mask from instructors, managers, Student Health Services, or Manager, COVID-19 Response & Compliance. Monitor for COVID-19 symptoms twice daily for 14 days after exposure If you develop symptoms, you should seek testing ASAP and will be required to self-isolate Q: WHAT MUST I DO IF I AM CONSIDERED AN INDIRECT CONTACT TO COVID-19? Obtain testing on day 5 after exposure or later, with day zero being the exposure date It is highly recommended to wear a mask at all times while around others Monitor for COVID-19 symptoms twice daily for 14 days after exposure If you develop symptoms, you should seek testing ASAP and will be required to self-isolate Q: WHAT MUST I DO IF SOMEONE IN MY HOUSEHOLD HAS TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVID-19? Household exposures are considered a HIGH RISK EXPOSURE. If a household member has tested positive for COVID-19, it is highly recommended to stay home for a minimum of 5 days while avoiding further contact as much as is doable for your given situation. The first day of minimizing exposure is Day Zero. Get a PCR or Rapid test on Day 5 of minimizing exposure A negative test result on Day 5 allows for you to return back to campus on Day 6 as long as you are symptom-free, (but wearing a mask through Day 10 is highly recommended) and you should get tested weekly for a total of 14 days. Thank you Inspire Diagnostics!

Please conduct symptom-checks before coming to campus- stay home if sick: ~Before coming to campus, students, employees and invited guests should familiarize themselves with general safety guidelines that prevent the spread of COVID-19. This includes engaging in a regular health screening and assessment before coming to campus. If you're feeling sick and have any of the symptoms of COVID-19 (even if you think it's just allergies or a cold) it is required to stay home until you can get a negative COVID-19 test and/or symptoms have resolved. Upon returning from international travel, continue wearing a mask for 48 to 72 hours after your return as you monitor yourself for COVID-19 symptoms. Wear a mask around others if you have respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, runny nose, and/or sore throat) and get tested. Wear a mask if you have been recently exposed to someone with COVID-19- do this for 10 days. Wear a mask around others if you have recently tested positive for COVID-19; do this for at least 10 days. Get more information at California for All- your actions save lives: [https://covid19.ca.gov/](https://covid19.ca.gov/) What do you do to stay safe and protect others from COVID-19? Effective March 1, 2023: Cabrillo becomes a mask-friendly campus - This means that, although masks are no longer required on campus, (except for those who have been recently exposed or infected with COVID-19) individuals may still choose to wear a mask for any reason; that personal choice must be respected. Cabrillo encourages the use of masks to help protect ourselves and others from COVID-19. Masks are required to be worn indoors on campus for a total of 10 days after having a close contact exposure or after testing positive for COVID-19. Masks are available for students and employees through [Manager, COVID-19 Response & Compliance](https://www.cabrillo.edu/directory/krista-gray-2/)and [Student Health Services](https://www.cabrillo.edu/student-health-services/). Wear the most protective mask you can, that fits well, and that you will wear consistently. Masks are required to be worn indoors on campus for a total of 10 days after having a close contact exposure or after testing positive for COVID-19. Consider wearing a mask in indoor areas of public transportation (such as in airplanes, trains, buses, ferries) and transportation hubs (such as airports, stations, and seaports). This is increasingly important as the risk for transmission increases in the community. When choosing to wear a mask, ensure your mask provides the best [fit and filtration](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Get-the-Most-out-of-Masking.aspx)(respirators like N95, KN95 and KN94 are best). If you've had a significant exposure to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, wear a mask for 10 days even when not on campus. For Employees: N95 Respirator Training & Information The District will provide an N95 Respirator mask to any employee who requests to use N95s while at work or on District business. Prior to using the N95, the employee IS REQUIRED to watch the 6-minute training video through Keenan Safe Colleges -- see instructions linked below.

Recommendations have changed as experts continue to learn more about the coronavirus, how it spreads, and how it's evolving. The CDC has [easy-to-follow guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) for which vaccines and boosters are recommended for each age group, as well as for people who are [immunocompromised](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html) and an interactive tool to [determine if you're up to date on COVID vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html). If you received a booster dose after the date the bivalent booster was rolled out for your age group, you received the bivalent booster. Those dates were: September 2, 2022, for people 12 years and older. October 12, 2022, for people ages 5-11. December 9, 2022, for children 6 months-4 years who completed the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine primary series. COVID-19 vaccines help your body develop protection from the virus that causes COVID-19. Although vaccinated people sometimes get infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, [staying up to date](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html)on COVID-19 vaccines significantly lowers the risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19. It is recommended that everyone who is eligible get a booster and stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines. Quarantine means staying home. It is no longer required for most people who have been exposed, but test negative. But it may be recommended if you live or work in a high-risk setting. Isolation means staying home and away from others in your household. It is for people who are ill or test positive.
