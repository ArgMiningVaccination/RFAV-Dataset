Dr. Andrew Weil (1942-) is a promoter of complementary [alternative medicine](/wiki/Alternative_medicine) and other such [woo](/wiki/Woo), though he is also a certified medical doctor (and a [Brave Maverick Doctor](/wiki/Brave_Maverick_Doctor)) based in Tucson, [Arizona](/wiki/Arizona).

[[1]](#cite_note-1) His institute, and thus he himself, was at the forefront of making the New Age movement and alternative medicine popular in the latter part of the 20th century. [[2]](#cite_note-2) Dr. Weil also has written numerous books promoting, among other things, crank dietary beliefs and so-called self- [healing](/wiki/Healing), and has, recently, promoted changing the [scientific method](/wiki/Scientific_method) for alternative medicine, in favor of clinical observations](/wiki/Bullshit)\" over [double-blind](/wiki/Double-blind), [randomized trials](/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial). [[3]](#cite_note-3) He has been the foremost advocate for establishing an American Board of Integrative Medicine, which (as an alternative medicine counterpart to the American Medical Association) would serve as an official system of board certification for people pushing alternative medicine. [[4]](#cite_note-4) This is pointless because any medical provider practicing medicine proven to work is just called a doctor. Why create a board to certify people to practice things that work, and a separate board to \"certify\" people to practice things that don't work? What's the point in \"certifying\" the latter group?
