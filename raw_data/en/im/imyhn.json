WOOLF, MD, BLAINE E. BENSON, P HARMD Toxic Exposure Surveillance System (TESS) data are compiled by the American Association of Poison ControlCenters (AAPCC) in cooperation with the majority of USpoison centers. These data are used to identify hazardsearly, focus prevention education, guide clinical research,and direct training. TESS data have prompted product re-formulations, repackaging, recalls, and bans; are used tosupport regulatory actions; and form the basis of postmar-keting surveillance of newly released drugs and products.From its inception in 1983, TESS has grown dramati- cally, with increases in the number of participating poisoncenters, population served by those centers, and reportedhuman exposures (Table 1). 1-18 The cumulative AAPCC database now contains nearly 31.4 million human poison exposure cases. This reportincludes 2,267,979 human exposure cases reported by 64participating poison centers during 2001, an increase of4.6% compared with 2000 poisoning reports.

Fifty-two of the 64 participating centers werecertied as regional poison centers by the AAPCC at theend of 2001. Annual center call volumes (human exposurecases only) ranged from 10,551 to 91,657 (mean 37,274) forcenters participating for the entire year. Penetrance, calcu-lated only for states that were completely served by centersparticipating in TESS, ranged from 5.8 to 16.8 exposuresper 1,000 population with a mean of 8.1 reported exposuresper 1,000 population. Penetrance is dened as the number ofhuman poison exposure cases reported per 1,000 individualsin the population served. A total population of 281.3 million was served by the participating centers, including 48 entire states and theDistrict of Columbia (Figure 1). Noting the 284.8 million2001 United States population, the data presented representan estimated 98.8% of the human poison exposures thatprecipitated poison center contacts in the US during 2001.Extrapolations from the number of reported poisonings tothe number of actual poisonings occurring annually in theUS cannot be made from these data alone, as considerablevariations in poison center penetrance were noted. Indeed,assuming all centers reached the penetrance level of 16.8poisonings/1,000 population reported for one state, 4.7 mil- lion poisonings would have been reported to poison centersin 2001. Although this report focuses on the human exposure cases reported to TESS in 2001, the database also containsdata (not presented here) on animal poison exposures(113,165 cases, mostly pets), human conrmed nonexpo-sures (6,914), animal of 3,266,174 casesand inquiries reported to TESS in 2001 does not reflect thefull extent of poison center effort. Approximately 2.3 mil-lion follow-up calls were placed by poison centers during the year to provide further patient guidance, conrm com-pliance with recommendations, and gather nal outcomedata. Follow-ups were done in 45% of human exposurecases. One follow-up call was placed in 23% of cases; morethan one (and up to 77 calls) were placed in 22% of cases. The data do not directly identify a trend in the overall incidence of poisonings in the US because of changingcenter participation from year to year and changes in centeruse. An analysis of data from 55 centers that participated forthe entirety of both 2000 and 2001 shows an increase of 4%in the number of reported poison exposures from 2000 to2001 within the regions served by these 55 centers. REVIEW OF THE DATA A major revision of TESS data elds was implemented on January 1, 2000. In 2001, the generic categorization ofcalls was revised. Prior revisions occurred in 1984, 1985,and 1993. TESS can now capture an unlimited number ofsubstances for each case. As a result, the 2000 and 2001data include more substances implicated compared to prioryears, reflecting a change in data collection practice ratherthan in the nature of the poisonings which occurred. Of the 2,267,979 human exposures reported in 2001, 92.2% occurred at a residence (Table 2). Exposures oc-curred in the workplace in 2.4% of cases, in schools (1.6%),health care facilities (0.3%), and restaurants or food services(0.5%). Poison center peak call volumes were noted from 4to 10 PM, although call frequency remained consistentlyhigh between 8 AM and midnight, with 90% of calls loggedduring this 16-hour period. The average number of humanpoison exposure consultations handled per day by all par-ticipating U.S. poison centers was 6,214. Higher volumeswere observed in the warmer months, up to 6,616 per day inAugust compared to 5,596 consultations per day in January.On average, ignoring time of day and seasonal fluctuations,U.S. poison centers handled one poison exposure every 14seconds. The age and gender distribution of human poison expo- sure victims is outlined in Table 3. Children younger than 3years of age were involved in 39.0% of cases, and 51.6%occurred in children younger than 6 years. A male predom-inance is found among poison exposure victims younger 392 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE IVolume 20, Number 5 ISeptember 2002FIGURE 1. Sixty-four poison centers participated in the Toxic Exposure Surveillance System in 2001. The shaded areas denote regions served by reporting centers.393 LITOVITZ ET AL I2001 AAPCC ANNUAL REPORTthan 13 years of age, but the gender distribution is reversed in teenagers and adults. Of all poison exposures captured,7,588 occurred in pregnant women. Of those with knownpregnancy duration, 32% occurred in the rst trimester, 38% in the second trimester, and 30% in the third trimester.In 4.8% of cases (109,781 cases) multiple patients wereimplicated in the poison exposure episode (eg, siblings\"shared \"a household product, multiple patients inhaled vapors at a hazardous materials spill). Fatalities differed from the total exposure data set in several ways. Table 4 presents the age and gender distribu-tion for the 1,074 reported fatalities. Although responsiblefor the majority of poisoning reports, children younger than6 years of age comprised just 2.4% (26) of the fatalities.Fifty-nine percent of poisoning fatalities occurred in 20- to49-year-old individuals.A single substance was implicated in 92.0% of reports, and 2.6% of patients were exposed to more than two pos-sibly poisonous drugs or products (Table 5). In contrast,48% of fatal cases involved two or more drugs or products.The overwhelming majority of human exposures were acute(92.4%) compared to only 55.5% of poison-related fatalexposures. Chronic exposures comprised 1.8% of all poisonexposure reports, and acute-on-chronic exposures com-prised 5.0%. (Chronic exposures were de ned as continuous or repeated exposures occurring in a period exceeding 8hours.) Reason for exposure was coded according to the follow- ing de nitions: Unintentional general: All unintentional cally de ned below. Most uninten- tional exposures in children are captured here. Environmen- tal: Any passive, nonoccupational exposure that results 394 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE IVolume 20, Number 5 ISeptember 2002from contamination of air, water, or soil. Environmental exposures are usually caused by man-made contaminants.Occupational: An exposure that occurs as a direct result of the person being on the job or in the workplace. Therapeutic error: An unintentional deviation from a proper therapeutic regimen that results in the wrong dose, incorrect route ofadministration, administration to the wrong person, or ad-ministration of the wrong substance. Only exposures tomedications or products substituted for medications areincluded. Drug interactions resulting from unintentional ad-ministration of drugs or foods which are known to interactare also included. Unintentional misuse: Unintentional im- proper or incorrect use of a nonpharmaceutical substance.Unintentional misuse differs from intentional misuse in thatthe exposure was unplanned or not foreseen by the patient.Bite/sting: All animal bites and stings, with or without envenomation, are included. Food poisoning: Suspected or conrmed food poisoning; ingestion of food contaminated with microorganisms is included. Unintentional unknown: An exposure determined to be unintentional but the exactreason is unknown. Suspected suicidal: An exposure result- ing from the inappropriate use of a substance for reasonsthat are suspected to be self destructive or manipulative.Intentional misuse: An exposure resulting from the inten- tional improper or incorrect use of a substance for reasonsother than the pursuit of a psychotropic effect. Intentional abuse: An exposure resulting from the intentional improper or incorrect use of a substance where the victim was likelyattempting to achieve a euphoric or psychotropic effect. Allrecreational use of substances for any effect is included.Intentional unknown: An exposure that is determined to be intentional but the speci c motive is unknown. Contami- nant/tampering: The patient is an unintentional victim of a substance that has been adulterated (either maliciously orunintentionally) by the introduction of an undesirable sub-stance. Malicious: This category is used to capture patients who are victims of another person 's intent to harm them. Adverse reaction: An adverse event occurring with normal, prescribed, labeled or recommended use of the product, asopposed to overdose, misuse or abuse. Included are caseswith an unwanted effect due to an allergic, hypersensitive,or idiosyncratic response to the active ingredients, inactiveingredients, or excipients. Concomitant use of a contraindi- cated medication or food is excluded, and coded instead asa therapeutic error. The vast majority (85.2%) of poison exposures were unintentional; suicidal intent was present in 7.8% of cases(Table 6A). Therapeutic errors comprised 7.4% of expo-sures (167,014 cases), with unintentional nonpharmaceuti- cal product misuse comprising another 3.7% of exposures.The types of therapeutic errors observed in each age groupare delineated in Table 6B. Approximately 36% of thera-peutic errors involved double-dosing. Dispensing cup errorswere seen in 4,825 cases, 10-fold dosing errors in 1,330cases, and dispensing errors in 3,605 cases. Unintentional poisonings outnumbered intentional poi- sonings in all age groups (Table 7). In contrast, of the 1,074human poisoning fatalities reported, 74% of adolescentdeaths and 79% of adult deaths (older than 19 years of age)were intentional (Table 8). Ingestions accounted for 75.8% of exposure routes (Table 9), followed in frequency by dermal, inhalation, and ocularexposures. For the 1,074 fatalities, ingestion, inhalation, andparenteral were the predominant exposure routes. Clinical effects (signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnor- malities) were coded in 30.4% of cases (17.0% had oneeffect, 7.9% had two effects, 3.7% had three effects, 1.2%had four effects, 0.4% had ve effects, and 0.1% had more than ve effects). Of 1,481,372 clinical effects coded, 81.1% were deemed related, 9.2% were considered notrelated, and 9.8% were coded as \"unknown if related. \" The majority of cases reported to poison centers were managed in a non-health care facility (78%), usually at thesite of exposure, the patient 's own home (Table 10). 12 Treatment in a health care facility was rendered in 22.0% of cases and recommended in another 2.0% of patients whorefused the referral. The percentage of patients treated in a 395 LITOVITZ ET AL I2001 AAPCC ANNUAL REPORThealth care facility varied considerably with age. Only 10.3% of children under 6 years and only 13.1% of childrenbetween 6 and 12 years were managed in a health carefacility compared to 48.1% of teenagers (13 to 19 years ofage) and 35.8% of adults (over 19 years of age). Of casesmanaged in a health care facility, 54.6% were treated andreleased without admission, 13.9% were admitted for criti- cal care, and 7.4% were admitted for noncritical care.Where treatment was provided in a health care facility,33.5% of the patients were referred in by the poison centerand 66.5% were already in or en route to the health carefacility when the poison center was contacted. Health care facilities included acute care hospitals (86.6%), physicianofces or clinics (10.2%), and freestanding emergency cen- ters (3.2%). Table 11 displays the medical outcome of the human poison exposure cases distributed by age, showing moresevere outcomes in the older age groups. Table 12 compares medical outcome and reason for exposure, and shows agreater frequency of serious outcomes in intentional expo-sures. Table 13 demonstrates an increasing duration of theclinical effects observed with more severe outcomes. Med- 396 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE IVolume 20, Number 5 ISeptember 2002ical outcome categories were as follows: No effect: The patient developed no signs or symptoms as a result of theexposure. Minor effect: The patient developed some signs or symptoms as a result of the exposure, but they were mini-mally bothersome and generally resolved rapidly with noresidual disability or dis gurement. A minor effect is often limited to the skin or mucous membranes (eg, self-limitedgastrointestinal symptoms, drowsiness, skin irritation, rst degree dermal burn, sinus tachycardia without hypotension,and transient cough). Moderate effect: The patient exhibited signs or symptoms as a result of the exposure that were more pronounced, more prolonged, or more systemic innature than minor symptoms. Usually some form of treat-ment is indicated. Symptoms were not life-threatening andthe patient had no residual disability or dis gurement (eg, corneal abrasion, acid-base disturbance, high fever,disorientation, hypotension that is rapidly responsive totreatment, and isolated brief seizures that respond readily totreatment). Major effect: The patient exhibited signs or symptoms as a result of the exposure that were life-threat-ening or resulted in signi cant residual disability or dis g- urement (eg, repeated seizures or status epilepticus, respi-ratory compromise ventriculartachycardia with stricture, and disseminated intravascular coagu-lation). Death: The patient died as a result of the exposure or as a direct complication of the exposure. Only thosedeaths that were probably or undoubtedly related to theexposure are coded here. Not followed, judged as nontoxic exposure: No follow-up calls were made to determine the outcome of the exposure because the substance implicatedwas nontoxic, the amount implicated was insigni cant, or the route of exposure was unlikely to result in a clinicaleffect. Not followed, minimal clinical effects possible: No follow-up calls were made to determine the patient 's out- come because the exposure was likely to result in onlyminimal toxicity of a trivial nature. (The patient was ex-pected to experience no more than a minor effect.) Unable to follow, judged as a potentially toxic exposure: The pa- tient was lost to follow-up, refused follow-up, or was notfollowed but the exposure was signi cant and may have resulted in a moderate, major, or fatal outcome. Unrelated effect: The exposure was probably not responsible for the effect. Conrmed nonexposure: This outcome option was coded to designate cases where there was reliable andobjective evidence that an exposure initially believed tohave occurred actually never occurred (eg, all missing pillsare later located). All cases coded as con rmed non-expo- sure are excluded from this report. In 2001 there were 6,914such human cases reported nationally. An additional 3,718duplicate reports were excluded (reported to more than oneparticipating poison center). Tables 14 and 15 outline the use of decontamination procedures, speci c antidotes, and measures to enhance elimination in the treatment of patients reported in thisdatabase. These must be interpreted as minimum frequen-cies because of the limitations of telephone data gathering.Table 16 demonstrates a continuing decline in the use ofipecac-induced emesis in the treatment of poisoning. Table 17A presents the most common substance catego- ries listed by frequency of exposure. Tables 17B and 17Cpresent similar data for children and adults, respectively, 397 LITOVITZ ET AL I2001 AAPCC ANNUAL REPORTand show the considerable differences between pediatric and adult poison exposures. Table 18 lists the substancecategories with the largest number of reported deaths; an-algesics and antidepressants lead this list. Table 19 showslittle variation over the past 18 years in the percentage ofcases reported to TESS that are fatal poisonings and in thepercentage of reported fatalities due to suicide. In contrast,the percentage of reported fatalities involving children un-der 6 years has declined. A breakdown of plant exposures isprovided for those most commonly implicated (Table 20). A summary of the 1,074 fatal exposures is presented in Table 21. Each of these cases was veri ed and abstracted by the reporting poison center. After extensive review onlythose exposures deemed \"probably \"or\"undoubtedly \"re- sponsible for the fatality were included in Table 21. Ab-stracts of selected interesting or unusual cases are presentedin the Appendix. Table 21 also reports the highest bloodconcentration for the responsible agents where that infor-mation is known. In addition Table 21 identi es those cases reported indirectly to the poison center (6% of cases) andthose cases in which a pre-hospital cardiac and/or respira-tory arrest occurred (36% of cases). Deaths are listed inTable 21 according to the agent deemed most responsiblefor the death by both the reporting center and the reviewers.Additional agents implicated are listed below the primaryagent. The number of fatalities reported in 2001 represents a 17% increase over the number reported in 2000. The rea-sons for this increase are not known. The number of re-ported fatalities has been steadily increasing each year,although it has not changed signi cantly as a percentage of total reported cases (see Table 19). For 2001, 48% ofreported deaths involved more than one agent.There were 26 fatalities reported in children less than 6 years of age. Although this represents a small increase overthe 20 deaths reported in 2000, the number is similar to the24 deaths reported in 1999. As a percentage of the totalfatalities, deaths in children have remained essentially un-changed for the last four years, varying from 2.2 to 2.7% oftotal reported deaths. The most common reason for thesepediatric fatalities was \"unintentional general. \"Remark- ably, eight of these deaths were due to therapeutic errors. Ofthe deaths in this age group, nine involved single agentanalgesics (two acetaminophen, three aspirin, one metha-done, one morphine, and two oxycodone) and only fourwere due to non-pharmaceutical household products (airfreshener, lamp oil, methanol and a battery). There werealso two heroin-related deaths. Two deaths resulting from in utero exposure, one with acetaminophen and one with methanol, were reported. In the 6 to 12 year age range there were only twelve deaths reported, similar to recent years. Of this number, fourwere due to carbon monoxide, with or without smoke. Nonewere reported as suicides, although one was thought sec-ondary to intentional abuse and one was listed as \"inten- tional, unknown. \" In the 13 to 19 year age range there were 77 reported fatalities. This number has increased steadily over the lastfour years. As in previous years the most common reasonwas suicide (45%) followed by abuse (25%). Somewhatsurprisingly, only 21% of the fatalities in this age rangeinvolved street drugs. For all age ranges, the most common class of substances implicated in the fatalities was analgesics, followed byantidepressants, sedatives and hypnotics, street drugs/stim-ulants, and cardiovascular agents. Analgesics, as the pri-mary substance implicated, account for 32% of fatalities(341 deaths). Of that number, 82 (24%) were caused by 398 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE IVolume 20, Number 5 ISeptember 2002either acetaminophen or aspirin as single agents. Also of note is the dramatic increase in the number of deaths wherelong-acting oxycodone was implicated as the rst sub- stance: in 2000 there were eight such fatalities while therewere 21 in 2001. In all, 49 deaths were reported where along-acting opioid analgesic product was thought to be therst substance. It is also apparent from review of the aspirin- related deaths that many were the result of a delay in theinstitution of dialysis. A careful review of the criteria fordialysis, particularly reliance on salicylate blood levels, may be in order. The second most common class of drugs deemed pri- marily responsible for death is street drugs. Stimulantsand street drugs, as the rst substance, accounted for 11% of deaths (119 deaths). An additional 8% of deaths in-volved street drugs in association with another primarysubstance. The last two years have seen a major increasein the number of deaths attributed primarily to amphet- amine or its derivatives, particularly methyl-enedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) with 18 deaths in2000 and 14 in 2001. There has also been a steadyincrease in the number of fatalities attributed to metham-phetamine over the last three years. For other abusedrugs, particularly cocaine and heroin, there has beenlittle change during the same time period. The third most common class of drugs associated with death was antidepressants, accounting for 11% of deaths asthe primary agent (114 deaths). An additional 9.5% ofdeaths involved an antidepressant as a secondary agent. Amajor shift has occurred in the particular drugs involved,with a decline in the numbers of deaths associated with 399 LITOVITZ ET AL I2001 AAPCC ANNUAL REPORTtricyclic agents, such as amitriptyline and doxepin, and an increase in the number of deaths associated with selectiveserotonin reuptake inhibitors. Cardiovascular drugs comprised the fth most common class of drugs responsible for reported deaths, accountingfor 9.1% of the fatalities (98 deaths where cardiovasculardrugs were the primary agent). Unfortunately, the signi - cant decrease in deaths due to cardiovascular agents ob-served in 2000 was not apparent in 2001. The numbers ofdeaths from these agents in 2001 was similar to that seen in1998 and 1999. Of the reported deaths involving cardiovas-cular substances, 51% were due to calcium channel block- ers. An additional 21% were due to beta-blockers, a signif-icant increase from previous years. The number of deathsattributed to digoxin remained similar to that seen in pre-vious years. As observed in previous years, the majority of the digoxin-related fatalities were due to therapeutic errors. The vast majority (76%) of reported fatalities were inten- tional. The percentage of fatalities attributed to other rea-sons has remained fairly constant over the last ve years (Table 8). As in previous years, a signi cant percentage (7.8%) of reported fatalities were the result of either anadverse reaction to a medication or to a therapeutic error. Ofsome interest, there have been no fatalities reported to thisdatabase due to food poisoning since 1997. Tables 22A and 22B provide comprehensive demo- graphic data on patient age, reason for exposure, medicaloutcome, and use of a health care facility for all 2,267,979exposures, presented by substance categories. Table 22Afocuses on nonpharmaceuticals; Table 22B presents drugs. 400 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE IVolume 20, Number 5 ISeptember 2002Of the 2,555,487 53.4% were nonpharmaceuticals and 46.6% were pharma-ceuticals. The reason for the exposure was intentional for29.8% of pharmaceutical substances implicated comparedwith only 4.8% of nonpharmaceutical substances. Corre-spondingly, treatment in a health care facility was providedin a higher percentage of exposures to pharmaceutical sub-stances (39.0%) compared with nonpharmaceutical sub-stances (16.4%). Pharmaceutical exposures also had moresevere outcomes. Of substances implicated in fatal cases,84.6% were pharmaceuticals, compared with only 46.6% innonfatal cases. Similarly, 83.5% of substances implicated inmajor outcomes were pharmaceuticals. In closing, we gratefully acknowledge the extensive con- tributions of each participating poison center and the assis-tance of the many health care providers who providedcomprehensive data to the poison centers for inclusion inthis database. 401 LITOVITZ ET AL I2001 AAPCC ANNUAL REPORT402 AMERICAN JOURNAL MEDICINE 2002403 LITOVITZ ET AL MEDICINE 2002405 LITOVITZ ET AL MEDICINE 2002407 LITOVITZ ET AL MEDICINE 2002409 LITOVITZ ET AL MEDICINE 2002411 LITOVITZ ET AL MEDICINE 2002413 LITOVITZ ET AL MEDICINE 2002415 LITOVITZ ET AL MEDICINE 2002417 LITOVITZ ET AL MEDICINE 2002419 LITOVITZ ET AL MEDICINE 2002421 LITOVITZ ET AL MEDICINE 2002423 LITOVITZ ET AL MEDICINE 2002425 LITOVITZ ET AL MEDICINE 2002427 LITOVITZ ET AL MEDICINE 2002429 LITOVITZ ET AL MEDICINE 2002431 LITOVITZ ET AL MEDICINE 2002433 LITOVITZ ET AL MEDICINE 2002435 LITOVITZ ET AL MEDICINE 2002437 LITOVITZ ET AL MEDICINE 2002439 LITOVITZ ET AL MEDICINE 2002441 LITOVITZ ET AL MEDICINE 5 ISeptember 2002REFERENCES 1.

A 28-year-old woman, 28 weeks preg- nant, HIV positive and a cocaine abuser, presented to theED with a refractory metabolic acidosis (pH 7.0) and Kuss-maul respirations. Further history revealed a similar unex-plained episode 6 weeks earlier, which resolved with treat-ment of the acidosis. On evaluation, the fetus was noted tobe in severe distress and was delivered by emergent caesar-ian section. The infant was born with metabolic acidosis(pH 7.26) and severe bilateral intracranial hemorrhages, andremained ventilator dependent. Toxic alcohol poisoningwas suspected, and an ethanol infusion was initiated in themother. The mother 's serum methanol concentration, mea- sured several hours after admission, was 54 mg/dL, andhemodialysis was initiated. After hemodialysis, ethanol wasdiscontinued and fomepizole was started. Despite theseinterventions, her condition deteriorated further and me-chanical ventilation was initiated; hemodialysis continuedperiodically for severe renal failure. Sepsis developed, re-fractory hypotension ensued, and the patient expired. Theinfant 's methanol concentration was 61 mg/dL, and he expired on the third day of life. Case 22. A 47-year-old woman ingested an unknown quantity of a blue liquid in an apparent suicide attempt. Shepresented to the ED despondent but rapidly became agitated 443 LITOVITZ ET AL I2001 AAPCC ANNUAL REPORTand then obtunded. She was intubated and found to be profoundly acidotic. The diagnosis of toxic alcohol inges-tion was entertained and fomepizole was administered. Amethanol concentration of 300 mg/dL was con rmed and the patient was dialyzed approximately ve hours after presentation. Despite aggressive care the patient remainedcomatose after six days and supportive care was withdrawn. Case 27. A 17-year-old boy ingested approximately 200 to 300 mL of antifreeze containing ethylene glycol about 12 to 16 hours prior to presentation to the hospital. He wastransported by EMS, obtunded and with Kussmaul respira-tions. He reportedly had been nauseated and had vomitedapproximately 9 hours prior to admission. He had a bloodpressure of 153/92 mm Hg and a heart rate of 100 beats/min.Urine fluorescence was noted in the ED. A loading dose of fomepizole was administered. An initial arterial blood gasshowed: pH, 6.93; 2,1 and lactate, 8.1 mmol/L. Sodium bicarbonate was given. A renal consultation was obtained and the patient was admitted tothe ICU. Other laboratory values were: BUN, 15 mg/dL;creatinine, 2.3 mg/dL; sodium, 150 mEq/L; potassium, 8.4mEq/L; bicarbonate, less than 5 mEq/L. The patient washemodialyzed approximately 5 hours after admission. Intra-venous thiamine and pyridoxine were also administered.Laboratory values obtained after 3 hours of dialysis were:pH, 7.14; pCO 2, 28 mm Hg; pO2, 114 mm Hg, and bicar - bonate, 14 mEq/L. His ethylene glycol concentration fromadmission was 62 mg/dL and, when repeated 3 hours intodialysis, it was 26 mg/dL. Dialysis was terminated after 4hours. An ethylene glycol concentration at that time was 17mg/dL. The patient developed premature ventricular con-tractions in the ICU at approximately 14 hours after hospitaladmission. This progressed to ventricular tachycardia. Hewas treated with amiodarone and an epinephrine infusion. Ahead CT was obtained which showed massive cerebraledema and possible herniation. Brain death was con rmed and life support was withdrawn approximately 48 hoursafter admission. Case 50. A 30-year-old alcoholic man with a several-day history of inhaling carburetor cleaner had seizure activity prior to arrival in the ED. Pre-intubation he had an arterialpH of 6.3 with a bicarbonate of 4 mEq/L. Profound aci-demia persisted despite vigorous resuscitative care. He wastransferred to a tertiary care facility and treated with fo-mepizole after a methanol concentration returned at 132 mg/dL. He expired before hemodialysis could be initiated. Case 53. A 2-month-old boy was home alone with his 5-year-old and 8-year-old siblings. When the mother re-turned, she found the baby blue and drove him to the ED.When intubation was attempted, the baby \"vomited \"an intact AA alkaline battery and went into cardiac arrest. The child was resuscitated but died approximately 18 hours laterof the hypoxic injury. Case 55. A 17-year-old girl was brought to the ED by EMS after being bitten on the hand by a snake . She ran to a nearby re-rescue building, where they felt she was ex- periencing an allergic reaction. She was treated with epi-nephrine and diphenhydramine and transported to the near-est ED. During transport she may have had a seizure andmay have been hypotensive. In the ED her oxygen satura-tion was in the 70 's while on 2 L/min of oxygen. The oxygen saturation increased to 94% when she was placed on100% oxygen by non-rebreather mask. On auscultation she had bilateral rales, which the physician suspected might besecondary to aspiration. Her blood pressure was 77/45 mmHg. The physician noted two puncture marks on her righthand without any local swelling or ecchymosis. Crotalidantivenin Fab therapy was begun. She was intubated due torespiratory distress and pulmonary edema. Dopamine wasstarted for hemodynamic support. Approximately 6 hourslater, there was still no swelling or discoloration at the bitesite. Despite the administration of antivenin, her clinicalcondition gradually deteriorated and she expired on the fth hospital day. She never developed laboratory evidence ofcoagulopathy and the affected limb never demonstrated anydiscoloration or swelling. Case 56. A 30-year-old man was comatose following a bite from his pet rattlesnake . In the ED the patient was found to have a coagulopathy and a subarachnoid hemor-rhage. Laboratory values on admission were: INR, 5.5;platelet count, 7,000/ /H9262L. The patient received 10 to 20 vials of crotalid antivenin and was admitted to the ICU. Hiscondition continued to worsen and support was withdrawnon the day after admission. Case 60. An 84-year-old man with prostate cancer was admitted to the hospital for hematuria. Treatment includedbladder irrigation with 1% ammonium alum . The patient 's bladder ruptured, requiring surgical repair. On day 3 thepatient became increasingly confused and lethargic. At thattime a serum calcium concentration was 6.4 mg/dL andcreatinine 2.5 mg/dL. Deferoxamine chelation was begun inassociation with dialysis. An aluminum concentrationdrawn prior to dialysis was reported to be 615 ng/mL.Hemodialysis alone was continued despite mental statuschanges and renal failure. The patient died after 13 days ofhospitalization. An aluminum concentration drawn post-dialysis on day 12 was reported after death as 645 ng/mL. Case 61. A 48-year-old man presented to the ED about 2 hours after an ingestion of battery acid (sulfuric acid) .O n admission, the patient was awake and alert with a bloodpressure, 150/87 mm Hg; heart rate, 103 beats/min; respi-ratory rate, in the 20 's; and oxygen saturation, 97%. His chief complaints were nausea, vomiting and abdominalpain. Subsequently, he developed tachypnea and dyspnearequiring intubation. One vocal cord was edematous were: mEq/L; 2.7 mEq/L. His chest and abdominal X-rayswere unremarkable with no signs of perforation. A diagnos-tic peritoneal lavage was performed which showed 50 whiteblood cells/ /H9262L and 4000 red blood cells/ /H9262L. The patient was then taken to the OR for an exploratory laparotomy.Portions of his stomach and intestines were necrotic andresected. Only the esophagus, proximal stomach, distaltransverse and descending colon were not removed. Hisliver was hyperemic but not necrotic, and the rest of hisabdominal organs were not necrotic at the time of surgery.The patient survived for one more day before going intocardiac arrest and expiring. On post-mortem, necrosis in-volved the rest of his gastrointestinal tract and abdominalorgans, including the esophagus, the rest of the colon, the444 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE IVolume 20, Number 5 ISeptember 2002medial aspect of the right liver lobe, the tail of the pancreas, the left diaphragm, and the overlying serosa and abdominalmusculature. His trachea and bronchi were noted to beerythematous. Case 65. A 49-year-old man was presumably celebrating with his two children. He had brought home pizza andpoured some soda from an already open bottle. His daughterdrank some but his son did not. The father drank some sodafrom his daughter 's glass, then poured the remainder from the bottle down the sink and went into the basement. Hecame back upstairs and fell to the ground. EMS was calledand the patient was transported to the emergency depart-ment. Upon presentation to the ED, the patient had oralburns and was in cardiac arrest. EMS indicated that theroom smelled like ammonia. The thiosulfate portion of thecyanide antidote kit was administered, but the patient didnot respond and was declared dead. The daughter respondedto therapy. The father was known to work in a jewelry shop.Health Department laboratory results showed that the sodah a dap Ho f7a n da cyanide concentration of 100 mg/L. Case 75. A previously healthy 70-year-old retired chem- ist unintentionally ingested a swallow of a sample of so- dium cyanide/copper cyanide etching solution he had stored in a soda bottle. He noted immediate burning in thethroat and soon experienced nausea, vomiting, and dif culty breathing. EMS was summoned. Over the next 25 minutes,the patient 's breathing worsened and his mental status de- clined. He developed apnea and was intubated by paramed-ics. Upon arrival in the ED, the patient had bradycardia(heart rate, 40-50 beats/min), hypotension (blood pressure,80/60 severe metabolic acidosis (pH, 6.94;P CO2, 48 mm Hg). Gastric aspiration was performed. The patient received 300 mg of sodium nitrite and 12.5 g sodium thiosulfate. Five minutes later, metabolic acidosis was min-imally improved (pH, 6.99; pCO 2, 55 mm Hg). Additional doses of sodium nitrite (total of all doses: 600 mg) and sodium thiosulfate (total of all doses: 50 g) were adminis-tered. The patient also received a total of 200 mEq ofsodium bicarbonate. He woke up and became \"alert and appropriate \", and his heart rate and blood pressure im- proved. Blood gas analysis showed: pH, 7.38; pCO m Hg; patient was extubated the following day. Twenty-four hours post ingestion, his con-dition had improved ALT, 2,183 IU/L. An acetaminophenconcentration determined on the initial blood sample wasnegative. Liver and renal function continued to deteriorateand pancreatic injury became evident. BAL administrationwas considered for possible copper toxicity, but was notadministered. The patient received hemodialysis treatmentsand intensive supportive care for liver failure, but eventuallydied 11 days post ingestion. Autopsy revealed extensivehepatic necrosis with a markedly elevated liver copper level(50.1 mg/g tissue). Case 96. A 7-year-old girl was playing in her back yard when she inadvertently stepped into a 5-gallon bucket con-taining about a gallon of hydrofluoric acid, 70%. The family rinsed the chemical off the child 's legs and then drove her to the hospital. The child had hydro fluoric acid burns to the backs of the legs bilaterally up to the buttocks,covering an estimated 10% of her total body surface area. She was further decontaminated in the ED, calcium gel wasplaced on her burns, and an intravenous calcium infusionwas begun. She suffered a cardiorespiratory arrest and wasresuscitated. She was then transferred to the regional burncenter. On arrival there she experienced a second cardiacarrest. A serum calcium concentration measured at that timewas 5.5 mg/dL. Despite aggressive therapy she died sixhours after the exposure. Post-mortem examination con-rmed that the death was due to the effects of hydro fluoric acid exposure. Cases 97, 98 & 99. Three chemical plant employees, ages 41, 47 and 56 years, were involved in an explosion and re involving a rail car lled with methylmercaptan . There was a prolonged extrication time from the hot zone. Twomen were transported to the ED and neither could be resus-citated; the third man was pronounced dead at the scene.The strong sulfur odor on the two transported bodies neces-sitated the closure and decontamination of the ED. Sulfhe-moglobin concentrations were 15%, 9%, and 6%, respec-tively. Case 106. An 84-year-old man developed distress after inhaling fumes from a bowl of 100% sulfur that was on re. He was using the product to exterminate rodents when itignited. He apparently immediately walked outdoors wherehe collapsed. He was intubated by paramedics, but shortlyafter arrival in the ED he went into cardiac arrest andexpired. Case 108. A 45-year-old man presented to the ED within 30 minutes of ingesting 3 to 4 ounces of concentratedsulfuric acid in a suicide attempt. On presentation it was noted that the patient had perioral burns, was not able tospeak, and was experiencing respiratory distress. His vitalsigns on presentation were: blood pressure, 207/100 mmHg; heart rate, 63 beats/min; and respiratory rate, 20breaths/min. The patient quickly developed a rigid abdo-men. He was intubated in the ED and underwent esophago-gastroscopy. Third degree burns were noted from the oro-pharynx to the stomach. The patient underwent resection ofthe esophagus, stomach, and part of the bowel. He wasadmitted to a burn unit where he survived for almost twoweeks before expiring from complications, including sepsis. Case 110. A 26-year-old man collapsed at his workplace while pressure-cleaning the inside of a tank containingtitanium dioxide . Resuscitation efforts were instituted by paramedics on arrival at the scene, but were unsuccessful.When paramedics attempted to intubate the patient, theynoted that the oropharynx and lungs were full of what wasdescribed as white paste. Death was felt to be due toinhalation of this particulate chemical. Case 113. A 14-year-old girl unintentionally drank from a glass in which a drain opener (sodium hydroxide, 50 to 60%) had been dissolved in water. She was seen in the ED10 minutes after the ingestion, already vomiting bright redblood. The patient was transferred to a tertiary care facility.On arrival she was in considerable pain and was medicatedwith morphine. Endoscopy revealed extensive burns fromthe oral pharynx to the duodenum, with full thickness cir-cumferential burns. The pediatric surgeons elected to treather symptomatically. Nine days into the hospitalizationrepeat endoscopy showed brin formation in the esophagus, granulation tissue the AL I2001 AAPCC ANNUAL REPORTbrinous exudates. Thirty days after the ingestion she was taken to the OR for esophagogastrectomy with colonicinterposition and an attempt at creating a pouch for a stom-ach out of her jejunum. She never regained consciousnessafter surgery. She developed sepsis and ARDS and eventu-ally expired on the 89 thday of hospitalization. Case 121. A 16-year-old boy, under house arrest for drug abuse, stumbled out of his bedroom and passed out. EMSwas called, but resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful. Ared and yellow can of oven cleaner containing sodium hydroxide was found in his room. He did not have a history of inhalation abuse. Mass spectral analysis of his bloodfound only the propellants isobutane andpropane . Case 131. A 58-year-old man presented to the ED with acute burning chest pain. ECG changes were suggestive ofmyocardial ischemia, and the patient underwent cardiaccatheterization, which was normal. In route to the catheter-ization laboratory he stated that he had ingested two bottlesoftoilet bowl cleaner (sodium hypochlorite/sodium hy- droxide ) in a suicide attempt that morning, prior to present- ing to the ED. He denied any other ingestion. He was takenfor a CT scan, which showed evidence of gastric perfora-tion. Exploratory laparotomy showed gastric perforation with extensive intra-abdominal caustic necrosis. Subsequentmanagement was supportive, and he expired within 24hours of the ingestion. Case 138. A 5-year-old girl, with a history of Angelman syndrome and a seizure disorder, ingested an unknownamount of an air freshener containing propylene glycol (6%) andethoxylate (13%) approximately 8.5 hours prior to arrival to the ED. She had vomited chunks of the airfreshener in the morning while under the care of her father.She was found unarousable and in respiratory distress byher mother returning from work that evening. In the ED, shewas unresponsive, hyperpneic and required tional history revealed that seizure control with valproicacid had been discontinued several months prior and thepatient was being controlled with a ketogenic diet. She wasoccasionally given hydroxyzine at bedtime for allergies.The family presented a bag of emesis, which had the sameconsistency and fragrance as a purchased sample of the airfreshener. Post-dialysis laboratory values were: propyleneglycol, 24.3 and lactate, 8.5 mmol/L. Ammonia and lactateconcentrations began to rise and further hemodialysis wasattempted, but the patient experienced bradycardia and hy-potension. Following stabilization with vasopressors andinotropes, additional hemodialysis was performed, but thepatient expired within 36 hours of presentation despitesubsequent propylene glycol concentrations of /H1102110 mg/dL. The autopsy, including histology of the liver, was negative.Case 141. A 38-year-old woman, with a history of de- pression, was being treated with carbon dioxide therapy byan alternative medicine physician. She had 12 uneventfulprior sessions. Therapy typically began with pre-treatmentwith atenolol (100 mg) and acetaminophen/butalbital/caf-feine (2 tablets). Approximately two hours later, she re-ceived, via face mask, varying mixtures of nitrous oxide , carbon dioxide and oxygen. During the therapy, the phy- sician adjusted the concentration of the gases initially toattain a 1:1 ratio of carbon dioxide and oxygen and ulti-mately a 3:2 ratio of carbon dioxide and oxygen. The carbondioxide was then discontinued and the patient was given100% oxygen. Shortly thereafter, the patient was noted to bein respiratory and, subsequently, cardiac arrest. Whileawaiting the arrival of EMS, the physician performed CPRfor approximately 15 to 20 minutes. Once EMS arrived, shewas intubated and ACLS was performed for another 15 to20 minutes, leading to resuscitation. In the ED, the patientreceived midazolam and an amiodarone infusion. She had anormal head CT and her toxicology screen was positive forbenzodiazepines and barbiturates. Her only neurologicfunction was spontaneous respiration. She was admitted tothe MICU with severe anoxic injury. A repeat head CT showed a loss of gray-white matter differentiation. Elevendays post exposure she was extubated and transferred to themedical floor; she expired 2 weeks later. Cases 143 and 147. A 6-year-old boy was found unre- sponsive in the family 's camper on the back of a pickup truck. The truck had been idling in traf c for a long period. The child was taken to the ED where he was pronounceddead from carbon monoxide poisoning. Police investiga- tion showed a leak in the truck 's exhaust system. The child 's 13-year-old sibling also died in the same incident. Case 177. A 33-year-old commercial sherman was sh- ing for squid when he went down into the hold of the shipand immediately lost consciousness. He suffered a cardiacarrest and was unable to be resuscitated in the eld. A co-worker went down after him and also lost consciousness;the co-worker was successfully resuscitated and dischargedfrom the hospital one month later. It is unknown if there wasan odor of rotten eggs in the hold of the ship. The coronerreported ndings consistent with hydrogen sul depoison- ing. Cases 180 & 182. Two men, ages 42 and 60 years, were found dead near a well. They had been \"acidizing \"the well with an unknown acid. There was a \"rotten egg \"odor at the site thought to be hydrogen sul de. One patient had coins in his pocket that had turned black. Cases 183 & 184. Two men, ages 67 and 73 years, were found unconscious in a well after cleaning the area withmuriatic acid. There was a strong smell of rotten eggs,presumed to be hydrogen sul de. Both men experienced cardiopulmonary arrest during transport to the ED. One mannever regained consciousness and died two days later de-spite intensive supportive care. The second man did regainconsciousness, but died suddenly 3 days later. Case 187. An adult man was working in a purging tank at a natural gas plant when he was overcome by methane . He collapsed and was unconscious approximately 20 min-utes before EMS arrival. He was brought to the ED incardiorespiratory arrest, but was unable to be resuscitated.446 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE IVolume 20, Number 5 ISeptember 2002Two other workers exposed in the same tank were evaluated in the ED for drowsiness; they did not notice any odors. Case 189. A 41-year-old dentist unintentionally dropped some old dental amalgam on the hot burner of his stove.Thick white fumes were produced. After 15 minutes heopened the windows and turned on a fan, but stayed in thekitchen. About an hour after exposure, the patient started tovomit. He called his girlfriend several times to say he wasalso short of breath and nally called an ambulance to take him to the hospital. On arrival in the ED, he was cyanoticwith dyspnea and tachypnea. Crackles were heard on chestauscultation and his chest x-ray showed diffuse in ltrates. His oxygen saturation was 80% on room air and up to 96%on high flow oxygen. An arterial blood gas showed a respiratory alkalosis with severe hypoxia. He was slightlydrowsy. His initial laboratories showed a spot urine mer- cury of 44,000 ng/mL and an elevated creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL. His creatinine normalized but he became hypoxic.He was started on chelation therapy with DMSA and alsoreceived steroids for his lungs. The patient 's status remained stable for 48 hours. He then became febrile to 43 oC, hypotensive (unresponsive to pressors), impossible to ven- tilate with a pCO2persistently above 100 mm Hg, and died. Case 192. A 13-year-old boy with a recent history of intentional abuse of gasoline fumes drove a four wheel allterrain vehicle a distance from his home with a friend andbegan huf nggasoline from the gas tank. He lost con- sciousness and was transported home on the vehicle by thefriend, where 911 was called. EMS found the child in fullcardiopulmonary arrest. Resuscitation efforts by EMS andthe local ED were unsuccessful. Case 193. A 12-month-old boy ingested approximately one mouthful of lamp oil containing 99% paraf n and 1% unspeci ed petroleum distillates. He began to cough imme- diately, and was referred to an ED for treatment. He arrivedat the hospital within thirty minutes of the exposure and wasimmediately intubated and transferred to a children 's hos- pital due to respiratory distress. He was placed on ECMOwithin six hours of exposure. Bilateral pleural effusionsdeveloped and chest tubes were inserted. He received intra-venous hydrochlorothiazide and surfactant via bronchos-copy. Six days after exposure he improved, with minimalaeration in the upper lobes and a pO 2of 48 mm Hg. Improvement was transient. He remained on ECMO and expired 31 days after the exposure. Case 195. A 16-year-old girl with a history of multiple previous suicide attempts was brought to the ED two hoursafter a suicide attempt with an unknown substance, possiblya pesticide. The patient was unresponsive, hypotensive,cyanotic, had shallow breathing, and was \"clenching her mouth \", resembling seizure activity. Laboratory values were: pH, 6.7; pCO 2,7 6m mm Hg; HCO3, 17 mEq/L. Despite supportive care the patient died shortly after ED arrival. The medical examiner determined that thecause of death was the ingestion of an aluminum phos- phide rodenticide from Nicaragua. Case 199. A 46-year-old man was brought to an ED 48 hours after a suicide attempt with an unknown amount ofparaquat . The patient was comatose and in respiratory, hepatic and renal failure. He also had caustic burns to theesophagus. Laboratory results were: pH, 7.35; pCO 2,3 5mm Hg; pO2, 55 mm Hg. The patient died of respiratory failure on the fth day of hospitalization. Case 203. A 2-year-old boy ingested a liquid pesticide that had been transferred to an unlabeled soda bottle and lefttemporarily on the kitchen counter. Prior to the arrival ofEMS the child began having tonic-clonic seizures. On ar-rival in the ED the child was in status epilepticus. Admin-istration of atropine, pralidoxime, diazepam, lorazepam,phenytoin and phenobarbital did not control the seizures. Hewas intubated, placed on a ventilator and transferred to atertiary care facility. There he had vomiting, tachycardia,hyperthermia (42 oC) and persistent seizures. At the time of transfer the pesticide was identi ed as endosulfan . Prali- doxime and atropine were discontinued and a midazolaminfusion was begun, which controlled the seizures. Thechild became hypotensive and required fluids, dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine to maintain his blood pres-sure. Phenobarbital and midazolam were discontinued be-cause of hypotension. The child showed no movement butthe EEG showed some activity. An MRI showed profoundattenuation in both cerebral hemispheres, the brainstem andparts of the cerebellum with a suggestion of herniation. Aradionuclide brain flow study failed to demonstrate blood flow. The child experienced multi-organ system failure and expired on the third hospital day. Case 205. A 50-year-old man swallowed an unknown amount of a Mexican rodenticide containing zinc phos- phide . The patient \"washed the poison down \"with water. He was brought to the ED by his sister one hour after theingestion. His vital signs were normal at that time. Thepatient developed pulmonary edema, hypotension, and met-abolic acidosis while in the hospital. He expired 11 hoursafter arrival. Case 206. A 20-year-old man was found unconscious by his family in the early morning. He had vomited during thenight. Datura stramonium seeds, atenolol , and celecoxib were found in his room. He had a respiratory arrest and wasintubated and transported to the ED where he was tachy-cardic and comatose. His initial arterial pH was 6.67. Soonafter arrival in the ED he developed seizures. Rhabdomy-olysis developed with a creatine kinase greater than 12,000U/L within four hours of arrival. He developed a ventriculararrhythmia, remained hypotensive and, despite maximalsupportive care, died about nine hours after admission. Themedical examiner 's report listed the cause of death as pul- monary edema secondary to atenolol and atropine revealed a blood atenololconcentration of 0.66 an atropine blood concen- tration of 0.049 /H9262g/mL. Case 208. A 63-year-old man presented to the ED with nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness, and a clinical picture ofmeningitis with encephalopathy. A CSF culture was posi-tive for Bacillus anthracis at both the state health depart- ment laboratory and the CDC. The patient was diagnosed ashaving pulmonary anthrax. Despite therapy with intrave-nous cipro floxacin and anthrax vaccine, the patient expired on the fourth hospital day from hemorrhagic complicationsof pulmonary anthrax. Case 209. A 27-week pregnant woman presented to the ED following an acetaminophen overdose. Her acetamin- ophen concentration was 90 /H9262g/ml an unknown time fol- lowing ingestion. The female fetus developed evidence of447 LITOVITZ ET AL I2001 AAPCC ANNUAL REPORTfetal distress and was delivered by caesarian section. The infant had respiratory distress at delivery, could not beadequately ventilated, and expired. The following pre-mor-tem laboratory values were obtained on the infant: pH, 6.61;pCO 2,6 5m mg/dL;acetaminophen, CSF glucose, 136 CSF protein, 188 mg/dL; and CSF WBC, 61/ /H9262L. Case 249. A 60-year-old malnourished woman with a history of colon cancer was found unresponsive on thebathroom floor with an empty bottle of acetaminophen nearby. The patient was transported to the hospital, intu-bated and placed on a ventilator. A CT scan of the head wasinterpreted as normal. Initial IU/ L; acetaminophen, The time of ingestion was unknown. N-acetylcysteinetherapy was begun via nasogastric tube. A repeat acetamin-ophen concentration one to two hours after arrival was1,145 /H9262g/mL. Her blood pressure fell to 80 mm Hg systolic but responded to a fluid bolus. The patient continued to deteriorate rapidly. Dopamine and fresh frozen plasma wereadministered. Her AST rose to 10,000 IU/L and ALT to7,000 IU/L. She arrested less than 24 hours after arrival atthe hospital and expired. Case 294. A 16-month-old child developed liver failure following a brief illness for which he was reportedly treatedwith excessive acetaminophen for fever control. A urine drug screen revealed methamphetamine , and the social history was notable for family involvement in home meth-amphetamine production. N-acetylcysteine was adminis-tered intravenously and the patient was transferred to atertiary care facility for liver transplant evaluation. Duringthe course of this evaluation, he developed cerebral edemaand died approximately two weeks after the onset of symp-toms. Case 382. A 1-year-old girl ingested an unknown number of enteric-coated aspirin tablets. In the ED 4 to 6 hours later, she had vomited and was jittery. Her heart rate was120 beats/min and her blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg.The salicylate concentration was 123 mg/dL. Before thechild could be transferred to a hospital capable of emer-gency pediatric hemodialysis, she become hypotensive withbradycardia. She then had a cardiac arrest and could not beresuscitated. The time from presentation to death was about 2 hours. Case 383. A 14-month-old girl presented to the ED with a blood glucose of 7 mg/dL, an anion-gap acidosis and anammonia concentration greater than 500 /H9262mol/L. The child suffered a cardiorespiratory arrest but was successfully re-suscitated after 15 min of CPR. She was transferred to atertiary care facility where a salicylate concentration was measured at 64.3 mg/dL. Subsequently concentrations of 60and 70 mg/dL were measured. Blood glucose was correctedand blood pressure was maintained on dopamine. Hypoka-lemia initially prevented adequate urinary alkalinization.The following day her ammonia concentration had de-creased to 45 /H9262mol/L but liver enzymes were elevated. An acetaminophen concentration at that time was negative. ACT scan of the head showed cerebral edema. Despite ag-gressive supportive care the child 's neurologic condition never improved. She was removed from life support sevendays later and expired. Case 392. A 45-year-old woman presented to the ED approximately four hours post ingestion of 500 aspirin tablets. Upon arrival in the ED, activated charcoal with acathartic was administered. After admission to the ICU thepatient was confused and combative. A salicylate concen-tration obtained approximately four hours post-ingestionwas 80 mg/dL, but increased to 109 mg/dL within approx-imately six hours. An abdominal X-ray showed bezoars inthe stomach. Whole bowel irrigant was administered via NGtube. The patient deteriorated rapidly, becoming totallyunresponsive. She was intubated, placed on a ventilator andprepared for hemodialysis. Her condition continued to de-teriorate and she expired prior to hemodialysis. Case 395. A lethargic 48-year-old man arrived at the ED stating that he had ingested 40 aspirin tablets in a suicide attempt 12 hours prior to admission. His vital signs were:heart rate, 110 beats/min; respiratory rate, 24 breaths/min;blood pressure, 130/80 mm Hg. He was afebrile. The rst salicylate concentration, at approximately 14 hours postingestion, was 74 mg/dL; the second, 10 hours later, was110.3 mg/dL. Serum alkalinization with sodium bicarbonatewas initiated, but the patient expired shortly thereafter. Case 430. A 45-year-old clinical pharmacist was admit- ted to the hospital with shortness of breath. He was found tohave a severe (pH, 6.9; but remained communi- cative and steadfastly denied any drug use or overdosedespite a past history of intravenous abuse of diazepam. Hedeveloped hypotension, fever and ARDS and expired 10days after admission. Because his presentation was sugges-tive of colchicine poisoning, a blood sample was sent on the day after he was admitted, and this later returned with anelevated concentration of 6.1 ng/mL. Case 440. An adult male was found dead after reportedly ingesting 24 fentanyl 800 /H9262g lozenges on a stick. Case 465. A 41-year-old woman with a history of heavy drug abuse was brought to the ED after a night of ingestingmethadone andmethylphenidate and snorting crack co- caine . She was stuporous with a low oxygen saturation and was given a dose of naloxone enroute to the ED. In the EDshe was alert and oriented and remained asymptomatic overa 5 hour period of observation. She was discharged homeand went to bed. An hour later she was found unresponsivewith snoring respirations. She wakened during attemptednasal intubation enroute to the ED. Her oxygen saturationwas 88% and another dose of naloxone was administered.She was admitted to the hospital and, over the followingfour hours, became completely alert and oriented and wasambulating normally. By 24 hours after her initial presen-tation, she was again drowsy with a 50% oxygen saturation.After another dose of naloxone and 100% oxygen she wasagitated for a brief period but had good respiratory effortand 96 to 98% oxygen saturation. Several hours later shehad a sudden severe respiratory event requiring intubationand ventilatory support. Over the following week she de-veloped pulmonary edema and was unable to be weaned448 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE IVolume 20, Number 5 ISeptember 2002from the ventilator. She died on the tenth hospital day when life support was discontinued. Case 475. A 9-month-old girl was admitted to the hos- pital for surgery. After surgery an order was written for herto receive 0.5 mg of parenteral morphine every two hours for pain control. A decimal point was misplaced and thechild died after receiving two doses of 5.0 mg morphine twohours apart. Case 484. A 59-year-old woman, in a nursing facility with metastatic lung cancer, was administered 5 morphine 100 mg tablets (long acting). The nurse had crushed thetablets to place them in food and there was concern that thesustained release effect would be lost. Activated charcoal was administered at the nursing facility. The patient vom-ited, aspirated stomach contents and her oxygen saturationdropped to 40%. Naloxone was given with no improvement,and she was transported to the local ED where additionalnaloxone was given. Shortly thereafter the patient devel-oped seizures, presumed to be due to withdrawal, as thepatient had been on morphine chronically. Diazepam wasadministered, but invasive procedures were withheld due tothe advanced cancer. The patient was in respiratory distress,and had apparently aspirated the charcoal. Over the next twodays the patient was given morphine for pain and diazepamfor occasional discrete seizures. Tachycardia and hypoten-sion persisted. On her second hospital day she suffered acardiopulmonary arrest and died. Case 503. A 13-month-old boy ingested an oxycodone tablet of unknown strength that he found on the floor at his grandmother 's house. He ingested the tablet between 12 and 16 hours prior to presenting to the ED. Upon arrival in theED the patient was having seizures and experienced arespiratory arrest. He was treated with naloxone and ben-zodiazepines and placed on a ventilator. He was also givenactivated charcoal via nasogastric tube. The patient contin-ued to have seizures and phenobarbital and fosphenytoinwere added. He responded to the anticonvulsants and hisvital signs became stable. The patient 's pupillary reactivity deteriorated from sluggish to nonreactive, and his level ofconsciousness never improved. A CT scan of the headconrmed cerebral edema and hemorrhage. The patient expired three days post ingestion. Case 505. A 9-year-old girl was discovered in bed at her grandmother 's house not breathing. Twenty of her grand- mother 'soxycodone 80 mg tablets were found to be miss- ing. Earlier in the evening, the girl had left the room forabout 15 minutes, then came back into the room for anadditional 15 minutes, and then became sleepy and went tobed. At postmortem eighteen intact tablets were found in thegirl's stomach with an additional tablet found in three pieces with possible bite marks on it. It remains unknown if shetook them on her own or was forced to take them. Thecoroner did not nd any marks or injuries to suggest forcible ingestion. Case 543. A 17-year-old girl presented 10 hours post- ingestion of an unknown amount of acetaminophen .A n ingestion of more than 10 grams of acetaminophen wassuspected. Co-ingestants were initially denied. Medical carewas sought due to vomiting and abdominal pain. An initialacetaminophen concentration was 67 /H9262g/mL The patient denied salicylate ingestion despite an initial salicylate con- centration of 33.7 mg/dL. She was started on oral NACtherapy followed by one dose of promethazine given as an anti-emetic. Through the evening she became agitated, anddeveloped tachycardia and hyperventilation. A repeat salic-ylate concentration was 95 mg/dL. She had a cardiac arrestapproximately 12 hours post admission and could not beresuscitated. Case 547. An adult man presented in the ED following the ingestion of an unknown quantity of tramadol .H ew a s treated in the ED with lavage, activated charcoal and acathartic. He was discharged to a prison in rmary where he was found unresponsive and in cardiopulmonary arrest 12hours later. He died en route to the hospital. An autopsyshowed concentrations of tramadol greater than 7 /H9262g/mL. Case 550. A 28-year-old woman injected ketamine with her boyfriend. The boyfriend fell asleep and when he awokeshe was cyanotic. She was transported to the ED where theyperformed cardiopulmonary resuscitation. She was unre-sponsive, ventilator 2.3 mg/dL. Twenty hours later, she remainedunresponsive with minimal brain function. Cardiac functionstabilized without vasopressors. Laboratory for anuria. the ventilator with decerebrate posturing. A CTscan showed anoxic brain injury. Nine days after presenta-tion she was declared brain dead and removed from theventilator. She died six days later. Case 552. A 19-year-old man was huf ngnitrous oxide from a bag placed over his head. He was found in asystoleand could not be resuscitated. Case 555. A 5-year-old boy became somnolent, then hypercarbic, then had a cardiac arrest 10-15 minutes after adental procedure using for presumed malignant hyperthermia. The pa-tient exhibited massive rhabdomyolysis associated with thehyperthermia. Later that day he was pronounced brain dead. Case 564. A 15-month-old child with Down syndrome suffered a seizure and was taken to the local ED. An orderwas written for 200 mg of fosphenytoin . Shortly after receiving this dose, he died. Subsequently, it was noticedthat there was 2000 mg of fosphenytoin missing from thedispensing machine. On post mortem, the patient 's serum phenytoin concentration was 110 /H9262g/mL. Case 584. A 53-year-old man presented to the ED after ingesting 28 amitriptyline 100 mg tablets. Initially, the patient was awake, alert and oriented. One hour later he wasunresponsive, but not intubated. He was treated with gastriclavage and given activated charcoal. Naloxone was admin-istered with no response. His heart rate was in the 150 's; his blood pressure was reportedly within normal limits. TheQRS complex was reported as \"not very wide \". The patient then had a brief seizure, followed by a respiratory and thencardiac arrest. Despite resuscitative measures, only an idio-ventricular rhythm with very wide complexes was observed.Despite aggressive resuscitation efforts with bicarbonate,449 LITOVITZ ET ANNUAL REPORTatropine, dopamine, vasopressin, calcium, de brillation, and temporary pacing (pacer did not capture), the patientexpired 3.5 hours after the overdose. Case 646. A 47-year-old woman was transferred to the ED from a nursing home due to mental status changes,confusion, ataxia, and hypotension. She had been in thenursing home due to a history of alcohol abuse and a mentaldisorder, for which she had been treated chronically withlithium . An initial lithium concentration was 3.1 mEq/L. She developed severe hypotension (palpable systolic bloodpressure, 50 mm Hg), tachycardia (heart rate, 180 beats/min), and renal failure. Norepinephrine and dopamine wereboth initiated, but the patient 's condition deteriorated quickly. She expired approximately 36 hours after admis-sion. Case 707. An 81-year-old woman was found by a neigh- bor on the floor, too weak to stand. The patient was in her usual state of good health until nine days prior to admissionwhen she began to develop oral ulcers and odynophagia,which limited her oral intake. She had been evaluated twodays prior to admission and found to have no recent fever,rash, or exposure to new medications or herbal remedies.The patient was being treated for hypertension, hyperlipid-emia, and osteoporosis with hydrochlorothiazide, felodip-ine,fluvastatin, conjugated equine estrogens, and medroxy- progesterone, all of which had been re lled 22 days earlier. A topical solution was prescribed to treat the aphthae. Onadmission, she was afebrile and hemodynamically stable,but profoundly dehydrated. There were severe, con fluent oral ulcerations without associated cutaneous, ocular, orgenital abnormalities. The cardiopulmonary examinationwas unremarkable except for tachycardia. Laboratory re-sults included: white blood count, 300/ and non-speci c changes con- sistent with the hypokalemia. The chest radiograph wasunremarkable. A family member retrieved the patient 's medication bottles for review and identi cation. The bottle labeled \"medroxyprogesterone 2.5 mg \"contained both this medication and methotrexate 2.5 mg tablets. She was treated promptly with high-dose leucovorin, 100 mg IVevery 4 hours, lgrastim, platelet transfusions, fluids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. A computer-generated list of allmedications dispensed to the patient and her late-husband inthe preceding three years did not include methotrexate. Herinitial serum methotrexate concentration was 0.12 /H9262mol/L and became undetectable on the third measurement, 24hours after admission. Her hospital course was complicatedby severe sepsis from aspiration pneumonia, respiratoryfailure requiring mechanical ventilation, and a non-Q-wavemyocardial infarction. Despite aggressive supportive ther-apy, she died on the twelfth hospital day. Case 715. A 71-year-old man was discovered by his wife ingesting the contents of a bottle of sustained-release the- ophylline 100 mg tablets. It was estimated that he took 90 to 100 tablets. EMS was called and the patient arrived in theED 30 minutes post ingestion. Gastric lavage was per-formed, with the return of pill fragments. Activated charcoaland metoclopramide were administered. A theophyllineconcentration was 3 /H9262g/mL. Over the next two hours thepatient 's blood pressure decreased and his heart rate in- creased into the 160 's. A repeat theophylline concentration, drawn 2.5 hours post ingestion, was 81 /H9262g/mL. Dobutamine and norepinephrine were administered and cardioversionwas performed. He was intubated and transported to atertiary care hospital. On arrival in the ICU the patient wassedated, his pupils were equal and reactive and he hadoccasional jerky movements of his extremities. ECG re-vealed a narrow supraventricular tachycardia of 172 beats/min. A theophylline concentration measured 7 hours postingestion was 132 /H9262g/mL. His blood pressure remained low at 60/40 mm Hg, despite high doses of dobutamine andnorepinephrine. Charcoal hemoperfusion was started andcontinued for six hours. His theophylline concentrationdecreased to 4.1 /H9262g/mL. The patient continued to be hypo- tensive. Despite charcoal hemoperfusion and aggressivesupportive care, including high dose vasopressors, he de-veloped a worsening acidosis and renal failure. The patientexpired on his second hospital day, less than 24 hours afterthe ingestion. Case 743. A 60-year-old man was admitted to the hos- pital with hemiparesis thought to be secondary to a pontineinfarct. Three weeks after admission, during rehabilitation,he awoke with slurred speech, dysphasia and an inability towalk. He was transferred to the medical service. Laboratoryvalues at that time were: BUN, The patient hadbeen receiving both cerivastatin and gembrozil ; both were discontinued. Two days later he was dialyzed for renalfailure. He also required surgery for a lacerated femoralartery, damaged during a catheter insertion. The day aftersurgery he developed a coagulopathy and gastrointestinalbleeding, requiring fresh frozen plasma and DDAVP. Hiscreatine kinase concentrations peaked at 289,000 IU/L. Hedeveloped a fever to 41.6 \u00b0C with negative cultures. On his ninth day on the medical service he developed hypotension,unresponsive to vasopressors, and died. At autopsy he wasfound to have severe rhabdomyolysis, including the myo-cardium. Case 747. A six-week-old girl, born premature with Down syndrome, had recent surgical procedures for duode-nal atresia and a cardiac cushion defect. During recoveryfrom a nosocomial pulmonary infection she developed pre-mature atrial contractions which were treated with intrave-nous digoxin . One hour following her third dose ventricular brillation, then asystole. Cardiopul- monary resuscitation ensued then placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.The digoxin concentration was 22 ng/ml and digoxin im-mune Fab was administered. On reviewing the case, thehospital pharmacy determined that the patient was uninten-tionally given an excessive amount of digoxin on the thirddose. The patient remained in sinus rhythm, but support waseventually withdrawn because of severe hypoxic brain dam-age, and the patient expired. Case 781. A 2-year-old girl was brought to the ED after ingesting several of her grandfather 's medications. Impli- cated metoprolol ,losartan ,pioglita- zone furosemide. At the time of pre- sentation the child 's vital signs and examination were reported to be normal. An IV was started and air transport450 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE IVolume 20, Number 5 ISeptember 2002to a tertiary care hospital was arranged. During transport, the child had an acute respiratory arrest followed by asys-tole. She could not be resuscitated. Case 788. A 48-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with agitation, shortness of breath and pulselessextremities. She had a past medical history of coronaryartery disease with a previous CABG done nine years ear-lier. She was treated with aspirin and begun on a nitroglyc- erin infusion. Due to agitation she was taken for a CT scan of her brain. During transfer, and also during the scanningprocedure, the nitroglycerin pump was inadvertently re-moved and the infusion rate was not controlled. The patientbecame profoundly hypotensive and unresponsive. Despitediscontinuation of the nitroglycerin and administration offluids and pressor agents, the patient expired. Case 824. A 15-month-old girl ingested an entire bottle of 30 benzonatate . Approximately 20 minutes after the ingestion, her mother called EMS. When they arrived on thescene the child was in asystole with apnea. The child wasresuscitated and intubated. On arrival in the ED her heartrate was 105 beats/min with a systolic blood pressure of 123mm Hg. The child never regained consciousness and ex-pired eight days later. Case 830. A 17-year-old boy was transferred from an outlying hospital ED with a suspected overdose of dinitro- phenol . The patient had a body temperature of 41.1 oC, a blood glucose of 1,100 mg/dL, metabolic acidosis and ARDS. He had been successfully resuscitated from threecardiac arrests since arriving at the ED. He died later thatevening following unsuccessful attempts to resuscitate himfrom a fourth cardiac arrest. Case 834. A 53-year-old woman was found unconscious by family members after ingesting an unknown number oftablets of ma huang two days prior to presentation. She had shallow breathing and was intubated by EMS. In the ED, ahead CT scan demonstrated a massive right-sided hemor-rhage. The urine drug screen was only positive for THC.Low dose dopamine was started. An EEG and neurologicexamination con rmed brain death. Case 842. An 83-year-old woman with advanced demen- tia, hypertension, diabetes and possible previous stroke,aspirated psyllium hydrophillic mucilloid powder. Her family described severe coughing and shortness of breath.In the ED vital signs included: respiratory rate, 36 breaths/min; heart rate, 130 beats/min; and blood pressure, 163/69mm Hg. Pulse oximetry was reportedly \"stable \"on 10 L of oxygen by mask. Initial chest X-ray showed an in ltrate, which rapidly coalesced into a dense opaci cation of the left lung. She became hypotensive with increasing respiratorydistress, requiring intubation in the ED. A copious amountof\"thick orange jelly type material \"was suctioned from her trachea. Initial laboratory assessment, including cardiac en-zymes, was unremarkable. She was admitted to the ICU andtreated with dopamine, antibiotics and assisted ventilation.Her clinical condition deteriorated and she expired the fol-lowing day. Case 843. A 4-year-old boy suffered a cardiorespiratory arrest at home and could not be resuscitated. The patient hadbeen seen earlier in the day by his physician for constipa-tion. He had subsequently received two pediatric and oneadult sodium phosphate/sodium biphosphate enemas . Postmortem examination showed acute bowel perforation.Case 848. A 51-year-old woman was brought to the ED after being found unresponsive by her husband. An initialblood glucose was 19 mg/dL but improved only to 20mg/dL despite treatment with D 50W. In the ED she was treated with glucagon, additional D50W boluses and a D10W infusion. Dopamine was started for hypotension. Her hus- band was a non-insulin dependent diabetic and concern forsulfonylurea overdose was entertained; octreotide was thenadded to her therapeutic regime. Other medications thatwere available to the patient were diazepam, buspirone, andbupropion. The patient failed to regain meaningful con-sciousness and the family decided to withdraw care. Shedied 11 days after presentation. A C-peptide concentrationfrom admission was 0.7 ng/mL (normal 0.4-4.5), 4,633 /H9262U/mL (normal 5-35). Case 867. A 2-year-old boy with a urea cycle defect and profound mental retardation was admitted to the hospital forfever, cyanosis and pneumonia. On the fourth hospital day,he inadvertently received 32 mL of his sodium phenylbu- tyrate solution orally over 12 hours, for a total dose of 27 g. He was receiving this medication chronically, as therapy forhis urea cycle defect, but his usual dose was 2.5 mL orallyevery 6 hours. He was lethargic and soon became hypoten-sive. The patient was intubated and hemodialysis was ini-tiated. Shortly after dialysis, his platelets fell to 12,000/ /H9262L and gastrointestinal bleeding began. His blood pressure fell,requiring fluid resuscitation and epinephrine and dopamine infusions. included: A CT scan of his head demonstrated possible brainstem bleeding and her-niation. He deteriorated and died. Autopsy showed diffusehemorrhage of the brain, spinal cord and retroperitoneum,and cerebellar tonsillar herniation. Case 868. A 10-year-old boy experienced a cardiorespi- ratory arrest 18 hours after surgery using succinylcholine as an induction agent. He was resuscitated, but became and had an elevated creatine kinase of 206,000 U/Land a temperature of 41.1 oC. expired. Case 870. A 43-year-old man, a C3-C4 quadriplegic receiving baclofen by intrathecal pump, was found at home unresponsive and in ventricular brillation. He was de bril- lated several times and intubated prior to ED arrival. Hisbaclofen pump had a history of malfunctioning. He wasfound to have xed and dilated pupils and was flaccid with some spasticity in his legs. His heart rate was 110-120 beats/min and his blood pressure was 114/83 mm Hg initially, ondopamine and norepinephrine. The patient was declared braindead later that day and life support was withdrawn. Case 975. A 37-year-old man was found in asystole when EMS arrived at his residence. He was intubated and ad-vanced cardiac life support measures were instituted. Onarrival in the ED he was febrile, with tachycardia, hyper-tension and seizures. Further history revealed that, follow-ing an argument with his wife, he had tried to elude thepolice. When found by EMS there was a bag of whitepowder thought to be cocaine next to the patient and an additional bag was found in his throat when he was intu-bated. Maximum supportive care was continued. On hospi-tal day two an EEG showed no brain activity. He died 96hours after hospital admission. The autopsy listed the causeof death as cerebral edema with bilateral pulmonary con-451 AL of cocaine toxicity. Toxicologic analysis of hospitalblood from admission showed a benzoylecgonine concentra-tion of 1.3 /H9262g/mL and an ethanol concentration of 120 mg/dL. Case 1051. A 12-year-old girl began having seizures at home. She then vomited and lost consciousness. Paramedicsfound her in cardiorespiratory arrest and CPR was begunduring transport to the ED. She could not be resuscitated.Her temperature was 39.2 \u00b0C. History, obtained from her boyfriend after her death, revealed that he had given her an\"Ecstasy \"during a kiss about 1.5 hours before the seizure. At autopsy methylenedioxymethamphetamine concentra- tions were 2.0 /H9262g/mL in femoral blood and 3.3 /H9262g/mL in cardiac blood. Case 1054. In an apparent attempt to dispose of drug during a police confrontation, a 19-year-old man ingestedapproximately six tablets of methylenedioxymethamphet- amine . The patient had seizure-like behavior prior to arrival in the ED. Upon presentation about 2 hours post ingestion,he was extremely agitated, with a heart rate of 170 beats/min, a blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg and a normal bodytemperature. The patient was administered parenteral halo-peridol, diphenhydramine and propranolol. By four hourspost ingestion, he had been intubated and was given smalldoses of diazepam and lorazepam. Approximately an hourlater, the patient 's status worsened with hyperthermia (42.2 o C, rectally), hypotension and ventricular dysrhythmias. His PTT at that time was found to be greater than 250 s.Dopamine, lidocaine and external cooling with ice wereused in an effort to control his rapidly deteriorating status.The patient arrested, and despite aggressive attempts atresuscitation, expired approximately 6 hours post ingestion.452 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE IVolume 20, Number 5 ISeptember 2002 "}
