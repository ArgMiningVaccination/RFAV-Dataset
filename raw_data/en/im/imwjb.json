The main attraction of vaccination to Allopathy is it's propaganda value, and without it's value in generating disease (see [Vaccine ](../vaccines/diseases.html) [disease](../vaccines/diseases.html) & [Disease Protection Racket](../a/fear_dis.html)) the Medical Industry would shrink to nothing, but it's chief value is in maintaining the [ Matrix](../b/matrix_beliefs.html) as it Baptises you into the [ Church of Allopathy](../vaccines/god.html) (the main control [Church](../c/church.html), and the main enforcement arm of the [Cult of Authority](../b/authoritarians_h.html)) and infects you with it's main controlling money making doctrine: [Fear of Viruses](../a/infectious_scares.html), which is the evil twin of vaccination.

We're going to go look back at this century and we're going to laugh eventually, but we'll cry first. This is one of the most barbaric periods. It's going to be called the Dark Ages of Medicine.\"---- [Dr Shulze](The [Sam Biser]Herbal Video Collection p198) In fact anything that comes out of the Allopathic Voice of Authority. ''Vaccination encourages medical dependence and reinforces belief in the inefficiency of the body. It creates people who need permanent assistance. It replaces the confidence one has in oneself with a blind confidence in others, outside ourselves. It leads to loss of personal dignity, in addition to making us financially dependent. It draws us into the vicious circle of sickness (fear - poverty - submission) and, in this way, ensures the submission of the herd so as to better dominate and exploit it. And then lead them to the abattoir. To slaughter.''

If microorganisms inside of vaccines can be coaxed into targeting or invading specific cells, they could achieve their goal at an accelerated rate over conventional vaccines. \"Depending on which side of the vaccine debate you're on, whether pro or con, nanobots inside vaccine preparations could advance their effectiveness exponentially by either dramatically improving or destroying immunity depending on their design,\" he added.\" [[2009] Are Populations Being Primed For Nano-Microchips Inside Vaccines?] \"Vaccination leads to social violence and crime. What better way to destabilize a country than to disarm its inhabitants, and reinforce police and military control? The authorities subtly create situations of panic and fear among the population which, in turn, necessitate the reinforcement of \"protection measures\", including forbidding citizens from owning weapons. The authorities then come across as saviours and strengthen their control. It is certain that, in order to impose a single world army, one must first disarm the citizens of every country. One must therefore create violence, if they are to achieve this disarmament, particularly in the United States where the right to bear arms is guaranteed by the Constitution.\" [Why Vaccination Continues by Guylaine Lanctot, M.D.] ''That book ( A Shot in the Dark) deals with the long term effects of vaccinations on the emotional life and psychological stability. . It's not a difficult conclusion. Vaccination does cause encephalitis, the doctors admit that. Encephalitis does have as one of its many sequelae, violent behavior. All one has to do is read the literature and it is evident that vaccinations are causing this epidemic of violent behavior. I haven't had any luck in persuading the allopathic physicians of that but I hope to one day before its too late.'' ~ [Harris Coulter Interview] Articles [Why Vaccination Continues by Guylaine Lanctot, M.D. ](../vaccines/lanctot.html) covers a few more in detail Quotes \"Medical propaganda and enforcement is the very best method for attaining long-range political control. .....

It was indeed a very great discoveryworth thousands of millions. That is why this kind of blackmail is still kept going.\"-- [Dr Hadwin](../vaccines/hadwen1.html) As medicine becomes more regimented, collectivist physicians begin to lose their sense of humanity. In a collectivist system, it is the \"plan\" that matters, not individuals. In fact, individuals are to be sacrificed for the \"plan.\" .....I was told by a researcher in the field of autism, that when he attended a conference in Italy on the genetic aspects of autism and mentioned the link between the vaccine program and autism incidence, one of the public officials in the Italian Health Department stood and told him in an angry tone that everyone knew that the vaccines were causing injury to children's brains, but the success of the vaccine \"program\" was more important. Further, he stated, these problems need to be downplayed so as not to endanger the vaccine \"program.\" \"That vaccination continues to this day is not because of its 'assumed' benefits, but "}
