Vaccination refers to the act of giving a vaccine to a person. A vaccine is the material used to immunise people against diseases. Like any other medication, vaccines can have side effects. Side effects after vaccination are usually mild and short-lasting and do not need special treatment. If the side effects seem severe or persistent, for example an ongoing high fever, breathing difficulties or convulsions seek medical advice. Read more about the [possible side effects of vaccination](/Articles/N_R/Possible-side-effects-of-vaccination). Adverse events following immunisation An adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) is an unwanted or unexpected event occurring after a vaccine has been given. Such an event may be caused by the vaccine or may occur by chance after vaccination (that is, it would have occurred regardless of vaccination). Vaccines can cause minor adverse events such as low-grade fever, pain or redness at the injection site, these symptoms are short lived. Surveillance Medical and Nurse Practitioners have a statutory responsibility to notify AEFI to the Chief Health Officer, as per the requirements of the Public Health Act 2016 and the Public Health Regulations 2017. Notifications using the WAVSS online reporting system satisfies the requirement to notify cases to the Director of the Communicable Disease Control Directorate, who is the delegate of the Chief Health Officer. This enables WA Health to identify new and unexpected AEFI and respond accordingly. Reporting Not all adverse reactions need to be reported such as, soreness or redness at the injection site or a slight fever that lasts less than a day. Read more about [common minor side effects to vaccines that do not require reporting](/Articles/N_R/Possible-side-effects-of-vaccination). If you experience a significant AEFI you should tell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when you had the vaccination. If your doctor is not available call healthdirect on 1800 022 222. This service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. A registered nurse will provide free advice about your health issues and concerns. You can also report the reaction yourself using the [Western Australian Vaccine Safety Surveillance system (WAVSS) (external site)](https://www.safevac.org.au/Home/Info/WA) or by calling the WA AEFI reporting line on telephone (08) 6456 0208 from 9.00am to 5.00pm Monday to Friday (except public holidays).
