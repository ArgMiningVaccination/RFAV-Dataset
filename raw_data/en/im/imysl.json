[Chef Monique Fiso](https://twitter.com/moniquefiso?lang=en) leads the way and points out edible wild plants, including peppery [horopito](http://www.terrain.net.nz/friends-of-te-henui-group/trees-native-botanical-names-m-to-q/mountain-horopito-pseudowintera-colorata.html), asparagus-tasting [pirita](http://www.terrain.net.nz/friends-of-te-henui-group/plants-native-botanical-names-r-to-z/supplejack-vine.html) (supplejack) and sweet purple [fuchsia](http://www.terrain.net.nz/friends-of-te-henui-group/table-1/tree-fuschia.html) berries. It may be the adventure capital of the world, but New Zealand flies under the radar in the culinary universe. With European, Asian, and Polynesian influences, contemporary New Zealand cuisine also draws heavily on [Mori](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/maori-culture-history) food. In traditional life, Mori peoples were hunters and gatherers who harvested their food from the mountains, forests, rivers, and ocean. Fiso, with her restaurant [Hiakai](https://www.hiakai.co.nz/), aims to shine a light on Mori cuisine, proving that there's a modern home for it in the world of fine dining. From the traditional [hngi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hngi) (earth oven) to foraging for ingredients harvested from the land and water, the indigenous Mori people possess a tradition of food that is uniquely their own and boasts flavors found nowhere else in the world. \"Foraging is big on the menu,\" says Fiso, and indeed the foraging tradition stretches back into history, to the earliest Polynesian settlers, and connects them to the natural environment. New Zealand has a lot of old, dense native bush, and its ferns, vines, palms, fungi, berries, fruit, and seeds became important foods. Much of the forest has been around for hundreds of years, since the time of Mori ancestors and was used by those ancestors for food and medicine\u2014so it's sacred to today's Mori people.

Thoughtful foraging practice, whether for [kai](https://media.newzealand.com/en/story-ideas/kai-traditional-maori-food/) (food) or [Rongo Mori](https://www.tepapa.govt.nz/discover-collections/read-watch-play/maori/maori-medicine) (herbal medicine), is to prioritize great respect for the forest, for the Mori people, the bush and the native plants are also ancestors. From [pikopiko fern tips](https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/pikopiko-maori-new-zealand) to [wood ear fungus](http://www.terrain.net.nz/friends-of-te-henui-group/fungi-te-henui/jews-ear-fungi.html) they're all generous resources from [Papatnuku](https://teara.govt.nz/en/papatuanuku-the-land)\u2014the Mother Earth figure in Mori tradition. \"You didn't tell me at the beginning of the week we'd be digging a hole and cooking in a pit,\" says Ramsay, when Fiso informs him that some of their dishes for the Big Cook will be cooked in a hangi. Into the earthen oven goes goat meat rubbed with spicy horopito leaves foraged from the forest, and wrapped in [puka leaves](http://www.terrain.net.nz/friends-of-te-henui-group/trees-native-botanical-names-m-to-q/puka-meryta-sinclairii.html) instead foil. \"I can't touch anything,\" says Ramsay. \"I can't double check for that level of perfection, because that's it\u2014it's in there now.\" It may not be the easiest practice for a chef who's used to checking the oven, but the hangi is an integral part of Mori culture and part of what Ramsay wants to highlight on Uncharted.
