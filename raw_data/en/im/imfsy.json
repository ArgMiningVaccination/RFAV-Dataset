DuPont Highway New Castle, DE 19720OUR VISION FOR THE 21ST CENTURY Delaware Health and Social Services' Division of Services for Aging and Adults with Physical Disabilities, while pursuing its mission to its customers, will move into the 21st century by pursuing a multi-faceted approach to success. It must also prepare to serve the succeeding generations, whose needs may require uniquely different approaches and resources. Our focus on advocacy, diversity, partnering, technology, and education will enhance our efforts for success in providing quality services to our customers, empowering them for greater independence.Dear Friends: Families who are going or have been through the experience of having a family member or friend in coma have many needs. Ascaregivers of a person who is in coma or recently recoveringfrom a coma, they may have many concerns and questions intrying to cope with a serious illness. This guide was developedas a result of the need we identified, when our 29-year-olddaughter, Jill Elizabeth Russell Eddy was in coma for 12 months.W e had no such guide or central place where comprehensiveinformation and resources on coma could be easily obtained.When we spoke to our State Representative, William Oberle, heunderstood our concerns and enthusiastically supported theidea of the COMA GUIDE FOR CAREGIVERS. My family and I would like to thank Representative Oberle and the Division of Services for Aging and Adults with PhysicalDisabilities for their wonderful support and untiring efforts tomake this Guide a reality . It is my sincere hope that the informa- tion supplied in this booklet will bebeneficial to families who are dealingwith such a tragedy and in some smallway will bring support and comfortduring their time of need.

Added to this stress is the uncertainty associated withbrain injury . It is difficult for any physician to predict the outcome during thefirst days, weeks, and even months. Along with family members, they must\"wait and see\" how the patient progresses. Struggling to understand this com-plex condition, most people feel alone and confused. Although each family member or friend deals with the crisis in his/her own way , all can benefit from certain basic information. This resource guide provides avariety of helpful material. The first section describes the structure and functionof the brain and goes on to explain the effects of injury . Patient care in the inten-sive care unit (ICU) and in other hospital settings is also addressed. The secondsection of the booklet discusses post-traumatic reactions of family members andclose friends and answers some common questions. A glossary of hospital termsis also included in the back of the booklet. Although family and friends may be anxious to learn more about brain injury , reading a resource guide may be difficult during such a trying time. It may behard to concentrate and remember explanations. Each person is different, how-ever. Some want to learn everything they can as quickly as possible. Othersprefer taking in information a little bit at a time. Read this resource guide at your own pace, perhaps a section at a time. In fact, some people like to start with the questions and answers. Many find it useful tojot down questions as they go along. Y ou may wish to use the blank note page inthe back of the resource guide for this purpose. In addition, keeping a journal ordiary of events, feelings, concerns, and questions is usually helpful. Plan to use this resource guide as you collect information about brain injury and discuss your concerns with family , friends, and caregivers. W e hope this bookletprovides a strong foundation of information for the days ahead. PAGE 4PAGE 5 NOTICE: The purpose of the following information is to review certain medical issues. The information contained herein has been supplied as a courtesy from BrynMawr Rehab, Malvern, P A, and thus shall not be reproduced nor be construed asmedical advice or opinion and is not intended as medical advice or opinion.Though the brain looks like a uniform struc- ture, it is actually divided into many partsthat perform very specific functions. Many ofthese different brain areas are active simulta-neously or sequentially during daily activities.Consider, forexample, that handthat the glass is coordinate themovement of theglass to your mouthusing your handand arm, and then coordinate the sequentialmovements of your mouth, tongue, andthroat to take a sip while taking a pausein breathing. This is quite a bit of activity to occur in just a few seconds. Y et the brain manages to per-form these kinds of routine actions regularlyand speedily through constant communica-tion between one part and the next. An injury ,however, can interrupt the connectionsbetween the areas of the brain and so inhibitthe simplest tasks.The brain is very complex. Though researchers are constantly making new discoveries about how it functions, it is possible through a basic explanation of the organ to gain some understanding of it's behavior. Although each brain area is involved in many varied functions and each activity requiresinvolvement of many brain areas, certaintypes of deficits commonly occur after aninjury to a specific part of the brain. In fact, in some cases, the areas of the brain that have been damaged can be identified by thechanges the individual exhibits afterward. As the director of all the body's functions, the brain uses a great many resources. At least 20percent of the blood the heart pumps goes tothe brain, and several million nerve cellssend, receive, and interpret messages thatkeep us functioning and acting purposefully . For the sake of description, the brain is divided into 3 main regions: the brain stem,THE BRAIN: STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION Diagram 1. Cross Section of the Brain PAGE 6the cerebellum, and the two cerebral hemi- spheres. The cerebral hemispheres are, in turn,divided into four lobes. The main brain regions and the lobes are identified in Diagrams 1 and 2. Descriptions ofthe different areas follow, along with theprimary functions they control. SKULL The bones that come together to completelycover and protect the brain. BRAIN STEM Although this area is anatomically small, itplays a very important role in many brainfunctions. Injuries to the brain stem can affectmotor function, eye movement, speech, swal-lowing, and the level of consciousness. CEREBELLUM This area is particularly important in coordina-tion and balance. CEREBRUM The largest part of the brain, it is divided intothe left and right cerebral hemispheres. Gener-ally, each hemisphere directs the motor andsensory functions for the opposite side of the Diagram 2. Lobes of the Brain body (i.e., the left hemisphere governs the rightside of the body and vice versa). The hemi-spheres also have specific roles. For example,the left hemisphere of right-handed peoplegoverns language functions and the righthemisphere is particularly important in visual-spatial functions. Each hemisphere is thendivided into four lobes (as noted in Diagram 2),which have specific functions. FRONTAL LOBES Govern personality , expression of emotion,storage of information, abstract thought,problem-solving, ability to organize,concentration, and the ability to initiate actionand movement. PARIETAL LOBES Important in sensation, perception, attentionand complex aspects of brain processing. TEMPORAL LOBES Regulate memory function, language informa-tion, and behavior. OCCIPITAL LOBES Responsible for aspects of visual function. PAGE 7 WHAT HAPPENS WITH BRAIN INJURY Even though the brain is well protected, it may be injured. Damage to the brain mayoccur immediately , or it may develop after theinjury due to swelling or bleeding. The skullis usually filled like this: After brain injury , the contents may change. The brain tissue may swell, causing it to takeup more room in the skull. This is callededema. When this occurs, the swollen braintissue will push the other contents to the side.There may be bruising called contusions or a collection of blood called a hematoma or clot.This may also push the other contents toone side. The flow of Cerebrospinal Fluid may also become blocked. This will cause the openspaces (ventricles) to become enlarged. Thisis called hydrocephalus. Any of these changes can cause increased intracranial pressure.

Theseinclude: N EUROLOGICAL EXAM: A series of questions and simple commands to see if thepatient can open their eyes, move, speak,and understand what is going on aroundthem. For example: What is your name?Where are you? What day is it? Wiggleyour toes. Hold up two fingers. X-R AY: A picture that looks at bones to see if they are broken (fractured). It can alsobe used to take a picture of the chest tolook at the lungs. This test may be done atthe bedside or in the X-ray departmentand takes between 5-30 minutes tocomplete. C T S CAN (CAT S CAN): An X-ray that can take pictures of the brain or other parts ofthe body . The scan is painless but thepatient must lie very still. The test takes30-60 minutes to complete. MRI (M AGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING SCAN): A large magnet and radio wavesare used, instead of X-rays, to take pic- tures of the body's tissues. It is painlessbut noisy . The machine is shaped like along tube. The patient must lie on a flattable in the middle of the machine. Thetest takes about 60 minutes to complete. A NGIOGRAM : A test to look at the blood vessels in the brain. Dye is put into a cath-eter in an artery (usually in the groin) thatsupplies blood to the brain. This test can tellif the arteries or veins have been damagedor are spasming. The test takes 1-3 hours. ICP M ONITOR : A small tube placed into or just on top of the brain through a smallhole in the skull. This will measure thepressure inside the brain (intracranialpressure). EEG (E LECTROENCEPHALOGRAPH ): A test to measure electrical activity in the brain.Special patches called electrodes areapplied to the head to measure the activ-ity . The test is painless and can be done atthe bedside or in the EEG department. Thelength of the test varies.HOW ARE BRAIN INJURIES EVALUATED ?

Please refer to it for the most up-to-date version ofthe document.PAGE 9Treatment of brain injury is aimed at: Stopping any bleeding Preventing an increase in pressure within the skull Controlling the amount of pressure, when it does increase Removing any large blood clots Treatments will vary with the type of injury. The doctor will decide which ones are used.These may include: POSITIONING : Usually the head of the bed will be elevated slightly and the neck kept straight.This position may decrease the intracranialpressure by allowing blood and cerebrospinalfluid to drain from the brain. Please do notchange the position of the bed without askingthe nurse. FLUID RESTRIC TION: It may be necessary to limit the fluids that a patient receives. The brain islike a sponge. It swells with extra fluid. Limit-ing fluids can help control the swelling. Pleasedo not give fluids without asking the nurse. MEDICATIONS : There are several types of medi- cations used with brain injury. Some of theseinclude: Diuretics are used to decrease the amount of water in the patient's body . This makesless water available to the brain forswelling. Steroids are used to decrease swelling in the brain tissue. Barbiturates are given if the patient's intracranial pressure is very high and hardto control. This medicine puts the patientinto a deep \"sleep\" called a barbituratecoma. This may help prevent more swell-ing and damage. Anticonvulsants are used to prevent seizures. Seizures occur as a result of extraelectrical activity in the brain. There areseveral types of seizures. The most com-mon type causes the patient to havejerking movements of the arms and legsfollowed by sleep. Other types may causeslight tremors of the face, or staring spells.Please notify the nurse or doctor if you seeany signs. Some patients have a seizure atthe time of injury while others may de-velop seizures after the injury . VENTRICULAR DRAIN (VENTRICULOSTOMY ): A small tube that is placed in the ventricle and con-nected to a drainage bag. It measures pressureinside the skull and drains CSF (cerebrospinalfluid). Some CSF is drained out of the brainto help control the pressure inside the skull.Pressure changes may be quickly seenand treated. VENTILATOR : A machine used to help the patient breathe. V entilators may breathe for the patientor they may be used to give extra breaths.When extra breaths are given the patient'sblood vessels in the brain become smaller andthis helps control the intracranial pressure. SURGERY : There are three types of surgery used with brain injury: Craniotomy - The skull is opened to relieve the causes of increased pressure inside theskull. Causes may be fractured bones,blood clots, or swollen brain tissue. Burr holes - A small opening is made into the skull to remove blood clots. Bone flap removal - A piece of bone is removed from the skull to relieve pressurecaused by swollen brain tissue. HOW ARE BRAIN INJURIES TREATED ?

It is not unusual forpeople with brain injuries to get infections.They may get pneumonia, bladder infections,blood infections, or infections in the brain orcerebrospinal fluid called meningitis. CHEST PT AND SUCTIONING : If the patient has pneumonia you may seestaff using a vibrating machine or clappingon the patient's chest. This loosens thephlegm in the lungs. Then the patient will beasked to cough. If the patient is not able tocough up the phlegm they must be suctioned.When a patient is suctioned a catheter isplaced in the back of the throat or into thelungs. TRACHEOSTOMY (TRACH): If the patient has a large amount of lungsecretions or is on a ventilator for a long timethey may need a trach. A trach is a tubeplaced in the trachea (windpipe). It will makeit easier for the patient to cough up phlegm. Italso allows the nurse to suction the lungs. Initially patients will be unable to talk while the trach is in place. A trach is not usuallypermanent. As the patient improves, theymay be able to have the trach taken out. SUCTIONING OF THE STOMACH : Sometimes after brain injury , the stomach willstop working for a short time. This is calledan ileus. Even though the stomach may notbe working it continues to make acids. Theacids may damage the stomach lining andcause stomach ulcers if they are not removed.A nasogastric tube (NG) will be placed through the nose into the stomach. This tube will beused to help remove stomach secretions.Medications may also be given to help preventstomach ulcers. NUTRITION : Meeting nutrition and fluid needs are impor-tant after brain injury . Patients may be lessactive, yet have very high nutritional needs. Atfirst, nutrition can be supplied by an IV . Whenthe stomach starts working an evaluation ofchewing and swallowing safety will be com-pleted. If the patient is too sleepy to eat, or isunable to swallow, a small nasogastric feedingtube may be used for nutrition. The tube isplaced through the nose into the stomach.Liquid formula will be given through thefeeding tube. Feedings may be given continu-ously or several times a day . The dietician willassist with food and fluid selection. Milk-shakes and liquid formulas may also be usedto provide extra calories and high proteinnutrition. BOWEL AND BLADDER CARE: Patients may not have control of their bowel orbladder. Catheters or diapers will be used untilbowel and bladder control returns. SKIN CARE: Activities such as turning, padding equipment,keeping skin clean and dry , using specialmattresses, and making sure the patient getsenough calories help prevent bedsores. RANGE OF MOTION (ROM) AND SPLINTS : Brain injured patients may not move theirjoints as much as needed. This can cause tightmuscles and joints called contractures. Rangeof motion (ROM) exercises and special splintsfor hands and feet help prevent contractures. PAIN CONTROL : Comfort measures and medication will be usedfor pain control, however, medications may belimited to types that do not cause drowsiness.WHAT OTHER TREATMENTS MAY BE USED? PAGE 11 WHAT EQUIPMENT WILL YOU SEE WHEN YOU VISIT? MONITOR SCREEN : A machine used to keep track of heart rate, breathing, blood pressure,and intracranial pressure. HEAD DRESSING : A bandage around the head used to keep the wound or incision cleanand dry . ICP M ONITOR : A small tube placed into or just on top of the brain through a small holein the skull. This will measure the amount ofpressure inside the brain (intracranial pres-sure). NASOGASTRIC TUBE: A tube placed through the nose into the stomach that can be used tosuction the stomach or provide liquid for-mula directly into the stomach. ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE: A tube inserted through the patient's nose or mouth into the trachea(windpipe) to help with breathing andsuctioning. EKG L EADWIRES : Wires connected to the chestwith small patches that measure the heart rate and rhythm. INTRAVENOUS CATHETER (IV) AND INTRAVENOUS FLUID: A flexible catheter which allows fluid, nutrients, and medicine to be given directlyinto a vein. VENTILATOR : A machine used in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit that may assist withbreathing or breathes completely for a patient. ANTI-EMBOLISM STOCKINGS (FREQUENTLY CALLED TEDS): Long white stockings used to help prevent blood clots in the legs. SEQUENTIAL COMPRESSION STOCKING (FREQUENTLY CALLED KENDALLS ): Plastic leg wraps that help prevent pooling of blood in the legs by inflatingand deflating around the legs. FOLEY CATHETER : A tube inserted into the bladder to drain and allow for accurate mea-surement of urine. INTRODUCTION When the patient is seenin the emergency roomthe doctor will decidewhich treatments to use. Avariety of equipment willbe needed. It is helpful toknow the purpose ofequipment used.

The Rancho Scale is used more often by health care providers to indicatelevels of recovery. The Glascow Coma Scale rates eye opening, motormovement (movement of the arms and legs), and verbal response. EYE OPENING 4 = Spontaneously 3 = T o voice2 = T o pain1 = No response Rehabilitation centers may use a scale called the Rancho Levels. The eight level scale wasdeveloped by the professional staff of theRancho Los Amigos Hospital in Downey ,California to describe the stages of recoveryafter brain injury . What follows is a simpli-fied explanation of each level of recovery . Remember, the patient never fits neatly into one level of the scale, but rather into ageneral area, exhibiting characteristics ofseveral levels. Also be aware that individualpatients progress through the levels atdifferent speeds, some skipping levels,others \"getting stuck\" for a while. The following is a brief description of the Ranchos Los Amigos Scale of CognitiveFunctioning: LEVEL 1 - No response. The patient appears to be in a very deep sleep or coma and doesnot respond to voices, sounds, light, ortouch.BEST MOTOR RESPONSE 6 = Follows commands5 = Localizes to pain4 = Withdrawal to pain3 = Decorticate2 = Decerebrate1 = No ResponseBEST VERBAL RESPONSE 5 = Oriented and converses4 = Disoriented and converses3 = Inappropriate words2 = Incomprehensible sounds1 = No responseGLASCOW COMA SCALE RANCHOS LOS AMIGOS SCALE LEVEL 2 - Generalized response. The patient moves around, but movement does not seem tohave a purpose or consistency . Patients mayopen their eyes but do not seem to focus onanything in particular. LEVEL 3 - Localized response. Patients begin to move their eyes and look at specific people andobjects. They turn their heads in the directionof loud voice or noise. Patients at Level 3 mayfollow a simple command, such as \"Squeezemy hand.\" LEVEL 4 - Confused and agitated. The patient is very confused and agitated about where he orshe is and what is happening in the surround-ings. At the slightest provocation, the patientmay become very restless, aggressive, orverbally abusive. The patient may enter intoincoherent conversation. LEVEL 5 - Confused, inappropriate but not agitated. The patient is confused and does notmake sense in conversations but may be able tofollow simple directions. Stressful situationsmay provoke some upset, but agitation is noPAGE 13longer a major problem. Patients may experi- ence some frustration as elements of memoryreturn. LEVEL 6 - Confused but appropriate. The patient's speech makes sense, and he or she isable to do simple things such as gettingdressed, eating, and teeth brushing. Althoughpatients know how to perform a specificactivity , they need help in discerning when tostart and stop. Learning new things may alsobe difficult. LEVEL 7 - Automatic, appropriate. Patients can perform all self-care activities and are usuallycoherent. They have difficulty rememberingrecent events and discussions. Rational judg-ments, calculations, and solving multi-stepproblems present difficulties, yet patients maynot seem to realize this. LEVEL 8 - Purposeful and appropriate. At this level, patients are independent and can processnew information. They remember distant andrecent events and can figure out complex andsimple problems. For a more detailed explanation of the 8 levels of the scale and effective interventions, read the article\"AAC and TBI: T ransitioning Systems Dana Scroggs, MHS, CCC-SLP , at the Charlotte (N.C.) Institute of Rehabilita-tion, at (704) 355-7119. The web site address for thearticle is www.kaddath.mt.cs.cmu.edu Coma is an unresponsive state so the patient is not able to open his eyes. Coma may serve as amechanism for the brain to preserve itselfduring times of extreme stress, such as follow-ing an injury . It is important that familiesknow the rehabilitation process can beginwhile the patient is still in a coma. The impor-tance of early intervention is supported byrecent studies. The length of time that a personis in a coma, does not necessarily determine thedegree of recovery . Health care professionals use a variety of therapeutic techniques and programs to movepatients from a state of unconsciousness(coma) toward a greater awareness of theirenvironment. Many of the programs are basedon the theory that intense stimulation of thesenses will excite the brain's reticular activatingsystem, which is responsible for arousal andwakefulness. Scientists report that the brain isfairly plastic and has the ability to modify itsown structural organization and function, although the actual mechanisms that cause thisto occur are not yet fully understood. Manybelieve that environmental enrichment andsensory stimulation can accelerate the recoveryprocess. Sensory stimulation should focus onverbal conversation, familiar objects andmemories, such as personal blankets, record-ings of favorite music, pets, and posters. Someresearchers recommend vigorous stimulation ofthe senses, using, for example, ringing alarmclocks, rubbing the skin, pleasant and unpleas-ant flavors and smells put on the tongue orheld to the nose, or bright lights flashed in frontof the eyes. The sensory stimulation programsare also careful to modulate the amount ofstimulation given to the patient and are work-ing to develop precise, structured regimens toavoid random stimulation and overstimulation. We have listed, in the appendix to this guide, several sources of information related to comaand coma stimulation and how you mayhelp the therapists with your loved one'srehabilitation. Using information from the Rancho Scale, the health care team can begin treatment that willhelp develop skills and promote appropriatebehavior. Health care professionals oftensuggest the following simple measures tofamily and friends while the patient is still in coma: Always talk as if the patient hears when you are nearby. Speak directly to the patient about simple things and reassure him or her frequently. Explain events and noises in the sur- rounding area. Tell the patient what hashappened and where he or she is. Touch and stroke the patient gently. Tell the patient who you are each time youapproach the bedside. Hold his or herhand. Play favorite music for the patient or tape a soothing message that can be playedwhen you are away from the bedside. For parents of young children, tape yourself singing or reading your child's favorite stories.PAGE 14 A. T HE EFFECTS OF A STROKE Because strokes can occur on either side of the brain, it is important to understand theuniquely different symptoms they cause. Thelocation of the stroke determines which side ofthe body will be affected. A stroke on the leftside of the brain causes right-sided paralysis(hemiplegia) or weakness, while damage tothe right side of the brain causes left-sidedparalysis or weakness. Some strokes may produce mild, or only temporary effects. Other strokes can producepermanent damage. The effects of a strokedepend upon which area of the brain has beendamaged, which brain cells were damaged,how much damage has occurred, how easilyand quickly the body repairs the blood supplysystem to the brain, and how quickly otherareas of the brain can take over the work of thedamaged brain cells. Some of the effects ofstroke are global, that is, they can occurwhether the stroke is on the right or left side ofthe body . Other effects are unique, dependingupon the area of the brain that is damaged. GLOBAL EFFECTS Memory is commonly affected following astroke regardless of which side is affected.Because memory is comprised of many variedcomponents, patients may experience differenttypes of memory impairment. Attention andconcentration skills may also be reduced alongwith reasoning and judgment. Reading mayBecause the brain is the center of operations for the body, an injury can affect many different areas. Some ef fects will be short-term, some may lastlonger, and some may be permanent. Some effects may appear suddenlyand disappear just as fast; others may take a long time to come on and an equally long time to overcome.THE EFFECTS OF A BRAIN INJURY pose some problem for individuals sustaining a left or right stroke; others may experiencetrouble writing due to motor weakness,paralysis, or poor coordination. Depression is a common reaction to illness or injury and should be considered normal aftera stroke, if it doesn't last for a prolongedperiod of time. Some depression may becaused by chemical changes associated withthe injury to the brain. Emotional changes are also common. An individual may cry easily and then beginlaughing for no apparent reason or may bemore irritable and more easily frustratedthan before the stroke. A person's bowel and bladder functioning may also be affected following a left or rightstroke. Many management techniques can beused to improve function. THE EFFECTS OF A LEFT STROKE The most apparent physical consequence of astroke on the left side of the brain is right-sided paralysis (hemiplegia). The weaknessor paralysis more often occurs to the handand arm rather than the leg. For some indi-viduals, the hemiplegia can prevent themfrom moving the affected limb, while othersmay experience only a mild weakness. Thismay cause difficulty standing, walking,dressing, bathing, and eating. NOTICE: The purpose of the following information is to review certain medical issues.

There may be difficulty in bothspeaking and understanding. In some cases,the muscles in the face, neck, mouth, and throatalso become weakened or paralyzed causingslow, labored slurred speech and an abnormalvocal quality . Other consequences of a left stroke are diffi- culty swallowing or inability to swallow(dysphagia) and vision problems such asdouble vision or a partial blindness affectingonly half the field of vision in each eye. Anindividual's behavior may also become slow, orappear hesitant when solving problems. THE EFFECTS OF A RIGHT STROKE A stroke on the right side of the brain maycause paralysis or weakness on the left side ofthe body . A person who has suffered a rightstroke may display some degree of muscleweakness and dysphagia, vision deficits,memory , attention and concentration deficits.However, they frequently have adequatecommunication abilities. Persons who suffer right strokes often havedifficulty judging distance, size, position, rateof movement, form and how parts are relatedto wholes. One-sided neglect, that is, ignoring a weak or paralyzed body part may also develop with aright side stroke. Individuals with one-sidedneglect may not even recognize that a bodypart is theirs. Right strokes can also cause an individual to have problems understanding body language.A patient may not be able to interpret informa-tion from tone of voice, body movements, orfacial expressions. While persons with left strokes are slow and cautious, persons with right strokes tend to beimpulsive and quick when completing activi-ties. They are often unaware of their deficitsand are unrealistic about their abilities. Someindividuals may try to complete activities theycannot perform safely . RIGHT STROKE Weak or paralyzedleft side Neglect of weak or paralyzed body part Difficulty judging distance, size,position, form,and rate ofmovement Poor judgment and reasoning Memory, attention, and concentration deficits Behavior: quick and impulsiveLEFT STROKE Paralyzed or weakright side Speech-language deficits and/orswallowingdisorders Memory, attention, and concentrationdeficits Poor judgment and reasoning Behavior: slow, hesitant,disorganizedPAGE 16B. M EDICAL AND RELATED PHYSICAL EFFECTS OF A TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY Many potential deficits are noted in the follow- ing 4 sections. But as you read through, remem-ber that only some may apply to your familymember. As noted earlier, each person with abrain injury has had a unique injury and willexperience a unique recovery process. PROBLEMS WITH NUTRITION AND EATING Physical and cognitive changes such as dimin-ished attention, poor hand coordination, anddifficulty in swallowing, can disrupt normaleating habits. Proper nutrition is essential tohealing, however, so evaluations can be per-formed to determine the best means for apatient to maintain adequate nutrition. Retrain-ing efforts through nursing, occupationaltherapy , and speech therapy can help a personrecover eating abilities. Dysphagia is the term that described swallowing disorders. A swallowing disordercan occur at various points along the food'spathway to the stomach. It is important torecognize that placing food into someone'smouth and having it disappear withoutoutward signs of choking does not assure thatthe food has been swallowed safely . In asignificant number of patients, particularly ifthey are just emerging from coma or showconfusion, food can enter the trachea (wind-pipe) and proceed to the lungs, where it cancause pneumonia to develop. A speech/language pathologist conducts an evaluation to determine a person's level ofsafety in swallowing. This evaluation can beenhanced with a special x-ray study , called avideo fluoroscopic swallowing study , which can help assess under what conditions swal-lowing may be safe and can offer direction forswallowing therapy . Evaluations and studiesalso will indicate if a feeding tube is necessary . Many people are able to eat only under certain conditions. For example, they may toleratesmall amounts of a selected food consistency (asoft diet, for example) in a carefully controlledtherapy setting but may be at significant risk iffed under even slightly different conditions.Such patients may require tube feedings tomaintain or supplement adequate nutrition.The feeding tube will maintain proper nutrition until a patient is able to swallow properlyagain. Several feeding tubes are common: thenasogastric (NG) tube, which does not require a surgical procedure for use and is passedthrough the patient's nose and into the stom-ach; the jejunostomy (J) tube, which is surgi- cally inserted directly into the small intestine,and the gastrostomy (G) tube, which is inserted directly into the stomach. FEVER If fever occurs, blood and urine tests and x-raysmay be needed to help find the cause. Feversare most often caused by urinary tract infectionor pneumonia and these can be treated withantibiotics. FRACTURES Many people who sustain traumatic braininjury also sustain fractures. Rehabilitative carecan assist in recovery from effects of theseinjuries and orthopedic care can continue in therehabilitation setting. HETEROTOPIC OSSIFICATION Many patients with severe brain injury developbone in the soft tissue around their joints \u2014usually shoulders, elbows, knees, and hips.This formation, called heterotopic ossification , can cause pain and diminish the range ofmotion in the affected joints. Range of motiontherapy can help to alleviate the problem andmay be used in conjunction with medication. Inmore severe cases, surgery may be necessaryover the long term. HYDROCEPHALUS Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) acts to cushion and protect the brain and spinal cord from physicalimpact. CSF flows through a series of pathwaysaround the brain. The amount of CSF in the skull must be main- tained at a relatively constant volume for thebrain to function normally . Hydrocephalus is a condition in which the production of CSFexceeds its absorption and results in enlarge-ment of cerebral ventricles. Hydrocephalus canbe caused by abnormalities in production orreabsorption of CSF or by obstruction of thecirculation of the fluid.PAGE 17Hydrocephalus may be suspected if a person begins to deteriorate in mental or physicalfunctioning or suddenly develops incontinence (i.e., cannot control urination). CT scans andsometimes additional tests may be required toestablish the diagnosis. In some cases, a smallcatheter or shunt may be required to drainexcess fluid from the brain. INCONTINENCE OF BOWEL AND BLADDER The inability to control bowel and bladderfunctions is common to people recoveringfrom a brain injury . Many managementtechniques can be used to improve function.For example, laxatives and suppositories canhelp regulate the emptying of the bowel.Taking the person to the bathroom at sched-uled times (time voiding) and using cathetersand external collecting devices can improvebladder management. Both functions alsomay be improved by changes in diet. PROBLEMS OF INACTIVITY The long period of inactivity that may be partof recovering from a brain injury can causecertain physical problems. General decondi- tioning is the generally decreased strength and stamina that a person may experience as aresult of extended bed rest. Individual exerciseprograms can help restore lost muscle strengthand physical endurance. Skin problems such as pressure ulcers can develop after lying inone position for a long time. The best preven-tion is frequent inspection of the skin andshifting and repositioning. Blood clots, called deep vein thrombosis (DVT), may develop especially in the legs when patients havelimited mobility . Though the clots are notalways apparent, they may be accompanied bypain, warmth, and swelling. An additional riskis for a clot in the leg to break off and enter thelung (called a pulmonary embolus ). Anti- coagulant medications frequently are pre-scribed to manage these conditions. In somepatients who may not tolerate anti-coagulants,a filter is sometimes placed in a large vein toprevent clots from going to the lungs. SEIZURES Seizures are common complications in peoplewith traumatic brain injury . The symptoms of aseizure can range from generalized shakingand loss of consciousness, to a discrete episode of altered attention, emotion, sensation,or movement. Seizures are caused by an abnormal electrical discharge by brain cells. The risk of seizures isgreater with prolonged unconsciousness,depressed skull fracture, or intracranial hemor-rhage. Seizures can be subdivided into early(one to two weeks after injury), and late post-traumatic seizures. Patients with late seizuresare generally treated with anti-convulsantmedication for a period of years. Patientswithout late seizures, but at high risk, aresometimes treated with anti-convulsants forbriefer intervals. SENSORIMOTOR EFFECTS This term refers to the relationship betweenmovement and sensory perceptions. The braininterprets information sent by the senses, anddirects physical movement according to theneeds expressed by this information. Any ofseveral movement disorders can result if abrain injury interrupts the smooth operation ofthis process. Different types and levels of paralysis can affect different parts of the body and last forunpredictable periods of time. Hemiparesis is weakness on one side of the body; whenthis weakness is more severe, it is calledhemiplegia. Motor control in general can decrease because the injury has affected the way the brain directsthe muscles to move. This can result in com-plete or partial interruption of certain move-ments, uncontrollable spasms, and/or a gen-eral inability to control movements. Anothercommon deficit in motor controls is apraxia , the inability to carry out purposeful move-ments. For example, a person may have theability to lift an arm, but can only do it sponta-neously , not upon request. The instructionscannot be willfully communicated fromthe brain. A person's balance and coordination also may be affected by a brain injury . Balance dependsupon vision, hearing, and position senseinformation reaching the brain and beingPAGE 18properly analyzed there. Any interruption in these connections can disrupt balance. Poorcoordination can be caused by injury to thecerebellum or portions of the inner ear andtheir connections to the brain. Called ataxia , this condition can interfere with the perfor-mance of even the most basic movementsand tasks. PROBLEM WITH MUSCLE TONE AND RANGE OF MOTION Muscle tone is frequently abnormal after a brain injury . Sometimes muscle tenseness mayincrease with movement. This is called spastic- ity. These changes in muscle tone can be painful and can lead to decreased range ofmovement and abnormal posture. Forexample, the arms may be held tightly acrossthe chest and the legs may be held in a straight,rigid position. Treatment for abnormal muscle tone includes exercises to normalize the tone, gain posturecontrol and improve flexibility. These mayinclude slow rocking, range-of-motion exer-cises, balance training, and serial casting (theapplication of casts to prevent deformity andgradually increase range of motion). Anti-spasticity medication, selected nerve blockinjections, and selected muscle injections mayalso be used. Orthopedic or neurosurgicalprocedures may be required in severe orchronic situations. DYSARTHRIA This term describes any of a variety of speechdifficulties caused by muscle weakness orparalysis. The problem could be located any-where in the mechanism of speech production:the muscles of the mouth, the passagewaybetween nose and mouth, the voice box(larynx), or the respiratory system. Dysarthriacauses slurred speech and an abnormalvoice quality . VISUAL DEFICITS Vision can be impaired in one eye, in both eyes,or on one side of the visual field (called visual field cut or hemianopsia ). Diplopia , or double vision, is also common after brain injury and isusually due to nerve damage. An eye patchoften relieves initial discomfort and impr ove-ment usually occurs over several months. If symptoms persist, prism lenses or eye musclesurgery may be considered. Vision therapy mayalso be considered. Often, people have visual-spatial difficulty that is not due to nerve damage. This is calledvisual perceptual deficit and is caused when the brain has difficulty interpreting what isseen. These problems include unilaterals neglect , in which a person neglects items located on one side or ignores one side of thebody , decreased depth perception, difficulty in perceiving how far away something is, anddiminished object recognition. OTHER PERCEPTUAL DEFICITS Because sensory information is processed in thebrain, any of the other senses of hearing, taste,smell, and touch may also be affected by abrain injury . The abilities to taste and smell areoften diminished and must be compensated for.Hearing itself or the quality of what is heard(auditory acuity ) may diminish. Certain sensitivities may be heightened, includingsensitivity to touch ( tactile defensiveness ) and to movement ( vestibular deficit ). Even the perception of one's own limbs, their connectionto the body and their relationship to the envi-ronment may be impaired ( proprioceptive disorder ). C. B EHAVIORAL EFFECTS OF A TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY Two of the most striking problems many people with brain injury experience are a lack of insight about their condition and denial about their condition. These problems canrange from complete denial of obviously severephysical impairments to underplaying theextent of cognitive deficits. As a result, patientsoften do not take their limitations into accountwhen planning future activities. Family mem-bers and rehabilitation staff need to have arealistic appraisal of the patient's strengths andweaknesses so they can provide guidance forplanning and problem solving.D. C OGNITIVE EFFECTS OF A TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY ATTENTION AND CONCENTRATION Patients in early recovery often can remain completely alert for only a brief period. Later, itmay be difficult for them to focus their atten-tion entirely or to stay with one project orconversation for a significant period withoutbecoming distracted. Patients can be distractedby their own emotions, thoughts, and physicalresponses or by any element in their environ-ment, such as voices, music, noises, or suddenchanges in the room. A related concern is aninability to turn one's attention from onesubject to the next. MEMORY Memory impairment, or amnesia , is common after traumatic brain injury . There can still beislands of preserved memory during post-traumatic amnesia, but during this time there isusually a limited attention span. Precise assess-ment of how much actual memory loss hasoccurred is difficult. Patients in a confused stateoften will not remember things because of theirseverely impaired attention, but they mayexhibit good memory function once theirattention improves. The duration of the periodof post-traumatic amnesia often indicatesinjury severity . Every person has different types of memory, and one aspect of memory can be affecteddifferently than another. Memory of things seen(visual memory) differs from memory of things heard (auditory memory) , and a strength in one area can be used in therapy to help im-prove functional memory. Short-term memory is the ability to recall things occurring within a few seconds to a day .Long-term memory is the ability to recall things occurring within a longer period ofweeks and months, and remote memory is the ability to recall events that occurred manyyears ago. Often, remote memory begins to return before short-term or long-term memory . Functionallyspeaking, it is the ongoing ability to make new,day-to-day memories that is important. Manypatients with severe memory difficulty canrecall events from years ago, but cannot re-member if they had breakfast that day .People who are confused or who misinterpret events and statements often may offer re-sponses that appear made up. This behavior isa condition called confabulation. The person is trying to respond as well as possible to astatement or a situation that may not make anysense and is calling upon different and oftenunrelated memories to create their response. It also is important to realize that a person may learn something new and remember it, but notremember the experience of learning it. Re-search has indicated that some people withbrain injury learn information or motor skillstaught in a therapy session even though theymay not remember the session itself. COMMUNICATION A brain injury can greatly diminish a person'sability to understand language and communi-cate thoughts in return. Language processingmay be impaired and, early in recovery , aperson may have little or no understanding ofwords. This can be followed by a period inwhich some words or commands are knownand not others, or some words may be knownat one time and not at another. Later in recov-ery , a patient may not understand complicatedstatements and may need to interpret a state-ment before responding. Aphasia is another type of communication problem in which a person can no longerconnect the correct word with a particularobject or find the words to express a particularthought. People who have difficulty under-standing have receptive aphasia ; those with difficulty saying/producing speech haveexpressive aphasia . Often, a person may experience both. A similar problem is paraphasia , in which the individual will substitute an incorrect wordthat may sound like the desired word or relateto its meaning in some way . People may be able to speak or write correctly , but it is either off the point entirely or becomesirrelevant as it moves further off the point. Thisis called tangential communication. Perseveration , when a person repeats a verbal or physical response inappropriately , isalso common. PAGE 19PAGE 20 WHO WILL HELP AFTER BRAIN INJURY ? Members of the health care team will work together with the patient, family, and friends during the hospital stay. Care will be centered onthe individual needs of the patient. Family and friends are importantmembers of the team. PATIENT : The patient is the most important member ofthe team. Care will be planned based onhow the patient responds to treatment. FAMILY AND FRIENDS : You provide emotional support to thepatient. Family and friends also provide thehealth care team with important facts aboutthe patient's past history and can help watchfor changes. Other team members will alsoteach you activities that you can do to helpwith the recovery process. The importanceof family and friends to a person's recoverycannot be over-emphasized. DOCTORS : Neur osurgery doctors are specialists that help determine the type of brain injury and itstreatment. They may perform surgery on thebrain. They will work with other doctors if thepatient is in intensive care or has injuries toother parts of the body. NURSES: Nurses check patient's vitals (temperature,blood pressure, heart and breathing rate) andwatch for changes in strength and thinking.T eam Members DOCTORS NURSESFAMILY AND FRIENDS PHYSICAL THERAPISTS OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS SOCIAL WORKERSDOCTORSPATIENT SPEECH PATHOLOGISTSNEURO PSYCHOLOGISTS DIETICIANS & OTHER STAFF NOTICE: This section of the document is copyrighted by the University of Iowa and Karen Stenger, R.N., M.A. The Virtual Hospital is a registered trademark of theUniversity of Iowa.

Please refer to it for the most up-to-date version ofthe document.PAGE 21They help with daily cares such as eating and bathing. Nurses also coordinate care among themembers of the health care team. SOCIAL WORKERS : Social workers provide emotional support tohelp the patient and family adjust to being inthe hospital. They coordinate discharge plan-ning, referral to community resources, anddeal with questions related to insurance ordisability . PHYSICAL THERAPISTS (PT): Physical therapists evaluate and treat weak-nesses in the patient's strength, flexibility ,balance, rolling, sitting, standing and walking.Treatment may include exercises or instructionin use of equipment such as walkers, canes, orwheelchairs. OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS (OT): Occupational therapists evaluate the patient'sability to perform dressing, bathing, homemak-ing and activities that require memory andorganization. They provide treatment orequipment needed for safe independent living. SPEECH PATHOLOGISTS : Speech therapists test and treat speech, lan-guage, thinking and swallowing problems. NEUROPSY CHOL OGISTS : Neuropsychologists test thinking, memory , judgment, emotions, behavior and personality .This information can be used to help guidetreatment. It will also help determine theamount of supervision that the patient needswhen they leave the hospital.DIETICIANS : Dieticians assess nutritional needs. They workwith the patient and other team members tohelp the patient meet their nutritional goals. RESPIRATORY THERAPISTS : Respiratory therapists assess the patient'srespiratory care, status, and treatment progress. Services provided include: oxygen therapy aerosol medication therapy ventilator management pulmonary diagnostic procedures In addition, respiratory therapists provide education to patients, family members, andhospital personnel and act as a resource to themedical staff for research and consultation. OTHERS: There are many other staff members that maywork with brain injured patients and family. These include: Clergy Activities Therapists Patient Representatives Child Life Therapists Music Therapists Vision Therapists V ocational RehabilitationPAGE 22 HOW WILL YOU REACT ? When a friend or family member is hospitalized, it is normal to have many emotional reactions. You may have these emotions at differenttimes. The emotions you may experience include: PANIC AND FEAR One of the first reactions you may have aftera family member suffers a brain injury ispanic and fear. Fears are intense becauseyou are worried the patient may not sur-vive. Until the patient becomes medicallystable, physical and emotional feelings ofpanic may continue. Some of your physicalsymptoms may be rapid breathing, inabilityto sleep, decreased appetite and upsetstomach. Some people may cryuncontrollably . SHOCK AND DENIAL You may feel that what is happening is notreal. Y ou may notice things going on aroundyou, but have trouble remembering infor-mation and conversations or meetings withothers. You may also have a hard timeunderstanding the seriousness of the injurythat has occurred. ANGER Many people feel angry that they or theirloved ones are in this situation. This may bejustified. You may be angry with the patientfor putting themselves in a situation wherethey could be hurt. You may also be angrywith family members, friends, or othersinvolved in the accident. You may be upsetwith the health care team for not doing orsaying what you think is right. This is anormal reaction and it is okay to havethese feelings.GUILT Guilt is a very normal reaction during thistime. Y ou may feel you could have donesomething to prevent the accident from hap-pening, even when this is far from true. Youmay also think about past events and personalexperiences with the patient that you wishcould have been different or better. If you arefeeling angry with the patient, you may alsofeel guilty about your anger. This too is anormal reaction. We encourage you to talkabout your feelings with someone close to youor a professional staff member . ISOLATION During this time you may feel distant fromothers. You may have a hard time relating toothers in this abnormal situation. Y ou maythink that others will not understand. Y ou mayalso think others are scared or disapprove ofyour feelings, and as a result isolate yourself.However, a crisis such as a brain injury is atime where it is helpful to accept comfort,support and assistance from others. HOPE As the patient begins to stabilize, anxiety aboutsurvival will be combined with hope of recov-ery . Medical complications and slow recoverymay increase anxiety . However, hope may bebrought about by the smallest changes.

Families canundergo many changes as their loved oneprogresses through recovery . During theinitial crisis period, there may have been notime to focus on anything other than theinjured relative's life and problems\u2014yet thehealth of each family member is important tothe overall health of the family . Parents,spouses, children, and siblings can all gothrough difficult reactions unique to theirrelationship to the injured person. If a familybalance is not restored that considers eachperson's needs, family members can experi-ence isolation, poor health, prolonged fear,and depression. Each family has its own style of expressing feelings, dividing chores, and solving prob-lems. All of this may change when a familymember acquires a serious disability , particu-larly a brain injury . It is common that inaddition to feeling sad about the lovedone's injury , family members feel a sense ofloss for how the family itself has beenaltered. Family members may relate differ-ently to one another and have differentdemands put on them. An especially painful change involved family roles. Families operate like a small organiza-tion, providing food, shelter , comfort, sup-port, and love. Different people in the familyorganization have different roles to play , andYou most likely will have gone through a tremendously dif ficult period marked by sadness, anxiety, fear, confusion, and frustration or anger. Abrain injury to one family member can be devastating to the family as awhole. And while the person who was injured is the actual patient, theentire family needs both support and information during this difficult adjustment period.FAMILY ISSUES : COPING WITH RECOVERY those roles go beyond just the prescribed definitions of mother and father, son anddaughter. For example, the roles can includewho listens to emotional problems, who sendsout the holiday cards, who takes care of thehouse repairs. If one family member becomesunavailable due to an injury , the entire systemusually changes. People naturally pitch in andhelp during a crisis, taking on new and addi-tional roles. There can be increased stress onfamily members as they do things they neverthought they would or could do. But once afamily member has a disability, pitching intemporarily usually leads to a permanent shiftin responsibilities. Often, people have emo-tional reactions to such permanent role changesthat include resistance, sadness, and even guiltat replacing a loved one in a particular func-tion. There are two essential elements forcoping with the shifts in roles: openly express- ing feelings and enlisting support. First, family members need to discuss the feelings they have about everything that hashappened. For example, they may feel sadnessand anger about the accident or illness itselfand similar feelings about the changes theevent has necessitated. Whatever the exactfeelings are\u2014there are no right and wrongones\u2014expressing them openly and directly isextremely important. Second, the family needs to rally whatever resources it can to deal with strong feelings and NOTICE: The purpose of the following information is to review certain medical issues.

The recovery process can be long and stressful. Family members need toassemble a support system of friends andrelatives that will help relieve the tension thatnaturally builds. Many times families don't want to ask for help. They don't want to impose on others or theyare embarrassed to be in a needy position.Some people may think, too, that if they mustask for help, then the situation must be veryserious. It is important to remember whenthese feelings arise that social support can bedrawn from many people and many types oforganizations. Extended family, neighbors, andmembers of your religious community oftenare waiting to be asked for help. In addition,support is available from institutions andcommunity groups through hospital staffmembers, psychologists, and establishedsupport groups. Every family will react differently to the crisis and will find its own means of coping. You are encouraged to use your intuition, participatefully in the rehab program, make suggestions,and ask questions. The more information you have about your family member's recovery , thebetter able you will be to handle the changesthat can arise during the process. The hope is that individuals who have experienced a brain injury or stroke will returnhome as independent as possible, with the helpof the people who love them. In this way ,families can be the most important part of thetreatment team, as they will often continue thecare of the recovering person at home. We'vecompiled the following list of suggestions foryou to consider. A. I NTERACTING WITH THE INJURED PERSON The personality changes that can accom- pany a brain injury or stroke may be moredifficult to cope with than any physicaldisability . If your family member behavesinappropriately , or in an unfamiliar way , itmay be the result of his or her injury . Y ouneed not feel embarrassed about behaviorthat naturally occurs during the recoveryprocess. Information may need to be presented to your injured family member as simply aspossible. Use straightforward language anddirect, uncomplicated gestures andexpressions. Your family member's emotional reactions may not be what you would normallyexpect. They may be heightened or they maybe absent. Often the types of reactionsdisplayed may be best explained by thenature of the injury and the stage ofrecovery at which your loved one may becurrently functioning. (See page 10 for theRancho Scale). A person recovering from a brain injury or stroke sometimes has little capacity to fullygrasp the extent of his or her deficits. Donot assume that your family member feelsas you would if you were in his or hersituation. Individuals are often unaware oftheir problems and are not depressed whenwe would expect them to be. The only wayto know how they feel is to ask them. Evenbehaviors such as laughing or crying do notnecessarily mean that the patient is happy orsad. Their behavior can be disconnectedfrom their feelings. As your family memberimproves, however, so does his or herinsight into losses or changes. This is thetime when he or she will most need yoursupport and the help of the team. People recovering from brain injury or stroke often have a diminished capacity for empa-thy . They are often incapable of seeing anypoint of view other than their own. Be awarethat your family member may not seem asmature as he or she once was, but respond-ing to him or her as one adult to another isstill important. Try to be objective about your family member's capabilities. Patients often denytheir disabilities and try to influence yourpoint of view about them. Y ou can makeyour assessments based on the informationthat you have.PAGE 25 Your family member will benefit from structure. Help him or her work throughproblems by providing input likely to lead inthe right direction. Your efforts may not always result in imme- diate improvement. You can feel discour-aged and even guilty as a result. It is impor-tant then, and at all times, to keep your senseof hope. While it is vital to remain realistic inyour goals, you do not need to give up onfuture possibilities. B. G ENERAL GOALS Take care of yourself and your family \u2014 not just your injured relative. It will not help himor her if you become exhausted. Do not beconcerned that asking staff members for helpfor yourself will limit our attention to yourrelative. Pace yourself. This process can be a long one. Do not expend all of your energy in theearly stages because you will need it in themonths ahead. Remember that dealing with a brain injury or stroke is difficult and no one has all theanswers. Common sense, however, willcarry you a long way . Counseling can alsohelp and can be found through your reli-gious institution or through psychologists,psychiatrists, and social workers. Participate in your family member's reha- bilitation program to gain a better under-standing of the processes and effects of abrain injury or stroke. Write important info down in a journal or notebook. Keep records and info together ina file for easy reference. Remember that every person is unique and so an injury to the brain will have uniqueeffects. T ry not to compare your familymember's progress to that of others in the rehabilitation program. The treatment teamindividualizes the care for each person, soyour family member is receiving the mostappropriate treatment. One therapist recom-mended, 'Don't look back one day andcompare your loved one's accomplishments;look back one week and you will really see adifference.' Acknowledge all of your feelings. You may not understand why you feel as you do atcertain times, but it is important to recognizeeven those that seem odd or unreasonable.Sharing them with other relatives andfriends may also provide some relief; theymay be feeling the same way . Holding a family get-together, particularly one with dependent children, can be verydifficult. Try to appraise the situation ashonestly as possible. If you are under stress,turn to professionals for help. Try to maintain your normal contacts. Stay in touch with relatives and friends and makeplans to do recreational activities outside ofthe hospital. Such outings will help to keepyou connected to the community. Maintain a sense of humor. A sense of humor has a healing influence. Once a patient'scondition stabilizes and improves, familymembers find their ability to laugh returns.They find that laughter helps them as well asthe patient. Every person in coma will react in a unique way . Some persons with a coma experiencecomplete recovery and others do not. Al-ways be hopeful that your loved one willcome out of their coma. Join a brain injury support group. Contact the Brain Injury Association of DE at1-800-411-0505 for dates and locations.PAGE 26 HOW CAN YOU HELP WITH RECOVERY ? The family and friends of a person with a brain injury are important members of the team. Friends of those with brain injuries may find ituncomfortable to visit when the patient is confused or agitated.Honest explanations from family members may help them continueto offer the attention and support that is so helpful to patients.Sharing this guide is another way to help them understand. Thefollowing is a list of suggestions that correspond with the stages ofrecovery. UNRESPONSIVE STAGE At this stage the patient appears to be in adeep sleep and does not respond to theirsurroundings. The goal is to obtain a re-sponse from various senses (hearing, smell,sight, touch). When speaking to the patient assume they understand what you are saying.Speak in a comforting, positive andfamiliar way . Speak clearly and slowly about familiar people and memories. When visitors are present, focus on the patient. Keep the number of visitors to 1 or2 people at a time. Visits should be short.Other distractions (TV , radio) should beturned off when visiting. Provide the patient with pictures and personal items that are comforting andfamiliar to them (use poster/bulletinboard). The nurses and therapists may encourage you to assist in care of the patient. Thisincludes: grooming, hair care, shaving, applying skin lotion, gently stretching andpositioning patient's arms and legs. If youdon't feel comfortable with these activities,that is okay. The staff will understand. EARLY RESPONSES At this stage the patient is beginning to re-spond to people and hospital surroundings.The responses may range from turning towarda familiar voice to moving an arm or leg at thestaff's request. The goal is to increase theconsistency of responses. There may be a delayed response time when asking the patient to move, speak, or payattention. Always wait 1-2 minutes for therequested response. Repeat your requestonly a couple of times during this timeperiod. Be aware that the patient's attention span may only be 5-10 minutes before fatigue andfrustration set in. Allow for rest periods. T urn off the TV , music, and lights, and limit visitors. Thepatient can become stressed by too muchnoise, light or stimulation.

AGITATED AND CONFUSED RESPONSES During this stage, things are confusing. Thepatient may begin to remember past events butmay be unsure of surroundings and the reasonfor hospitalization. The goal is to help thepatient become oriented and to continue totreat their physical needs. Provide one activity at a time and expect the patient to pay attention for only shortperiods. Keeping the noise level low helpsthe patient focus. The patient may repeat a word, phrase, or activity over and over. T ry to interest thepatient in a different activity . Socially unacceptable behavior may occur at this level. This is common. Calmly tell thepatient the behavior is not appropriate. Provide visual as well as verbal information about the patient's surroundings to assistwith orientation. Remembering informationfrom one time to another is difficult. It maybe helpful to provide cues for the patientsuch as: - A calendar with the days marked off- A sign in the room telling them where they are - Post a schedule with meal times, therapies, and special appointments Allow the patient to move about with supervision to decrease frustration. HIGHER LEVEL RESPONSES At this stage patients are able to take part intheir daily routine with help for problemsolving, making judgments, and decisions.Most of the suggestions from the previousstage continue to apply here. The goal is todecrease the amount of supervision neededand increase independence. Here are a fewadditional suggestions for this stage. Assist with making the environment safe. Safety decisions may still be difficult for thepatient to make. Discuss with the patient decisions that he or she makes. Provide praise for safe decisionsand a calm explanation for unsafe decisions.Learning is still difficult. Encourage the use of a memory and date book to help with appointments anddaily routines. Encourage brief rest periods because the patient will continue to need more rest. Check with the health care team on activities that may be completed with or withoutsupervision. These activities may includework or school re-entry, taking medications,driving, or managing money .PAGE 28 Reprinted with permission from The Brain Injury Assn., Inc. website at www .bia.orgTREATMENT AND REHABILITATION MODELS OF REHABILITATION In the past, rehabilitation services for people with brain injury were largely provided in a\"medical model,\" located in a medicalfacility with a cadre of physicians, nurses,and trained professionals providing ser-vices. While this model still predominates,the trend today is toward more community-based rehabilitation models, and moreoptions are available than ever before.Rehabilitation service delivery and fundingare changing rapidly as managed carecontinues to replace the traditional fee-for-service and indemnity insurance plans. MEDICALLY BASED REHABILITATION : Early intervention is crucial. Rehabilita-tion should ideally start in the Intensive Care Unit. At this point, rehabilitation is generallypreventive in nature. Range of motion,bowel and bladder hygiene (i.e. initiation ofregular bowel program and removingindwelling catheters), prevention of pressuresores, and orientation are all very important,right from the beginning. Frequently , reha-bilitation activities initiated in the ICU canreduce complications and sometimes, thelength of hospitalization. Acute Rehabilitation: Once a person is medically stable, transfer to an acute reha-bilitation facility often occurs. There, he orshe will spend several hours a day in astructured rehabilitation program. Thisprogram usually includes a team of profes- WHAT IS THE REHABILITATION PROCESS ? 1. The goal of rehabilitation is to help people regain the most independent level of functioning possible. 2. The rehabilitation process is different for everyone. Rehabilitation programs should be individualized, catering to each person's unique needs. Just as notwo people are exactly alike, no two brain injuries are exactly alike. Theperson with a brain injury and his or her family should always be the mostimportant members of the treatment team. Cultural, religious, social andeconomic backgrounds must always be taken into consideration when plan-ning a person's rehabilitation program. 3. Rehabilitation channels the body's natural healing abilities and the brain's relearning processes so that an individual recovers as quickly and effi-ciently as possible. Rehabilitation also involves learning new ways tocompensate for abilities that have permanently changed due to brain injury .There is much that is still unknown about the brain and brain injury reha-bilitation. Treatment methods and technology are rapidly advancing asknowledge of the brain and it's functions increases.PAGE 29sionals with training and experience in brain injury rehabilitation. Additional staff sup-port the brain injury rehabilitation team'sefforts, and often includes respiratorytherapy , pharmacy, lab, nuclear medicineand and even housekeeping,dietary central supply . \"Subacute\" Rehabilitation: People who are minimally aroused for a prolonged periodoften have limited attention and stamina,and need a less intensive level of rehabilita-tion services, over a longer period of time.Subacute rehabilitation may be provided in avariety of settings, but is often in a skillednursing facility or nursing home. It is impor-tant to note that the services provided bysubacute programs vary widely , as there isno generally accepted definition of subacuteservices at this time. It is important to recognize that \"more therapy\" does not make a person \"better\",but that \"appropriate\" therapy does. Sub-acute rehabilitation programs require thesame appropriately trained professionals asacute rehabilitation programs do. The goalsof sub-acute rehabilitation should includeminimizing morbidity , maintaining func-tional positioning, hygiene, nutrition, andmedication management, as well as provid-ing support for the person with a braininjury and his or her family . Sub-acuterehabilitation programs may also be de-signed for persons who have made progressin the acute rehabilitation setting and are stillprogressing, but are not making rapidfunctional gains. Day T reatment/Day Rehab: Day r ehab (sometimes called \"Day Hospital\") providesintensive rehabilitation in a structuredsetting during the day and allows the personwith a brain injury to return home to theirfamily at night. The treatment team is oftenmade up of a variety of trained rehabilitationprofessionals.COMMUNITY -BASED REHABILITATION Out-patient Facilities: Following acute rehabilitation or sub-acute rehabilitation, aperson with a brain injury may continue toreceive outpatient treatment in specific areas(i.e. ongoing speech pathology to continue towork on language and cognition, oroccupational therapy to work on daily livingskills, etc.). Often, this treatment can also beprovided in the home by a home-healthagency . Home-based Rehabilitation: There are a few rehabilitation companies which focus onproviding acute rehabilitation within thehome, or community setting. Once medicallystable, some persons with a brain injury maybe able to participate in such a program, ifthere is such a program in their community . Community Re-entry: Community re-entry programs generally focus on developinghigher level motor and cognitive skills inorder to prepare the person with a braininjury to return to independent living andpotentially to work. Treatment may focus onsafety in the community , interacting withothers, initiation and goal setting and moneymanagement skills. Vocational evaluationand training may also be a component of thistype of program. Community Re-entryprograms generally run for part or all of theday , with participants returning home tosleep and be with their families. Independent Living Programs: Independent Living programs provide housing for per-sons with brain injury , with the goal ofregaining the ability to live as independentlyas possible. Usually, independent livingprograms will have several different levels,for people requiring more assistance, tothose who are living independently andbeing monitored. In addition to physical,occupational, speech and recreation thera-pists, these programs usually have life skillstechnicians, who assist the person with abrain injury towards independence.PAGE 30 FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE The following resources may offer assistance: Brain injury is a long term illness that continues long after hospital discharge. As a result, financial planning for short and long term care needs to begin immediately.Health insurance can pay for a few days in the hospital but funding needs to beidentified for services after discharge. Social Security Disability or Medicaid maypay for some of the services needed. Most people have not planned ahead and willneed to find sources of \"hidden funding.\" ON ADMISSION, families should begin to take these steps: Establish open communication with hospital staff, the social worker, financial aid office, discharge planner and make appointments to seek their help in finding\"Hidden Funding.\" Call the Claims Supervisor of their health insurance provider and ask their doctor's office claims managers to help. Do not take \"no\" for an answer. Ask why, and consider appealing decisions. Call state agencies for assistance. Contact organizat ions that family, friends or co-workers belong to for help. Keep track of ALL contacts, recording the date, time, name of person and conversation or agreements. Ask a rehabilitation facility to evaluate the consumer for admission.

Every 5 minutes someone dies from a head injury: 140,000 people each year. 75,000 - 100,000 in the U.S. Over half of the deaths occur at the time of the incident or within twohours of hospitalization. Every 5 minutes someone becomes permanently disabled due to a headinjury . 70,000 - 90,000 of those who survive will have lifelong disabilities. 2,000 more will live in a persistent vegetative state. Over 50% of those who sustain a Brain Injury have been intoxicated at the timeof injury. The cost of T raumatic BrainInjuries in the U.S. is over $48 Billioneach year! CAUSES 51% - Motor V ehicle Accidents 21% - Falls 12% - Assaults and Violence 10% - Sports and Recreation 6% - Other SURVIVORS A survivor of severe brain injury faces 5 to 10 years of intensive services andrehabilitation. The costs of a severe brain injury often exceed 4 million dollars. A majority of head injury survivors are under the age of 30. 2/3 of those who survive will live a normal life span, but will require lifelong services such as vocational rehabili-tation and physical therapy .INJURY A person does not need to be knocked out or lose consciousness to have sustained atraumatic brain injury . A person does not need to strike their head to sustain traumatic brain injury . (eg.,whiplash, shaken baby syndrome.) Even mild traumatic brain injuries can cause cognitive impairments serious enough toimpact a person's ability to enjoy life and tobe able to work and earn a living. People who sustain a brain injury are 3 times as likely to sustain a (second) braininjury . Those who sustain a second brain injury are 8 times as likely to sustain a (third) braininjury . BICYCLING About 75% of all bicyclists who die each year die of head injuries. 85% of head injuries in bicycle accidents can be prevented by wearing a helmet. DEMOGRAPHICS Males between the ages of 14 and 24 have the highest rate of injury . Males are almost twice as likely to suffer serious brain injuries than females. Brain Injuries kill more Americans under the age of 34 than all other diseasescombined. CHILDREN Child abuse is the cause of 64% of all infant head injuries. Approximately 1 in 500 school-age children each year receive a head injury severeenough to be hospitalized. 1 million children sustain a head injury each year . 165,000 children will be hospitalized due to a head injury . 1 in 10 of those children hospitalized will suffer moderate to severe impairments. Traumatic brain injury is the leading cause of death for children and young adults.REGIONAL COMA AND BRAIN INJURY REHABILITATION PROGRAMS DELAWARE Christiana Care System, Center for Rehabilitation at Wilmington HospitalWilmington Admissions Information: Usually take Rancho Scale Level 4 and aboveNo Coma Stimulation Program Call 302-428-6600 St. Francis Hospital Rehabilitation Center Wilmington Admissions Information: Usually take Rancho Scale Level 5 and aboveNo Coma Stimulation Program Call: 302-421-4541 Milford Hospital Rehabilitation Program MilfordAdmissions Information: Usually take Rancho 5 and above andevaluate on individual basis Call 302-424-5962 or 5971 PENNSYLVANIA Bryn Mawr RehabilitationMalvern Admissions Information: Usually take Rancho Scale Level 2 and above Call 610-251-5411 Moss Rehabilitation Hospital Philadelphia Admissions Information: Usually take Rancho Scale Level 1 and aboveComa Stimulation Program Call 215-456-9700Magee Rehabilitation Hospita l Philadelphia Admissions Information: Usually take Rancho Scale Level 1 and aboveComa Stimulation ProgramSpecialized Spinal Cord Injury ProgramNew Contract with Blue Cross/Blue Shieldof Call 800-96-MAGEE (62433) or 215-587-3157 NEW JERSEY Mediplex RehabilitationCherry Hill, New Jersey Admissions Information: Usually take Rancho Scale Level 1and aboveComa Stimulation Program on acase-by-case basisTake Rancho Scale Level above Call 609-342-7600 MARYLAND Bryn Mawr RehabilitationBaltimore Admissions Information: Usually take Rancho Scale Level 2 and aboveNo Coma Stimulation Program Call 410-225-8522 Kernan Rehab and Deaton Specialty RehabilitationBaltimoreAdmissions Information: Usually take Rancho Scale Level 1 and aboveComa Stimulation Program Call Kernan @ 410-328-8680 orDeaton @ 410-328-1513 PAGE 35PAGE 36 DELAWARE STATE GOVERNMENT RESOURCES STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION: SPECIAL EDUCATIONDirectorExceptional Children and Early Childhood Group Department of EducationP .O.
