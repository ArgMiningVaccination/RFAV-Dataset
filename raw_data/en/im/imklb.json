Contact Dr. Bridgett McIntosh, UT Extension Equine Specialist Email us at bmcintosh@utk.edu Statement/Non -Discrimination Statement http:// From the backyard pasture pet to the performance horse, vaccination programs are an important part of routine equine healthcare. While there is no \"standard\" vaccination program for all horses, the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) recommends Core Vaccinations and Risk-Based Vaccinations for horses. Core vaccinations are typically recommended for all horses while the use of risk -based vaccinations varies regionally and depends on the farm and/or the individual horse. Core Vaccines: Tetanus Eastern/Western Encephalomyelitis (EEE/WEE) Viral Arteritis (EVA) Rotaviral Diarrhea The AAEP guidelines are based on use in horses (including draft and pony breeds). There are limited data addressing the use of vaccines in other equine (ie. donkeys, mules and miniature horses). Those managing equine should consult a veterinarian to develop a vaccination program. Vaccination schedules vary depending on the risk of exposure and the type of vaccine. Most adult horses that have been previously vaccinated require annual re- vaccination of core vaccines, usually in the spring prior to insect vector season for protection against EEE, WEE and WNV.
