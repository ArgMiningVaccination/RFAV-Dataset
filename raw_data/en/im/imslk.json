This guide arms law enforcement professionals with the information needed to ensure consistency in their investigation of child abuse. Pertinent considerations and helpfulinvestigatory protocols are provided. Other useful materials include suggestions on working with physicians, responding to domestic disturbance calls, and placing children in protective custody. Supplemental readings and additional resources are cited. In protecting our children from criminal predators, law enforcement professionals are serving their communities and their Nation. We hope that this guide will aid in that worthy endeavor. Original Printing May 1997 Second Printing March 2001 NCJ 1624251hild abuse is a community problem. No single agency has the training, manpower, resources,or legal mandate to intervene effectively in child abuse cases. No one agency has the sole responsibility for dealingwith abused children. When a child is physically beaten or sexuallyabused, the ideal set of events is that doctors treat the injuries,therapists counsel the child, social services works with the family,police arrest the offender, and attorneys prosecute the case. To promote this response, effective community intervention involves the formationof a child protection team that includes professionals from medicine, criminal justice, social work, and education who understand and appreciate the differentroles, responsibilities, strengths, and weaknesses of the other team members but cooperate and coordinate their efforts. The skills of each person are viewed asdifferent but equally important. The role of law enforcement in child abuse cases is to investigate to determine if a violation of criminal lawoccurred, identify and apprehend the offender, and file appropriate criminal charges. The response of law enforcement to child abuse needs to be consistent. The intent of this guide is to provide officers who respond to this type of crime with information that will ensure this consistency. It is also to help law enforcementunderstand the importance of developing procedures and protocols and ways they can work with other professions to ensure that the needs of children are met.C2State-mandated reporting laws require a referral when there is a suspicion of abuse. In most child abuse cases, law enforcement becomes involved in oneof two ways: by a referral from a school, a physician, or an agency such as social services, or by a direct call for service froma parent, a child, or a neighbor. Because of increased reporting of child abuse, it is critical that police officers be trained to handle cases involving child maltreatment. Child abuse cases have unique characteristics that make them different from other types of cases. For a number of reasons, children make \"perfect\" victims, and crimes involving childabuse, particularly sexual abuse, are among the most difficult investigated by law enforcement: YChildren are usually unable to protect themselves because of their level of physical and mental development; frequently theydo not like to talk about the abuse. They may delay disclosure or tell only part of the story. YAn emotional bond often exists between the child and the offender; children may want the abuse to stop, but they may not want the offender to be punished. YCrimes of abuse are not usually isolated incidents; instead, they take place over a period of time, often with increasing severity. YIn most sexual abuse cases, there is no conclusive medical evidence that sexual abuse occurred. Moreover, it occurs ina private place with no witnesses to the event. YInterviews of children require special handling; legal issues governing child testimony are complicated and ever changing,and children\u2014whether victims or witnesses\u2014are often viewed as less credible or competent than the accused. YChild abuse cases often involve concurrent civil, criminal, and sometimes administrative investigations; they often cross jurisdictional lines. YThe criminal justice system was not designed to handle the special needs of children. Officers must be objective and proactive in their investigations of abuse. Questions concerning who, what, where, when, how, and why must be answered. It is important to remember that child abuse is a crime and law enforcement has a legal dutyand responsibility to respond accordingly.3Multidisciplinary Team Approach The most effective approach to cases involving child maltreatment is interagency coordination and planning. Social workers, physicians, therapists, prosecutors, judges,and police officers all have important roles to play. All must work together with a common concern\u2014the welfare of the child\u2014and with a common goal\u2014to communicate with mutualrespect. Differences of opinion are to be expected. Effective teamwork includes having a mechanism for discussing and, if possible, resolving these differences. All members of the child protection team have an obligation to appreciate what the other professionals on the team are seeking to accomplish and to understand how their activitiesinterrelate. For example, law enforcement officers need to be concerned that their investigation might traumatize a child, and physicians and therapists need to be concerned that theirtreatment and evaluation techniques might hinder or damage law enforcement's investigation. An ongoing discussion of problems that the team encounters during investigations willhelp resolve them and will also clarify the roles and responsibilities of team members. All players on the child protection team must have clearly defined roles in order to carry out their responsibilities effectively. YAn interagency protocol helps in establishing written guidelines for those who investigate cases of child abuse and neglect. YA properly drafted agreement also provides a blueprint for each of the principal agencies responsible for abuse cases in the community. The team members must also invest their time in developing a long-range strategic plan that will ensure the team is ever responsive to the needs and changes within the community. The goal should be efficient coordination of services, with the chief objectives being to determine what happened and to meet the needs of the child.4The following are essential elements of an effective interdisciplinary response team: YIdentification of the scope of the community problem. YIdentification of the resources available. YEstablishment of communication guidelines for each response team member and the victim's family. YEstablishment of clearly defined roles and responsibilities for each response team member. YEstablishment of clearly defined criteria for the types of cases with which the team will become involved. Establishing Law Enforcement Protocols and Procedures With their legal authority to investigate violations of the law, law enforcement officers are vital members of a community'schild protection team. Failure to respond properly to child abuse cases from the outset (e.g., failure of the responding law enforcement officer to obtain certain information) can result incases being dismissed in court or, in some cases, in innocent people being falsely accused. Investigators should be trained and experienced in objectively investigating child maltreatment, including conducting interviews of children and interrogating suspected offenders. Training should be viewed as an ongoing process, designed to increasethe competence of the interdisciplinary team. Moreover, local law enforcement departments must establish policies and procedures to investigate child abuse cases.Personnel investigating child abuse need to consider many important factors (see figure 1, \"Considerations for Child Abuse Investigations,\" pages 6 and 7). Established agency protocols, guidelines, and training will guide the decisionmaking process, but officers are likely to face situations in which the officer's judgment must be theguiding light. For this reason, officers must be familiar with what is expected of them legally in their jurisdiction. As necessary, they should consult the agency's legal advisor orthe prosecuting attorney to clarify this.5Speaking a Common Language Professional terminology is used by many disciplines. Members of the child protection team must be familiar with highly specialized technical terms (such as \"subdural hematoma,\"\"dissociation,\" \"battered child syndrome,\" and \"pedophilia\") as well as with basic or common terms (such as \"child,\" \"molestation,\" and \"rape\"). However, problems can arisebecause some terms do not have a universally accepted, consistent definition. It is important for clear communication and effective coordination that professional team membersunderstand what is meant when professional terminology (or jargon) is used by other team members and that they ask for clarification when they do not. The legal definition of a child varies from State to State and even from statute to statute in the same State. Issues such as whether the victim consented or whether the offender was a guardian or caretaker are important legal considerations in such cases. How the law determines consent is often confusing, even in the case of a 14-year-old boy who has been seduced by a 55-year-old pedophile. There is a difference between the legal definition of consent and the meaning given to it by lay people. To determine who is a child and what is abuse, law enforcement officers must turn to the law. The penal code will legally define both, but law enforcement officers must still deal with their own perceptions and opinions as well as with those of societyas a whole. For this reason, people working as part of an interdisciplinary task force must clearly communicate how they are defining aparticular term and establish common ground. Law enforcement investigators should always be aware of and communicate to others the legal definitions of terms. Law enforcement investigators must also be able to communicate with victims, offenders, and witnesses, as well as with social workers, physicians, mental health personnel, lawyers,judges, and peers. To avoid confusion and misunderstanding, investigators must be equally familiar with various family or slang terms for body parts and sexual acts when talking to victims, witnesses, and suspects. Investigators must know not only both the slang and professional terms, but also the appropriate times for using each.6Figure 1 Considerations for Child Abuse Investigations When You Receive the Referral YIdentify personal or professional biases with child abuse cases. Develop the ability to desensitize yourself to thoseissues and maintain an objective stance. YKnow department guidelines and State statutes. YKnow what resources are available in the community (therapy, victim compensation, etc.) and provide thisinformation to the child's family. YIntroduce yourself, your role, and the focus and objective of the investigation. YAssure that the best treatment will be provided for the protection of the child. YInterview the child alone, focusing on corroborative evidence. YDon't rule out the possibility of child abuse with a domestic dispute complaint; talk with the children at the scene. Getting Information for the Preliminary Report YInquire about the history of the abusive situation. Dates are important to set the timeline for when abuse may have occurred. YCover the elements of crime necessary for the report. Inquire about the instrument of abuse or other items on thescene. YDon't discount children's statements about who is abusing them, where and how the abuse is occurring, or what types of acts occurred. YSave opinions for the end of the report, and provide supportive facts. Highlight the atmosphere of disclosure and the mood and demeanor of participants in the complaint. Preserving the Crime Scene YTreat the scene as a crime scene (even if abuse has occurred in the past) and not as the site of a social problem.7Figure 1 continued YSecure the instrument of abuse or other corroborative evidence that the child identifies at the scene. YPhotograph the scene and, when appropriate, include any injuries to the child. Rephotograph injuries as needed tocapture any changes in appearance. Followup Investigation YBe supportive and optimistic to the child and the family. YArrange for a medical examination and transportation to the hospital. Collect items for a change of clothes if needed. YMake use of appropriate investigative techniques. YBe sure the child and family have been linked to support services or therapy. YBe sure the family know how to reach a detective to disclose further information. During the Court Phase YVisit the court with the child to familiarize him or her with the courtroom setting and atmosphere before the firsthearing. This role may be assumed by the prosecutor or,in some jurisdictions, by victim/witness services. YPrepare courtroom exhibits (pictures, displays, sketches) to support the child's testimony. YFile all evidence in accordance with State and court policy. YUnless they are suspects, update the family about the status and progress of the investigation and stay in touch with them throughout the court process. Depending on the case, officers should be cautious about the type and amount of information provided to the family, since they may share the information with others. YProvide court results and case closure information to the child and the family. YFollow up with the probation department for preparation of the presentence report and victim impact statement(s).8Working With the Medical Profession Physicians can be important allies in the prevention and treatment of child abuse. Doctors can serve as family counselors and educators, as influential child advocates, and as keymembers of the community multidisciplinary team. They can help to alleviate stress on a family by managing health problems, providing child-rearing advice, and discussingfamily planning alternatives. In cases of suspected child maltreatment, doctors have five basic responsibilities: YTo identify suspicious injuries. YTo diagnose problems of abuse. YTo administer treatment to the child. YTo report suspected incidents of abuse to the appropriate authorities. YTo testify in subsequent legal proceedings. Unfortunately, some physicians are reluctant to get involved in cases of abuse. For example, they may find few personal or professional rewards in dealing with an abusive family.They may not wish to report an incident because it may be impossible to determine who caused a child's injuries. Finally, they may not wish to testify in court because of time constraintsor because of a fear of cross-examination, interrogation, challenges to their credentials, or possible litigation. Law enforcement investigators can help counteract physicians' reluctance by fully involving members of the medical profession in the community's team approach to child abuse and by stressing the importance of medical evidence inpreparing a case for court. It may also be helpful to remind physicians that all 50 States and the District of Columbia have enacted legislation regarding immunity from civil or criminalliability for persons who, in good faith, make or participate in making a report of child abuse or neglect.9Obtaining a Medical Examination In most cases a medical assessment of the child needs to be performed as soon as possible. The primary purposes of the medical examination are to assess potential injury and identifythe need for treatment. Such an examination will also protect law enforcement against accusations that a child's injuries occurred after removal from the home. Whenever possible,all children suspected of having been abused should be given a medical examination, preferably by a medical professional experienced and trained in conducting forensic examinations.This is critical in cases in which sexual abuse is alleged. The medical professional should reassure the child, who may be fearful about the procedure and concerned about the physical and emotional consequences of the abuse. A secondary purpose of a medical examination is to determine the presence of any corroborating evidence of acute or chronictrauma. In recent years the ability and willingness of doctors to corroborate child abuse has improved greatly. Better training, the establishment of protocols, and technological advancementshave improved the ability of doctors to corroborate physical and sexual abuse in children. Medical imaging technology now available includes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),computed tomography (CT), and colposcopes (an instrument with magnification capabilities for visualizing the interior of a hollow organ, such as the vagina or rectum; pictures and videocan be taken with the colposcope to document the examination results). Law enforcement should be aware that statements made to doctors by the child during the medical examination may be admissible in court as exceptions to the hearsay rule. Many acts of child sexual abuse do not leave any physical injury that can be identified by a medical examination. In addition, children's injuries can heal rapidly. However, lack of medical corroboration does not necessarily mean that a child was notsexually abused or that an offense cannot be proved in court. Figure 2, \"Sample Child Sexual Abuse Protocol\" (see pages 10 and 11), offers guidelines for the immediate law enforcementresponse to an allegation of child sexual abuse and provides details about obtaining the medical examination critical to investigating this offense.10Figure 2 Investigator's Sample Child Sexual Assault Protocol Interviewing the Victim YAssess the medical needs of the child so that emergency medical conditions can be attended to immediately. YDetermine what examinations are needed for collection of evidence. YDetermine venue. YEstablish what offenses, if any, have occurred. YEstablish date and time of the offense. YContact child protective services (CPS), if that has not been done. Obtaining a Medical Examination Note: If a sexual assault occurred within the previous 72 hours, the medical examination should be performed as soonas possible to maximize the possibility of recovering certainforensic evidence, such as blood, semen, saliva, and traceevidence. If the assault occurred more than 72 hours before,the probability of this type of evidence being recovered isreduced. However, since the investigator cannot be absolutely sure when the last encounter was, it is prudent to schedulethe medical examination sooner rather than later. A physicianand/or nurse examiner conducts the examination. YContact a physician and/or sexual assault nurse examiner. YCoordinate with CPS to determine if you (the police investigator) or the CPS worker will accompany the childto the examination. YMeet with the CPS representative, the physician and/or nurse examiner, the child, and the parent or guardian atthe hospital treatment room. YAssist the child and parents or guardian with the procedures for admission to the emergency room. (CPS may provide thisassistance, depending on who has requested the examination.) YBrief medical personnel concerning the facts, allegations, suspect information, the mental state of the child, pasthistories, and what the police department and CPS arelooking for in the examination and what evidence is tobe collected.11Figure 2 continued Handling the Evidence YSee that the cultures are prepared and marked to maintain the chain of custody. Include the date, the initials of the person conducting the examination, and the child's name.Transport the cultures and all other materials collected forevidence to the State laboratory. Make sure that both youand the laboratory personnel have signed the chain ofcustody form. Local procedures may differ from this; lawenforcement must know and follow all jurisdictionalprocedures for handling evidence. YMake sure that photographs are marked with the date, time, victim's name, photographer's initials, and case number and turned over to you as evidence. Photographs can be takenby police officers, investigators, CPS workers, physicians,nurse examiners, or other parties. Subpoena Procedures YCall the physician and/or nurse examiner as soon as possible if a subpoena has been issued to compare calendarsand identify any conflicts early. Such notification shouldinclude the names of the child victim, defendant, andprosecuting attorney (if known); court date; and mattersto which the physician may be r equested to testify. Local procedures may differ from this; law enforcement must know and follow all practices and procedures for their jurisdiction. YAs an option, law enforcement may assist in the coordination of a pretrial conference with the medicalprofessional and the prosecutor in advance of the court hearing. At this meeting: lQuestions that may be asked of the medical professional can be outlined. lMedical terminology or difficult trial issues related to thetestimony can be clarified. lRequests for exhibits that may be helpful in clarifyingtestimony can be discussed and time allowed for their preparation. This meeting is also a courtesy to prepare the medical professional in a timely fashion and to relieve the anxietyof testifying.12Domestic Disturbance Calls One of the most common calls for service by law enforcement is the domestic disturbance call. Most police officers understand the potential for danger associated with such calls, but manydo not realize that a violent adult might also vent anger on a child. A recent study in Florida* revealed that nearly one-third of domestic disturbance calls masked an incident of some formof child victimization. For this reason, officers should ask whether there are children living at the residence and, if so, where they are. YIt is recommended that domestic disturbance calls be answered with at least two officers, not only for officer protection but also so that one officer can deal with the parties involved withthe domestic disturbance while the other officer talks with any children who may be present. YOnce the involved parties are calm, most parents, if asked tactfully, will allow an officer to talk with their children and may even appreciate the officer's offer to allay a child's fear that someone has been hurt or is going to jail. YIf possible, an officer should speak directly with the children. Such conversations allow the police officer to gather information about the situation directly from the child and to assess the child's need for protection. Officers should be observant and look for any physical signs that the child may have been abused, but they should be aware that a child in this situation is likely to be afraid and withdrawn. Nervousness or a reluctance to talk to an officer does notmean that physical abuse has taken place. The officer should be attuned to the fact that the child may not want to stay at the residence, fearing another altercation. An officer suspecting child abuse should preserve possible crime scene evidence such as a weapon or instrument of abuse and arrange for photographing of the scene. This eliminatesthe need for a search warrant, since officers are already legally on the scene. The officer must also notify social services of his or her suspicions of child abuse as soon as possible. * Hammond CB, Poindexter RW, Caimano JV , Kramer W, Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, Tampa, Florida. Crimes Against Children Crime Analysis Project: Implications and Findings. Washington, DC: Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, 1993.13Placing a Child in Emergency Protective Custody Officers who become involved in a child abuse case through social services should consider all information that has beenprovided to them. Based on this information, officers should ask a basic question: \"If we leave and obtain a court order to remove this child, is the child likely to be injured before wereturn?\" If the answer is yes, then the officer should remove the child. All actions should be in accordance with State guidelines and departmental policy and procedure: YDepending on the jurisdiction, the officer may be obligated to remove the child if direct disclosure of physical or sexual abuse is made, if such abuse is alleged, or if evidence of an abusiveincident is present. YMoreover, in most jurisdictions, State law allows an officer to decide to remove a child based on observation of the facts andjudgment of the information given. In some situations an officer may remove a child because he or she feels that the child may suffer further physical or emotional harm or trauma or be hidden or abducted before a court order can be obtained. In some jurisdictions law enforcement may be called upon by child protective services to investigate allegations of child abuse, to officially place a child in emergency protective custody, or to assist with such placement. Officers in suchsituations need to know the laws in their State. Failure to understand their legally mandated roles and responsibilities could result in: YA child being left in a dangerous situation. YA child being removed illegally. YThe officer and the department being placed in a situation of civil liability. However, if a mistake is to be made, it is better to err in the attempt to safeguard the physical well-being of the child. In jurisdictions where law enforcement has sole responsibility for deciding to remove a child from the home, the childis usually placed in the custody of the department of social services until a final determination regarding custody of the child can be made by the courts. Social services is responsiblefor placing the child in a licensed foster care facility. Officers14need to be aware of the legalities regarding parental rights and their responsibilities for providing written notification of the child's removal. In most States it is not acceptable for law enforcement to take a child from one parent and place him or her in the custody of another parent or of a relative without a court order or verification of legal authority. Also, in most States the placementof a child in the custody of another individual is the sole responsibility of the department of social services and not law enforcement. However, if social services chooses to place the child in the custody of a parent or someone other than a licensed foster care facility, law enforcement should be aware of the jurisdiction's policies and practices before par ticipating in or agreeing to this placement. It is highly recommended that removal or detention orders or other appropriate court paperwork accompany officers to the removal site and that this paperwork be explained to adversarial parents. In some jurisdictions there is \"summary removal\" authority\u2014that is, with no paperwork in hand andbased on circumstances of the case as it develops, the child may be removed from the home. Safety issues enter into the equation, especially as law enforcement is often present for theprotection of social service personnel. Law enforcement officers are responsible for ensuring that they have met all requirements of their State governing theplacement of children into protective custody. Common Mistakes To Avoid Some law enforcement officers inadvertently cause asituation to escalate when placing a child in protective custody. Experienced officers have learned to avoid three common mistakes: YMaking premature accusations. Making an accusatory statement to the parent, guardian, or custodian that the child is being taken into protective custody because someone has abused the childplaces police officers in a situation of serious liability. A more appropriate statement is, \"Because of questionable injuries, marks, or allegations about inappropriate activity, the child isbeing taken to a licensed foster care facility of the State until a complete and thorough investigation into the situation can be conducted.\"15YAttempting to rationalize the removal of a child. Some officers attempt to rationalize with the parent their decision to remove achild. However, the best tactic is to remove the child and vacate the situation as quickly as possible, after ensuring that everyone's rights are protected. The fact is that no amount of explainingwill lessen the pain, fear, and anger (hostility) involved in having a child taken away. Of ficers should be aware that heightened emotions can lead to a dangerous escalation of the situation. YFailing to provide all of the required forms. Police officers must be familiar with all the forms that must be completed by the parent at the time that a child is placed in protective custody.For example, many States require that a form explaining that the child has been placed in protective custody must be provided to the parents within 24 hours after the child has been so placed.The form must state that the placement was made in accordance with a particular statute, and it must describe the parents' rights in the matter. The responsibility for providing this form to the parents varies from State to State. Law enforcement officers and social service workers must know what is required in their State. Removing the Child If a law enforcement officer has been called to assist in the removal of a child, it is the officer's responsibility to ensure that the child is removed with as little trauma or danger to the child and the social worker as possible. YThe police officer should meet with the social worker at a neutral location before going to the residence. The social worker should explain the situation in general, describe the layout of theresidence, and specify who is expected to be there. In this way the police officer and the social worker can determine a plan of action before arriving at the scene. YAny necessary items, such as medication, should be brought with the child. The key point is that once the decision to remove a child has been made, the action should be carriedout expeditiously. Impact on the Child Physical removal from the home is extremely traumatic for the child. Both the law enforcement officer and the social worker are relative strangers. They need to keep the following pointsin mind: YDebating the situation with the parent or caretaker only raises the emotional level of the child. Such arguments may cause the child to become more nervous, upset, distraught, and emotionally unstable.16YIn most situations, children are not going to leave their parents willingly, even though they have been physically or sexually abused. They may not understand what is best for them and may try to resist the law enforcement officer. YOfficers should not respond to a child's outbursts with anger or displeasure. Instead, they should behave as positively\u2014or at least neutrally\u2014as possible. They should do everything they can to help the child adjust to a new and scary situation. YOnce the officer has removed the child from the residence and the child has had a chance to calm down, if the child is old enough to communicate, the officer should take the time to explain that thechild has not done anything wrong and was removed for his or her own protection. Conclusion Child abuse is a multidimensional problem that requires a multidisciplinary, multiagency team approach for successful intervention. This means that all professionals involved\u2014 in law enforcement, child protective services, mental health,medicine, and the law\u2014communicate and coordinate with one another. A child's best interest can be served only when the various professionals that are involved understand theirrespective roles, possess knowledge of their State statutes and local guidelines, and have adequate training in their respective fields. Sensitive and consistent application of policies andprocedures established in written protocols is essential for an effective alliance to combat child maltreatment. Contributing Authors Carl B.
