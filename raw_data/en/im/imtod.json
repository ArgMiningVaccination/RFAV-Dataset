There are many ways we can take care of ourselves throughout the whole year to ensure optimal health. You've likely heard the saying, \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\" It's a reminder that being mindful about your wellness and making healthy choices now can prevent health problems in the future - and is far more effective than having to work to treat problems after they've taken hold. Here at the First Nations Health Authority, our work is based on this \"upstream\" kind of thinking - we promote \"health through wellness.\" This means we support and promote programs, resources, and activities that provide First Nations people in BC with services and options for lifestyles and health care that will help make and keep communities strong. At the same time, we work to improve or change things in the health care system that do not meet this standard for our people. We are deeply committed to helping build our shared vision of healthy, self-determining, and vibrant First Nations children, families, and communities. Making healthy choices is one way we can supply ourselves and our loved ones with powerful doses of prevention - preventive/good medicine -- so that we don't need cures. Not every facet of health is in our control, of course, but there is much we can do individually to promote health and prevent sickness. On International Self-Care Day, I'd like to highlight some of the ways we can take care of ourselves throughout the year to ensure optimal health. My personal favourite is gardening whenever I get the chance. I find it is healing and soothing for body, mind, and soul! Take good care of yourself spiritually, mentally, emotionally and physically by: If you have something that works wonders for your health and it's not mentioned above, please feel free to share with us at wellness@fnha.ca and we might include it in a future article or resource! Quoting you, of course! Be Well, Dr. Shannon "}
