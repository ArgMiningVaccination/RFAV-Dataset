It is also responsible for fighting viruses that have entered the body. The immune system lies at the core of our bodily functions because, without it, the body would not be able to stay in top condition. As such, you need to keep your immune system in check. Your health and overall well-being depend on it. The immune system is comprised of cells, antibodies, and organs, so if you want to keep it strong, you need to care for your entire body. The basic way to [strengthen the immune system](https://organicaromas.com/blogs/aromatherapy-and-essential-oils/5-essential-oils-to-strengthen-your-immune-system) is to maintain a balanced diet and a healthy lifestyle and to take multivitamins or Vitamin C. You can supplement this healthy lifestyle and boost your immune system with clove essential oil. Clove Essential Oil And The Immune System Clove is a spice that is integral to cultures in China, Indonesia, and the Moluccas. It comes from an evergreen tree that grows in humid tropical climates. Clove essential oil comes from the dried flower buds of the clove tree or Eugenia aromatic. It contains minerals, fiber, and vitamins, and it has antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and expectorant properties. Clove essential oil is also an antioxidant. These therapeutic effects work together to help strengthen the immune system. - Clove essential oil's antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and expectorant properties aid the immune system in fighting infectious agents that may have entered the body. These properties also help the body regulate flu and other symptoms. - The antioxidants in clove essential oil protect the cells from oxidative stress by subduing the effects of free radicals, thereby preventing cells from dying. Antioxidants help the immune system stay strong so it can fight off viruses. How To Boost The Immune System With Clove Essential Oil: Dos And Don'ts There is no question that clove essential oil has elements that can boost the immune system. The question is: how can you boost your immune system with clove essential oil? The answer lies in the most effective way to deliver essential oils to the body. Dos In Using Clove Essential Oil 1 - Do check the quality Not all essential oils are made the same. Beware of essential oils that have been diluted or fragrances that are marketed as essential oils. Double-check that you buy only high-quality, pure clove essential oil. 2 - Do store them properly Pure essential oils are sensitive to heat. They are also highly potent, so they tend to dissolve plastic. This is why essential oils are stored in amber glass bottles. Choose an essential oil that is stored in this type of bottle and make sure to store it in a cool, dry place. 3 - Do consult with your doctor Essential oils are great for many purposes, but they can also have adverse effects on people who are pregnant or medicating. If you have a certain medical condition, consider consulting your doctor first. Make sure that aromatherapy and clove essential oil will not conflict with your medication. 4 - Do use a nebulizing diffuser A [nebulizing diffuser](https://organicaromas.com/products/raindrop-essential-oil-diffuser) uses pressurized air to turn essential oils into microparticles. Those microparticles are undiluted, so their potency will allow your immune system to get the full benefits of clove essential oil. Because of this process, a nebulizing diffuser is more efficient than other types of diffusers. With just a few drops, a nebulizing diffuser can disperse essential oil microparticles throughout the room. Don'ts In Using Clove Essential Oil 1 - Don't apply essential oils directly to your skin Essential oils such as clove are highly potent and may irritate the skin if not used properly. Certain essential oils can be used for topical application, but even then, they need to be diluted with carrier oils. If your goal is to boost your immune system, topical application is not advised. 2 - Don't ingest essential oils Essential oils are not made for consumption. Ingesting essential oils, even in small amounts, can cause poisoning. [Aromatherapy](https://organicaromas.com/blogs/aromatherapy-and-essential-oils/can-aromatherapy-help-you) is still the best and safest way to get the benefits of essential oils. 3 - Don't use water to diffuse your clove essential oil Water dilutes essential oils, which makes them less potent. That's why diffusers that use water are not ideal if you want to boost your immune system with clove essential oil. A more efficient and viable alternative that will maximize the benefits of any essential oil is a nebulizing diffuser. 4 - Don't use heat to diffuse your clove essential oil Heat may one of the most popular methods used in aromatherapy, but it is not the best option. Heat tends to erode the composition of essential oils. This has an adverse effect on their properties. If you want to get the full benefits of clove essential oil for your immune system, keep your essential oil away from heat. "}
