How is NUCCA Chiropractic Different: No Twisting, \"Cracking\" or \"Popping\" of the Spine or Neck Did you know that there are much gentler and safer procedures that do not involve any twisting, \"Cracking\" or \"popping\" of the spine or neck? NUCCA chiropractic is one of the few techniques. NUCCA spinal corrections are gentle, specific and safe. During the adjustment you are in a side lying position on a special table, and your neck is in a neutral position. There is no twisting of the head or neck. Easy, safe, and painless. Even kids love getting adjusted! #2. How is NUCCA Chiropractic Different: A Focus on One Area to Benefit the Whole Body \"Adjusting a misalignment elsewhere in the spine is not addressing the-root cause\". NUCCA doctors concentrate on the top bone of the neck called atlas (C1) to affect the rest of the spine and body as a whole. When there is a misalignment of C1, it unbalances the head and neck, causing the whole spine and body to compensate. This area of the spine is important to the proper function of the body. Your chiropractor should check this area first before addressing other areas. Adjusting a misalignment elsewhere in the spine is not addressing the-root cause. #3. How is NUCCA Chiropractic Different: Unique Care Tailored to YOU NUCCA chiropractors use specialized x-rays to create a 3D approach specifically tailored to your anatomy. No two people are the same, every individual is unique and therefore has different needs. Such specialized X-rays allow the doctor to pinpoint how the C1 vertebrae is out of alignment. This is why every chiropractor is not the same. No traditional chiropractor uses this system of analysis except for Upper Cervical doctors. #4. Removing Stress on the Brain and Nervous System \"C1 vertebrae can result in dysfunction of the brain...\". The top vertebrae of the neck has a very intimate relationship with the brain and nervous system that the rest of the spine does not. Problems with C1 vertabrae can result in dysfunction of the brain particularly the brain stem, which controls thousands of functions in the body. Stress on the brain stem can result in problems with the heart, such as an irregular heartbeat and abnormal changes in blood pressure. Problems with balance and movement, headaches, migraines, and low back pain are only some of the few conditions that can arise. #5. How is NUCCA Chiropractic using Cutting Edge Technology NUCCA doctors use a state of the art machine called the Anatometer to detect imbalance within the body and nervous system. The use of the anatometer and 3D motion capture technology you can accurately assess the entire body in less than 20 seconds. In our office we use both alongside the latest protocols from the NUCCA organisation to help you A specific postural pattern for an individual patient can be reflective of an upper cervical (C1) misalignment. #6. How is NUCCA Chiropractic Different: Knowing When & When NOT to Adjust \"The deeper healing of tissues occurs when the upper neck is in alignment\". This is one aspect that surprises patients the most about NUCCA care. NUCCA doctors assess for when to adjust but also know when NOT to adjust the spine. The goal is to remove any stress and interference on the brain and nervous system. The deeper healing of tissues occurs when the upper neck is in alignment. A natural state of healing only happens when the body is allowed to communicate without interference. So now you know.. 6 Ways How NUCCA Chiropractic Is Different from Traditional Chiropractic?
