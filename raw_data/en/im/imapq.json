Evers, with In August 2008, I received a solicitation for the \"2008 . . . Area Annual Fund Drive\" from the Diabetes Fund, P.O. Box 96673, Washington, D.C. 20090 [1]. The message, addressed to \"Dear Friend,\" said that, \"Our annual drive is the single most important fundraiser of the year to support our fight against diabetes.\" How does the National Diabetes Fund \"fight diabetes\"? The reverse side of the reply form stated: NDC Facts: Solicitation for NonProfit Purposes Fund National Diabetes Fund is a program of Project Cure. Contributions made to Project Cure are used for fundraising expenses, including administrative costs, public education and program services. The services of a paid professional fundraiser, Direct Response Consulting Services, are used to professionally assist them in this solicitation of funds. In the last fiscal year, Project Cure raised a total of $5,115,252. Its expense distribution was 73.64% to fundraising, 1.53% to administration, 7.74% to program services, and 17.09% to public education in conjunction with fundraising appeals. The cost of this solicitation is charged partly to fundraising and partly to public education. Fundraising costs include costs incurred in establishing a donor base. Public education costs include costs incurred in disseminating information contained in solicitations. . . . Project Cure raises funds under three programs: National Diabetes Fund, Prostate Cancer Fund, and The Alzheimer's Disease Fund [1]. These numbers mean that in 2006, Project Cure used no more than 25% of its reported gross income for program services and public education. But I believe that the actual percentage amount was less because the \"public education in conjunction with fundraising\" was not what most people would consider public education. The only \"educational\" information in the solicitation I received was a statement that \"today over 15 million Americans suffer from diabetes and there is no cure for this disease.\" As far as I can tell, Project Cure gives no money for research into the diseases related to its fundraising. Its current public education activities include a Web site (naturalhealthvillage.com) that mainly posts tidbits by Peter Barry Chowka every two weeks and links to news articles on other sites. In contrast, the leading voluntary health organizations fight their chosen diseases by giving grants and providing information that is reliable, practice, and comprehensive. In 2006, for example, the percentages of expenses used for these purposes were 76% for the American Diabetes Association, 86% for Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, 77% for the Alzheimer's Association and its chapters. and 76% for the Prostate Cancer Foundation [2]. Some people donate to Project Cure because the names it uses resemble these respectable charities. Background History Project Cure's tax returns describe its aims this way: Lobbying\u2014Project Cure, Inc.'s lobbying program is directed at the White House and Congress, promoting four programs: The Alzheimer's Disease Fund, Center for Advanced Heart Research, The National Diabetes Fund, and the Prostate Cancer Fund. At the core of each of these programs is the basic premise that America's health care system, which is geared toward serving the interests of health care providers, must be radically altered to serve the interest of the American public. These programs encourage citizens to communicate their views to lawmakers via petitions, letters, phone calls, and personal visits. Meetings with lawmakers and their aides are also conducted to discuss pertinent health issues and legislation. Education\u2014information regarding Alzheimer disease, diabetes, and prostate cancer treatments are disseminated to the public via letters, brochures, printed material, radio and television presentations and participation in seminars, workshops, and debates. Health care providers, media, and others interested in expanding their knowledge in these areas are provided educational information in an effort to broaden the base of research looking into new cutting edge treatments. These goals may sound respectable, but they are not. The treatment methods Project Cure promotes are not legitimate. The organization was founded in 1979 by Robert DeBragga, a marketing executive who developed lung cancer in the late 1970s and died in 1990 [3]. It has 501(c)(4) status, which means that it does not pay income tax but contributions to it are not tax-deductible. During the 1980s, Project Cure described itself as \"the first citizens' lobby group acting on behalf of cancer patients and their non-toxic treatment alternatives\" and said that its primary goal was to \"encourage Congress and the medical community to evaluate and employ nutritional, nontoxic cancer therapies.\" [4] DeBragga claimed that in 1978 he had been diagnosed with lung cancer, underwent standard treatment, but was told that because the cancer had metastasized to lymph nodes, he had about nine months to live. He then began investigating and using \"nontoxic\" treatments and used Project Cure to raise money and to lobby in support of his beliefs. Stories of this type are generally not trustworthy [5]. DeBragga also claimed to have counseled more than 2,000 patients and appeared on more than 250 radio and television programs. In 1987, Project Cure was said to have distributed more than eight million pieces of literature by mail [6]. In 1987, when DeBragga's cancer progressed, Attorney Michael S. Evers became Project Cure's executive director and president [7]. In the 1980s, Project Cure's mail solicitations often contained form letters that could be sent to legislators to oppose food irradiation, oppose licensing of nutritionists, and urge that the National Cancer Institute spend more of its research budget on nutritional treatments and cancer prevention. Some solicitations claimed that the recipient was sweepstakes winner could collect the prize by sending a $7 contribution or a voided check. In 1988, The New York Times noted that the solicitations had been distributed by Watson & Hughey and that several state attorneys general had taken legal action against the company, Project Cure (d/b/a/ Center for Alternative Cancer Research), and six other nonprofit organizations [8]. Some of Project Cure's solicitations claimed that money received from recipients would \"help our research programs to find a cure for cancer.\" The Missouri Attorney General charged that this was misleading because Project Cure (d/b/a/ Center for Alternative Cancer Research did not have a laboratory and did not conduct research. The Missouri suit also charged that Project Cure had misapplied funds by making purchases unrelated to its expressed purpose of funding cancer research [9]. In 1991, the Associated Press reported that settlements had been reached with 12 states: Missouri and Texas Missouri separately, and a joint $2.1 million settlement with the states of Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington [10]. The California Attorney General reported that in 1998 and 1999, only about 13% of Project Cure's funds had been used for charitable purposes [11]. Michael Evers is the adopted son of H. Ray Evers, M.D., who is considered to be the \"father\" of chelation therapy, which I regard as one of the serious forms of quackery [12]. In 1985, Michael founded the Health Alternatives Legal Foundation (HALF), which described itself as a nonprofit public interest law center whose purposes included defending \"alternative\" health care practitioners and initiating antitrust litigation challenging medical practice laws [13]. HALF published a few newsletters and became involved in a few lawsuits but became quiescent after Michael took over Project Cure. Michael now identifies himself as Project Cure's president. His annual salary has risen from $132,000 in 1998 to $240,000 in 2016 and then dropped in 2017. Project Cure's Form 990 tax returns give the following numbers: |Year||Contributions | and Grants |Total | Expenses Investigation In June 2013, the Tampa Bay Times placed Project Cure as #15 in its list of the 50 worst charities in America. The ranking was based on the the total amount paid to commercial fundraisers during the past ten years [14]. A few days later, a reporter from the Bradenton Herald looked through a window at Project Cure's listed address at 4920 Lena Road and took the photo to the right photo with his cell phone camera. The things he saw included a mattress and box spring leaning against a wall, an old chandelier on the ground, and Christmas tree bulbs on a shelf, but no office furniture [15]. The Bottom Line Florida-based Project Cure has been promoting questionable methods since its inception. It solicitations have suggested that contributions will be used in the fight against cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and other major health problems. However, its financial reports indicates that (a) it does not sponsor research, (b) its \"educational\" programs are unreliable, and (c) most of the money it collects winds up in the hands of professional fundraisers.

Immuno-augmentative therapy (IAT)\u2014also referred to as Immune Augmentation Therapy\u2014was developed by Lawrence Burton, Ph.D., a zoologist who claimed that it could control all forms of cancer by restoring natural immune defenses.

Burton did not publish detailed clinical reports, divulge the details of his methods, publish meaningful statistics, conduct a controlled trial, or provide independent investigators with specimens of his treatment materials for analysis. During the mid-1980s, several of Burton's patients were reported to have developed serious infections following IAT. During the 1990s, the IAT Web site falsely claimed that \"IAT may well be the best option available for cancer patients today.\" Thus there is no logical reason to believe that Burton was honest or that IAT was or is effective. Background Burton received his Ph.D. in zoology from New York University in 1955. He had no formal graduate training in immunology, oncology, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. His research began with fruit flies (Drisophila melanogaster) and later included mice. His doctoral dissertation was entitled \"Carcinogenic Activity of Larval Donor Extracts in Drosophila.\" [1] He was a biology research associate at the California Institute of Technology from 1955 to 1957 and at New York University in 1958. From 1959 through 1973, he held various research positions at St. Vincent's Hospital in New York City [2]. Although Burton claimed to have been a \"senior oncologist\" at St. Vincents, hospital documents indicate that only medical doctors were titled \"oncologists.\" His work on fruit flies was also challenged. Burton claimed to have discovered a \"tumor induction factor\" (TIF) and a naturally occurring TIF inhibitor in fruit flies. Later, in New York, he reported findng the same inhibitor system in mice and concluded that all mammals have it. However, Burton's research was questioned at Cal Tech after someone discovered that the control fruit flies in his experiments had no injection scars, while their experimental animals did, even though the research protocol called for injecting controls with an inert material. Burton's supervisor, biology professor Herschel K. Mitchell, Ph.D.\u2014who had co-authored four papers with Burton\u2014investigated and concluded that Burton's results were \"meaningless.\" [3] As summaized by Saul Green, Ph.D., in the Journal of the American Medical Association: When questions were raised about the research results, Mitchell presented Burton with coded samples and asked him to use his assay to identify those containing purified TIF. Burton could not distinguish between plain buffer solutions and [buffer] solutions containing TIF. Subsequently Mitchell tried to repeat Burton's tumor transmission experiments with Burton's own TIF preparations, but found no difference between control and experimental groups. Consequently, Mitchell concluded that the assay did not work and that Burton had failed to provide evidence that TIF existed in fruit flies. Because the results Burton was reporting from New York were based on the invalidated bioassay, Mitchell asked to be \"forgotten\" as a collaborator in the work Burton did at the California Institute of Technology [2]. Despite Mitchell's repudiation, Burton applied his theory to the treatment of humans. From 1974 to 1977, he operated as research director at the Immunology Research Foundation in Great Neck, N.Y., which had been established in 1973 with the help of several businessmen. The Foundation's major purpose was \"to investigate and stimulate immunological research for the ultimate control of cancer through the victim's own defense system.\" [4] Treatment using Burton's methods was administered by affiliated physicians [5]. In December 1974, the foundation submitted an investigational new drug (IND) application to the FDA, seeking to initiate human trials using IAT with Burton as the principal investigator. But according to the FDA, subsequent questions about the research were not fully answered. Instead, Burton asked that his application be withdrawn, and the National Institutes of Health placed it in an \"inactive\" file in March 1976 [6]. Although IND numbers are assigned for identification only, a foundation brochure claimed that the FDA had \"awarded an IND number toward the furtherance of the Foundation's goals\" and that \"having been granted the identifying number, certain clinical trials may be begun on a very limited experimental basis.\" In 1977, Burton left the United States and opened the Immunology Researching Centre, Ltd., in Freeport, Grand Bahama Island, Bahamas. Literature from the center described it as a nonprofit corporation. In 1978, representatives of the Bahamian Ministry of Health and the Pan American Health Organization (one of whom was a National Cancer Institute official) visited the facility and reviewed 49 charts that the center's staff considered to represent encouraging results. The report concluded that there was no objective evidence that IAT was beneficial and recommended that the facility be closed [7]. However, except for a seven-month period beginning in July 1985, the Bahamian government has permitted the clinic to remain open. Another IAT facility licensed by Burton was opened in 1987 in Frankfort, West Germany. A third one, the Immune Therapy Clinic, opened in 1989 in Playas, Mexico, with a promotional office in nearby San Ysidro, California (a suburb of San Diego). IAT was administered on an outpatient basis. In 1998 and 1999, the estimated cost of treatment at the Immunology Research Centre was $7,500 for the first four weeks and $700 a week after that, with an average stay of 12 weeks. After the patients return home, the maintenance program cost $50 per week [8]. I can find no mention of the Mexican or German facilities in any directory or on the Internet, so I assume they are no longer in business. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, National Cancer Institute officials communicated with Burton and other interested parties about possible approaches for evaluating his methods. However, no agreement could be reached for collaboration. In 1980, Burton received an enormous boost when CBS-TV's \"60 Minutes\" gave him favorable publicity. During the program, a prominent physician stated that one of his patients treated by Burton appeared to have miraculously recovered [9]. The patient died within two weeks after the program was shown [10], but \"60 Minutes\" never informed viewers of this fact. Shortly after the program aired, a young man whose mother was being treated by Burton wrote to the American Cancer Society about what happened when he visited the Bahamas clinic and spent about 40 minutes talking with Burton. The man happened to be a Ph.D. candidate in biochemistry at a research center that was studying cancer and immunology. He reported: - Burton kept no medical or scientific literature in his office or laboratory and openly admitted that he kept no records of data, which meant that he was not actually doing research. - The laboratory workers were young Bahamians with only high school education and no scientific background. - Burton's discussion rambled from one unrelated subject to another, he used scientific terms improperly. When I asked him a question about the nature of his \"deblocking protein\" component, as to whether it was a protease, he answered with a long dissertation on adreno corticotropic hormone (ACTH) and something about measuring liver damage by alkaline phosphatase. He always tried to talk fast and over my head so as to try to confuse me and leave me with the impression that he was highly knowledgeable, but little of what he said was accurate or even related to the question. - When shown thru his lab, I was told that the procedure that was used for processing his patients' blood involved heating and centrifuging at low and ultracentrifuge speeds. I was completely unable to understand how he could separate or assay for four different immunological components with no other equipment in his lab. - Burton's wife Esther. his administrator, asked my mother for a starting contribution of $5000. in the first week that she attended the clinic. She stayed there for over six months. I do not know how many thousands of dollars Burton received from her in all that time. - There was pressure on the patients of tbs supposed \"not-for-profit foundation\" to contribute on a regular basis. Those who were not contributing regularly were usually asked to leave. One of Burton 's workers, whom I spoke with outside of the clinic, described a person who didn't give Burton money as a \"free-loader.\" Burton was known to ask people to leave when they became gravely ill. People constantly feared being asked to leave. At one point my mother wrote to me and stated that over ten of the 53 at the Burton clinic were asked to leave, all within a few days. My mother died 4\u00bd months after she was asked to leave [11]. In 1984, at a Congressional hearing held by Representative Claude Pepper, a pathologist from Alabama described how his father-in-law had been tricked into believing that IAT had cured him: In 1982, my father-in-law was diagnosed as having unresectable, incurable, widely disseminated cancer of the lung, and advised that essentially his condition was terminal. As could be expected, the family was distraught, and we began to grasp at straws and looking into alternative modes of treatment. . . . Some of the local press . so-called immuno-augmentative therapy. . . . Soon thereafter he went to the Bahamas to get the treatment. His main symptom had been pain from the tumor. It had metastasized to the bones. When he went down there, he was told to go off pain medication and to begin the serum injections, and that . . . the serum injections, if they work and dissolve the tumor, will cause pain. So he went down there knowing he had a tumor growing in him and causing him pain, and through a pretty good ploy he came back convinced that the pain he was having was a cure. In addition, he was told the tumor was shrinking. The x-ray film they took was overexposed, which has the technical problem of making masses look smaller than they really are. Upon his return, I encouraged him to go to Fox Army Hospital and have another chest x-ray made. Several radiologists corroborated that they could see no evidence of any shrinkage in the tumor. I was then faced with the unpleasant task of telling my father-in-law for the second time he was dying. It was interesting that both he and his wife came back with total euphoria\u2014that he was cured. They told everyone they saw he was cured. When they realized that they had been fooled, it was really a shock, and, of course one doesn't usually go around telling people you have been fooled. He died approximately two months after he returned. In addition to the emotional turmoil and being away from the rest of the family for essentially half the remaining life he had, this cost them approximately $10,000, including travel and lodging, for this phony cancer cure [12]. The American Cancer Society's medical library has identified 24 papers written or co-authored by Burton between 1954 and 1969. In 1982, the Society asked him for documentation of his work and references to relevant publications. No reply was received. During a lawsuit, Burton stated that after papers he wrote between 1964 and 1973 were rejected, he decided he was being \"blackballed\" and would submit no more papers to major journals. He also said that he would never do a controlled study because he would not want to deprive a controlled group of the opportunity to have his treatment [13]. In 1986, U.S. Representative Guy V. Molinari held a public hearing on IAT, after which he and 41 other congressmen signed letters asking the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) to evaluate IAT. Subsequently, Representative John Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, asked OTA to investigate unconventional cancer treatments with IAT included as a case study. OTA then appointed a working group composed of technical experts and representatives of Burton to design a clinical trial to evaluate IAT. According to OTA's report, a protocol was designed in which colon cancer patients would be treated at an accredited medical center in the U.S. However, communication between Burton and U.S. government authorities broke down after he insisted that a \"pre-test\" be conducted at his clinic. The OTA report concluded that \"no reliable data are available on which to base a determination of IAT's efficacy.\" [14] In 1991, after an extensive investigation, the American Cancer Society issued a position paper warning that it had \"found no evidence that [IAT] was safe or resulted in objective benefit in the treatment of cancer.\" [15] IAT was also promoted by People Against Cancer (PAC), an organization that advocated \"medical freedom of choice\" and offered literature and counseling about \"therapeutic alternatives.\" The organization's founder and president was Frank Wiewel, of Otho, Iowa, whose father-in-law was a patient of Burton. Regular membership, which cost $35 during its early years, included a subscription to Options, a newsletter that promoted questionable cancer treatments. PAC's \"Alternative Therapy Program\" in which Wiewel provided an \"extensive report and consultation on treatment options,\" required purchase of a \"sustaining memberhip\" for $350. Wiewel was also president of the IAT Patient's Association, Inc., which was formed in 1985 and later transferred its assets to People Against Cancer. Proponent Claims In 1981, when the Florida legislature was considering whether to legalize IAT in Florida, its proponents distributed literature stating that IAT could provide: - Safe, nontoxic treatment free of adverse side effects - Efective treatment for all types of cancer; (c) practical and effective cancer prevention - The earliest possible type of cancer detection - The most advanced, individualized, and \"tailor-made\" cancer treatment and treatment-monitoring tests and techniques; - Reliable cancer prediction - Better-quality lifestyle for the cancer \"victim\" during treatment - Less expensive cancer treatment. [16] Burton claimed that his treatment \"augments the patient's own immune system.\" He postulated that cancers develop because of a breakdown in the immune system and that IAT restores the body's natural defenses. A brochure from the Immunology Researching Centre stated: Tumor antibodies are \"alerted to the presence\" of tumor cells by a protein produced by the tumor cells themselves-tumor complement factor. . . . Tumor complement induces the tumor antibodies to destroy the tumor cells. If the tumor cells are destroyed in an unregulated manner, however, a person's liver may become overburdened. . . . To protect the body, blocking protein factors are produced to shield the tumor cells from attack by the tumor antibodies and thereby regulate the rate of tumor kill. The important balance of tumor kill rate is maintained by yet another blood component-de-blocking protein factor . . . which neutralizes the blocking protein and thereby permits antibodies to destroy tumor cells in a regulated manner. At times this dynamic process is upset and an over-supply of blocking protein factor exists, along with undersupplies of deblocking protein factors and tumor complement factor. When this imbalance . . . occurs, the individual is said to be immuno-suppressed or immunodeficient [17]. According to the brochure, Burton's laboratory made daily or twice-daily assessments of the levels and proportions antibody,\" \"deblocking protein,\" and \"blocking then given daily injections of \"tumor complement factor\" obtained from the serum of persons with cancer and \"deblocking protein factor\" and \"tumor antibody\" obtained from the serum of persons without cancer. Burton determined the dosages after analyzing these data with a computer program that he developed. The brochure also stated: Each therapeutic IAT intervention is prescribed with the most recent assessment of: (1) the status of the native immune system; (2) the status of tumor activity; (3) the effects of the most recent therapy; and (4) the accumulated effects of all previous therapy and response. After the patient was considered stabilized, a computer readout was prepared for a daily program of injections administered at home [17]. Burton did not claim that IAT products attacked cancers directly. Therefore, failures would be attributable not to his treatment but to unresponsiveness of the patient's immune system due to damage by prior treatment or advanced disease. He advised patients undergoing IAT to stop other therapies \"so as not to confuse other data.\" The brochure stated that Burton did not claim \"cure,\" but did claim that many patients \"prosper\" by becoming symptom-free and resuming their normal life activities. Burton conducted no controlled trial of his treatment and did not publish detailed case histories of his patients. The clinic brochure contained a chart of about 40 types of cancer in various stages and scores a \"+\" if half or more of patients \"have responded to IAT with long-term regression of tumors and/or remission of symptoms.\" These data were scientifically meaningless [18]. OTA asked Burton for the data or calculations upon which the chart was based but did not receive them [14]. The Immunology Researching Center brochure also suggested that double-blind experimentation would be immoral because it would deprive half the patients of active treatment. However, an NCI official who critiqued the brochure in 1984 noted that Phase III trials compare the experimental treatment with standard treatment, not a placebo. He also said: I think [Burton] realizes that he could get his work published if he were able or wished to present the data in the form needed to make his case. Nothing is required of him that is not required of others who wish to report his findings. If worst came to worst, he could as a start, publish and circulate the \"clinical data\" that he implies his promotional brochure is based on just as easily as he published and circulated promotional material. He could also make available to the scientific community the laboratory and clinical records upon which his claims are based [19] In 1987, IAT proponents stated that Burton \"was experimenting with his mice and some select patients with what he calls 'immune replacement' rather than immune augmentation. . . . If results continue to show promise and be executed, it will mean more frequent and longer stays at the clinic\u2014but home maintenance shots could be discontinued.\" [20] Investigations of Claims In 1979, Burton entered a contract with MetPath, the nation's largest biomedical laboratory. The documents presented in April 1981 to the Florida legislature called the contract \"another practical validation of the principles on which IAT is based.\" The material also stated that MetPath thoroughly investigated the IAT early detection test and found \"spectacular\" results [16]. However, MetPath had actually terminated the contract in December 1980 because it was unable to develop a sufficiently reliable technique to measure or identify the substance Burton claimed was related to the presence or absence of cancer. According to MetPath's board chairman: Notwithstanding Burton's assertions to the contrary, our contract was not \"another practical validation of the principles upon which IAT is based.\" We are not aware of the basis for the assertion that the results were \"spectacular'\" or that the \"tests proved to be 100% accurate and identified the blood specimens of patients known to have cancer.\" [21] The Florida legislators were also given binder containing testimonials, one section of which included 142 \"cancer victims whose immune systems have responded successfully to IAT.\" Two of these patients did not have cancer, and six did not specify when their treatment began or the date the testimonial was signed. Of the remaining 134 patients, 39 (29%) had begun treatment less than two months before their testimonial had been obtained, and 50 (37%) had given their testimonial between two and six months after starting treatment [18]. This is not enough time to evaluate a cancer treatment. However, Burton claimed that by monitoring the immune system of patients with his four tests, he could usually determine whether there was a positive response to IAT therapy within three or four days [22]. Two of the 134 patients died of their disease at least two months before he presented their testimonials to the legislators [18]. Burton held patents [A, B, C, D, E] for extracting the alleged IAT proteins, but he kept his computer program secret. In 1985, consultants from the Pan American Health Organization asked whether they could observe the preparation and dispensing of his protein fractions. According to their report, Burton replied that if they wanted to see how these products were made, they could go to Washington and examine his patents [23]. Saul Green, Ph.D., a biochemist who did cancer research at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital for 23 years, examined the patent applications. Dr. Green concluded that have \"never been identified as components of human blood much less of the immune system in the human.\" Moreover, proteins with the molecular weights Burton attributes to these alleged substances cannot be separated by centrifugation of blood using the speeds and times described in his patents [2]. A report to the OTA reached similar conclusions [24]. Dr. Green also noted that Burton did not establish immunologic baselines for normal individuals that were verified by independent investigators. Nor did he use recognized scientific tests to determine the status of his patients' immune competence either before or after treatment. Moreover, even if Burton's postulated substances do exist, the amounts injected into the patient's bloodstream would be too small to change the level of any existing blood component significantly [14]. No independent analysis of IAT treatment materials has been done on samples provided by Burton himself. Nor did he publish the results of any analysis he did on the nature and contents of the protein fractions he says he used to treat patients. NCI scientists who analyzed treatment materials given to several patients concluded that the materials were dilute solutions of ordinary blood proteins, the major component being albumin. None were electrophoretically pure, and none contained the components that Burton postulated [25]. William A. Nolen, M.D., who visited Burton's clinic in 1982, reviewed many records and had follow-up conversations with at least ten patients and some of their doctors. Dr. Nolen concluded that most of the patients had never had cancer or had tumors that typically grow slowly, while some had undergone conventional treatment that was probably responsible for any positive results [26]. In 1986, NCI and the American Society of Clinical Oncology asked cancer specialists about their experiences with patients who had undergone treatment with IAT. Although 95 such patients were identified, the researchers concluded that for various technical statistical reasons their survey could not be used to draw valid inferences about the effectiveness of IAT [27]. A research team from the University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center led by Barrie R. Cassileth, Ph.D., collected data on 79 patients who had received IAT at Burton's clinic. The researchers' report, which was privately published, stated that its data did not enable meaningful comparison of IAT patients and conventionally treated patients and suggested that a well controlled prospective study was needed [28] Nevertheless, IAT proponents circulated copies of the report and claimed that the study demonstrates IAT effectiveness [29]. In 1987, the American Medical Association's Diagnostic and Therapeutic Technology Assessment (DATTA) asked an expert panel to evaluate IAT. Of 27 panelists who commented on effectiveness, none rated IAT \"established,\" 6 (22%) called it \"investigational,\" 16 (73%) \"unacceptable,\" and 5 (19%) \"indeterminate.\" Of 26 panelists who commented on safety, none rated IAT \"established,\" 6 (23%) called it \"investigational,\" 19 (59%) \"unacceptable,\" and 1 (4%) \"indeterminate.\" [30] In 1989, investigators obtained permission to evaluate and follow patients who attended the IAT clinic in Playas, Mexico for up to 48 weeks. They found that (a) one of the 46 patients showed tumor regression, (b) 40 patients (87%) had disease progression, (c) 25 (55%) died within 6 months from disease progression, (d) 35 (76%) noticed a decline in their quality of life during IAT, and (e) 38 (83%) continued treatment, despite its lack of effectiveness. The researchers concluded that their study did not justify continued use of IAT [31]. In 1990, Burton's literature included a booklet summarizing the experiences of 35 IAT patients and their status as of February 1988. [32]. Wallace I. Sampson, M.D., a cancer specialist who analyzed the data, concluded: The sampling of cases is not meaningful. To estimate prognosis accurately, the stage and grade of a tumor are needed. Only a few of these vignettes provide both of these. Any facility that treats large numbers of cancer patients will have some patients who survive a long time\u2014with or without treatment. It would not be possible to determine IAT's effectiveness without knowing how these outcomes compare with the rest of Burton's patients who had similar cancers. Moreover, 30 of the 35 received standard or near-standard treatment before undergoing IAT. All of these had a significant probability of living as long as was recorded in the booklet [33]. Safety Questions The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has reported that from March 1982 to March 1984, 16 people treated at Burton's clinic developed skin abscesses where IAT materials had been injected. Nocardia asteroides was recovered from seven of these patients, one of whom also developed pneumonia. Based on a survey of patient charts, CDC estimated that between November 15, 1983, and March 1, 1984, the attack rate for abscesses at injection sites was 4.5 per 100 [34]. At the Molinari hearing, Burton stated that the Nocardia infections had been caused by a problem in an air conditioning duct and that the problem had been eliminated [35]. In 1984, NCI examined unopened vials of treatment materials given to five patients of Burton and found contamination with various bacteria [36]. During 1985, public health officials found antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vials of serum obtained from several patients and were able to culture the virus from one specimen-suggesting that blood infected with HIV had been used to prepare IAT treatment materials [37]. Antibodies to hepatitis B were also found in IAT serum, and a few cases of this disease occurred following treatment at Burton's clinic [36,37]. Because of the public health risk involved, the Bahamian health authorities asked the Pan American Health Organization to send consultants to reinspect Burton's clinic. The consultants reported: The visit to the clinic was essentially unproductive. . . . Some miscellaneous information was obtained, such as the fact that the clinic has treated AIDS patients . . . .The overall impression [of the report's writer] was one of dismay and concern for the lack of scientific knowledge displayed by the clinic staff, including the director, the unscientific atmosphere in the laboratories and the considerable potential for harm [38]. The consultants advised the Bahamian Ministry of Health to close the clinic. It was closed in July 1985 but was allowed to reopen in March 1986 after it acquired equipment to test for the AIDS and hepatitis B viruses. Legal and Regulatory Status In 1980, U.S. Representative Larry McDonald introduced federal legislation to exempt IAT \"blood fractions\" from FDA regulation for five years. His effort was not successful [39]. McDonald, a urologist who used the quack remedy laetrile to treat cancer patients in his office, also introduced bills intended to exempt laetrile from FDA regulatory action [40]. Bills to legalize the use of IAT were passed in 1982 in Florida and Oklahoma. The Florida bill required that the treatment be administered with a protocol and that data be presented periodically to a patient qualification review board. The Oklahoma bill required that samples of the serum be submitted to the State Health Department before treatment. Burton did not open a clinic in either state. The laws were repealed in Florida in 1984 and in Oklahoma in 1985. In 1986, the FDA issued an Import Alert to halt importation of IAT treatment materials used by Burton [41,42]. Although the ban is still in effect today, I have seen no report indicating that it has been enforced. In May 1988, a U. S. District Judge for the Western District of Michigan denied a widower's suit for payment by his insurance company of his deceased wife's treatment with IAT [43]. The court arbitrator in the case had concluded: Based upon the record before me, it does not appear that the [IAT clinic] is conducting a therapeutic program which is reasonably designed or intended to add to the general body of scientific knowledge. . . . Since the effectiveness of the therapy is unknown, and since it appears that its effectiveness will remain unknowable under the [clinic] program as it is presently designed, I cannot find that the treatments in question were \"necessary.\" [44 ] Conclusion No evidence has been published showing that immuno-augmentative therapy is safe or effective against cancer in humans. Burton did not publish detailed clinical reports or meaningful statistics, divulge the details of his methods, conduct a controlled trial, or provide independent investigators with specimens of his treatment materials for analysis. The mechanism of action he postulated for his treatment involved substances that are unknown to the scientific community. Although Burton said that IAT treatment materials were produced with processes he patented, experts do not believe that these processes can achieve what he claimed. Several attempts to develop a protocol for a clinical trial of IAT were unsuccessful. Independent investigators who determined what happened to 46 patients after they left Burton's clinic found no benefit. Moreover, during the mid-1980s, cases were reported of patients of Burton who developed serious infections following IAT. Burton died in 1993, but the Bahamian clinic he founded continued to operate under the direction of Dr. R. John Clement, a British-trained general practitioner who joined with Burton in 1978. In 2003, the clinic was renamed ITC Cancer Clinic and added other nonstandard treatments. The facility has also operated under the name Immune Augmentation Therapy Clinic. Clement reportedly retired in 2015 and died in 2018. Recently, it was announced that a former patient donated $250,000 to \"upgrade and modernize the facility\" which will reopen in October 2018 as Quantum Immunologics and that Eric Brown, M.D., a staff member since 1993, will be the medical director [45,46].

[Hide Full Content](#thirteen-thousand-one-hundred-eighty-three) [Stay Away from Donsbach University Graduates](https://quackwatch.org/related/donsbachuniversity/) During the past 25 years, nonaccredited correspondence schools and other organizations have issued thousands of \"degrees\" and certificates which suggest that the recipient is a qualified expert in nutrition. These documents are promoted as though they are equivalent in meaning to established credentials\u2014which they are not. Whereas nutrition degrees from accredited schools generally take several years to acquire, Donsbach degrees could be obtained in less than a year. Some cases involve no schooling at all but mere payment of a fee. The most conspicuous nonaccredited school was Donsbach University of Huntington Beach, California, whose president, Kurt W.

During the past 25 years, nonaccredited correspondence schools and other organizations have issued thousands of \"degrees\" and certificates which suggest that the recipient is a qualified expert in nutrition. These documents are promoted as though they are equivalent in meaning to established credentials\u2014which they are not. Whereas nutrition degrees from accredited schools generally take several years to acquire, Donsbach degrees could be obtained in less than a year. Some cases involve no schooling at all but mere payment of a fee. The most conspicuous nonaccredited school was Donsbach University of Huntington Beach, California, whose president, [Kurt W. Donsbach, D.C](donsbach.html)., is one of the world's most notorious promoters of dubious health information and treatment. I have been closely monitoring his activities since 1971. Although Donsbach has placed various letters after his name, he has never acquired an accredited degree. In 1957, he graduated from Western States Chiropractic College, in Portland, Oregon, and practiced as a chiropractor in Montana, \"specializing in treatment of arthritic and rheumatoid disorders.\" Later he acquired a license to practice naturopathy in Oregon, based on a document that was later revealed to be a forgery. From 1961 to 1965, he worked in \"research development and marketing\" for Standard Process Laboratories (a division of Royal Lee's Vitamin Products Company) and the Lee Foundation for Nutritional Research, headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. While Donsbach worked for Lee, he lived in California, did literature research, and gave nutrition seminars, primarily to chiropractors who were interested in marketing the company's products to their patients. In 1962, while Donsbach was still employed, Lee and the Vitamin Products Company were convicted of misbranding 115 special dietary products by making false claims for the treatment of more than 500 diseases and conditions. Lee received a one-year suspended prison term and was fined $7,000. In 1963, a prominent FDA official said Lee was \"probably the largest publisher of unreliable and false nutritional information in the world.\" Lee died in 1967. After Lee became ill, Donsbach left his employ and opened a health food store in Westminster, California, and Westpro Laboratories, in Garden Grove, California, which repackaged dietary supplements and a few drugs. From 1975 to 1989, Donsbach served as board chairman of the National Health Federation, a group that promotes the full gamut of quackery. Four Criminal Convictions In 1970, undercover agents of the Fraud Division of the California Bureau of Food and Drug observed Donsbach represent to customers in his store that vitamins, minerals, and/or herbal tea were effective against cancer, heart disease, emphysema (a chronic lung disease), and many other ailments. Most of the products Donsbach \"prescribed\" were packaged by Westpro Labs. Charged with nine counts of illegal activity, Donsbach pleaded guilty in 1971 to one count of practicing medicine without a license and agreed to cease \"nutritional consultation.\" He was assessed $2,750 and served two years' summary probation. In 1973, Donsbach was charged with nine more counts of illegal activity, including misbranding of drugs; selling, holding for sale, or offering for sale, new drugs without having the proper applications on file; and manufacturing drugs without a license. After pleading \"no contest\" to one of the \"new drug\" charges, he was ordered to pay a small fine and was placed on two years' summary probation with the provision that he rid himself of all proprietary interest in Westpro Labs. In 1974, Donsbach was found guilty of violating his probation and was fined again. In 1996, after a lengthy investigation by the U.S. Justice Department, he was indicted and pleaded guilty to smuggling unapproved drugs into the U.S. and not paying income tax on the money he made for selling them. In a plea bargain with the U.S. Attorney's office, he forfeited about $165,000 and paid an additional $150,000 in back taxes. In 1997, Donsbach was sentenced to a year in federal prison by a federal judge, but the sentence was later changed to six months of \"house arrest,\" during which time he was permitted to conduct business as usual in Mexico and elsewhere. In 2009, Donsbach was arrested and charged with treating patients without a license, misbranding drugs for sale, grand theft, unlawfully dispensing drugs as a cure for cancer, and falsely representing a cure for cancer. In 2010, he pleaded guilty to 13 felony charges: five counts of practicing medicine without a license, five counts of selling/distributing misbranded drugs, and one count each of of attempted grand theft, grand theft, and being a felon in possession of a firearm. He also admitted that he personally inflicted a great bodily injury on one of the victims related to the unlicensed practice of medicine. In 2011, he was sentenced him to a year in prison to be followed by ten years of probation, during which he is prohibited from representing himself as any type of health practitioner. The judge also imposed a $60,000 fine. History of Donsbach University During the mid-1970s, Donsbach affiliated with nonaccredited Union University and reported that he had acquired MS and PhD \"degrees\" in nutrition from the school. During 1977, Union formed a nutrition department with Donsbach as its \"dean\" Donsbach subsequently launched and became president of his own school, Donsbach University, which in 1979 became \"authorized\" by California to grant degrees. This status had nothing to do with accreditation or other academic recognition, but merely required the filing of an affidavit which described the school's program and asserted that it had at least $50,000 in assets. But [ads for the school](https://cdn.centerforinquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2021/05/29155820/donsbach_university_ad_1980.pdf) offered a \"recognized and authorized degree in nutrition\" in \"less than a year.\" The picture below, appeared in many of Donsbach's ads. The small print under it says, \"Artists's concept of new building to be completed in the near future.\" I have seen no evidence that the building was completed, and I would be surprised if construction was ever started. The picture to the right shows the \"diploma\" that appeared in the same ads. Donsbach University operated mainly by mail. Initially, it offered courses leading to B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. \"degrees\" in nutrition. Its original \"catalog\" was a 4-page flyer. The original \"faculty\" had seven members, including Donsbach, Alan H. Nittler, M.D., and Rayy, an unlicensed practitioner of iridology. Its 16-person advisory advisory board included Nittler, Richard Passwater, \"Ph.D.,\" Betty Morales, Benjamin Colimore, \"Ph.D,\" and Bruce Halstead, M.D. - Nittler's California medical license had been revoked in 1975 because he practiced unscientific \"nutritional therapies.\" - Passwater's \"degree\" was issued by [Bernadean University](../../04ConsumerEducation/Nonrecorg/bernadean.html), a nonaccredited correspondence school that was located in Nevada but was not authorized to operate within the state or to grant degrees. - Morales marketed dietary supplements and performed \"nutritional consultation\" by mail. Some of her products were marketed with illegal therapeutic claims. In 1976, she recommended a long list of useless products in response to an inquiry from me that described the symptoms of blurred vision characteristic of glaucoma. - Colimore's \"Ph.D.\" was issued by Donsbach University. In 1980, he and his wife were prosecuted by the Los Angeles City Attorney for conduct during the operation of their health food store. Prosecution was initiated after a customer complained that the Colimores had diagnosed a bad heart valve, pancreatic abscesses and benign growths of her liver, intestine and stomach\u2014all based on an analysis of her hair\u2014and prescribed two products from the store. After pleading \"no contest\" to one count of practicing medicine without a license, the Colimores were fined $2,000, given a 60-day suspended jail sentence, and placed on probation for two years. - Halstead was convicted in 1987 in the State of California of 24 counts of fraud for prescribing an \"herbal tea\" to cancer patients. The original catalog listed 14 \"textbooks\" required for the \"core curriculum.\" Four of these were actual textbooks, but the rest were books written for the general public by promoters of questionable nutrition practices who recommend dietary supplements for the prevention and/or treatment of a wide range of diseases. In addition to Donsbach, these included Carlton Fredericks and [Lendon Smith](../../04ConsumerEducation/lendonsmith.html). Fredericks, who had no formal nutrition training, was convicted of practicing medicine without a license in New York in 1945. Smith, a pediatrician, was placed on probation by the Oregon Board of Medical Examiners from 1971 through 1979 for \"inappropriate prescribing of drugs\" to adult heroin addicts. In 1988, he permanently surrendered his license to settle charges of insurance fraud filed by the Oregon Board. The catalog also listed 18 textbooks under the \"Advanced Graduate Study\" program. Of these, 15 were not recognized textbooks but were written by promoters of questionable nutrition practices who recommend dietary supplements for the prevention and/or treatment of a wide range of diseases. The authors included Donsbach, Smith, the Colimores, Passwater (2), and Emory Thurston, Ph.D., who in 1973 was convicted, fined and placed on two years' probation in the State of California after selling laetrile to a woman who told him she had cancer. The 1981 Donsbach University tuition schedule listed a registration fee of $100 and a tuition fee of $3,045, with a 20% discount for prepayment. In 1985, the MS/Ph.D. tuition was $4,495 with a 20% discount for prepayment. Donsbach claims that the school served over 4,000 students. The significance of this number is unclear. In 1980, the California Board of Registered Nursing approved Donsbach University as continuing education provider. However, after receiving complaints, the board concluded that his credentials and training were problematic and that substantial portions of the course materials for his \"Nutrition in Action\" course were \"inaccurate and not related to scientific knowledge required for the practice of nursing.\" In 1984, the board withdrew its approval but, after Donsbach petitioned for a rehearing, the case was settled by a stipulation in which the board set aside its withdrawal and Donsbach surrendered his provider number and agreed not to apply for another one for at least five years. During the proceedings, Donsbach submitted a CV in which stated that Union University had awarded him a Master of Science degree in molecular biology in 1975 and a Ph.D. degree in nutritional science in 1976. However, [Union University president Robert Pfeiffer stated in a letter](https://centerforinquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/quackwatch/pfeiffer.pdf) that (a) that Donsbach had never been a student at Union, (b) the school had never offered the degrees Donsbach claimed (molecular biology and nutritional science), and (c) the school lacked the laboratories and other facilities that would be necessary to provide such degrees. Donsbach's petition for rehearing vigorously disputed this, but the the stipulated settlement prevented further consideration of this issue. Phony Accreditation In catalogs and advertisements during the early 1980s, Donsbach University maintained that it was accredited by the National Accreditation Association (NAA). This \"agency\" was bogus. I t was created in 1980 by a California chiropractor and two members of his family. A few months later, Donsbach University announced that it had become accredited. In 1981, Dr. William Jarvis, President of the National Council Against Health Fraud, visited NAA in Maryland and found that its \"office\" was a telephone in the living room of its executive director, who said he received $100-a-month salary. Although NAA correspondence had designated the man as holding a \"Ph.D.\" from the Sussex College of Technology in England, the British Embassy informed Jarvis that it did not consider the \"school\" or its diplomas valid. NAA was never recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education or the Council on Postsecondary Accreditation. In 1981, California authorities ordered Donsbach to stop representing that his school was accredited without mentioning that the agency was not recognized. In 1984, Donsbach University announced that it had been recognized as a candidate for accreditation by the National Association of Private, Nontraditional Schools and Colleges (NAPNSC) as of March 3, 1984. Documents in my possession indicate that NAPNSC began trying to gain recognition from the U.S. Secretary of Education in 1976 and from the Council on Postsecondary Accreditation in 1977 but was not successful. An NAPNSC position paper dated March 20, 1984, stated that neither agency had any intention of permitting NAPNSC to become recognized. In about 1987, Donsbach University was renamed International University for Nutrition Education and Jacob Swilling assumed its ownership. In a 1997 [deposition](https://centerforinquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/quackwatch/swilling_depo.pdf), he indicated that the number of students dwindled from about 4,000 in 1985 to 2,000 in 1989 and about 60 in 1996. After that, as a result of a change in California law, the school was no longer authorized to grant degrees. The New York State Injunctions Donsbach also operated the International Institute of Natural Health Sciences, a company through which he marketed numerous misleading publications and a \"Nutrient Deficiency Test\" which was taught to students and used nationwide by chiropractors and bogus nutritionists. In July 1985, the New York Attorney General brought actions against Donsbach, his university, and the International Institute, charging that they lacked legal authorization to conduct business within New York State and that it was illegal to advertise nonaccredited degrees to state residents. Abrams also charged that the institute's \"Nutrient Deficiency Test\" was a scheme to defraud consumers. This test was composed of 245 yes/no questions about symptoms. When the answers were fed into a computer, a report of supposed nutrient deficiencies and medical conditions was printed out. The questions did not provide a basis for evaluating nutritional status. A scientist with the FDA's Buffalo district office who analyzed the computer program (in connection with prosecution of a Donsbach University \"graduate\") found that no matter how the questions were answered, the test reported several \"nutrient deficiencies\" and almost always recommended an identical list of vitamins, minerals, and digestive enzymes. The questionnaire also contained questions about the subject's food intake during the past week. However, the answers given did not affect the printout of supposed deficiencies [1,2]. In 1986, Donsbach and his Institute agreed to: (a) stop marketing in New York State all current versions of its nutrient deficiency questionnaire and associated computer analysis services, (b) place conspicuous disclaimers on future versions of the questionnaire to indicate that the test should not be used for the diagnosis or treatment of any disease by either consumers or professionals, and (3) pay $1,000 in costs. Donsbach and the university agreed to disclose in any direct mailings to New York residents or in any nationally distributed publication that the school's degree programs were not registered with the New York Department of Education and were not accredited by a recognized agency. The university also agreed to pay $500 to New York State [3,4]. In 1987, Jacob Swilling assumed ownership of Donsbach University, which was renamed International University for Nutrition Education but soon went defunct. Since that time Donsbach's primary activity has been the operation of [Hospital Santa Monica](http://www.hospitalsantamonica.com/index.htm), a Mexican clinic that offers dubious treatments for cancer and other serious diseases. Donsbach's \"Graduates\" Donsbach University \"graduates\" typically refer to themselves as \"nutrition consultants,\" a term also used by some reputable nutritionists. Some are still in practice. At least four Donsbach \"PhD's\" have been in legal difficulty: [Jacob W. Kulp, DC, practiced chiropractic in Cheektowaga, New York. In 1983, he pled guilty to a charge of violating federal drug law by claiming that wheat bran tablets would improve a patient's nutrient absorption by eliminating \"black intestinal plaque\"\u2014a condition unknown to medical science. The \"patient\" was an undercover agent for the U.S. Postal Inspection Service who paid $25 for the advice. Kulp was sentenced to six months' probation with special conditions that he not pose as a nutritionist or give nutritional advice through broadcast media unless he acquires a graduate degree in nutrition from an accredited college or university.] [Sandi Mitchell practiced as a nutrition consultant in Alabama. In 1985, she was permanently restrained from \"the maintenance of an office where the individual care and treatment of persons is performed, including the diagnosis of human diseases or conditions, the giving of instructions on good nutrition thereon, recommendation of colon irrigation, and recommendation and sale of vitamins, food supplements and homeopathic medicines.\" She was also barred from performing diagnostic tests or using the designation \"Dr.\" or giving individual advice to specific persons for human diseases and condition [5].] [Gary Pace practiced as a nutrition consultant in New York City. In 1985, New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams filed a civil suit accusing Pace of practicing medicine without a license, false advertising, and illegal use of educational credentials. Pace's schemes, said Abrams, induced hundreds of consumers to pay him for improper physical examinations, worthless laboratory tests (including hair analysis and herbal crystallization analysis), bogus nutritional advice, and unnecessary vitamin, mineral, and herbal supplements. The case against Pace was supported by affidavits from thirteen aggrieved clients and two undercover investigators, all of whom had been advised to take supplements. Some of the female clients reported that Pace had examined their breasts or genitals. Several clients underwent significant expense to obtain medical reassurance that they did not have various diseases that Pace said they had. One was advised by her medical doctor to stop taking vitamin A because her palms had become yellow as a result of overdosage. Abrams said that at least 251 clients had paid Pace an average of $307 during the previous four years. Many had been attracted by his ad, which was the largest of eleven listings in the \"Nutritionists\" section of the Nassau County Yellow Pages. Pace also taught in the extension division of a local community college and hosted a radio program. The investigators discovered that the \"free consultation\" promised in Pace's Yellow Page ad was merely the brief telephone conversation in which he advised prospective clients to make an appointment. The case was settled with an injunction forbidding Pace from engaging in the unlawful practice of medicine or using \"Ph.D.\" or \"Dr.\" in dealings with the public unless he obtains a degree from an institution recognized by New York State. Pace agreed to pay $2,000 to the state and to make restitution to dissatisfied clients. He also agreed not to do further \"nutritional counseling\" unless he obtained proper credentials or posts a $150,000 bond.] [Raymond J. Salani](../../11Ind/salani.html), who practiced as a \"nutrition consultant,\" was charged in 1989 by the New Jersey Attorney General and the state board of medical examiners with practicing medicine without a license, violating the state's clinical laboratory act, and committing insurance and consumer fraud. The complaint stated that Salani misused the term \"doctor, \"prescribed excessive quantities of food supplements\" that were ineffective or potentially toxic, and issued fraudulent reports to insurance companies. In December 1989, a superior court judge enjoined Salani from representing to the public that he has a doctoral degree unless he acquires one from an accredited school. A few months later, the judge approved a consent agreement barring Salani from representing himself as a doctor, recommending supplements for any specific medical problem (except under medical supervision), diagnosing medical conditions or symptoms, or filling out insurance forms in a misleading manner. Salani was also required to inform clients that the FDA does not recognize any need or usefulness for the products he typically recommends. He also was assessed $11,000, part of which was used for restitution to insurance companies and former patients. In 1994 and 2017, he was charged with violating the 1990 order. [Jacob Swilling](http://www.healthydoctors.com/drswilling.htm)is described on the \"Healthy Doctors\" Web site as \"internationally known for his advanced work in the field of Biological Medicine.\" Between 1983 and 1985, while residing in South Africa, he obtained bachelor's, master, and PhD \" degrees from Donsbach University. Shortly afterward, he emigrated to the United States to help Kurt Donsbach operate the school and wound up assuming its ownership. - Larry Lytle, DDS, began manufacturing and distributing low-level laser devices in 1997, shortly before the South Dakota Board of Dentistry had revoked his dental license for fraud and substandard patient care. A federal complaint, filed in 2014, charged that Lytle, doing business as QLasers PMA and 2035 PMA, had marketed a dozen devices with illegal claims that they could treat \"over 200 different diseases and disorders,\" including cancer, cardiac arrest, deafness, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, macular degeneration, and venereal disease. The case ended with a permanent injunction against continuing to market the devices. [George Zabrecky, DC](../../11Ind/zabrecky.html), is a Connecticut chiropractor who treats cancer patients. In 1991, his license was suspended for six months and he was successfully sued for treating a cancer patient with cellular products that appeared to have destroyed the man's liver. - In 2004, the California Board of Chiropractic Examiners ordered former bodybuilding champion Franco Columbu, D.C., to stop claiming on his letterhead that he had a Ph.D. from Donsbach University. [The Sacramento Bee reported this](http://www.sacbee.com/111/story/153688.html)after Columbu was appointed to the board by Governor Arnold Schwarzennegger. The Bee article also noted that Columbu, who had trained with Schwarzenegger and served as best man at his wedding, was still mentioning on his [Web site](http://www.columbu.com)that he had a Ph.D. in nutrition. Other Donsbach Public Protection Efforts As Donsbach graduates began representing themselves to the public as nutrition professionals, the American Dietetic Association began a drive for passage of state laws to restrict use of the word \"nutritionist\" to qualified professionals with accredited training. So far, more than 40 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws to regulate nutritionists. Some make it illegal for unqualified persons to call themselves dietitians or nutritionists, while others define nutrition practice and who is eligible to practice. The most basic requirement is completion of accredited training. Licensing does not offer complete protection against all forms of nutrition practice conducted privately between consenting adults. (It does not, for example, protect people from the poor advice offered by many chiropractors, acupuncturists, naturopaths, and health-food retailers.) But it can deter untrained individuals from widely advertising that they are experts. References [Notice of petition](http://www.casewatch.net/ag/ny/donsbach/du_petition_1985.pdf).

What sells is not the quality of their logic or their products, but the ability to influence their audience. Their basic strategies are to promise the moon and/or knock the \"competition.\" To one and all, they promise better health and a longer life. They offer solutions for virtually every health problem, including some they have invented. To those in pain, they promise relief. To the incurable, they offer hope. To the nutrition-conscious, they say, \"Make sure you have enough.\" To a public worried about pollution, they say, \"Buy natural.\" For ailments amenable to scientific health care, they offer \"safer nontoxic alternatives.\" And they have an arsenal of ploys for defending themselves against criticism. To gain your allegiance it is not necessary to persuade you that all of the statements below are true. Just one may be enough to hook you. \"We really care about you!\" Although being \"cared about\" may provide a powerful psychological lift, it will not make a worthless remedy effective. It may also encourage over-reliance on an inappropriate therapy. \"We treat the whole patient.\" There is nothing wrong with giving due attention to a patient's lifestyle and social and emotional concerns in addition to physical problems. In fact, good physicians have always done this. Today, however, most practitioners who claim to offer \"alternative,\" \"complementary,\" \"integrative,\" or \"holistic\" health methods are engaged in quackery and embrace such terms as marketing tools. Few actually \"treat the whole patient.\" \"No side effects\" \"Alternative\" methods are often described as safer, gentler, and/or without side effects. If this were true\u2014and often it is not\u2014their \"remedy\" would be too weak to have any effect. Any medication potent enough to help people will be potent enough to cause side effects. FDA approval requires evidence that the likelihood of benefit far exceeds the probable harm. \"We attack the cause of disease.\" Quacks claim that whatever they do will not only cure the ailment but will also prevent future trouble. This claim is false. Illness can result from many factors, both internal and external, some of which have been identified and some of which are unknown. Scientific medical care can prevent certain diseases and reduce the odds of getting various others. \"We treat medicine's failures.\" It is often suggested that people seek \"alternatives\" because doctors are brusque, and that if doctors were more attentive, their patients would not turn to quacks. It is true that this sometimes happens, but most quackery does not involve medical care. Blaming doctors for quackery's persistence is like blaming astronomers for the popularity of astrology. Some people's needs exceed what ethical, scientific health care can provide. Some harbor deep-seated antagonism toward medical care and the concept of a scientific method. But the main reason for quackery's success is its ability to seduce people who are unsuspecting, gullible, or desperate. Several years ago, a survey done in New Zealand found that most cancer patients who used \"alternative\" therapies were satisfied with their medical care and regarded \"alternative\" care only as a supplement [1]. A more recent study found that only 4.4% of those surveyed reported relying primarily on alternative therapies. The author concluded: Along with being more educated and reporting poorer health status, the majority of alternative medicine users appear to be doing so not so much as a result of being dissatisfied with conventional medicine but largely because they find these health care alternatives to be more congruent with their own values, beliefs, and philosophical orientations toward health and life [2]. \"Think positive!\" Many quack promoters suggest that use of their method(s) will provide mental benefit that transcends the physical properties of their remedy. This is typically described with terms like \"mind/body interaction,\" \"mind over matter,\" or the power of positive thinking. A positive attitude may make people more apt to comply with an effective treatment regimen. Contrary to \"popular wisdom,\" however, there is little scientific evidence that optimism or faith in a treatment causes people to live longer or to recover faster from an illness. Even if there were, it would not outweigh the dangers of misplaced trust. \"Jump on the bandwagon.\" Quacks and vitamin pushers use several strategies to claim that their methods are popular (which may or may not be true), that popularity is a sign of effectiveness (which often is untrue), and that therefore you should try them. The popularity claim may involve endorsements or testimonials (which are inherently misleading) or statistics (which typically are inflated). The statistics can include the number of consumers supposedly using a method, how long the method has been in use, the number of practitioners administering it, and/or the length of time a practitioner or facility has been in business. \"Time-tested\" or \"Used for centuries!\" This ploy suggests that the length of time a remedy has been used is a measure of its effectiveness. Its promoters imply that if the remedy didn't work, it wouldn't remain available. Some promoters claim (sometimes truthfully, sometimes not) that their methods have been handed down from generation to generation, are steeped in folk wisdom, were derived from ancient writings, or the like. The falsity of this ploy is easily seen by noting that astrology has survived for thousands of years with no reliable evidence of any validity. Note, too, that many genuine methods survive briefly because they are replaced by more effective ones. \"Backed by scientific studies\" Since most people regard scientific evidence as a plus, unscientific promoters claim to have it when in fact they do not. Their writings may list dozens or even hundreds of publications that supposedly support what they say. But the references they cite may be untraceable, misinterpreted, outdated, irrelevant, nonexistent, and/or based on poorly designed research. The classic example is [Adelle Davis](../../04ConsumerEducation/davis.html)'s book Let's Get Well, which lists 2,402 references. Many did not support her viewpoints and some were not even related to the passage in which they were cited. What should count is not the number of references but their quality and relevance\u2014which the average reader will find difficult or impossible to judge. When talking with experts, quacks may acknowledge that \"some aspects of what we do are not well understood,\" thus implying that other aspects are solidly based and the rest will eventually be substantiated. \"Studies are underway.\" If no studies exist, quacks often claim that research is underway. If that is true, they imply that if their method were not effective, reputable researchers would not spend time and money to study it. If a genuine study fails, the quacks invariably claim that it was not properly designed. Moreover, in many cases, the research claim is a complete fabrication. \"Take charge of your health!\" This is probably the most powerful slogan in the quack's bag of tricks. People generally like to feel that they are in control of their life. Quacks take advantage of this fact by giving their clients things to do-such as taking vitamin pills, preparing special foods, meditating, and the like. The activity may provide a psychological lift, but believing in false things tends to carry a high price tag. The price may be financial, psychological (when disillusionment sets in), physical (when the method is harmful or the person abandons effective care), or social (diversion from more constructive activities) [3]. \"Think for yourself.\" Quacks urge people to disregard scientific evidence (which they cannot produce) in favor of personal experience (theirs or yours). But personal experience is not the best way to determine whether a method works. When someone feels better after having used a product or procedure, it is natural to give credit to whatever was done. Most ailments are self-limiting, and even incurable conditions can have sufficient day-to-day variation to enable quack methods to gain large followings. In addition, taking action often produces temporary relief of symptoms (a placebo effect). For these reasons, scientific experimentation is almost always necessary to establish whether health methods are really effective. Individual experience rarely provides a basis for separating cause-and-effect from coincidence. Nor can the odds of a treatment working be determined without following participants in a well-designed study and tabulating failures as well as successes\u2014something quacks don't do. \"What have you got to lose?\" Quacks and vitamin pushers would like you to believe that their methods are harmless and therefore there is nothing to lose by trying them. With vitamins taken as \"nutrition insurance,\" for example, many people feel as though they are making a bet with very little to lose and a great deal to gain. If a method doesn't work, do the odds of it causing physical harm really matter? Moreover, some quack methods are directly harmful; others harm by diverting people from proven methods. All waste people's time and/or money. \"If only you had come earlier.\" This phrase is handy when the treatment fails. It encourages patients and their survivors not to face the fact that consulting the quack was a mistake. \"Science doesn't have all the answers.\" Quacks use this ploy to suggest looking beyond what scientific medicine has to offer; they also imply that since medical care has limitations, they are entitled to have them too. Medical science doesn't claim to have all the answers, but its effectiveness keeps increasing because the scientific method offers ways to find more answers. The idea that people should turn to quack remedies when frustrated by science's inability to control a disease is irrational. Quackery lacks genuine answers and has no method for finding them. \"Don't be afraid to experiment.\" This advice is typically based on the clich\u00e9 that \"what works for one person may not work for someone else with the same problem.\" Although this statement is literally true, scientific methods enable us to determine which methods are most likely to work and which ones are not worth trying. If a barrel is full of apples that are obviously rotten, does it make sense to sample all of them to see whether one tastes good? \"Let's work together.\" This ploy is used to portray quacks as \"nice guys\" while suggesting that their critics are not. \"Since science doesn't have the answers,\" they may say, \"let's put our differences aside and work together for the common good.\" That would be fine if they had something to offer besides empty promises. Proponents of \"complementary medicine\" (also called \"integrative medicine\") claim to integrate scientific and \"alternative\" medicine, using the best of both. Is it helpful to add ineffective methods to effective ones? Does it make sense to go to someone who uses the \"best\" ineffective methods? Is someone whose reasoning process is faulty enough to believe in such things as homeopathy likely to deliver high-quality medical care? Do \"complementary\" practitioners use reliable methods as often as they should? From what we have seen, the answer to each of these questions is no. \"Keep an open mind.\" Quacks portray themselves as innovators and suggest that their critics are rigid, elitist, biased, and closed to new ideas. Actually, they have things backwards. The real issue is whether a method works. Science provides ways to judge and discard unfounded ideas. Medical science progresses as new methods replace less effective ones. Quack methods persist as long as they remain marketable. Even after they are gone, they still may be glorified. Open-mindedness is the willingness to follow where the evidence leads and should include willingness to defer to impartial investigations rather than one's own predilections [4]. It is not close-minded to reject ideas that are unsubstantiated and lack a scientifically plausible rationale. Nor is it close-minded to rely upon the vast body of accumulated scientific knowledge as a guide to giving advice or making practical decisions. \"Why don't you clean your own house!\" This type of statement comes up most often in debates between scientific and \"alternative\" practitioners, usually when the latter is not a medical doctor. Its aim is to portray the critic as a meddler or as someone with a grudge. The simple answer is that the shortcomings of medical care do not justify any form of quackery. Unnecessary surgery, for example, is an abuse of something that works and is entirely different from quackery, which is the use of things that do not work. Another big difference is that quackery is organized. There is no national organization of \"Surgeons Dedicated to Unnecessary Surgery,\" but there are national organizations dedicated to quackery. Moreover, unlike members of the scientific community, quacks rarely criticize their own methodology or that of their colleagues. \"Prove me wrong!\" Quacks try to stand science on its head by demanding that their critics prove them wrong. Or they may say, \"How do you know it doesn't work if you haven't tried it?\" But there are not enough resources to test every idea that is proposed; for this reason, scientists tend to pursue those that seem most promising. Under the rules of science, the burden of proof is on the person who makes the claim. Unproven methods that lack a plausible rationale should be considered worthless until proven otherwise. Personal experience is not a substitute for scientific testing. \"We have no money for research.\" When challenged about the lack of scientific evidence supporting what they espouse, promoters of quackery often claim that they lack the money to carry out research. However, preliminary research does not require funding or even much effort. The principal ingredients are careful clinical observations, detailed record-keeping, and long-term follow-up \"to keep score.\" Advocates of \"alternative\" methods almost never do any of these things. Most who clamor for research do so as a ploy to arouse public sympathy. The last thing they want is a scientific test that could prove them wrong. If a scientific study is performed and comes out negative, proponents invariably claim that it was conducted improperly or that the evaluators were biased. Proponents of so-called \"natural\" products (dietary supplements and herbs) often complain that funding is difficult or impossible to obtain because the products can't be patented and therefore drug companies have little incentive to study them. That may be true for some products, but it is certainly not true for all. Think, for a moment, about plain, ordinary aspirin. Although not patentable, it has been subjected to thousands of published studies. \"I'll be happy to show you my data.\" Some promoters invite critics to visit their clinic, examine their records, and talk with their patients. If the offer is accepted, would they actually permit the visit. If so, would visitors be given access to patient files? Even if they were, looking at records (which may contain false information) could not establish that a method is effective. Nor could talking with patients. But seeming to be open to inspection may make the promoters look more credible. \"I'm too busy getting sick people well.\" Quacks use this response when asked why they have not tabulated their supposedly good results and submitted them for publication in a scientific journal. The key question, of course, is how can you know whether a method works without keeping careful score. The correct answer is that you can't. Even simple scorekeeping may provide significant information. In 1983, a naturopath named Steve Austin visited the Gerson Clinic and asked about thirty cancer patients to permit him to follow their progress. He was able to track 21 of them through annual letters or phone calls. At the five-year mark, only one was still alive (but not cancer-free); the rest had succumbed to their cancer. \"They persecuted Galileo!\" The history of science is laced with instances where great pioneers and their discoveries were met with resistance. William Harvey (nature of blood circulation), Joseph Lister (antiseptic technique) and Louis Pasteur (germ theory) are notable examples. Today's quacks boldly claim that they, too, are scientists ahead of their time. Close examination, however, will show how unlikely this is. The ideas of Galileo, Harvey, Lister, and Pasteur's overcame their opposition because they were demonstrated to be sound. \"Health freedom\" Quacks use the slogan \" [health freedom](hfreedom.html)\" to divert attention away from themselves and toward victims of disease with whom we are naturally sympathetic. Quacks who insist that \"people should have the freedom to choose whatever treatments they want\" would like us to overlook two things. First, no one wants to be cheated, especially in matters of life and health. Victims of disease do not demand quack treatments because they want to exercise their \"rights,\" but because they have been persuaded that they offer hope. Second, the laws that outlaw worthless nostrums are not directed against the victims of disease but at the promoters who attempt to exploit them. These laws simply require that products offered in the health marketplace be both safe and effective. If only safety were required, any substance that would not kill you on the spot could be hawked to the gullible. \"Toxins are everywhere.\" This general ploy attempts to undermine public trust in science-based medical care, public health measures, our food supply, and lots of useful consumer products. In addition to recommending avoidance, many of the critics offer \"detoxification\" products and services [5]. \"We offer alternatives.\" Quackery promoters are adept at using slogans and buzzwords. During the 1970s, they popularized the word \"natural\" as a magic sales word. During the 1980s, the word \"holistic\" gained similar use. Today's leading buzzword is \"alternative.\" Correctly used, \"alternative\" refers to methods that have equal value for a particular purpose. (An example would be two antibiotics capable of killing a particular organism.) When applied to questionable methods, however, the term is misleading because methods that are unsafe or ineffective are not reasonable alternatives to proven treatment. For this reason, we place the word \"alternative\" in quotation marks when it refers to methods not generally accepted by the scientific community and which have no plausible rationale [6]. \"Only 10-20% of medical procedures are proved\" This figure was stated in a 1978 Office of Technology report but its source turned out to be a 1963 survey of 19 physicians who practiced in a northern British town during two weeks in 1961 and 1962 [7]. During the past 30 years, many studies have looked at the extent to which medical decisions in various settings were evidence-based. A 2001 repor that summarized 15 such studies found that scientifically supportable interventions ranged from 45% to 97%, with a median of 77% [8]. Because \"alternative\" methods are defined as unproven, the comparable figure for them would be zero. References - Clinical Oncology Group. New Zealand cancer patients and alternative medicine.

The cause of MS is unknown, but the most attractive theory is that it is an immune reaction to the nervous system. Its symptoms include muscular weakness, loss of coordination, and difficulty with speech and vision. It occurs chiefly in young adults and, like arthritis, can have a very variable course. Some people have only a single attack. Others have only a few attacks in a lifetime, recover from these, and experience no disability except during attacks. Others have frequent attacks from which they don't recover completely, but which cause only partial disability. Still others have ... Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a degenerative disease in which patches of inflammation and scarring interfere with the function of the brain, spinal cord, and/or the nerves to the eyes. The cause of MS is unknown, but the most attractive theory is that it is an immune reaction to the nervous system. Its symptoms include muscular weakness, loss of coordination, and difficulty with speech and vision. It occurs chiefly in young adults and, like arthritis, can have a very variable course. Some people have only a single attack. Others have only a few attacks in a lifetime, recover from these, and experience no disability except during attacks. Others have frequent attacks from which they don't recover completely, but which cause only partial disability. Still others have a slow progression of disability over a period of 10 to 25 years, which eventually leaves them helpless. When attacks occur, symptoms may come and go suddenly and may even vary from hour to hour. MS's extreme variability makes it a perfect disease for quacks. The only way to know whether a treatment is effective is to follow many patients for years to see whether those who receive the treatment do better than those who do not. Quacks don't bother with this kind of testing, however. They simply claim credit whenever anyone who consults them improves. And since the majority of attacks are followed by complete or partial recovery, persuasive quacks can acquire patients who swear by whatever they recommend. The Therapeutic Claims Committee of the International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies analyzed more than a hundred alleged treatments and published the results in a book called Therapeutic Claims in Multiple Sclerosis, which underwent four editions between and 1982 and 1996. The book was updated and published again in 2001 and 2006 as Multiple Sclerosis: The Guide to Treatment and Management. Each analysis included a description of the method, the proponents' rationale, a scientific evaluation, estimate of risks and/or costs, and the authors' conclusion. The methods were then classified according to plausibility, extent of study, risk, and cost. No cure is known, but a few methods are useful in shortening the duration of attacks, reducing their severity, or helping to deal with the symptoms. Methods that have a plausible rational but have not been sufficiently tested are considered \"investigational.\" I am not listing the useful or investigational methods because I believe that advice about them should be obtained from a qualified neurologist who can thoroughly discuss them. Reliable information is also available from the [National Multiple Sclerosis Society](http://www.nmss.org/). The committee noted that no nutritional deficiency is known to be a factor in MS, and that no special diet or the addition of vitamins or minerals has been proven to alter its course. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have slight immunosuppressive properties, but studies involving sunflower seed oil, evening primrose oil, safflower seed oil, and fish oils, have produced conflicting results. The committee concluded that other than a possible benefit of PUFA-containing oils, there is no evidence that any dietary change affects MS. Methods to Avoid The methods considered implausible or ineffective are listed below. I believe these methods should be avoided: Adequately tested but ineffective in influencing the course of MS Aspirin and sodium salicylate; colchicine (for immune modulation); thymectomy factor; myelin basic protein; hyperbaric oxygen (HBO). Implausible and untested applied near the spinal column; magnet therapy; dental approaches such as correction of bad bite, TMJ treatments, or Bilicomb, Panpur, Panzynorm). Implausible and known to have significant risk or side effects ACTH or other corticosteroids administered into the plus hot tubs); acupuncture; electrical stimulation of the dorsal column of the spinal cord; hyperbaric oxygen (HBO); surgical spinal cord relaxation vertebral artery surgery; surgical implantation of pig brain tissue; Cambridge or other very-low-calorie liquid diets; high-dosage or vitamin C, and various vitamin or mineral regimens. [Superesonant Wavenergy (SRWE) Program] In the 1980s, Irving Dardik, M.D., a vascular surgeon, devised an exercise program which he claimed would to optimize the body's health patterns and lead to reversal of such disorders as multiple sclerosis. In 1995, New York State medical licensing authorities found him guilty of fraud, exercising undue influence, guaranteeing satisfaction or a cure, and failing to maintain adequate records. Case records indicate that he had charged four MS patients from $30,000 to $100,000 for their treatment. [His New York medical license was revoked,](../../11Ind/Dardik/index.html) he was fined $40,000, and his New Jersey license was subsequently revoked. One of the victimized patients, former TV investigative reporter Ellen Burstein MacFarlane, coauthored a book about her experience [1]. \"Amalgam Toxicity\" Scam A few hundred physicians and dentists have been falsely claiming that \"mercury toxicity\" from amalgam fillings cause multiple sclerosis and that removing them may cure it. This claim is false and fraudulent. The mercury is amalgam is tightly bound so that the amount that gets into the body over time is insignificant. Moreover, no scientific study has demonstrated that removing amalgam fillings helps patients with multiple sclerosis or any other ailment. I believe that practitioners who recommend amalgam replacement as a treatment for multiple sclerosis have extremely poor judgment and should be delicensed [2]. In 1990, the Iowa Supreme Court disciplinary action against Ronald Bob Hufford, D.D.S., who had extracted all of a patient's teeth after telling her that amalgam removal \"would improve her health and stop the progress of her M.S.\" The dental board suspended Hufford's license for five years. The Iowa Supreme Court's stated that the board had \"admirably performed its duty\" to uphold the standards of the dental profession [3] Calcium EAP Calcium ethylamino-phosphate (calcium EAP) has been promoted as a therapy or cure for MS and many other diseases. These claims are based on anecdotal reports rather than controlled clinical trials. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society has concluded that there is no objective evidence calcium EAP is effective against MS and \"because the treatment protocol includes many different agents and may include a powerful drug that suppresses the immune system, the proposed therapy is not without serious risk.\" [4] The major proponent, a German physician named Hans Nieper, died in 1998, but the substance is still marketed here and abroad. Coral Calcium \"Coral calcium\" is a dietary supplement said to be derived from \"remnants of living coral that have fallen from coral reefs, as a result of wave action or other natural processes.\" Since coral reefs are protected by law, \"coral calcium\" is made by grinding up limestone that no longer contains live organisms. Their principal promoter, Robert Barefoot, has claimed in widely aired infomercials that he has witnessed people with multiple sclerosis \"get out of wheelchairs just by getting on the coral.\" He doesn't say how he determined that patients with multiple sclerosis were actually helped by coral calcium. There is neither scientific evidence nor any logical reason to believe that they were [5]. The FTC charged Barefoot with false advertising and obtained an injunction against further advertising claims of this type. Hydrogen Peroxide Practitioners who advocate this type of therapy argue that diseases develop in people whose bodies lack sufficient oxygen. They claim that hydrogen peroxide is an effective treatment because it increases the cellular oxygen levels, thereby correcting the alleged deficiency. \"Oxidative therapy\" has also been promoted for the treatment of cancer, asthma, emphysema, AIDS, arthritis, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease. There is no scientific evidence that lack of cellular oxygen occurs as described by \"oxidative therapy\" proponents, that swallowing or injecting oxygen-rich substances actually effects cellular oxygen levels, or has any effect on the diseases it is used to treat. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society [6] and the American Cancer Society [7] have both warned that hydrogen peroxide therapy has not been proven safe or effective. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society was made in response to the death of a woman who had received hydrogen peroxide therapy [8]. Hyperbaric Oxygen Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) involves breathing pure oxygen in a specially designed chamber. It is appropriate for deep sea divers who suffer pressure problems (the \"bends\") after resurfacing). Some clinicians, particularly in the United Kingdom, speculate that some of the nerve damage in MS is caused by lack of oxygen. The most positive reports have not been based on controlled studies, so their data cannot be interpreted. In 2004, after an extensive literature search and analysis, the Cochrane Collaboration published a comprehensive review of the controlled studies\u2014two positive and seven negative. The reviewers concluded: We found no consistent evidence to confirm a beneficial effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and do not believe routine use is justified. The small number of analyses suggestive of benefit are isolated, difficult to ascribe with biological plausibility and would need to be confirmed in future well-designed trials. Such trials are not, in our view, justified by this review [9]. Prokarin (also called Procarin) is a skin cream that is administered using a patch that enables its ingredients to be absorbed. The treatment is based on a hypothesis that involves histamine and dates back to the 1940s. The primary promoter is Elaine DeLack, a nurse who \"discovered\" and patented a mixture of histamine and caffeine. Compounding pharmacists prepare the product, which is inexpensive to manufacture but is sold for about $250 for a month's supply. In February 2002, the journal Multiple Sclerosis published the results of a 12-week study of MS patients in which 21 people took Prokarin, 5 took a placebo, and all participants were asked to limit their intake of caffeinated beverages to one cup of regular coffee per day. The authors concluded that Prokarin produced a \"modest\" lessening of fatigue [10]. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society advised that the study was difficult to interpret because the number of participants was small; the numbers in the Prokarin and placebo groups were very different; the fact that Prokarin contains caffeine might mix up the results; and other reasons [11]. The Society also warned that Prokarin lacks a scientifically plausible rationale and has not been proven to modify the course of the disease and that while Prokarin does not appear to be harmful, the level of benefit does not justify its very high cost [12]. Prokarin proponents are promoting this study as showing that Prokarin \"works.\" But even if it can lessen fatigue, there is no reason to believe it can influence the course of the disease, which is why most people take it. In my opinion, it is a poor investment and any marketing that arouses hope that it will influence the course of MS is both unethical and may be illegal. If you encounter a pharmacist selling Prokarin, ask the state pharmacy board to investigate what claims are being made. Liberation Therapy The FDA has warned that \"liberation therapy\" (also called liberation procdure) is unproven and unsafe. The procedure, in which balloon angioplasty devices or stents are used to widen narrowed veins in the chest and neck, is based on the unproven idea that a narrowing of veins in the neck and chest (chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency) may cause MS or contribute its progression by impairing blood drainage from the brain and upper spinal cord. However, studies exploring a link between MS and CCSVI are inconclusive, and the criteria used to diagnose CCSVI have not been adequately established. The FDA warning was generated by reports of death, stroke, detachment and migration of the stents, damage to the treated vein, blood clots, cranial nerve damage and abdominal bleeding associated with the \"liberation\" procedure [13]. In 2017, Canadian researchers reported on two studies that should end the use of liberation therapy. In one, British Columbia residents who self-reported having had venoplasty were interviewed and followed for up to 24 months post-therapy using standardized structured questionnaires. At first, more than 40% of participants thought that the venoplasty had had positive effects on their health conditions, such as fatigue, numbness, balance, concentration/memory and mobility. However, this improvement was not maintained over time. In addition, 11.5% reported procedure-related complications and 17.3% reported complications within the first month after the procedure [14]. The other study was a controlled experiment in which 104 participants had a catheter inserted into their blocked veins, but only 49 had their vessel walls pushed out by inflating a small balloon. A year later brain imaging, standard assessments of MS symptoms, and the patients' own self-assessments were the same in both groups [15]. Aetna's List Aetna has issued a clinical policy bulletin that lists covered and not-covered MS treatments. The non-covered methods include for diagnosing MS; as electronystagmography (in the disorder); certain erythropoesis stimulating agents; ferritin/iron status (blood or CSF) for the diagnosis of MS; Gamma-interferon; gMS DX and gMS Pro EDSS tests for the diagnosis of MS; hyperbaric response; Naltrexone; Ocrelizumab; for macular edema; oral myelin (Myloral); otoacoustic absence of signs of hearing loss); photopheresis; plasmapheresis for chronic or Rituximab disease progression in MS; transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta; tumor necrosis factor antagonists; and tympanometry (in the absence of hearing loss) [15]. Aetna's list also includes other methods that are undergoing clinical trials and may have some therapeutic potential.

It summarizes scientific reports; legislative developments; Web site evaluations; recommended and nonrecommended books; and other information relevant to consumer protection and consumer decision-making. FTC warns companies about disclosures. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has sent warning letters to more than 60 companies\u2014including 20 of the 100 largest advertisers in the country\u2014that failed to make adequate disclosures in their television and print ads. The initiative\u2014Operation Full Disclosure\u2014focused on disclosures that were in fine print or were otherwise easy to miss or hard to read, yet contained important information needed to avoid misleading consumers. The FTC's letters advised the advertisers to ensure that any necessary disclosures are truly \"clear and conspicuous\" and asked them to report what remedial steps actions they intended to take. The targeted companies were not identified but included a wide range of industries and products. Makers of weight loss claims were warned that ads featuring testimonials claiming outlier results did not adequately disclose the weight loss that consumers generally could expect to achieve.

State Farm has withdrawn an ad featuring actor Rob Schneider. The company's action came in response to a vigorous social media campaign that questioned how a company that sells health insurance could hire a celebrity spokesperson who is so openly against vaccinations.

By creating the profession of heilpraktikers (\"practical healers\"), Hitler and his Nazi colleagues played a major role in initiating what is now called \"alternative medicine\" in Germany. Goebbels did this to keep the civilians happy because as soon as a war could be arranged, the real doctors were going to be sent off to tend the troops. The Nazis conducted tests and actually realized that practical healing didn't work. Goebbels' law, as well as legitimizing its practitioners, was intended to prohibit further training so that their numbers would dwindle after the war ended. However, in 1957 they got a court judgment overturning this restriction. Rusting greenhouses with broken windows stand near the electrified barbed wire fence of Hitler's death camp just north of Munich. Beds for plants are barely visible in the long grass. An old rake still leans against the oven where the medicinal herbs were dried. This was the Nazis' experimental herb garden at the concentration camp Dachau, a relic of their support for what has been successively known as holistic, alternative, complementary and integrative medicine [1]. Here, in addition to conducting grisly medical experiments on the inmates, the Nazis tested herbal remedies. This huge plantation was part of the Nazis attempt to cut medical costs in preparation for the war they were intending to start. Its 150 hectares (370 acres) comprised the largest garden for medicinal herbs in Europe. The beds held gladioli, peppergrass, chili, blackcurrant, sage, thyme and hundreds of others [2]. By systematically testing about a thousand varieties of plants, the Nazis hoped to find remedies for minor ailments that would be cheaper than drugs. Homeopathy, with its miniscule amounts of the supposedly active ingredients, sounded like an especially promising way to cut costs. And, of course, slave labor made it cheaper still. Even better, these thrifty herbal cures needn't be prescribed by doctors. The low-cost workforce of traditional healers could do the job. This motley crew already prescribed plant extracts, homeopathic potions, and water cures, taking advantage of the widespread belief in alternatives to conventional medicine in Germany during the 1930s. At that time about half a million Germans were formally enrolled in health clubs devoted to spreading these questionable cures, and this was just the tip of an iceberg of believers [3]. Even today, there are about 600 clubs, with more than 160,000 members, preaching the health doctrines of just a single one of these\u2014the treatments prescribed by the 19th-century Bavarian priest, Sebastian Kneipp [4]. Father Kneipp began his medical mission after he became convinced that he had cured his own tuberculosis by icy dips in the Danube in winter. These popular beliefs, if cleverly promoted, could be of use to the Nazis. And to make the Germans even more receptive to these low-cost cures, the Nazis set about to demonize scientific medicine. It was, they claimed, a plot by \"Jewish doctors.\" Of course, Jews were, indeed, overrepresented in medicine. A fifth of the doctors in Germany were of Jewish origin, and in Vienna it was well over half. This was related to centuries of persecution. Historically, medicine had been the only profession open to Jews, as this placed them in the front lines in battling the plagues of the Middle Ages. Someone had to do the dangerous job, and Jews were expendable [5]. The Nazis' creeping restrictions on Jewish doctors began right after their rise to power in Germany in 1933. They were expelled from the universities, forbidden to practice, and finally driven out of the country or killed. After Germany annexed Austria in 1938, the process was repeated there. The Medical Faculty in Vienna was \"cleansed\" of three quarters of its instructors, nearly all for having Jewish ancestry. Their colleagues who remained voiced little opposition [5]. The disappearance of the Jewish doctors lessened the competition for academic posts at the university and the competition for patients in the city. But if the remaining doctors thought they were now freed of competition, they were mistaken. In 1937 the Nazis disbanded the doctors' professional organizations and placed them under the control of the government. The groups of folk healers faced the same fate, but for them state control was an upward step, for it was accompanied by recognition as part of the medical profession. Now the real doctors found themselves on the same footing as herbalists, homeopaths, and apostles of Father Kneipp's water cures [3] Even in some hospitals the doctors were obliged to bow to the practices of their newly-recognized \"colleagues.\" In Stuttgart a whole hospital was run according to homeopathic doctrines. And at the Rudolf Hess Hospital in Dresden patients were treated with diet, fasting, and water cures. But the doctors didn't dare object. In the opening ceremony in Dresden in 1934 they were given a warning: \"If any colleagues, with the arrogance of scientific medicine, intend to look down upon the [alternative]. healers, these gentlemen would be well advised to seek a different profession.\" [3] Though bullying could silence the skeptics, it couldn't alter the facts. For three years, from 1936 until the war broke out, the Nazis cultivated the herb garden at Dachau, but their large-scale experiment didn't yield the hoped-for alternative to the scientific pharmacy. They couldn't find any scientific basis for the herbal treatments, and when the potions were tested clinically the results were so disappointing that they were never published [3] Despite this setback, the Nazis were determined to foster the faith of the German population in the alternative healers. These were needed to keep the civilians happy \u00e2\u20ac\" because as soon as a war could be arranged, most of the real doctors were going to be sent away to care for the soldiers. And so, six months before the Nazis invaded Poland, Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi Minister of Propaganda, introduced a law to turn the folk healers into a recognized profession. He gave them a new title, \"Heilpraktiker\" (\"practical healer\") and admitted them into the German health system. However, a clause in the 1939 law reveals what Goebbels really thought of the profession he had created. After victory had been achieved and the real doctors returned from the front, Goebbels didn't want this swarm of incompetents underfoot. So the law forbade the training of any new heilpraktikers [6]. This was meant to ensure that after the war they would fade away. Goebbels is claimed to have said, \"This law is both their cradle and their grave.\"[7]. In East Germany, they did indeed dwindle away after the war, exactly as Goebbels had intended. However, in West Germany the new political system came to their rescue. A F\u00c3\u00bchrer can do things by fiat, but a parliament must act according to law. This saved the heilpraktikers, who in 1957 were able to argue successfully before the West German Supreme Court that in a democracy you cannot forbid people to train for a perfectly legal profession. This ruling ensured their continued existence and the New Age movement that followed ensured their growth. To those searching for spirituality the heilpraktikers offered treatments that were \"in harmony with Nature and the Cosmos.\" Between 1970 and 1989 their number in West Germany more than trebled. And after that, German reunification enabled them to expand into the eastern part of the country [8]. Once the alternative healers gained a legal foothold, their growth was pretty well assured. Unlike doctors, the heilpraktikers proselytize constantly. Even the \"health\" courses offered by the adult education centers in Germany today are mostly delivered by alternative healers, who use them to advertise for patients. Yet the participants still pay fees to attend these courses and the taxpayers subsidize them, as well. These \"education\" courses give the heilpraktikers a platform from which to air their views on the virtues of alternative medicine and the vices of the evidence-based sort. They consider themselves far more knowledgeable and they feel it is their mission to spread the Truth. Theirs is a struggle against the forces of evil, in the form of science-based medicine, which some of them claim is \"the leading cause of death.\"[9]. Added to this sense of righteousness is the heady feeling of being leaders on the scientific frontier. After all, only they understand medicine's spiritual dimension. The irony of opposing science while claiming to be on the leading edge of science is lost on them. Alternative healers also get the chance to push their product during consultations. They can afford to spend far more time with a patient than a doctor because their time is worth considerably less. And many are, indeed, superb salespeople, appealing to vanity, exploiting hopes and fears, turning customers into salespeople and wielding a whole arsenal of clinical tricks [10]. The very nature of many illnesses helps their cause. When improvement occurs, patients fail to attribute this to the placebo effect or to the natural ups and downs of many chronic illnesses, or for a variety of other reasons [11]. The high demand for the services of these alternative healers and the ease of entry into this field makes it a popular profession. If you want to become a heilpraktiker the only educational requirement is graduation from primary school. After that you can try the admission test, whose written part consists of sixty multiple-choice questions. This one is my favorite: \"If the patient is in a coma, can you wake him up by shouting at him? Ja or nein?\"[12]. In case you have difficulty with this, don't worry, you can retake the test as often as you like. After all, you have no obligation to actually cure anyone: the stated aim of this examination is merely to ensure that you \"do not pose a danger to the public health.\" [13] Once you've gotten through this exam\u2014if necessary, on your umpteenth try\u2014you are then let loose to offer medical treatment to the German public. There you will encounter very few restrictions. The main constraints are that heilpraktikers can't perform surgery, deliver babies or try to treat communicable diseases [14]. (Of course, there's no assurance that they would recognize a communicable diseases if they encounter them.) Yet, oddly enough it's not just medical laymen who become heilpraktikers. In Germany, as in other countries, alternative medicine is now so widely accepted that sometimes even scientifically trained doctors get \"converted.\" Those who should know better can find it profitable to ignore any doubts. A doctor who supplements his evidence-based medicine with alternative treatments is seen by many patients as having an additional specialty. This easy-to-acquire additional \"qualification\" is often used to burnish the credentials of women doctors returning after maternity leave and struggling to re-establish a practice. All of this means that when you go to a new doctor in Germany you can never be sure what awaits you. That became clear after I made an appointment with a German specialist in sports medicine, someone with at least six years of scientific medicine under his belt. I presented myself to the doctor with what I thought was an obvious problem: ever since lifting something far too heavy, my back had been hurting. But it wasn't clear to him. He was determined not to merely treat my \"symptoms\"\u2014he intended to seek out the underlying cause. So after poking around a bit, Herr Doktor announced that the real problem was that my pelvis was in the wrong position. He broke the news of this major anatomical malformation with remarkable cheerfulness. No problem, he assured me\u2014he could flip my pelvis back again. All he needed to do was perform a manipulation on my neck. Yes, this fellow wanted to perform a totally unnecessary treatment, despite the risk of injury, on a part of my body that was unrelated to my symptoms. Of course, from his point of view something \"natural\" like a manipulation must be risk-free. He seemed to have forgotten (along with the rest of what he had learned in medical school) that the most common serious \"side effect\" of a neck manipulation is damage to the artery leading to the brain\u2014and this can lead to a stroke [15, 16]. This medical comedy routine was beginning to sound dangerous, and I shuffled out of his office as fast as I could go. But what if I had been less skeptical and my complaint had been more serious? In Germany nearly two-thirds of the people diagnosed by doctors as having cancer turn up eventually at the door of a heilpraktiker [17]. And that doesn't count those who visit a properly accredited doctor, as I did, who turns out to be a quack. Furthermore, the face-to-face consultations with alternative healers will be only a fraction of the virtual visits made though their websites. A survey of about 30 of these sites turned up 118 different fake cancer \"cures.\" Some of these sites even advise cancer patients to ignore standard medical advice and skip the recommended chemotherapy and radiation treatments [18]. When desperation finally drives the patients of the alternative healers back to the real doctors, it can be too late. Adolf Hitler is second only to Josef Stalin as the undisputed, all-time, world champion of killers. But Hitler's death at the war's end did not end his influence. His cynical promotion of alternative healers has had lasting results worldwide. Even today Hitler's legacy of quack medicine is still costing lives. References - Salzberg S.

Naturopathy, sometimes referred to as \"natural medicine,\" is a largely pseudoscientific approach said to \"assist nature\" [1], \"support the body's inherent assert that diseases are the body's effort to purify itself, and that cures result from increasing the patient's \"vital force.\" They claim to stimulate the body's natural healing processes by ridding it of waste products and \"toxins.\" At first glance, this approach may appear sensible. However, a close look will show that naturopathy's philosophy is simplistic and that its practices are riddled with quackery [4]. The notion of a \"vital force\" or \"life force\"\u2014a nonmaterial force that transcends the laws of chemistry and physics\u2014originated in ancient times. Historians call it the doctrine of vitalism. No scientific evidence supports this doctrine, but a huge body of knowledge, including the entire discipline of organic chemistry, refutes it. Vitalistic practitioners maintain that diseases should be treated by \"stimulating the body's ability to heal itself\" rather than by \"treating symptoms.\" Homeopaths, for example, claim that illness is due to a disturbance of the body's \"vital force,\" which they can correct with special remedies, while many acupuncturists claim that disease is due to imbalance in the flow of \"life energy\" (chi or Qi), which they can balance by twirling needles in the skin. Many chiropractors claim to assist the body's \"Innate Intelligence\" by Medicatrix Naturae.\" Ayurvedic And so on. The \"energies\" postulated by vitalists cannot be measured by scientific methods. According to a comprehensive report presented to the United States Congress in 1970 by the now-defunct National Association of Naturopathic Physicians (NANP): Naturopathy . . . is the technique of treatment of human disease which emphasizes assisting nature. It can embrace minor surgery and the use of nature's agencies, forces, processes, and products, introducing them to the human body by any means that will produce health-yielding results. Naturopathy is based upon the tendency of the body to maintain a balance and to heal itself. The purpose of naturopathic medicine is to further this process by using natural remedies . . . as distinct from \"orthodox\" medicine (allopathy and osteopathy), which seeks to combat disease by using remedies which are chosen to destroy the causative agent or which produce effects different from those produced by the disease treated. . . . Naturopathy places priority upon these conditions as the bases for ill health: (1) lowered vitality; (2) abnormal composition of blood and lymph; (3) maladjustment of muscles, ligaments, bones, and neurotropic disturbances; (4) accumulation of waste matter and poison in the system; (5) germs, bacteria, and parasites which invade the body and flourish because of toxic states which may provide optimum conditions for their flourishing; and (6) consideration of hereditary influences, and (7) psychological disturbances. In applying naturopathic principles to healing, the practitioner may administer one or more specified physiological, mechanical, nutritional, manual, phytotherapeutic, or animal devices or substances. The practitioner's end aim is to remove obstacles to the body's normal functioning, applying natural forces to restore its recuperative facilities. Only those preparations and doses which act in harmony with the body economy are utilized, to alter perverse functions, cleanse the body of its catabolic wastes, and promote its anabolic processes [1]. The [American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP)](http://www.naturopathic.org/) has stated that \"naturopathic medicine has its own unique body of knowledge, evolved and refined for centuries\" and is \"effective in treating all health problems, whether acute or chronic.\" [5] According to a 1989 AANP brochure: The main difference [between naturopathic and conventional medicine] is in philosophic approach. Naturopathic physicians treat patients by restoring overall health rather than suppressing a few key symptoms. Naturopathic physicians are more concerned with finding the underlying cause of a condition and applying treatments that work in alliance with the natural healing mechanisms of the body rather than against them. Naturopathic treatments result less frequently in adverse side effects, or in the chronic conditions that inevitably arise when the cause of disease is left untreated.\" [6] Naturopaths offer treatment at their offices. A few operate spas where patients may reside for several weeks. Their offerings include fasting, \"natural food\" diets, vitamins, [herbs](../../herbs.html), tissue medicine](../../acu.html), natural childbirth, minor surgery, and applications of water, heat, cold, air, sunlight, and electricity. Radiation may be used for diagnosis, but not for treatment. Many of these methods are said to \"detoxify\" the body. Some states permit naturopaths to prescribe various drugs that are listed in a formulary maintained or authorized by their licensing board. What's Wrong with the Above Picture? Scientific research has identified measurable, causative factors and specific methods of preventing and/or treating hundreds of health problems. Naturopaths have done little more than create glib generalities. The above theories are simplistic and/or clash with science-based knowledge of body physiology and pathology. For example: - \"Balance,\" \"vitality,\" and \"harmony with concepts. Like \"optimal health\" or \"supporting\" of the body, these concepts are vague and cannot be objectively measured or scientifically tested. - Naturopaths pretend that precise medical treatment is less important than \"maintaining body balance.\" - Whether infectious disease occurs depends on the degree of exposure to an infectious organism, the virulence of the organism, and the body's ability to resist. A person does not need to be \"toxic\" or \"imbalanced\" in order to catch a cold. - Some diseases are an inevitable result of genetic make-up. Others have little to do with hereditary factors. - The general concept of treating disease by \"strengthening the immune system\" is unsubstantiated and clashes with the fact that in some conditions, such as allergies or autoimmune diseases, the immune system is overreactive. - Naturopathy's claim that \"natural methods\" can treat cancer by strengthening the immune system is unsubstantiated, and the notion that cancer represents a failure of the immune system is simplistic [7]. In the late 1950s, it was hypothesized that the immune system guards against cancer cells in ways similar to its protection against infectious organisms. However, subsequent research has demonstrated that relationships between cancers and the immune system are highly complex and that successful tumors develop \"tolerance\" mechanisms that enable them to invade the body without activating immune responses that would destroy them. The rapidly developing science of cancer immunotherapy is aimed at detecting and defeating these mechanisms. One way might be to mobilize T- cells to attack and destroy cancers, but this will not be simple to do [8]. Merely increasing the number of such cells won't work. Thus the odds that any dietary measure, herb, or other \"alternative\" approach will solve the problem of cancer by increasing immune surveillance should be regarded as zero. Naturopaths assert that their \"natural\" methods, when properly used, rarely have adverse effects because they do not interfere with the individual's inherent healing abilities. This claim is nonsense. Any medication (drug or herb) potent enough to produce a therapeutic effect is potent enough to cause adverse effects. Drugs should not be used (and would not merit FDA approval) unless the probable benefit is significantly greater than the probable risk. Moreover, medically used drugs rarely \"interfere with the healing processes.\" The claim that scientific medical care \"merely eliminates or suppresses symptoms\" is both absurd and pernicious. Most of the things naturopaths do have not been scientifically substantiated; and some\u2014such as [homeopathy](../../homeo.html)\u2014clearly are worthless. In many cases, naturopaths combine sensible dietary advice (based on medically proven strategies) with senseless recommendations for products. A Brief History Modern-day naturopathy can be traced to the concepts of Sebastian Kneipp (1821-1897), Benedict Lust (1872-1945), Kneipp, a German priest, opened a \"water cure\" center after becoming convinced that he and a fellow student had cured themselves of tuberculosis by bathing in the Danube River. Kneipp also developed herbal methods using whole plants. Lust, also German, was treated by Kneipp and in 1892 was commissioned to establish Kneipp's practices in the United States. In 1895, he opened the Kneipp Water-Cure Institute in New York City and began forming Kneipp Societies whose members had been using Kneipp's methods or other \"drugless therapies.\" Subsequently, he acquired degrees in osteopathy, chiropractic, homeopathic medicine, and eclectic medicine [9]. In 1901, Lust organized a national convention and chaired a committee that endorsed the use of massage, herbs, homeopathy, spinal manipulation, and various types of occult healing. In 1902, he purchased the rights to the term \"naturopathy\" from John H. Scheel, another Kneipp disciple, who had coined it in 1895. That same year, he began referring to himself as a naturopath, opened the American Institute of Naturopathy, and replaced the Kneipp Societies with a national naturopathic organization. Lindlahr further systematized naturopathy and opened a sanitarium and a school in a Chicago suburb. Macfadden popularized exercise and fasting. Tilden contributed notions about \"auto-intoxication\" (said to be caused by fecal matter remaining too long in the intestines) and \" [toxemia](http://soilandhealth.org/02healthlibrary/0201hygienlib%7Fcat/020109tilden/020109tilden1stpart.html)\" (alleged to be \"the basic cause of all diseases\"). [10] Naturopathy's grandiose claims attracted the sharp pen of Morris Fishbein, M.D., who edited the Journal of the American Medical Association and spearheaded the AMA's antiquackery campaign for several decades. He noted: Whereas most cults embrace a single conception as to the cause and healing of disease, naturopathy embraces everything in nature. . . . The real naturopaths were, of course, such healers as Father Kneipp . . . and others who advocated natural living and healed by use of sunlight, baths, fresh air, and cold water, but there is little money to be made by these methods. Hence the modern naturopath embraces every form of healing that offers opportunity for exploitation [11]. The practices Fishbein debunked included: - Aeropathy: baking the patient in a hot oven - Alereos system: spinal manipulation plus heat and mechanical vibration - Astral healing: diagnosis and advice based on reading the patient's horoscope - Autohemic therapy: giving a solution made by modifying and \"potentizing\" a few drops of the patient's blood - Autotherapy: treating infections with potions made from the patient's infected tissues or excretions - Biodynamochromic diagnosis and therapy: administering colored lights while thumping on the patient's abdomen - Bloodwashing with herbs - Chromopathy: healing with colored lights - Electrotherapy with various devices - Geotherapy: treating disease with little pads of earth - Irido-diagnosis: diagnosis based on eye markings\u2014now called [iridology](../../iridology.html) - Pathiatry: self-administration of spinal adjustment, massage, and traction - Porotherapy: treatment applied through the pores of the skin to the nerves said to the control internal organs - Practo-therapy, a fancy term for intestinal irrigation - Sanatology, based on the notion that acidosis and toxicosis are the two basic causes of all disease - Somapathy: spinal adjustment followed by applications of cold or extreme heat - Tropo-therapy with special nutritional foods - Vit-O-Pathy, a combination of 36 other systems - Zodiac therapy, combining astrology and herbs - Zonotherapy (now called reflexology): pressing on various parts of the body to heal disease in designated body \"zones.\" [11] Most of these methods disappeared along with their creators, but some (or their offshoots) are still used today. The total number of naturopathic practitioners in the United States is unknown but includes chiropractors and acupuncturists who practice naturopathy. The AANP was founded in 1985 and is closely allied with the 4-year naturopathic colleges. Its membership is said to be limited to individuals who are eligible for licensing in states that issue licenses. Its online directory contains about 1300 names. The [American Naturopathic Medical Association (ANMA)](http://www.anma.com/), founded in 1981, claims to represent about 2,000 members worldwide. Although some have recognized credentials in other health disciplines, others merely have an \"ND\" degree obtained through a nonaccredited correspondence school. The [Homeopathic Academy of Naturopathic Physicians (HANP](http://www.hanp.net)), which requires a recognized professional degree and additional homeopathic training, lists about 50 members in the United States and Canada. The AANP published the Journal of Naturopathic Medicine six times between 1990 and 1996. The issues ran from about 80 to 100 pages. The third issue was devoted to \"Non-Standard HIV/ARC/AIDS Management.\" The fifth, which attacked immunization, contained papers suggesting that vaccines may be a factor in causing cancer and that homeopathic prophylaxis using nosodes would be effective and safer than standard vaccines. (Nosodes are homeopathic products made from pathological organs or tissues: causative agents such as bacteria, fungi, ova, parasites, virus particles and yeast; disease products; or excretions. There is no scientific evidence that nosodes are effective, and the FDA has ordered several manufactures to stop making preventive claims for them. The sixth issue of the journal promoted the use of \"natural\" products for cancer and contained an absurd article claiming that measuring the electrical resistance of the skin may be a useful way to diagnose the early stages of cancer and AIDS. In December 2009, the AANP, partnered with publisher Karolyn A. Gazella, began producing the online [Journal of Naturopathic Medicine](http://www.naturalmedicinejournal.com/), which is published monthly. Education A 1927 AMA study listed 12 naturopathic schools with fewer than 200 students among them [12]. During the 1920s and 1930s, about half the states passed laws under which naturopaths and/or \"drugless healers\" could practice. However, as modern medicine developed, many of these laws were repealed and all but a few mail-order schools ceased operations. The doctor of naturopathy (N.D.) degree was still available at several chiropractic colleges, but by 1957, the last of these colleges stopped issuing it. The [National College of Naturopathic Medicine (NCNM) ](http://www.ncnm.edu/)was founded in 1956 in Portland, Oregon, but, until the mid-1970s, had very few students. From 1960 through 1968, the average enrollment was eight and the total number of graduates was 16 [1]. Today, within the United States, a \"doctor of naturopathy\" (N.D.) or \"doctor of naturopathic medicine\" (N.M.D.) credential is available from five full-time schools of naturopathy and several nonaccredited correspondence schools. Training at the full-time schools follows a pattern similar to that of chiropractic schools: two years of basic science courses and two years that include working in outpatient clinics. Because medical school programs also last four years that include two years of basic science training, many naturopaths claim that their education is equivalent. There are several big differences, however. - The quality of medical school programs is vastly superior to those of naturopathic schools. Medical school faculties are much larger and better trained, and the scope and depth of clinical experience are much greater because people going to medical school clinics encompass the full gamut of disease. - Much of naturopathy's coursework embraces practices\u2014such as homeopathy\u2014that have zero validity. - Some naturopathic graduates take an additional year of postgraduate training where they work in an outpatient setting. However, most go directly into practice. Nearly all medical school graduates undergo 3-6 years of additional full-time specialty training that includes work with hospital inpatients. The leading accredited school, [Bastyr University](http://www.bastyr.edu/), in Seattle, Washington, was founded in 1978. Besides its N.D. program, Bastyr offers a B.S. degree program in Natural Health Sciences with majors in nutrition and Oriental medicine; a B.S. program in psychology; B.S. and M.A. programs in applied behavioral sciences; M.S. programs in nutrition and acupuncture/oriental medicine; and a certificate in midwifery. Bastyr has also provided health-food retailers and their employees with home-study programs that promote \"natural\" approaches for the gamut of disease. Students in the naturopathic degree program are required to take three courses in homeopathy and can elect to take three more. The [Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine and Health Sciences](http://www.scnm.edu/) in Scottsdale, Arizona, was founded in 1992. The [University of Bridgeport College of Natural Medicine](http://www.bridgeport.edu/naturopathy/index.html) in Bridgeport, Connecticut, began classes in 1997. The [ National University of Health Sciences](http://www.nuhs.edu/academics/college-of-professional-studies/naturopathic-medicine/), located near Chicago, which has offered chiropractic degrees since 1966, got its doctor of naturopathy program approved in 2006. Naturopathy schools receive much of their financial support from companies that market dietary supplements, homeopathic products, and/or herbal remedies. The naturopathic programs offered by correspondence schools span much less time and include no experience with actual patients. Accreditation In 1987, the U.S. Secretary of Education approved the [Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME)](http://www.cnme.org/) as an accrediting agency for the full-time schools. As with acupuncture and chiropractic schools, this recognition was not based upon the scientific validity of what is taught but on such factors as record-keeping, physical assets, financial status, makeup of the governing body, catalog characteristics, nondiscrimination policy, and self-evaluation system. NCNM, Bastyr, and Southwest became accredited. In 1999, the U.S. Department of Education staff and the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (NACIQI) asked U.S. Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley to deny CNME's application for renewal of recognition. The recommendation was based on evidence that CNME did not respond appropriately to violations of its standards at Southwest College. The staff report [13] and testimony at a NACIQI meeting [14] indicated that in 1997 and 1998, the school underwent an administrative upheaval that had nearly led to its closure. Several officials resigned or were abruptly fired, classes were suspended for two weeks, and the school's bank accounts were temporarily frozen after the school's chief financial officer was fired. CNME testified at the hearing that it had closely followed the situation and urged school officials to correct the problems. However, the Department of Education staff and a majority of NACIQI members concluded that CNME had failed to issue a timely order to show cause why Southwest should not have its candidacy for accreditation ended [14]. In January 2001, [Riley agreed that CNME's approval should not be renewed](http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Naturopathy/accreditation.html) [15]. However, CNME reapplied, was approved in 2003, and has remained approved since that time. Legal Status Naturopaths are licensed as independent practitioners in 16 states (Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, and Washington), the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands [16]. They can also legally practice in a few others. Efforts are on the way to to press for licensure in the remaining states. Graduates of the 4-year schools assert that licensing is needed to protect the public from unqualified practitioners. However, the existing naturopathic licensing boards have done little or nothing to protect the public from naturopathy's widespread quackery. Since the proposed laws would set educational requirements that many of ANMA's members could not meet, ANMA has vigorously opposed the licensing efforts. The National Council Against Health Fraud has pointed out: The difference between more and less educated naturopaths is . . . . like comparing more and less educated witch doctors. It could actually be argued that less-schooled naturopaths are safer because they may have a smaller bag of tricks and, because they don't consider themselves \"primary health physicians\" are more apt to refer patients to M.D.'s for additional care [17]. Naturopathic services are not covered by Medicare or most insurance policies. Expansion of naturopathic licensing will make naturopaths appear more legitimate and could help them gain passage of \"insurance equality\" laws that force insurance companies to cover their services. Scope of Practice Most naturopaths allege that virtually all diseases are within their scope. The most comprehensive naturopathic publications that illustrate this belief are the Textbook of Natural Medicine [18-21] and the Encyclopedia of Natural Medicine [22-24]. The textbook, now in its fourth edition, was written for students and professionals; the encyclopedia, now in its third edition, was written for the general public. Joseph E. Pizzorno, Jr., N.D., president (later president emeritus) of Bastyr University, and Michael T. Murray, N.D., a faculty member, edited the textbook and co-authored the encyclopedia. Both books recommend questionable dietary measures, vitamins, minerals, and/or herbs for more than 70 health problems ranging from acne to AIDS. For many of these conditions, daily administration of ten or more products is recommended\u2014some in dosages high enough to cause toxicity. Some treatments are recommended even though the authors indicate that the evidence supporting them is preliminary, speculative, or even conflicting. The textbook discuss many dubious diagnostic tests as though they have validity. Arnold Relman, M.D., Editor-in-Chief Emeritus of The New England Journal of Medicine, has written a [devastating review of the textbook's second (1999) edition](relman1.html) in which he concludes: Many of the treatments recommended in the Textbook . . . are not likely to be effective, and treatments proven to be effective are often totally ignored. This could endanger the health and safety of patients with serious diseases who relied solely on care from a naturopathic practitioner [25]. The third edition of the Encyclopedia recommends inappropriate testing that could lead to the diagnosis of nonexistent problems and inappropriate treatment of many if not most patients who consult naturopaths. For example: - The chapter on hypothyroidism claims (incorrectly) that taking one's armpit temperature upon awakening is a reliable test for thyroid function and that naturopaths prefer treating hypothyroidism with desiccated thyroid. The book also states that \"health-food-store thyroid preparations . . . . may provide enough support\" to help a mild thyroid problem, even though the FDA requires such products to be hormone-free. Scientific physicians consider desiccated thyroid (made from dried animal glands) inferior because its potency can vary from batch to batch. Synthetic thyroid hormone does the job efficiently. Using a product that might contain no hormone is even more ridiculous. - The chapter on \"detoxification\" improperly links dental amalgams to \"fatigue, headache, insomnia, nerve disorders, high blood pressure, impaired memory and concentration,\" falsely claims that 25% of Americans suffer from heavy metal poisoning, and advocates periodic fasting plus various supplements and herbs. - Page 112 states that the best way to determine the \"body load\" of heavy metals is through challenge testing. This advice is pernicious because most people have trace amounts of lead and mercury circulating harmlessly in their blood stream. In challenge testing (also called provoked testing), a chelating agent is administered that temporarily increases excretion. The resultant test report typically suggests abnormalities for which the practitioner recommends \"detoxification.\" [26] The widespread involvement of naturopaths with nonexistent metal toxicity is illustrated by searching with Google. In November 2013, my search for \"naturopath + metal toxicity\" yielded 31,300 hits and my search for \"Naturopath + amalgam\" yields 2.3 million hits. - The \"Candidiasis\" chapter espouses Dr. William Crook's fad diagnosis of \" [candidiasis hypersensitivity](../../candida.html)\" and includes Crook's three-page questionnaire for determining the probability that \"yeast-connected problems are present.\" The questionnaire does not have the slightest validity. - The chapter on angina gives a glowing recommendation for [chelation therapy](../../chelation.html), which the scientific community regards as worthless. - The chapter on \"cellulite\" falsely claims that a gotu kola extract has \"demonstrated impressive results.\" In The Complete Book of Juicing, Murray recommends juices for treating scores of ailments. He also advises everyone to use supplements because \"even the most dedicated health advocate . . . cannot possibly meet the tremendous nutritional requirements for optimum health through diet alone.\" [27] These ideas lack scientific validity. In another book, Murray claims that juicing is valuable because fresh juice provides the body with \"live\" enzymes [28]. [This idea is absurd](../../juicing.html). The enzymes in plants help regulate the metabolic function of plants. When ingested, they do not act as enzymes within the human body, because they are digested rather than absorbed intact into the body [29]. Pizzorno and Murray have claimed that \"in most instances, the naturopathic alternative offers significant benefits over standard medical practices.\" That statement is preposterous. For the few illnesses where their encyclopedia acknowledges that medical treatment is essential (because otherwise the patient may die), they propose naturopathic treatment in addition. In many passages, they describe prevailing medical practices inaccurately. A Revealing Anecdote Pizzorno's book Total Wellness: Improve Your Health By Understanding Your Body's Healing Systems contains a chapter titled \"Strengthen Your Immune System,\" in which the following anecdote is used to illustrate how naturopaths regard \"immune suppression\" as an underlying cause of disease: Several years ago I began to develop large warts on several of my fingers. Warts are an interesting phenomenon; they tend to grow or recede according to how well the immune system is functioning. Although I treated them several times with thuja oil (a standard naturopathic treatment for warts), they had not responded very well. I was perplexed because I was living a pretty healthful lifestyle and using a therapy I'd used successfully for a lot of patients. Then I visited the dentist. As I've only had one cavity, I hadn't been to the dentist for several years. Surprisingly, X-rays revealed an abscess in that one tooth\u2014the filling had not been sealed properly. A week of antibiotics cleared the infection, and within three months all my warts were gone. Even though I had had no other symptoms, the abscess was continually draining my immune system. [30] Any sensible preventive dental-care program should include visits every 6-12 months for professional cleaning (to remove gumline calculus to prevent gum disease), a check for early signs of tooth decay (cavities), and occasional x-ray examination to look for hidden problems. How come Pizzorno\u2014despite all his talk about prevention\u2014does not believe he should have dental check-ups like the rest of us? What does it mean that he permitted large warts to develop on his fingers without seeking medical treatment? (You can decide this for yourself.) Did fixing the abscess actually lead to the disappearance of the warts? I doubt that this has been scientifically studied. However, it is well known that most common warts disappear spontaneously within two years or can be effectively removed with simple, nonscarring medical treatment [31]. Another Revealing Glimpse The AANP claims that \"naturopathic physicians are not opposed to invasive and suppressive measures when these methods are necessary [and] make referrals for such treatment when appropriate.\" [6] I doubt that the majority of naturopaths fit this description. Many naturopaths espouse nutrition and lifestyle measures that coincide with current medical recommendations. However, this advice is often accompanied by nonstandard advice that is irrational. Although naturopaths claim to emphasize prevention, most oppose or are overly critical of immunization. The AANP presents an overly negative view of immunization [32]. Several years ago, as part of a child-custody evaluation, I examined records from nine naturopaths who had treated a child whose mother was antagonistic to medical care and was briefly enrolled as a naturopathy student. The child was not properly immunized and did not see a medical doctor until she developed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus shortly before her eighth birthday. \"chronic cough,\" \"vaginitis,\" \"urinary burning\" and \"asthma\" were noted in the records, there were no indications that these problems had been adequately diagnosed or appropriately treated. (One episode of \"chest congestion,\" for example, was treated with homeopathic remedies.) Three of the practitioners used a [Vegatest device](../../electro.html) to diagnose \"allergies\" to sugar and many other foods and had recommended severe dietary restrictions, even though the child had not reacted adversely to any of the foods. (The Vegatest is quack device that merely measures the amount of moisture on the skin and how hard the practitioner presses a probe against the patient's fingers or toes.) Another practitioner recommended [chelation therapy](../../chelation.html) after diagnosing \"heavy metal poisoning\" with a [hair analysis](../../hair.html). The recommended treatments for both actual and nonexistent conditions included regimens of up to 35 pills a day, including some supplements in potentially toxic doses. The only medical referral took place after the child developed severe signs of diabetes. Although the nine naturopaths do not constitute a random sample, their unscientific practices were consistent with typical naturopathic writings. Scandal in Arizona In May 2001, the Arizona Naturopathic Physicians Board of Medical Examiners fired its executive director, John L. Brewer, D.C., following allegations that he shredded documents, copied exams, and misrepresented his credentials. According to a report in the Arizona Republic, a board member had discovered that Brewer did not receive a naturopathic degree from a college in Los Angeles as he had claimed on his license application [33]. In June 2000, the Arizona Auditor General had severely criticized the board's performance. The most serious deficiencies involved the naturopathic licensing examination, which had not been validated to ensure that it tests what naturopaths would need to practice safely. Even worse, the board consistently \"adjusted\" scores upward so that everyone taking the exam since 1998 passed it. With the February 1999 exam, for example: - Although none of the 18 applicants scored the necessary 75%, all scores were adjusted upward. - The board gave full credit for about one-sixth that were \"too difficult.\" - Since 9 out of 18 applicants were still too low, additional \"adjustments\" were made. - One applicant got full credit for 90 incorrect answers on part 2 of the 3-part test. The Auditor General's report also noted that complaints to the board had not received adequate attention and that record-keeping and overall management had been inadequate [34]. The Bottom Line In 1968, the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) recommended against Medicare coverage of naturopathy. [HEW's report](hew.html) concluded: Naturopathic theory and practice are not based upon the body of basic knowledge related to health, disease, and health care which has been widely accepted by the scientific community. Moreover, irrespective of its theory, the scope and quality of naturopathic education do not prepare the practitioner to make an adequate diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment [35]. Although some aspects of naturopathic education have improved in recent years, I believe this conclusion is still valid. I believe that the average naturopath is a muddlehead who combines commonsense health and nutrition measures and rational use of a few herbs with a huge variety of unscientific practices and anti-medical double-talk.

I am furious and at the same time saddened, if that is possible; how dare you write articles titled \"Ayurvedic Mumbo-Jumbo\" and \"Aromatherapy, Making Dollars out of Scents\"? Why do you need to be so incredibly flippant and dismissing, what are you afraid of? It is you who are unfairly misleading the public. You critique/critisize and dismiss medicicinal practices (ayurvedic, CTM, herbalism),from countries that are thousands of years old, seducing the general public with stats, tests and the scientific method. What you are forgetting to mention to people is that Allopathic (western) medicine is less than 400 years old, a mere infant in the life cycle of medicine and healing. Allopathic medicine is responsible for countless numbers of deaths due to poor diagnosis, deadly drug interactions, using human beings as guinea pigs for new and improved drugs (only to find years later the damage many of these drugs have caused) and the 'instant fix', band-aid approach to healing. I look forward to reading ALL of the articles on this site, I am sure that doing this will further my faith in Alternative Medicine. You see, alternative medicine is not interested in insulting western medicine in order to further its healing practices; to be fair to all, why don't you include articles on the many dangers and deaths of modern medicine? I think it would round out this site nicely. This article was revised on November 26, 2013.

David Steenblock, D.O. operates a clinic in Mission Viejo, California, which claims to \"give the maximum amount of recovery possible for stroke and traumatic brain injury.\" The facility, now called Dr. Steenblock's Clinic, operated as the Brain Theraputics Medical Clinic from 2001 through 2007 and the Health Restoration Medical Center before that. According to its Web site, the clinic provides: A Comprehensive Neuro-Rehab Program utilizing Hyperbaric Oxygen, Pulsed Magnetic Therapy, Acupuncture, External Counterpulsation, as well as Nutritional / Metabolic Therapies. Where brain damage is located determines which nerves, muscles, organs and tissues will be affected. But we are also a \"brain and body\" therapeutics medical clinic, treating the whole person, striving to find the underlying cause of your disease, then addressing it with safe, non-invasive, effective therapies backed by scientific and clinical proof [1]. The site also states: He has devoted many years to research in the fields of biochemistry, pathology, nerve and muscle physiology, cardiovascular disease and other diseases of aging. He has also written numerous scientific articles and is a contributing editor to several national consumer health magazines [2]. Steenblock's StemCell.md Web site states: When Dr. Steenblock isn't with a patient, he is at his computer investigating new research or reading through stacks of medical journals that come in on a daily basis. Dr. Steenblock has an extensive library and two research assistants. What he doesn't know, he quickly and avidly investigates\u2014and what he does know, he gives to the world. No other physician in the U.S. has been on the forefront of alternative medicine for these past thirty years and continues to stay on the forefront, against all odds, in advocating safe, effective and natural treatments for brain injuries and chronic degenerative disease [3]. What treatment does he offer? According to a biographical sketch on the Cancer Control Society's Web site: Dr. Steenblock uses one marrow stem cell therapy, hard chamber hyperbaric oxygen, intravenous glutathione, chelation of all types, pulsed electromagnetic therapies, external counterpulsation, intermittent high altitude therapies, spinal disc decompression, nutritional therapies, etc. for the prevention and treatment of stroke, brain injuries, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, ALS, macular degeneration, cerebral palsy, autism, Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, kidney and liver disorders, diabetes, anti-aging, etc. [4] Some people who read the above statements might conclude that Steenblock is a great scholar who offers the latest, most effective, and most innovative treatments for many serious diseases. That's certainly not how I perceive him. What counts is not the amount of time spent reading journals, but the ability to integrate the information into an evidence-based practice. Steenblock, however, includes treatments that have no scientifically plausible rationale and have not been demonstrated to be effective. What's more, some of the conditions he claims to treat do not have any proven effective treatment. Despite all of his research and alleged treatment success, [the only scientific journal articles I could find under his name in the Medline database were three papers about blood clotting in dogs and guinea pigs published in 1968](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?orig_db=PubMed&db=pubmed&cmd=Search&term=Steenblock D[author]) when he was working as a research assistant in a biochemistry lab. Biomeridian Testing The Stroke Doctor Web site indicates that Steenblock's clinic uses \"Biomeridian Assessment\" to \"formulate a comprehensive support program of therapies and supplementation customized to your unique needs\" and says that device also helps to \"stay on track and measure progress.\" Proponents of such devices claim that they measure disturbances in the body's flow of \"electro-magnetic energy\" along \"acupuncture meridians.\" Actually, they are little more than fancy galvanometers that measure electrical resistance of the patient's skin when touched by a probe. The device emits a tiny direct electric current that flows through a wire from the device to a metallic cylinder that the patient holds in one hand. A second wire is connected from the device to a probe, which the operator touches to \"acupuncture points\" on the patient's other hand or a foot. This completes a low-voltage circuit and the device registers the flow of current. The information is then relayed to a computer screen that provides an interpretation of the findings and suggests products the patient can take. The Biomeridian and similar devices provide no useful information about the patient's diagnosis or treatment [5]. Questionable Treatment Claims The treatments that seem to interest Steenblock most are hyperbaric oxygen therapy and stem cell therapy. His Web sites describe him as \"America's foremost 'Stroke Doctor'\" and the \"Number One Leading Expert in Stem Cell Therapies in the United States.\" According to an article on the Stroke Doctor Web site: Strokes are caused by a lack of oxygen to a part of the brain. Long term effects are caused by the continued lack of oxygen, the swelling of brain tissue and the accumulation of calcium within the damaged nerve cells. Dr. Steenblock's neuro-rehab program is designed to bring oxygen back to these starved cells, reduce swelling, and provide the nutrients needed to help the cells remove their waste and restore normal metabolic function [6]. It is true that strokes are caused by lack of oxygen to the brain. However, there is no scientific evidence that increasing oxygen delivery to the brain after an acute episode is over can stimulate cells to regenerate. Steenblock's sites list more than 100 diseases that they claim stem cell transplantation can treat. Stem cell therapy is certainly a promising area for research [7,8]. Stem cells have the ability to give rise to many specialized cells in an organism. Certain types of stem cells are already used to restore blood-forming and immune system function after high-dose chemotherapy for some types of cancer, and several other restorative uses have been demonstrated [9]. The broadest potential application is the generation of cells and tissues that could be used to repair or replace damaged organs. If scientists can learn how to control stem cell conversion into new, functionally mature cells, doctors might be able to cure many diseases for which therapy is currently inadequate. However, Steenblock's claims go way beyond what is likely and should be regarded with great skepticism. Questionable Research Claims Steenblock has been closely associated with Fernando Ramirez Del Rio, M.D., who operates a clinic in Tijuana, Mexico, where he administers stem cell therapy. Steenblock has also been associated with [Anthony G. Payne](http://faculty.uml.edu/sgallagher/agpayne.htm), who worked for him as a \"staff nutritional counselor\" in 1990 and and as a \"senior science writer\" at the Steenblock Research Institute (SRI) from March 2003 through June 2007 [10]. During most of this period, according to Payne, Steenblock did not administer stem cell treatment himself but referred patients to Payne to discuss options [11]. Most of the patients would then to go to Ramirez, who followed Steenblock's protocols and retained the SRI to collect and analyze patient responses. The book Umbilical Cord Stem Cell Therapy, which Payne and Steenblock co-authored, was published in 2006 and describes some of their findings [12]. That same year, Ramirez, Steenblock, and Payne wrote an article about eight children with cerebral palsy (ages 3-12) whom Ramirez had treated with stem cell injections into fatty tissue under the skin near their umbilicus (belly button). Their article was published in Medical Hypotheses and Research, a journal not listed in Medline [13]. This report states that parents completed questionnaires before the treatment and at 1, 3 and 6 months afterwards and that the children's own therapists submitted submitted evaluations to SRI for analysis. It further states that all eight children showed clinically significant improvement, but it does not tabulate the outside therapists' observations. Although its findings are interesting, the report should not be promoted as evidence of effectiveness. At the very least, a study of this type should include complete physical evaluations before and afterwards by independent observers. It is also important to know whether any improvement could have occurred as a result of other treatment or the natural history of the ailment. That would require a comparison between treated and untreated children. Near the end of 2006, Steenblock began administering stem cell therapy himself by withdrawing fluid from the bone marrow and injecting it back to the patient intravenously. In a 2007 lecture delivered in the United Kingdom, he stated that he had originated this method and that any doctor could use it [14]. The StemCell.md site has an interesting testimonial for \"Emily,\" a 16-year-old girl who underwent this procedure. - Emily had right-sided disability and spasticity since birth. - She was treated by removing 300 milliliters of bone marrow from her hip and giving it back to her intravenously. - Five hours after the raw bone marrow infusion, she was able to move her right toe for the first time in her life. - That evening, she was able to walk, stepping heel to toe on her right foot. - By the next day, she was able to straighten out and use her right arm and wrist for the first time. - Within three weeks, she was also able to move her fingers on her right hand and hold a cup for the first time. - She has continued to improve on her walking rhythm and is also running [15]. In an videotaped interview recorded the day after her stem cell treatment, Emily and her mother give a glowing report [16]. Her appearance, however, is unpersuasive. Although they talk about how she can unclench her right hand, straighten her right elbow, and raise her right arm\u2014all of which they say she could never do before the treatment\u2014she demonstrates none of this during the recording. Moreover, the idea that transfused stem cells are responsible for such rapid improvements is questionable. If cells are actually removed from the marrow and injected intravenously into a person, they would simply not gravitate toward and fix damaged organs in a single day or so. Many, in fact, would be filtered out by the spleen, circulate back to the marrow, and/or simply die. The Web site does not say when Emily's treatment took place, but the video was uploaded to YouTube on August 13, 2009. It seems probable to me that her testimonial is an expression of wishful thinking. Payne readily acknowledges that stem cells could not be directly responsible for an improvement within hours, but he speculates about other mechanisms [17]. Steenblock Research Institute The Steenblock Institute, founded in 2003, is located in San Clemente, California, a few miles from Steenblock's office. The Stem Cell Therapies Web site describes it as a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation \"dedicated to educating the public about safe and effective alternatives for difficult medical cases.\" [3] The site promotes a book Steenblock wrote and solicits donations for four projects that it describes as (a) neurological research (cerebral palsy, stroke, TBI, ALS, MS, Down's syndrome), (b). eye research (macular degeneration), (c) cardiovascular research (heart disease, atherosclerosis), and (d) cancer research. However, at this point, it does not look like the money SRI raises will result in any meaningful research. The institute's tax returns show a total income of only $23,538 in 2006, $3,162 in 2007, and $17,461 in 2008 [18-20]. The returns state that its projects included (a) organizing research on stem cell therapies, (b) creating a Web site on umbilical-derived stem cells, (c) writing a book, and (d) answering individual inquires about umbilical cord stem cell therapy. The 2008 tax return lists \"advertising and promotion expense\" of $20,954. In 2013, the [California charities database](http://oag.ca.gov/charities/charity-research-tool#Location:Default) contained no filings after 2008 and listed the institute's income and assets as $0. Disciplinary Actions Steenblock has been disciplined by his state licensing board four times and is now serving 5 years' probation. In 1991, he was charged with negligence in connection with two patients he had treated [21]. In 1994, the case was settled with a stipulation under which he agreed to serve five years of probation, pay $10,000 for costs, and take extra continuing education courses in pharmacology, medical charting, and ethics [22]. In 1997, Steenblock was charged with violating his probation by not paying the $10,000 assessment and by using three unlicensed \"physical therapy assistants\" to administer patient services [23]. (In 1997, the employees were convicted of practicing physical therapy without a license.) In 2000, after Steenblock had paid the $10,000 and hired a licensed physical therapist to supervise the others, the board assessed another $3,500 toward costs but decided not to penalize him for \"aiding and abetting the unlicensed practice of physical therapy.\" [24] The proceedings also had the effect of extending his probation for three months. In January 2008, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California charged David A. Steenblock, D.O. with gross negligence, repeated negligent acts, excessive treatments, failure to maintain adequate records, and falsely representing his credentials. The complaint stated that he: - Charged a 77-year-old stroke patient more than $26,000 for services that included 87 sessions of hyperbaric oxygen, 84 physical therapy treatments, 20 intravenous treatments, and 8 testosterone injections. - Retained Medicare payments that should have been refunded to the patient. - Failed to document an initial evaluation, any treatment rationale, or the patient's responses to treatment. - Falsely represented that he is board-certified by the American Board of Family Practice, even though he had not been certified by that board since December 1984. - Represented that he is certified by the American Board of Chelation Therapy, even though that board is not recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties and did not list him among its members [25]. In August 2009, the Board concluded that Steenblock had engaged in gross negligence, repeated negligent acts, and excessive prescribing of treatment and had failed to maintain adequate records. The board also concluded that Steenblock had improperly advertised himself as board certified. He was placed on probation for five years, ordered to take courses in medical ethics and recordkeeping, and assessed $25,166.60 for the cost of investigation and enforcement [26]. During the deliberations, the lack of efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen treatment for stroke victims was not considered. In 2011, the board filed a petition to revoke Steenblock's probation. The [petition](https://centerforinquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/quackwatch/petition_2011.pdf) stated that in early 2010, Steenblock had notified the board that he had not complied with his probation terms because he had challenged the a prior board decision in San Francisco Superior Court and expected the court would stay his probation until the matter was resolved. However, the court did not issue a stay and, even though the Board notified Steenblock that he was required to comply with probation, he did not make reports, enroll in the required continuing education courses, or pay the $25,166.60 [27]. In February 2013, the board suspended Steenblock's license for 60 days, ordered him to pay the $25,166 within that time period, and renewed his probation for another five years during which he is required to comply with the terms of the 2009 order [28]. In February 2013, Alexander Thermos, D.C., D.O. joined the staff of Steenblock's clinic staff and was represented on its Web site as an \"expert on the clinical use of stem cells.\" Like Steenblock, Thermost has an extensive regulatory history: - In 1997, when Thermos practiced in Nebraska, the Nebraska Department of Health & Human Services disciplined him for prescribing controlled substances after his controlled substances registration had expired. - In 1999, after Thermos had applied for a license in Colorado, the Colorado board granted his license but entered into a stipulation under which Thermos agreed to be placed on probation for five years, during which he was required to have psychiatric treatment [29]. - In 2007, the board sent a letter warning Thermos that it had received complaints that he had \"consistently refused\" to provide a number of his patents with a copy of their medical records and that he was required to do so [30]. - n 2011, Thermos agreed to relinquish his Colorado osteopathic medical license. The stipulation document indicates that (a) from 2003 through 2008, he treated a young woman with excessive amounts of tranquilizers and narcotic painkilling drugs, and (b) he failed to document objective findings for diagnosing the patient with interstitial cystitis, fibromyalgia, and chronic abdominal pain. The agreement states that after two years he can apply for reinstatement provided that the Colorado Physician's Health Program clears him as safe to continue practice [31]. - Thermos acquired a California license in 2009 and subsequently worked at various clinics that offer a range of nonstandard methods. In 2013, based on Colorado's action, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California issued a stipulated settlement and disciplinary orde [r](https://centerforinquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/quackwatch/probation_2013.pdf)under which he agreed to (a) pay $4,016 for costs, (b) serve five years on probation, (c) take courses in pharmacology and medical ethics, (d) take extensive clinical training, and (e) complete a professional enhancement program [32]. The Bottom Line Over the years, Steenblock has advocated and/or used many treatments that are unsubstantiated and lack a scientifically plausible rationale. His current favorites seem to be hyperbaric oxygen and stem cell treatment. He has been disciplined twice for negligence and now serving five years' probation.

New project reports on alleged \"CAM\" cancer treatments. The National Information Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the University of Troms\u00f8, Norway, is now operating a project that reviews alleged \"complementary and alternative\" cancer treatments. The project\u2014called \"Concerted Action for Complementary and Alternative Medicine Assessment in the Cancer Field\" (CAM-Cancer)\u2014is funded mainly by the university's National Research Center in Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NAFKAM) and Reliable Cancer Therapies (RCT), a non-profit organization that provides research-based information on cancer treatments. [The CAM-Cancer Web site has about 60 reports that can be downloaded and freely reproduced](http://cam-cancer.org/CAM-Summaries). UK activists attack misleading \"CAM\" regulatory agency. The Nightingale Collaboration, a group of British activists, has submitted 100 complaints against practitioners and clinics registered with the UK's [Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC](http://www.cnhc.org.uk/)). The CNHC was set up in 2008 with government support to regulate Alexander therapy, aromatherapy, Bowen therapy, craniosacral therapy, healing, hypnotherapy, massage therapy, microsystems acupuncture, naturopathy, nutritional therapy, reflexology, reiki; shiatsu, sports therapy, and yoga therapy. To display the CNHC \"quality mark,\" registrants must meet a long list of standards that include, \"Advertisements must not be misleading, false, unfair or exaggerated.\" The [Collaboration's home page](http://www.nightingale-collaboration.org/) summarizes the situation this way: - The breadth of these questionable claims is truly staggering, with just about no CNHC 'discipline' left untouched. The Alexander Technique is a notable exception in this batch of complaints\u2014at least there is some good evidence for it for some conditions and we found no evidence of the outrageous claims that were being made for other disciplines. - The CNHC controls what training is considered appropriate for an aspirant registrant and they must also ensure that future registrants are clearly taught during their training just what they can and cannot treat\u2014and that has to be based on the best scientific evidence available. Anything less is a dereliction of their duty. They promised this nearly four years ago, but even if they have taken action, our complaints clearly demonstrate that it was wholly inadequate. - If the CNHC ever wants to be considered a regulator that protects the public rather than its registrants, it should take this opportunity to tackle the endemic problems with their registrants head on, ensure that all misleading (and indeed illegal) claims are removed, and deal with the registrants appropriately. - The CNHC recently applied to the Professional Standards Authority (PSA) to join their statutory Accredited Voluntary Register. With these revelations of the widespread and reckless claims being made by CNHC registrants, we suggest the PSA drop their application and have nothing further to do with them until the CNHC are able to fully demonstrate their ability to control their registrants and protect the public. Tetanus case attracts media attention. The parents of a 7-year-old boy who suffered terribly and nearly was killed by tetanus are speaking out about their poor decision not to provide measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) shots to the boy. The parents attributed their decision to statements on the Internet that vaccines cause autism and are promoted by drug companies purely for profit. Widespread media coverage of the story in Australia and New Zealand is motivating parents to get their children immunized. [Wynne E.

If your doctor is interested in nutrition, he or she may be a good place to start. The principles of nutrition are those of human biochemistry and physiology, courses required in every medical school. Although many medical schools do not teach a separate required course in nutrition, this does not mean that the subject is ignored.

Many medical educators prefer that nutrition be included in other courses at the point where it is most relevant. In addition, most medical schools offer an elective course in nutrition. Medical training, of course, does not end on graduation day. The medical profession advocates lifelong education, and physicians can further their knowledge of nutrition by reading medical journals, discussing cases with colleagues, and attending courses. If your doctor is unable or unwilling to provide what you need, you can be referred to someone who will\u2014usually a registered dietitian. Nutrition Credentials Many accredited universities offer nutrition courses based on scientific principles and taught by qualified instructors. A bachelor's degree in nutrition requires four years of full-time study that qualify a graduate for entry level positions in dietetics or food service, often in a hospital. A master's degree, which can widen career opportunities, requires two more years of full-time study beyond the undergraduate level. People who wish to become nutrition researchers usually pursue a doctorate (Ph.D.) in biochemistry, which requires at least two years of additional study plus a thesis based on original laboratory research. Those wishing to concentrate on teaching or educational research usually seek a Ph.D. or Ed.D. degree in nutrition education. Regular membership in the [American Society for Nutrition](http://www.nutrition.org/)\u2014formerly called the American Institute of Nutrition and the American Society for Nutritional Sciences\u2014is open to open to any individuals with a doctoral-level degree (Ph.D., M.D., D.D.S, D.V.M., D.Pharm, etc.) in nutrition or a related field from an accredited institution with notable accomplishments as an author of a nutrition publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Nutritionists at the doctoral level may also seek certification. From 1984 through 2001, certification was offered by by the [American Board of Nutrition](http://main.uab.edu/Shrp/default.aspx?pid=81046) to specialists in clinical nutrition (M.D.'s only) or human nutritional sciences (M.D.'s and Ph.D.'s). Since 2001, physician certification has been available from the [American Board of Physician Nutrition Specialists (ABPNS)](http://main.uab.edu/Sites/abpns/about/), Board certification requires passage of comprehensive examination. Most board-certified nutritionists are affiliated with medical schools and hospitals, where they conduct clinical research and offer consultation to primary-care physicians. Registered dietitians (R.D.s) are specially trained to translate nutrition research into healthful, tasty diets. The R.D. credential is available to individuals who obtain a bachelor's degree in nutrition accredited by the [Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND)](http://www.eatright.org/) (formerly called the American Dietetic Association), complete an approved dietetic internship, and pass a comprehensive written test covering all aspects of nutrition and food-service management. To maintain their credential, they must also participate regularly in approved continuing education programs. Although completion of a masters degree or Ph.D is highly desirable for nutrition professionals, it is not required to become a registered dietitian. Most active R.D.s work in hospitals. Typically, they counsel patients and conduct classes for pregnant women, heart and kidney patients, diabetics, and other persons with special dietary needs. Dietitians are also employed by community agencies such as geriatric, day- care, and drug/alcohol abuse centers. Some dietitians do research. Others engage in private practice where they counsel physician-referred clients. The AND also has a certification process for advanced-level practitioners and for specialists in renal (kidney), pediatric, and metabolic nutrition. Unfortunately, many members of the academy's Dietitians in Integrative and Functional Medicine (DIFM) Practice Group are not only offering services that are highly questionable but also appear to be outside the legitimate scope of dietetic practice. The [Certification Board for Nutritional Specialists](http://www.cbns.org/) (CNNS) was founded by the American College of Nutrition (ACN) in 1993. It originally offered a Certified Nutrition Specialist (CNS) credential only to professionals with an accredited master's or doctoral degree who have clinical experience and pass an examination. In 2009, it severed its connection with ACN and became an independent nonprofit organization. In 2010, it opened its certification process to people with a degree in medicine, dentistry, chiropractic, naturopathy, and several other health disciplines. CBNS's certification requirements remain substantial but less than those of the American Board of Physician Nutrition Specialists.. In addition, it is not clear how rigorously they investigate their applicants. Many CNS holders have distinguished nutrition credentials. However, I know of at least two people who became certified even though their \"Ph.D\" degrees came from a nonaccredited correspondence school. Most conditions for which detailed nutrition advice is needed require medical diagnosis first. These include high blood cholesterol, diabetes, severe food allergy or sensitivity, high blood pressure, certain digestive problems, osteoporosis, severe kidney disease, cancer, and obesity. Consultation with an expert can also be worthwhile for pregnant and lactating women, competitive athletes, and individuals who feel confused about nutrition. Questionable Credentials A Certified Clinical Nutritionist (CCN) credential is offered by the [Clinical Nutrition Certification Board (CNCB)](http://www.cncb.org/), an organization founded in 1991 to provide credentialing to nutrition professionals who might not be eligible to become registered dietitians or to be certified by the American Board of Nutrition. Although some members are qualified and practice appropriately, both CNCB and its sponsoring organization (the [International and American Associations of Clinical Nutrition](http://www.iaacn.org/)) include promoters of highly dubious practices among their leaders and members. Although some members are qualified and practice appropriately, CNCB's required clinical nutrition course promotes the use of homeopathy, dubious laboratory tests, detoxification, herbology, homeopathy, and alternative cancer therapies and several its recommended reference books advocate highly dubious practices. [American Health Science University](http://www.ahsu.com/) offers a [Certified Nutritionist (CN) ](http://www.certifiednutritionist.com/)credential to students who complete its six-course \"distance learning program\" and take an examination. Although accredited, it is closely aligned with the health-food industry and should not be regarded as trustworthy. Its president, James R. Johnston, does not appear to have a accredited doctoral degree. The [American Association of Nutritional Consultants](Nonrecorg/aanc.html) issues a Certified Nutritional Consultant (CNC) credential to persons who take an open-book test. The CNC credential should be regarded as bogus. [The Society of Certified Nutritionists (SCN)](http://www.certifiednutritionist.com/), established in 1985, includes Certified Clinical Nutritionists (CCN), Certified Nutritionists (CN), and Certified Nutrition Consultants (CNC) among its members. SCN membership should be regarded as a sign of poor judgment. Beware of Unqualified Individuals Because the titles \"nutritionist\" and \"nutrition consultant\" are unregulated in most states, they have been adopted by many individuals who lack recognized credentials and are unqualified. In addition, a small percentage of licensed practitioners are engaged in unscientific nutrition practices. The best way to avoid bad nutrition advice is to identify and avoid those who give it. I recommend steering clear of: - Anyone who says that everyone needs vitamin supplements to be sure they get enough. Most people can get all the vitamins they need by eating sensibly. - Anyone who suggests that most diseases are caused by faulty nutrition. Although some diseases are diet-related, most are not. - Anyone who suggests that large doses of vitamins are effective against a large number of diseases and conditions. That is simply untrue. - Anyone who suggests [hair analysis](../../01QuackeryRelatedTopics/hair.html)as a basis for determining the body's nutritional state or for recommending vitamins and minerals. Hair analysis is not reliable for this purpose. - Anyone who claims that a wide variety of symptoms and diseases are caused by \"hidden food allergies\" - Anyone who uses a computer-scored \"nutrient deficiency test\" as the basis for prescribing vitamins. There are valid ways that computers can be used for dietary analysis. But those used for recommending vitamins are programmed to recommend them for everyone. - All practitioners\u2014licensed or not\u2014who sells vitamins in their offices. Scientific nutritionists do not sell vitamins. Unscientific practitioners often do\u2014usually at a considerable profit.

[Hide Full Content](#thirteen-thousand-eight-hundred-sixty-seven) [Be Wary of the National Health Federation (1993)](https://quackwatch.org/consumer-education/nonrecorg/nhf/) The National Health Federation (NHF) is an alliance of promoters and followers who engage in lobbying campaigns and many other activities. It is antagonistic toward established medical practices and uses the words \"alternative,\" and \"freedom\" to suit its own purposes. The information in this article was published in 1993 as part of a chapter on \"Health Freedom Crusaders\" in my book, The Health Robbers: A Close Look at Quackery in America. As you read this article, keep in mind that it describes things as they were in 1993. The people mentioned are no longer in leadership positions, some have died, and its tax returns indicate that it has fewer than 1,000 members. However, its focus and activities have not changed. Background Information NHF is headquartered ... The National Health Federation (NHF) is an alliance of promoters and followers who engage in lobbying campaigns and many other activities. It is antagonistic toward established medical practices and uses the words \"alternative,\" and \"freedom\" to suit its own purposes. The information in this article was published in 1993 as part of a chapter on \"Health Freedom Crusaders\" in my book, The Health Robbers: A Close Look at Quackery in America. As you read this article, keep in mind that it describes things as they were in 1993. The people mentioned are no longer in leadership positions, some have died, and its tax returns indicate that it has fewer than 1,000 members. However, its focus and activities have not changed. Background Information NHF is headquartered in Monrovia, California. Its members pay from $36 per year for \"regular\" membership to a total of $1,000 or more for \"perpetual\" membership. NHF members receive occasional mailings and a monthly magazine called Health Freedom News (formerly called Public Scrutiny and the NHF Bulletin). In 1991, it had about 6,600 members. Since its formation, NHF's stated purpose has been to promote \"freedom of choice\" by consumers. As expressed for years in its Bulletin: NHF opposes monopoly and compulsion in things related to health where the safety and welfare of others are not concerned. NHF does not oppose nor approve any specific healing profession or their methods, but it does oppose the efforts of any one group to restrict the freedom of practice of qualified members of another profession, thus attempting to create a monopoly. At first glance, this credo may seem \"democratic\" and somehow related to unfair business competition. What NHF really means, however, is that government should not help scientifically based health care to drive unproven methods out of the marketplace. NHF wants anyone who merely claims to have an effective treatment or product to be allowed to market it without scientific proof that it works. NHF promotes questionable health methods and has little interest in scientifically recognized methods. Health Freedom News contains ads for questionable treatments and products that are being marketed illegally. Nutritional fads, myths, and gimmicks are mentioned favorably by NHF publications and convention speakers. Worthless cancer treatments, particularly laetrile, have been promoted in the same ways. Articles in NHF publications have looked with disfavor on such proven public health measures as pasteurization of milk, immunization, water fluoridation, and food irradiation. Use of nutritional supplements is encouraged by claims that modern food processing depletes our food supply of its nutrients. \"Natural\" and \"organic\" products have been promoted with suggestions that our food supply is \"poisoned.\" Chiropractic, naturopathy, and homeopathy are regarded favorably. Books that promote questionable health concepts are given favorable reviews. Antiquackery legislation is condemned. Underlying all these messages is the idea that anyone who opposes NHF's ideas is part of a \"conspiracy\" of government, organized medicine, and big business against the little consumer. NHF has been very active in the political arena. It presents testimony to regulatory agencies and sponsors legislation aimed at minimizing government interference with the health-food industry. To bolster the influence of its lobbyists, it generates letter-writing campaigns that urge legislators and government officials to support NHF positions. These campaigns typically include charges of persecution, discrimination, and conspiracy. NHF also has filed lawsuits against government agencies and helped to defend people prosecuted for selling questionable \"health\" products or services. NHF's Leaders Not surprisingly, most of NHF's leaders have been economically involved with the issues it has promoted-and at least twenty have been in legal difficulty for such activities. NHF's officers and board members have included the following people. Fred J. Hart, who founded NHF in 1955, was president of the Electronic Medical Foundation, a company that marketed quack devices. In 1954, Hart and his foundation were ordered by a U.S. District Court to stop distributing thirteen devices with false claims that they could diagnose and treat hundreds of diseases and conditions. In 1962, Hart was fined by the court for violating this order. He died in 1976. Royal S. Lee, D.D.S., a nonpracticing dentist who died in 1967, helped Hart found NHF and served on its board of governors. Lee owned and operated the Vitamin Products Company, which sold food supplements, and the Lee Foundation for Nutritional Research, which distributed literature on nutrition and health. One of the vitamin company's products was Catalyn, a patent medicine composed of milk sugar, wheat starch, wheat bran, and other plant material. During the early 1930s, a shipment of Catalyn was seized by the FDA and destroyed by court order because it had been marketed with false claims of effectiveness against serious diseases. In 1945, the FDA ordered Lee and his company to discontinue illegal claims for Catalyn and other products. In 1956, the Post Office Department charged Lee's foundation with fraudulent promotion of a book called Diet Prevents Polio. The foundation agreed to discontinue the challenged claims. In 1962, Lee and the Vitamin Products Company were convicted of misbranding 115 special dietary products by making false claims for the treatment of more than five hundred diseases and conditions. Lee received a one-year suspended prison term and was fined $7,000. In 1963, a prominent FDA official said Lee was \"probably the largest publisher of unreliable and false nutritional information in the world.\" Jonathan V. Wright, M.D., who became NHF's board chairman in 1992, is embroiled in disputes with the FDA involving nutritional products that the FDA seized in a much-publicized raid on Wright's clinic and an adjacent pharmacy. [Kurt W. Donsbach, D.C.](../../../01QuackeryRelatedTopics/donsbach.html), a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Lee, replaced Fred Hart as NHF's board chairman in 1975 and held that position until 1989. In 1971, after agents of the California Bureau of Food and Drug observed Donsbach tell customers at his health food store that vitamins, minerals, and/or herbal tea were effective against several serious diseases, he pled guilty to one count of practicing medicine without a license and agreed to cease \"nutritional consultation.\" In the ensuing years, Donsbach has marketed supplement products, issued publications, operated nonaccredited correspondence schools, marketed a bogus \"nutrient deficiency\" test, and administered dubious treatments at Mexican cancer clinics. During NHF's early years, Andrew S. Rosenberger served as the group's \"nutrition chairman\" and spoke at NHF conventions. For many years, he and his brother Henry operated a large chain of health-food stores called Nature Food Centers. In 1938, their firm made an agreement with the FTC to stop making therapeutic claims for more than twenty products. During the 1950s, the Post Office Department filed several complaints against the firm for making false therapeutic claims for various products; in each case, the company agreed to discontinue the claims. In 1962, the Rosenberger brothers were fined $5,000 each and given six-month suspended prison sentences for misbranding dietary products. Nature Food Centers was fined $10,000. Clinton Miller was NHF's legislative advocate from 1962 through 1989 and has also served as NHF's executive director. Before coming to NHF, Miller chaired the antifluoridation committee of Utah, which helped make Utah the least fluoridated state in the U.S. In the 1960s and early 1970s, he operated Clinton's Wheat Shop (a health-food store) in Bountiful, Utah, and Miller's Honey Company in Salt Lake City. During this period the FDA took seven enforcement actions (two citations and five seizures) involving products marketed by these companies. One was a seizure from the wheat shop in 1962 of some \"dried Swiss whey,\" which the FDA considered misbranded when claimed as effective in treating intestinal disorders. The whey was returned when Miller agreed to change its labeling. In 1976, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. Senate. Maureen Kennedy Salaman, NHF's president from 1982 to 1992, hosts a radio talk show and has been very active in promoting questionable cancer remedies. Her 1983 book, Nutrition: The Cancer Answer, claims that \"the American Cancer Society advocates treating cancer rather than preventing it.\" In 1984, she ran for vice-president on the Populist party ticket. David Ajay was president of the National Nutritional Foods Association (NNFA), a trade association that represents health food retailers, distributors, and producers. Norman J. Bassett was publisher of Let's Live, a magazine that promotes questionable health methods. Walter Douglas Brodie, M.D., was convicted twice of failing to file income tax returns. In 1977, he was sentenced to six months in prison, and in 1987 he was fined $10,000 and sentenced to one year in prison and five years' probation. In a 1983 letter describing how he has prescribed laetrile and other \"alternative\" cancer treatments, Brodie stated that he had moved his practice to Nevada after \"political persecution\" by the California State Board of Medical Quality Assurance, which had unsuccessfully attempted to discipline him several times. Kirkpatrick Dilling, who was NHF's general counsel for many years, is an attorney who specializes in the issues in which NHF has been involved. He has also been the attorney for the Cancer Control Society, a group that promotes questionable methods of cancer treatment. H. Ray Evers, M.D., who died in 1990, was a leading practitioner of \"chelation therapy.\" During his career he claimed to have treated more than twenty thousand patients and supervised more than 500,000 chelation treatments. In 1976, at the FDA's request, a Louisiana federal judge prohibited Evers from using chelation therapy in Louisiana. Testimony in the case suggested that at least fourteen patients had died from this therapy at Evers' hospital. Later that year, Evers was given a suspended prison sentence and two years' probation after pleading guilty to \"intimidating and impeding officers of the Internal Revenue Service.\" According to the IRS agents' report, Evers had cursed at them, threatened their lives, and attempted to run one of them down with his car when they visited his property in connection with a tax matter. Evers then moved to Montgomery, Alabama, where, despite FDA efforts, a judge allowed him to continue doing chelation therapy. In 1980, he opened the ninety-bed Evers Health Center in Cottonwood, Alabama. His letter to prospective patients stated that his practice was \"limited to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic degenerative diseases by the nutritional, non-toxic, metabolic method including chelation therapy\" and offered \"special regimes of treatment\" for arthritis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, cancer, Parkinson's disease, and other diseases. According to the clinic brochure, a patient's typical day would include a visit with Dr. Evers, spinal manipulation by his chiropractic associate, chelation therapy (three hours), and other therapies such as hyperbaric oxygen and colonic irrigation. In December 1986, the Alabama Medical Licensure Commission revoked Evers's medical license. According to an article published by his son Michael, the proceedings were based on Evers's use of an herbal salve to treat a thirty-year-old woman who had cancer and died several months later, presumably of her disease. The revocation was for \"engaging in the practice of medicine in such a manner as to endanger the health of [the patient],\" \"using untruthful or deceptive or improbable statements concerning the effects or results of his proposed treatment,\" and \"demonstrating unprofessional conduct in the treatment of [the patient].\" The commission also concluded that Evers's actions constituted \"gross malpractice.\" After the appeals process ended, Evers moved his practice to Mexico. Michael Gerber, M.D., had his California medical license revoked after hearings before the California Board of Medical Quality Assurance in which he was accused in 1984 of improperly administering to patients. One patient was a fifty-six-year-old woman with treatable cancer who had allegedly died as a result of Gerber's neglect while he treated her with herbs, enzymes, coffee enemas, and chelation therapy. The other patients were three-year-old twin boys with ear infections for which Gerber had prescribed 70,000 or more International Units of vitamin A daily and coffee enemas twice daily for several weeks. After his medical license was revoked, Gerber acquired a homeopathic licence and began operating a chain of clinics in Nevada. Garry Gordon, M.D., has been president of the American Academy of Medical Preventics (currently called the American College of Advancement in Medicine), a group of doctors who do chelation therapy. He has also been medical director and board chairman of Mineralab (a large commercial hair analysis laboratory) and director of a subsidiary that sold questionable nutritional products. Bruce Halstead, M.D., was convicted in 1985 of twenty-four counts of cancer fraud and grand theft for selling an herbal tea called ADS to ten patients with cancer and other serious diseases for $125 to $150 per quart. Although he maintained that ADS was a \"nutritional supplement,\" analysis showed it to be 99.4 percent water and a brownish sludge composed mainly of coliform bacteria (the same bacteria found in human feces). Halstead, who operated the Halstead Preventive Medicine Clinic in Colton, California, has been a leading promoter of laetrile, chelation therapy, and many other questionable practices. Following the trial, which lasted for five months, Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Hyatt Seligman called Halstead \"a crook selling swamp water.\" He was fined $10,000 and sentenced to four years in prison, but remains free during the appeals process. According to an article published by Michael S. Evers, Halstead maintained during his trial that he was the target of a \"Medical Gestapo\" out to destroy health practitioners who deviate from orthodox cancer therapies such as surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. In 1992, his license to practice medicine in California was revoked. He is still vice-president of the Committee for Freedom of Choice in Medicine. Bruce Helvie had vitamin and mineral products seized by the FDA because they were marketed with false and misleading claims for the treatment of more than twenty-five diseases and conditions. The seized products were destroyed by consent decree in 1960. Bob Hoffman, who died in 1985, published bodybuilding magazines and sold bodybuilding equipment and food supplement products through his company, York Barbell Co., of York, Pennsylvania. In 1960, the company was charged with misbranding its Energol Germ Oil Concentrate because literature accompanying the oil claimed falsely that it could prevent or treat more than 120 diseases and conditions, including epilepsy, gallstones, and arthritis. The material was destroyed by consent decree. In 1961, fifteen other York Barbell products were seized as misbranded. In 1968, a larger number of products came under attack by the government for similar reasons. In the consent decree that settled the 1968 case, Hoffman and York Barbell agreed to stop a long list of questionable health claims for their products. In 1972, the FDA seized three types of York Barbell protein supplements, charging that they were misbranded with false and misleading bodybuilding claims. A few months later, the seized products were destroyed under a default decree. In 1974, the company was again charged with misbranding Energol Germ Oil Concentrate and protein supplements. The wheat germ oil had been claimed to be of special dietary value as a source of vigor and energy. A variety of false bodybuilding claims had been made for the protein supplements. The seized products were destroyed under a consent decree. Despite his many brushes with the law, Hoffman achieved considerable professional prominence. During his athletic career, first as an oarsman and then as a weightlifter, he received over six hundred trophies, certificates, and awards. He was the Olympic weightlifting coach from 1936 to 1968 and was a founding member of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. These activities helped make Hoffman a major factor in the growth of nutritional fads for athletes. Max Huberman was president of the National Nutritional Foods Association and a board member of the American Natural Hygiene Society. Victor Earl Irons, who was vice chairman of NHF's board of governors for more than twenty years, received a one-year prison sentence in 1957 for misbranding Vit-Ra-Tox, a vitamin mixture sold door to door. In 1959, shipments of eight products and accompanying literature shipped by V.E. Irons, Inc., were destroyed under a consent decree because the products were promoted with false or misleading claims. Other seized products were ordered destroyed in 1959 and 1960. Irons has claimed that virtually everyone has a \"clogged colon,\" that deposits of fecal material cause \"toxins and poisonous gases\" to \"seep into your blood and poison all your organs and tissues,\" and that \"if every person in this country took 23 home colonics a week, 95% of the doctors would have to retire for lack of business.\" Literature from V.E. Irons, Inc., has stated that \"the most important procedure toward regaining your Health is the COMPLETE and THOROUGH cleansing of the colon, no matter what or how long it takes.\" This is the goal of the \"Vit-Ra-Tox Seven Day Cleansing Program,\" which involves eating no food, drinking a quart or more of water daily, using herbal laxatives and various supplement products, and taking at least one strong black coffee enema each day. Ten years ago, products for this program cost $60, while those for maintenance after the seventh day cost about $100 per month. Bernard Jensen, D.C., is a leading proponent of iridology, a pseudoscientific system of diagnosis based upon examination of the eye. He formulated the products and was chairman of the health advisory board of Nova Nutritional Products, Inglewood, California, a multilevel company that called itself \"the ultimate in nutritional science.\" Nova's products included Stress-Buster, Immune Forte, and Endurance Plus. Jensen also helped found and was board chairman of Vitality International, a Seattle-based multilevel marketing company whose products included a \"life extension formula\" called New Youth. Terence Lemerond is president of Enzymatic Therapy, Inc., of Green Bay, Wisconsin, which has marketed hundreds of formulas containing vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, and/or glandular tissue. The company has made illegal claims for these products in advertisements, newsletters, \"confidential reports,\" testimonial messages, \"research bulletins,\" \"health guides,\" and other materials given to health food retailers for distribution to their customers. Company publications state that Lemerond studied nutrition for twenty years and was a nutritional consultant for nine years. During the late 1980s, the company held seminars whose attendees received a loose-leaf manual describing how Enzymatic Therapy products could be used to treat more than eighty diseases and conditions. The manual also contained \"protocols\" for using various products to combat AIDS, multiple sclerosis, cancer, arthritis, and other serious health problems. In 1991, after five years of investigation and several warnings, the FDA took Lemerond and Enzymatic Therapy to court. In 1992, the case was settled with a consent degree barring the company from marketing products with unproven therapeutic claims. The court order also lists fifty-six items that cannot be marketed or manufactured unless new promotional material for them is approved by the FDA. Andrew R.L. McNaughton was a central figure in the worldwide promotion of laetrile. In 1977, he was placed on two years' probation after pleading guilty to a criminal charge of conspiracy to facilitate the transportation of smuggled laetrile. He had a prior conviction in Canada for a stock fraud. Robert S. Mendelsohn, M.D., who died in 1988, was NHF's president from 1981 to 1982. He spoke frequently at NHF conventions and produced a newsletter and a syndicated newspaper column, both called The People's Doctor. Although he had taught at several medical schools and been chairman of the Illinois state licensing board, Mendelsohn considered himself a \"medical heretic.\" He opposed water fluoridation, immunization, licensing of nutritionists, and screening examinations to detect breast cancer. One of his books charged: \"Modern Medicine's treatments for disease are seldom effective, and they're often more dangerous than the diseases they're designed to treat\"; that \"around ninety percent of surgery is a waste of time, energy, money and life\"; and that most hospitals are so loosely run that \"murder is even a clear and present danger.\" Mendelsohn was also president of the New Medical Foundation, a tax-exempt organization formed in the late 1970s to support \"innovative forms of medical education of the public and the medical profession.\" At a meeting sponsored by this group in 1984, he said: Doctors complain that quacks keep patients away from orthodox medicine. I cheer! Since all the treatments, both orthodox and alternative, for cancer, coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke, and arthritis, are equally unproven, why would a sane person choose treatment that can kill the patient? In 1986, the National Nutritional Foods Association gave Mendelsohn its annual Rachel Carson Memorial Award for his \"concerns for the protection of the American consumer and health freedoms.\" Betty Lee Morales, who died in 1987, was president of the Cancer Control Society. She published two newsletters, owned a health food store, and was co-owner of Eden Ranch, the company that marketed Betty Lee Morales Signature Brand food supplements. Promotional material from Eden Ranch suggested that Americans who did not use food supplements ran a significant risk of developing deficiency diseases. Among its many supplement products were Lipotropic Plus, to relieve \"liver stress,\" and Nia-Flex, for stiff joints. During her career, Mrs. Morales also provided \"nutritional consultations\" by telephone and by mail. In 1976, the Lehigh Valley (Pa.) Committee Against Health Fraud (LVCAHF) tested the quality of her advice after answering an ad in Let's Live magazine for Eden Ranch products. The reply contained a two-page health questionnaire which LVCAHF returned, indicating that the writer, \"age 61,\" was in good health except that: For several years I have had (on and off) pain and swelling in the joints of my fingers and toes. During the past few months, I have had attacks of blurred vision. Sometimes my eyes ache and I see halos around lights at night. Your suggestions would be most welcome. The arthritis symptoms, while not specific, were compatible with a diagnosis of gout, a type of arthritis that can sometimes benefit from a special diet. The eye symptoms were taken from a textbook description of glaucoma, a condition that could soon lead to blindness if not medically treated. Mrs. Morales' reply contained a disclaimer that her advice was for: public education . . . and to assist individuals to cooperate with the doctors of their choice in building better health. . . . In the event that the information is used without the supervision or approval of a doctor, that is prescribing for yourself, which is your constitutional right, but we assume no responsibility. Her \"highly personalized nutrition program\" consisted of \"detoxification\" with a special diet and enemas, plus fifteen different food supplements that could be purchased from Eden Ranch or a health-food store. Based on an enclosed price list, the supplements would cost more than $40 per month; however, they had no medically recognized benefit for either arthritis or visual difficulty. Mrs. Morales did not appear to recognize that the writer's symptoms might be serious or require urgent medical attention. Roy F. Paxton headed a firm that marketed Millrue through agents, health food stores, and ads in an NHF publication. In addition, Paxton consulted personally with prospective customers, diagnosing them and recommending Millrue for such diseases as cancer, arthritis, and diabetes. In 1958, he and his company were fined a total of $1,200 for false and misleading labeling claims for Millrue. When they persisted in selling the product and promoting it through an NHF publication, the FDA again brought prosecution for misbranding. In 1963-the year that Paxton's term as NHF governor expired-he and the company were fined a total of $4,000 and he was sentenced to three years in prison. Donald F. Pickett founded and was board chairman of the Neo-Life Corporation, a multilevel company that sells dietary supplements and various other products. The company magazine has advised Neo-Life distributors that people who complain about being tired, sluggish, or listless might be lacking in essential nutrients. To induce sales, the magazine suggested telling prospects that \"food low in nutrients will have the same long-term effects on the body as used oil does to the automobile-lower performance and greater wear and tear.\" James R. Privitera, Jr., M.D., was convicted in 1975 and sentenced to six months in prison for conspiring to prescribe and distribute laetrile. In 1980, after the appeals process ended, he served fifty-five days in jail. Then, because he had been prescribing unapproved substances (including laetrile, calcium pangamate, and DMSO) for the treatment of cancer, the California Board of Medical Quality Assurance suspended Privitera's medical license for four months and placed him on ten years' probation under board supervision. During the probationary period, Privitera was \"prohibited from making any representation that he is able to cure cancer through nutrition.\" He was also forbidden to tell a patient he had cancer unless the diagnosis had been confirmed in writing by an appropriate board-certified specialist. Privitera founded two companies that have marketed devices for doing \"live cell analysis,\" a procedure in which blood obtained from a patient's finger is placed under a dark-field microscope to which a television monitor has been attached, so that both the practitioner and the patient can examine cells and particles in the blood. Proponents claim that this method can be used to detect \"multiple vitamin and mineral deficiencies, toxicity, tendencies toward allergic reaction, excess fat circulation, liver weakness, and arteriosclerosis.\" However, the test has little or no value in diagnosing such conditions. John N. Ritchason, N.D., wrote The Vitamin and Health Encyclopedia (1986) and The Little Herb Encyclopedia (1982), both of which recommend vitamins, minerals and/or herbs for more than 150 health problems. The books state that Ritchason had a Ph.D. from Donsbach University and was a naturopath, iridologist, herbalist, Touch-for-Health Instructor, and Registered Healthologist. Frank Salaman, a current board member and former husband of NHF president Maureen Salaman, was convicted in 1977 of conspiring to smuggle laetrile. Emory Thurston, who died in 1981, was an active promoter of laetrile and displayed pamphlets he had edited at a booth at NHF conventions. At a 1973 convention, when approached by an agent of the California Bureau of Food and Drug who said she had cancer of the uterus, Thurston offered to supply her with laetrile. He instructed the agent to contact him at his office at the Institute for Nutritional Research in Hollywood. He later sold laetrile to the agent and advised her not to have surgery. After additional evidence was gathered, Thurston was convicted, fined, and placed on probation for two years. In 1975, a federal court judge issued a [permanent injunction](https://cdn.centerforinquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2020/09/22170742/usa_v_general_research.pdf) barring Thurston, General Research Laboratories, and four other parties from manufacturing, selling, or distributing \"Apriikern,\" [bee] Seventeen\" or similar products in interstate commerce. These products products were being promoted as way to get the alleged benefits of laetrile in a \"food\" products. Paul J. Virgin, who has served as NHF treasurer, was public relations director of the Alta-Dena Dairy, the leading producer of certified raw (unpasteurized) milk. This dairy has been implicated repeatedly as a source of salmonella infection in raw milk consumers in California. In 1989, a California judge ordered the dairy (then operating as Steuve's Natural) to stop making false and misleading claims that its unpasteurized products were safer and nutritionally superior to pasteurized milk products. The judge also ordered the dairy to place a warning label on its raw milk cartons. [Floyd Weston is a former insurance executive who stated in an interview in NHF's Public Scrutiny that he had organized a group of businessmen in 1975 \"to conduct a worldwide search for the answer to good health.\" One of his \"discoveries\" was an \"electrodiagnosis\" machine based on the theory that there is \"an electric wiring system in the body-each organ having a wire that goes to a standard location in the hands and feet.\" Weston claimed that such devices can \"verify the exact condition of individual organs throughout the body,\" \"differentiate between acute, chronic, or degenerative stages,\" and \"discover these pathological processes when regular clinical diagnoses cannot detect them.\" Treatment is then administered with homeopathic remedies, vitamins, and/or minerals. At various times, Weston has shared ownership of a homeopathic clinic and marketed electrodiagnostic devices and homeopathic remedies. California authorities are currently trying to stop him from marketing such devices.] Other NHF board members have included Sid Williams, D.C. and Robert Atkins, M.D. NHF's \"Vitamin Bill\" NHF's most notable campaign occurred during the 1970s with a bill to weaken FDA jurisdiction over vitamins. In 1972, after lengthy study, the agency had proposed that food products be labeled so that ingredients, nutrient content, and other information would be displayed in a standard format. These provisions became regulations with little controversy. The FDA proposal also said that labeling could neither state nor imply that a balanced diet of ordinary foods cannot supply adequate amounts of nutrients. Because this struck at the heart of health food industry propaganda, NHF filed lawsuits and proposed legislation to remove FDA jurisdiction over vitamins. Crying \"Fight for your freedom to take vitamins!\" NHF organized its members and allies into unprecedented political activity. Article after article urging support of the anti-FDA bill appeared in the NHF Bulletin, in various health-food industry magazines, and in chiropractic journals. Letter-writing kits were distributed by chiropractors, by health-food stores, and in special NHF mailings. At a Congressional hearing on this issue, several Congressmen reported that they had received more mail about vitamins than about Watergate. In 1976, as a result of this pressure, Congress passed the Proxmire Amendment to the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Though not as restrictive as NHF's proposal, this law prevents the FDA from regulating food supplements unless they are inherently dangerous or are marketed with illegal claims that they can prevent or treat disease. NHF has also promoted \"Medical Freedom of Choice\" and \"Foods Are Not Drugs\" bills. Federal laws now require that all new drugs be proven both safe and effective before they are marketed. NHF's proposed bills, which would remove the efficacy requirement, would open the door to any supposed \"remedy\" that doesn't kill people on the spot. Such bills are a snake-oil salesman's dream. The Promotion of Laetrile Because laetrile lacks FDA approval, it is illegal to market it in interstate commerce. In 1977, a federal court set up an \"affidavit\" system under which personal supplies of laetrile could be imported into the United States by cancer patients certified by a physician as \"terminal.\" The plaintiff in the case was Glen Rutherford, a Kansas seed salesman who believed that laetrile was needed to keep him alive. Although the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against Rutherford in 1979, the affidavit system was not dismantled until 1987. During the appeals process, Rutherford became an NHF governor, Kirkpatrick Dilling became one of his lawyers, and NHF took care of his attorney fees. From 1978 to 1982, NHF published Public Scrutiny, a monthly newspaper (later converted to a magazine) whose primary focus was on laetrile and \"metabolic therapy.\" Most of its original staff members were prominent promoters of laetrile, and three of its advisers had been convicted of laetrile-related crimes. Each issue of Public Scrutiny contained a full-page ad from the Laetrile Information Center, a company near the Mexican border that would arrange for legal importation. Mexican clinics and other sellers of laetrile also advertised regularly in Public Scrutiny. After NHF governor James Privitera, M.D., was charged with a laetrile-related offense, appeals in Public Scrutiny raised more than $5,000 to help defend him; and after he was convicted, NHF generated more than 10,000 form letters asking California governor Jerry Brown to pardon him (which he did). NHF also contributed $5,000 toward the legal expenses of the parents of Chad Green, a three-year-old boy with leukemia; and an NHF governor served as a lawyer for the parents. Chad attracted nationwide attention when his family moved to Mexico to defy a Massachusetts court order that the boy receive proper therapy and stop getting laetrile. The October 1979 issue of Public Scrutiny described how Chad was thriving, how his father was studying for a career as a \"nutrition consultant,\" and how Chad's mother had stopped his chemotherapy without telling the Mexican clinic doctor. A few days after the newspaper was distributed, Chad died. His parents continued to promote laetrile and to claim that Chad died because he had \"lost the will to live.\" However, the autopsy showed recurrent leukemia, and cyanide (a breakdown product of laetrile) in his liver and spleen. NHF also assisted the parents of Joey Hofbauer, an eight-year-old boy with Hodgkin's disease, a form of cancer usually curable in its early stages. In 1977, New York State authorities sought custody of Joey because his parents chose laetrile over effective treatment for the boy. With NHF attorney Kirkpatrick Dilling representing the parents, the court ruled that they were \"concerned and loving\" and \"not neglectful\" in rejecting conventional treatment. After eighteen months of laetrile and megavitamin treatment from Michael Schachter, M.D. (a New York psychiatrist who occasionally lectures at NHF conventions), Joey was moved to the Bahamas for another type of questionable treatment. He died in 1980 with lungs full of tumors. A bill to exempt laetrile from FDA jurisdiction was introduced by Public Scrutiny's legislative advisor, physician-Congressman Larry McDonald (D-GA). In 1979, a malpractice suit against him by survivors of a patient he had treated with laetrile was settled for $30,000. NHF's efforts to exempt laetrile petered out after McDonald was killed in the crash of the Korean airliner shot down by the Soviets in 1983. Opposition to Fluoridation Adjusting community drinking water to about one part fluoride to one million parts of water is a safe, simple, and inexpensive way to help prevent tooth decay. Although NHF's leaders claim to be interested in preventing disease by \"proper nutrition,\" they are rigidly opposed to fluoridation. Over the years, NHF has assembled many documents which it claims are \"proof\" that fluoridation is dangerous (which it is not). Close examination of these documents shows that they contain reports of poorly designed \"experiments,\" twisted accounts of actual events, statements by respected scientists taken out of context to change their meaning, misinterpreted statistics, and other forms of falsification. Given enough publicity, however, these items have convinced many communities that fluoridation is too risky. In 1972, NHF granted $16,000 for a fluoridation study to the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), a group led by former associates of Ralph Nader. To help raise this money, a special mailing to NHF members announced that a clinically controlled test was being conducted by \"FRIENDS of indisputable, scientific reputation.\" The mailing claimed that the study would arm NHF with \"unassailable, up-to-date, scientific data to help defeat fluoridation.\" When CSPI learned about this message, it protested, stating that the study would be a scientific review whose outcome was certainly not fixed against fluoridation. NHF apologized, claiming that the fundraiser had been mailed \"without being cleared by appropriate officials\" and contained \"serious errors\" about the study's nature. NHF members were never told of these errors, however. Nor were they notified when the study concluded that \"the known benefits of fluoridation far outweigh any risks which may be involved.\" [In 1974, NHF announced that opposing fluoridation would be its number two priority and that a biochemist named John Yiamouyiannis had been hired to \"break the back\" of fluoridation. Yiamouyiannis soon began issuing reports based on misinterpreted government statistics, claiming that fluoridation causes cancer. He was joined in this effort by Dean Burk, a retired National Cancer Institute employee who was also a leading promoter of laetrile. In 1980, Yiamouyiannis left NHF and founded another group whose structure and activities were similar. Although NHF remains opposed to fluoridation, it has had little political involvement since Yiamouyiannis departed.] Recent Friction In 1986, a company controlled by Kurt Donsbach published The Great Medical Monopoly Wars, a book which claimed that the American Medical Association, the FDA, drug companies, and various individuals were conspiring to \"destroy the American free-enterprise system in the health care field.\" The book contained false and defamatory statements about antiquackery activists John H. Renner, M.D., and Victor Herbert, M.D., J.D. Despite warnings from the pair's attorney, NHF and several allied individuals, organizations, and publications promoted the book and made additional defamatory remarks. Dr. Renner filed suit in Missouri against six defendants and wound up collecting $60,000 in an out-of court settlement with Donsbach, Clinton Miller, and Maureen Salaman. Dr. Renner's suit against the book's author, P.J. Lisa, is still pending. Dr. Herbert filed suit in Iowa against twenty-six defendants, twenty-two of whom were dismissed by the judge because he felt that they were not doing enough business in Iowa for his court to have jurisdiction. Dr. Herbert has appealed the dismissal. The case involving the four remaining defendants is scheduled for trial in 1993. These lawsuits appear to have caused considerable strife among NHF's leaders, some of whom had been upset with each other anyway. In 1989, Donsbach left under bitter circumstances and launched a new organization. A special NHF report distributed in July 1990 stated that Clinton Miller had been fired for setting up an unauthorized bank account, and that attorney Dilling was suing NHF for $64,633.17 for allegedly unpaid fees in the Herbert and Renner cases. NHF wound up suing Donsbach, Miller, and various other former NHF members. These difficulties, added to other financial problems and decreased membership, appear to have greatly weakened NHF. Some Final Comments During the past century, scientists have developed rules for determining what methods are effective in preventing and treating disease. At the same time, laws have been developed to protect the public from methods that are ineffective, unproven, or promoted with misinformation. NHF is antagonistic to accepted scientific methods as well as to current consumer-protection laws. Instead of supporting the rules of science and law, its leaders want to destroy them. They clamor for the right to market methods without ensuring that they are effective. The \"freedom\" they espouse would be nothing more than a hunting license for quacks. Despite their shortcomings, can generate large letter-writing campaigns which create the illusion that they represent a large constituency. They have won some significant court and legislative battles and intend to win more. Additional Information This article was posted on July 18, 2003. The introduction was updated on July 15, 2012. "}
