[In addition to chiropractic care](/chiropractic-care/), [Triandos Chiropractic and Acupuncture provides acupuncture](/about-us/) for all those in need. This form of Traditional Chinese Medicine has been used for thousands of years to restore balance in the body and keep people well. Patients of all ages can benefit from acupuncture, which helps people relax and feel calmer. How Does Acupuncture Work? The human body's energy flow courses over 12 meridians or channels that are usually well balanced. If there's a disruption in the energy flow, that can alter the entire system. The result is pain or symptoms in the body. Unlike conventional healthcare approaches, acupuncture balances the body's energy by placing small, ultra-thin needles under the skin. By inserting these needles at particular points, we are able to create chemical changes in the body. These chemical changes ultimately reduce pain and other symptoms. If you're new to acupuncture, you understandably may be concerned about the needles. Though every person responds differently to acupuncture, most patients report little to no discomfort as the needles are inserted. It's like tapping a ballpoint pen on the skin. You also shouldn't feel discomfort once the needles are in place. Many patients don't feel them at all. A broad spectrum of health issues can effectively be treated with acupuncture. These include - Anxiety - Fatigue - Headaches and migraines - Infertility - Neck pain - Sinus problems - Stress How Often Is Acupuncture Necessary? Chronic problems generally require more sessions than acute ones. Typically, patients come in twice a week for the first week and then once a week. If all goes well, then we will recommend coming in once every two weeks. If you're wondering whether Alexandria acupuncture could benefit you, contact us today. "}
