The use of pure essential oils can have profound physiological and psychological effects as they work very quickly to change your emotional state and facilitate physical healing. When an essential oil is inhaled the aroma travels through the nose to the limbic system which is our emotional brain. The limbic system is directly connected to the part of the brain that controls heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, memory, stress levels, and hormone balance. When an essential oil is used topically the healing properties of the oil are absorbed into the body. Here at the studio I use only the highest quality essential oils. I also stock a variety of high quality essential oils for purchase in the boutique. Customized blends can be made depending on your individual needs and added to your massage or Reiki session and special blends can be crafted for clients to purchase. Aromatherapy workshops are available, see events list for any upcoming or contact me for scheduling information. I have been utilizing the healing essences of plants and essential oils for over twenty five years. I completed my formal Aromatherapist training through the [American College of Healthcare Sciences](https://www.achs.edu/) (2017 Graduate AAS in Complementary & Alternative Medicine, 2021 Graduate BS in Integrative Health Sciences, 2023 returned for MS in Integrative Health Sciences in process). I am a member of the [National Association of Holistic Aromatherapy](https://naha.org/) as a Level 3 Clinical Aromatherapist. Please be aware that I cannot personally advise you without seeing you first as a client in my studio. "}
