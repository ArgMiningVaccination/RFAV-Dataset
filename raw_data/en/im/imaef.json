I work with individuals and families who instinctively prefer a natural approach to health and wellness. My core values align with my work as a Homeopath and Naturopath; I have a deep respect for nature and I believe in cultivating health and wellness as a way of life, not just a remedy for illness. Having studied both naturopathy and homeopathy, I have a broad knowledge and appreciation of the rejuvenating capabilities of herbal medicine, nutrition, and homeopathic preparations, in conjunction with lifestyle choices. I have furthered my studies at university level to be able to understand the complex pathophysiological process that can cause chronic disease. My intent is to work alongside your doctor and specialists to assist you in the management of your health problem, while increasing the foundation of your wellness. About Naturopathy The naturopathic approach to health seeks to look at all the factors contributing to and detracting from your health and wellbeing, in order to find the path back to wellness, including: Stress Environmental factors Lifestyle factors Diet and nutritional quality of food Family health history Effects of past illness, injury or trauma A naturopath seeks to connect the dots between your health problem and the factors that impact your wellbeing. The naturopathic prescription draws from the therapeutic benefits of herbal medicine, nutritional supplementation, diet and lifestyle recommendations to help bring you back to good health.

Homeopathic preparations are derived from plants, minerals and other substances, but prepared in such away that no crude amount of the original material remains in the solution. Through ultra-dilution, homeopathic preparations are completely non-toxic. Through a process called 'potentisation', homeopathic preparations can interact with the human being at an energetic level. Homeopathy is thus a natural medicine operating at a higher vibration than herbs or functional foods. And so, people who resonate with a higher level of consciousness recognize the healing potential of homeopathy. Through Homeopathy, my aim is to help people who wish to heal in a holistic way. Homeopathy is for people who want to use gentle, non-toxic, non-invasive methods of healing, because that is the attitude they aspire to in life.
