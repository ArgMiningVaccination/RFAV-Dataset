We can all agree that pregnancy is a joyful, rewarding, and life-changing experience. But it also comes with important decisions to make and some not so pleasant side effects to contend with. Given all this, it's ok to admit that sometimes pregnancy can be stressful and challenging. Wouldn't it be nice if there were natural remedies available to help combat pregnancy stress, morning sickness, or nausea? Good news, essential oils are here to help! It is important to understand that every obstetrician has their own level of comfort talking with patients about essential oil use during pregnancy. Please be sure to talk to your [doctor](/message-us) before you try anything new before, during, or after pregnancy. Essential Oil Basics Essential oils are a class of evaporative aromatic oils derived from plants. Within their plant hosts, the oils are responsible for providing the plant's characteristic smell, attracting beneficial organisms, repelling harmful parasites, and helping the plant reproduce, regenerate, and heal. Ancient Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians are credited among the first humans to harness the many capabilities of essential oils. These ancient peoples developed the techniques used to extract essential oils from their natural plant habitats via distillation and pressing. They used essential oils because of their healing and medicinal properties, for cosmetic purposes, and to aid in spiritual meditation and relaxation. And after going through 2020, we can all agree that a little relaxation would be nice. Today we realize these same regenerative, healing, soothing, and aromatic benefits when essential oils are inhaled, diffused, ingested, or applied topically to the skin. Our selection of essential oils has expanded greatly from that of our ancient ancestors as distillation and pressing processes continue to grow in sophistication. Essential Oils and Pregnancy So, you may be thinking: natural healing, regenerative, and calming benefits all sound great, but are essential oils safe to use during pregnancy? The answer is yes, with a few special considerations. First, it's important to choose your essential oils with care. Select a reputable essential oil provider that delivers pure, high-quality, therapeutic-grade essential oils with an emphasis on scientific testing and responsible sourcing. The best essential oils are 100% plant derived without fillers or byproducts. Next, always exercise caution with essential oil use, specifically during the flurry of development that occurs in your first trimester. Additionally, avoid the essential oils listed in the [\"don'ts\"](#Essential_Oils_to_Avoid) section below. Finally, pregnant women should avoid ingesting and topically applying undiluted essential oils throughout pregnancy. Instead, try inhaling essential oils or adding them to a diffuser. If you elect to apply essential oils to your skin, make sure they're diluted with a carrier oil and test a small area of your skin for sensitivity before general use.
