It's obvious that there are so many types of medicine! Well, here's another one to add to that list: ethnomedicine. This lesson is going to define this kind of medicine and provide some examples of it that will hopefully help you understand what it's all about. Ethnomedicine Definition Ethnomedicine is a term that refers to a wide range of healthcare systems and structures, practices, beliefs, and therapeutic techniques that arise from indigenous cultural development. Ethnomedicine is also taken to mean the study of these systems and techniques more so from the sense of placing them into an anthropological context rather than evaluating their effectiveness using the scientific method (although the latter is possible). Either way, such healthcare systems don't necessarily follow the structure of modern or Western medicine. Instead, these healthcare practices are based on the unique culture that has arisen from native and indigenous groups of people. Ethnomedicine isn't limited to the obvious things, like using indigenous plants and ingredients to treat the sick. It also involves studying or utilizing the following: - How a disease or illness arises, according to the native cultural point of view. - Indigenous beliefs about what a person's signs and symptoms really mean. - The way by which a disease or illness progresses. - The best ways by which a disorder should be managed and who should manage it and how. In the last case, that may be the person who is sick themselves, or it may be a practitioner of that form of ethnomedicine, like a local shaman. Ethnomedical systems tend to see the mind and body as one entity and they focus on preventative techniques, such as the use of massage therapy, exercise, spices, herbs, and food to heal a diseased or ill individual. On that note, it should be mentioned that although the terms ''disease'' and ''illness'' are often used synonymously, they aren't necessarily the same thing in the field of medical anthropology. The word disease tends to be used when referring to a structural or functional problem of the body itself whereas illness refers to the subjective experiences and perspectives of the person with respect to their disease (the mind-body connection mentioned before). Ethnomedicine Examples In any case, many forms of Eastern medicine, such as traditional Chinese medicine, are examples of ethnomedicine. This means techniques like herbal therapy, acupressure, and acupuncture are some well-known practical examples of ethnomedicine as well. Another example of ethnomedicine is Ayurvedic medicine. This practice may involve the use of oils, massage, and even laxatives to help restore a person's harmony and balance and cleanse their body. Other examples of ethnomedical techniques include: - Yoga - Tai chi - Meditation - Sorcery and magical incantations - Dance and music - Reiki - Qigong - Aromatherapy All of these techniques, in one way or another, may be seen by local populations as a way by which the mind and body can be healed. And as you can also tell by now, ethnomedicine overlaps with quite a few of those terms in the introduction. It includes many aspects of traditional medicine, such as traditional Chinese medicine, which in this case is a part of Eastern medicine in general. But not all forms of Eastern medicine are necessarily ethnomedicine. For example, acupuncture may be part of one indigenous culture in Asia but not another. Lesson Summary All right, let's now take a moment or two to review. As we learned in this lesson, ethnomedicine refers to a wide range of healthcare systems and structures, practices, beliefs, and therapeutic techniques that arise from indigenous cultural development. This term also refers to the study of these things, commonly from an anthropological point of view, as opposed to trying to prove or disprove their validity through the scientific method. Ethnomedicine isn't just about using native plants to heal the body. It's also about understanding the healthcare system and structure as a whole, including: - How a disease or illness arises, according to the native cultural point of view. - Indigenous beliefs about what a person's signs and symptoms really mean. - The way by which a disease or illness progresses. - The best ways by which a disorder should be managed and who should manage it and how. For instance, traditional Chinese medicine may rely on acupuncture to heal the body. Ayurvedic medicine may rely on herbs and laxatives to do so. Other indigenous communities may rely on chants or ritual dance and music. Others still may believe yoga, meditation, and massage can help heal a person.
