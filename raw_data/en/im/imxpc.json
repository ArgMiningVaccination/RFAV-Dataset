AAFA is the leading patient organization advocating for people with asthma and allergies, and the oldest asthma and aller gy patient group in the world. RSV can be particularly dangerous for older adults with asthma. RSV can trigger asthma episodes or attacks. Being over 65 and having asthma are both factors for greater risk of RSV -related hospitalization or death.1 Because of the severe impact of RSV on older adults, particularly older adults with asthma or other chronic lung disease, we are heartened by the potential availability of these vaccines . In the U.S., older adults with asthma face myriad challenges. Approximately 7.8% of people aged 65 and older have asthma, a rate roughly the same as that experienced across the whole population. 2 However, for older adults, asthma can 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \"Older Adults are at High Risk for Severe RSV Infection\" (2022).

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. have more severe consequences, triggering more sympto ms and higher death rates.3 Physical changes from aging, reduced motor and other skills, lower income, and the demands of other comorbid conditions can all exacerbate older adults' asthma and create barriers to care.4 Overall, older adults are more l ikely to be underdiagnosed and undertreated for asthma than younger adults.5 Reflecting overall disparities in asthma in the U.S. , asthma impacts older adults of certain racial and ethnic groups more severely ; for example, older adults with asthma who are Black, Hispanic, and/or low income are at a heightened risk of frequent hospitalization.6 Because of these factors, we ask the Advisory Committee to take into account not only the overall potential impact of RSV vaccines for olde r adults, but in particular the potential importance of such vaccines for older adults with asthma, including those subpopulations most burdened by the disease. A vaccine for RSV could reduce asthma exacerbations, improving quality of life for older adults living with asthma; and reduce mortality, particularly among older adults with asthma. Our patient community drives our work. AAFA strongly supports utilization of preventive interventions that can improve the health of individuals and communities living with asthma. This includes education and outreach to encourage utilization of vaccines for respiratory illnesses that can exacerbate asthma, such as flu, pneumococcal disease, and whooping cough,7 based on https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/most_recent_national_asthma_data.htm . CDC asthma surveillance data does not separate adults age 60 -64 from the larger adult population of 35-64. 3 AAFA, \"Asthma in Older https://aafa.org/asthma/living- with -asthma/asthma- in-older -adults/ 4 Id. 5 Dunn, R.
