We wish to also warmly thank all our contributors to this edition. We thank and farewell Dr Alduino Mazzone, who now retires from the review panel of our Journal. Alduino turned 60 this year and has lived for the last 51 years in Adelaide after early childhood in Italy where his family originates. After graduating, he first taught in high schools, also with times as training manager in the Institute for FitnessResearch and Training and as a Social Development consultant with the Research Branch of the SA Education Department. He was an excellent gymnast and competed nationally as a member of the state gymnastics squad. Following a deep interest in Rudolf Steiner\u0092s work for some years, in 1979 he became a founding teacher at the MtBarker Waldorf School in Adelaide. During these years and the years following he was also involved in school management, in parent education and teacher education. He eventually resigned from class teaching in 1992. He then worked as a Waldorf education consultant in numerous new Steiner schools around Australia and Steiner based foundation courses and teacher training (Parsifal College- Sydney, Raphael College-NSW, and Rudolf Steiner College- Adelaide), working with students, teachers and parents. He was also Council Coordinator of the national Council of the Anthroposophical Society for almost 10 years and became a Class holder within the Society. Alduino was a founding member and first coordinator of the Pedagogical Section of the Anthroposophical Society inAustralia. It was formed in 1995 here in Adelaide with Dr Heinz Zimmermann present. Alduino strove enthusiastically to bring the esoteric content of Anthroposophy into practical life \u0096 with regular teaching work, meditative work and initiating contacts with other schools, helping organise conferences and remaining in touch with colleagues both interstate and overseas. He published regular newslettersand went on to completed a Masters In Educational Studies(\u0093Islands of Culture\u0094: The Origin and Development of Steiner/ Waldorf Schools in Australia-1995) and a PhD (The Implications for Teacher Education of Rudolf Steiner\u0092sEducational Philosophy and its Practice in Waldorf Schools- 1999). In 2001 Alduino retired from the role of Ed Section coordinator and was succeeded by Peter Glasby. Increasingly, after the completion of his PhD, and as one of the first to do post graduate work in Steiner education inAustralia, he has acted as examiner, reader, and advisor to many other post graduate students, on post graduate study and research with reference to Rudolf Steiner, Anthroposophy and/or Steiner Waldorf education in Australia and overseas. This advisory work has continued up to the present time and concludes with the writing of his newly published book A Passionate Schooling . Key ideas behind Steiner Waldorf education. In 1999, Alduino, in his late forties, faced a healing crisis in the form of primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Aftermany unsuccessful attempts with different healing modalities, he eventually concluded that the illness for him was not about becoming \u0091healed\u0092, but a challenge to find the source of quiet within himself even while accepting the increasing powerlessness and helplessness brought on by the disease process. This challenge to live with dignity and equanimity with such a paralysing illness has lived side by side with his passion to share his insights into Rudolf Steiner\u0092s work in his new book. It has been a marvel to Alduino\u0092s many friends and admirers, how he has met the challenges of his illness with equanimity,objectivity and good humour. He has helped review the Journal for many years, despite enormous obstacles to reading and typing. His keen academic mind and his prompt responses will be sorely missed. His movements are now severely restricted (quadriplegic) and he continues to meet life with interest, warmth and calm. The achievement of completing and publishing his book A Passionate Schooling are a credit to his shining spirit and the love and care of his partner SueLaing and his wonderful family. With grateful acknowledgement and appreciation of all your warmth and encouragement for our work \u0096 from theeditors \u0096 Neil Carter and Peter Glasby.JOURNAL for Waldorf Education Vol 12.2, October, 2010 3Recently, in August 2010, we built a lime kiln for the first chemistry lessons of Class 7 at Raphael House Rudolf Steiner School, Wellington NZ. Thefollowing is to facilitate class teachers repeating this sometimes elusive process. We begin with a brief description of a way of teaching introductory chemistry to children at the end of their primary schooling in a way that both develops and extends their intellectual muscle while at the same time building a context for the experiences andconcepts that can engage the young person in a deeper way with the everyday life around them. Our approach will look at \u0091substance\u0092 as the outcome of\u0091processes\u0092 - life processes at that. So substance not as the prime mover but rather the end of life processes whose qualities are then foundmetamorphosed in the qualities of the substances that emerge. The opposing approach will be the teaching of chemistry as if the world is primarily builton matter (the common paradigm). In that approach, children are taught about the aggregate states of matter from an atomistic point of view \u0093as if atomswere little particles\u0094 that somehow form the basis of life, soul and spirit. Fire is the starting point. It is not a thing that you can pick up and put in your pocket easily. It has more the characteristics of a process with movement and activity than \u0093thing-like\u0094 properties. It dances and moves as light and warmth consuming form andsubstance as it does so. The whole environment becomes involved in the process. The surroundings are lit up and warmed; movement is created as airmoves in and rises above. The bigger the fire, the greater the wind created - the more it involves its surroundings. To stir their imagination, children could be told about fire \u0096 its role in human life. Perhaps the role of fire in the taming and domestication of wild animals such as the Asian elephant. The following story is from my own childhood. I remember the privilege of being allowed to spend some time in an elephant camp of a friend of my father, Lalji we called him, the Raja of Gauripur,Assam.Building a Lime Calcination Kiln for Class 7 ChemistryPeter Glasby pglasby@adam.com.au The elephant camp was in, what is now, the Garo Hills. Only men lived there, leaving their wives and children back in their villages. The life in the camps was intense and focussed on the catching and tamingof these magnificent animals of the Asian jungles. Only on the Asian continent have these animals been tamed and brought under control of human hands.Fire is the element that plays a major role in this domestication of the elephant. Deep in the jungle a sturdy stockade is built out of logs. A wild herd is then located and driven with much noise by the people on their tamed elephants into the stockade. Once inside the gates are closed and as night falls men climb onto the walls of the stockadewith burning torches which terrifies the wild herd inside. When the herd is in this terrified state, the gates are opened and a number of domestic tuskerswith disguised mounts enter. For disguise the mahouts cover themselves with elephant dung and hang beneath the necks of their charges. The tuskers then move amongst the herd isolating the young elephants from their mothers. When isolated the mahouts slip to the ground and place ropes around the young elephants. When a number have been bound in this way, there is a rising of the noise again and the gates are opened. The panic stricken herd, including the mothers, surge through the gates and into the night filled jungle leaving their offspring bound in the stockade between overbearing tuskers. Between these tuskers they are then walked back to the camp, fighting and straining against their captors. In the camp the young elephants are bound by their back ankles to a tree behind and by their neck to a tree in front. Their front legs were free and they had limited lateral movement. One person was assigned to visit them daily with food and water. After some time in this situation, say a week, most of the mahouts in the camp would visit the elephant at night. Usually a quantity of rice beer had been drunk by the men who carried burning torches and were singing in unison. They surrounded the elephant, waving the torches before him while singing and swaying. Fire and the human voice were combined in this way as something which the4 JOURNAL for Waldorf Education Vol 12.2, October, 2010elephant gradually had to become accustomed to. This was repeated on many nights and then enhanced by the singing, fire waving men rubbingthe elephant with great wads of grass. The element of touch was then added to the sound of the human voice and the warmth of fire, the element that soterrified the wild creatures. A further enhancement is the climbing of the men beneath the belly of the elephant and finally climbing onto the elephant. Aftersome nights of this ritual, the mahout assigned to that elephant gets onto its neck and between two tuskers is escorted to the river for its first \u0091domesticbath\u0092. Eventually the mahout is able to take the elephant alone to the river for its daily bath. Such a story gives a picture of how fire is so closely linked to humanity in its separateness from the naturalorder. Another story that deals with this in a different way is the story from Greek mythology of Prometheuswho stole the fire from the Gods to give the possibility of freedom to humankind - a deed he was severelypunished for. Throughout these introductory lessons on chemistry, further stories can be introduced that develops this imagination of the connection betweenhumanity and fire. The first lessons then can be built around the building of fires from plant material and observingthis primeval process. These experiments can be extended to look at different types of fires - glowing charcoal whose glow can be effected by the chimney created above it (an earthy fire); a flowing fire waterfall made of an ignited mixtureof Methylated spirits and water in a proportion of 80% methylated spirits:20% water (a watery fire); the fire made by expelling propane gas, from abrown paper bag, over a candle (an airy fire); the fire made by careful controlled burning of petrol(a fiery fire, which could be described at anothertime, and needs careful preparation to be done safely). A next step could be to collect the substances emerging from fire. The smoke from the flickeringpole of the fire can be collected and passed through diluted juice 1 of a red cabbage (a sensitive indicator) which will become tinged to pink from its original violet colour. The ash, from the base of the fire, will colourthe cabbage juice green (in neutral rain water thejuice is violet). The juice of the cabbage is an indicator for acids when it is red and for alkalis when it is green.You can get a whole spectrum of colours with it using soap, vinegar, lemon juice, bicarbonate of soda andother things. Other experiments could explore other substances from the children\u0092s lives \u0097 lemon juice, vinegar, soap,bicarbonate of soda, tartaric acid, window cleaner,etc. using taste in connection with the red cabbage juice. There is not space here to describe in detail the many experiments, questions and activities thatcan accompany the lessons. Suffice to say that from the fire can emerge the polarities of acid and base (alkali) - fundamental polarities of chemistry but alsoof life in a much broader sense, and also the idea of neutralization. A further step in this introductory chemistry block is to take fire deeper - take it into the mineral world,into the limestone, the rock that comes out of animal life. Here we come upon another ancient process -Calcination, where limestone is heated to between 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C in a kiln. This process forms the basis of the making of lime mortarused for building houses and the lime milk for fresco painting. The process is very impressive but often is missed because of the perceived difficulties inachieving the high temperatures in the classroom during the time of a main lesson. The following description with picture provides a simple, safe andvery efficient way of calcining limestone during a main lesson, while at the same time allowing the collection of the acidic gas (carbonic acid) coming off theprocess as \u0093smoke\u0094 and the alkaline \u0093ash\u0094 remaining behind as the \u0093enlivened limestone\u0094 - the quick lime or \u0093thirsty lime\u0094. When you heat the marble to 1000degrees centigrade, the deadening gas, carbon dioxide is driven out of the marble, and bubbles through the red cabbage juice. Carbon dioxide isheavier than air and if the hose that comes out of the flask containing the red cabbage juice is put into a jug with a cloth over the top then the jug will fill upwith the invisible liquid air. If you lower a little lighted candle into the jug, it will be extinguished. You can pour the invisible air into a cup and drink it. It willhave a slightly sour taste. The red cabbage juice will go a slightly pink as the carbon dioxide dissolves in the water and forms carbonic acid. 1 During winter and spring, it is easy to find a red cabbage at the produce market or greengrocer. It is a cabbage which has a red-violet colour. Buy one of them and cut it in little slices. Put them in a pot and pour enough water to cover them. Boil for half an hour, then turn off the heat and let the temperature come down. Pour the blue- violet liquid you have obtained into a container.JOURNAL for Waldorf Education Vol 12.2, October, 2010 5 Figure 1: The kiln being built to show the space needed. Figure 2: Beginning the kiln Figure 3: The back of the kiln where the burner will be inserted. Notice the little apron of ceramic fibre wool which forms the base of the fire box and extends out beneath where the burner will be to prevent the heat getting down to the bench. Figure 4: The ceramic fibre lining of the sides of the fire box, which must be just big enough to fit the steel calcination tube with only small gaps around it. Figure 5: The addition of the ceramic fibre top to the fire box. FIG 4FIG 5If you peep into the kiln during the heating process you may see the brilliant white \u0093limelight\u0094 emitted by the hot marble block. When the marble has cooledit will have lost its shine and become chalky. It has really come to life and responds to water by becoming very hot. It is very thirsty. It moves and steams and isvery lively. Eventually its thirst is quenched and it becomes lime milk which can be used to make fresco paintings. This hydrated (slaked) lime then sucksback in carbon dioxide from the air and becomes limestone again. So the fresco is a painting that has become stone. (Ajanta Caves). A further step in the main lesson would involve theburning of Sulphur which leaves no ash but only a very acid smoke. Then would follow the burning of metal (copper) which leaves an ash but no smoke. This ash is the ore we find in the earth from which the pure metals are them smelted - another primeval process which makes up this introduction tochemistry. The main lesson then spans fire in the plant world to fire in that part of the mineral world thatcomes from the animals to the fire in the fiery non-metal (sulphur) to the fire around the production of metals out of their ashes (ores) deep in the earth. Construction of the kiln The classroom kiln is built from loose concrete and/or clay bricks and lining made from sheets of ceramic fibre wool obtainable from a fireplace or kiln shop. The fire source is a propane gas Teclu Burner, or somethingsimilar, which produces a noisy very hot blue flame about 4cms long and 2cm thick. The pieces of limestone or marble to be calcined are fitted into the end of a length of steel piping (2.5cm diameter) that reaches into thekiln. The steel tube must be welded airtight closed at one end. The tube end rests on a larger piece of marble.

Figure 9: The back of the kiln with the steel calcination tube resting on piece of marble. Note the spacing. Figure 10: The flap at the back of the kiln with the hole in the ceramic fibre wool. This arrangement protects the burner from the heat of the fire box. The burner in this case is a Teclu Burner, but can be replaced by something equivalent. Figure 11: Looking back into the fire box from the chimney end. Figure 12: The working kiln with the burner going and a glass tube extending from the calcination tube taking the vented gases through the conical flask containing dilute red cabbage juice. Figure 13: The inlet to the flask containing red cabbage juice goes to the bottom of the vessel ensuring the gas bubbles up through the juice. The outlet has a rubber tube on it, which takes the gas into a jug, to be poured into glasses and tasted. The gas can also be shown to extinguish candle flames i.e. it is a 'dead' gas.FIG 6FIG 7 FIG 8 FIG 9 FIG 10FIG 11 FIG 12FIG 13JOURNAL for Waldorf Education Vol 12.2, October, 2010 7The story of Limestone begins with moist little creatures creating hard coverings (houses) for themselves (think of the bird\u0092s egg). These rain down out of the ocean creating vast deposits of lime sludge in the ocean, upto 1.5km deep, theprecursors of future limestone rock and mountain formations. Limestome then gets eroded by acid rain creating the \u0093airy\u0094 karst 2 landscapes with caves that form the homes for bats, bears and human beings. This limestone is then cut from the karst landscapes and calcined to make mortarfor the making of houses again - a theme in the chemistry of limestone. Figure 14: The calcination tube being emptied after 45 minutes. The shiny marble has become chalky white.Figure 15: Slaking the thirst of the enlivened quick lime. After the expulsion of the 'dead' gas it has become very lively, giving of great heat, making sounds and moving.FIG 14FIG 15 Summary: The process is an archetypal chemical process which underlies the making of mortar for buildings, the beginnings of cement making and the paintingof frescoes. It belongs in the sequence ofcombustion processes which make up the firstchemistry of the Waldorf Steiner Schools - Theburning of plant material and all that goes with that,then the calcination of limestone - a rock thatderives from the animal kingdom, then the burningof Sulphur which has no ash only acid smoke, andfinally the burning of metal which has no smokebut only an ash which is the ore of the metal whichthen leads to the smelting of cassiterite (tin oxide). The kiln worked extremely well. References: Manfred v. Mack ensen, 43.

The lecture from Oct. 7th 1923 on the Easter Imagination gives some interesting esoteric insights about limestone and its enlivening in the Spring (for the teacher's background).2 The term karst referred originally to the limestone landscape of the Karst area, near Trieste around the Italy-Slovenia borde r. Large rivers disappear underground, and there are many caves, enclosed depressions, fluted rock outcrops, periodic lakes, subterranea n rivers, and large springs.8 JOURNAL for Waldorf Education Vol 12.2, October, 2010Having taught as a Geography teacher for 10 years in mainstream education and now working as a lecturer in Teacher Training at the Wits Schoolof Education, a dramatic first impression as the Geography teacher at Michael Mount Waldorf School in South Africa from 2006 to 2008, wasthat the students had an inert sense of wanting to learn; were far more self-confident, assertive and \u0091sure-of-themselves\u0092 than most of their peers inconventional schooling; and were also really engaged in the idea and sense of \u0091community\u0092 - suggesting that Waldorf Education has a great dealto offer South Africa\u0092s education system - as it seems to educate the child more holistically. South Africa has survived the \u0091teething\u0092 process of democracy and as an \u0091adolescent\u0092 herself,rushes forward to another period of growth, development and prosperity towards heradulthood. Education in South Africa has undergone tumultuous times and possibly the lessons and wisdom of Steiner Education can beapplied in our move towards \u0091lifelong learning\u0092 in this new Millennium? Particularly as South Africa embarks on yet further curriculum changes andimprovements in the next decade. CLASS ELEVEN CLIMATOLOGY MAIN LESSON (16-17year olds) In a Class 11 Climatology main lesson which I taught under the supportive and mentoring eye of an experienced Waldorf Teacher (Elizabeth Swanepoel) \u0096 the discussion centered on themechanics of primary air circulation. After a day or two of establishing the basic tenets of air temperature; air pressure and their relationship toone another and how this causes wind \u0096 the learners were given the task of creating a model to illustrate how global air circulation (commonlyknown as the Tri-cellular arrangement) functions in the Earth system.Figure 1 illustrates the imaginative genius of one learner who used a melon; toothpicks and arrows(drawn on paper) to demonstrate how the global circulation of air occurs within the Earth\u0092satmosphere. Much written work was undertaken, although a day or two was spent on conceptualising and creating these models duringthe main lesson time of the school day. During this 2 to 3 week time period, children create their own \u0091main lesson\u0092 book - which documents thelearning and content presented in the main lesson. Astronomy is another exciting example of the quality and extent of a Class 11 Main Lesson. CLASS ELEVEN ASTRONOMY MAIN LESSON In 2008, I taught the class 11 main lesson on Astronomy where the learners are exposed to all phenomena and processes known to occur in the cosmos. I started off by incorporating music intothe lesson by teaching the class to sing The Galaxy Song (by Monty Python - which is a humorous,Learner-centred Geography Main Lessons at Michael Mount Waldorf School, Johannesburg, South AfricaClinton D. van der Merwe1 & Elizabeth Swanepoel2, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa Figure 1: Model of the Earth's Primary Circulation. 1 Lecturer: Geography in Education & PGCE Coordinator, Social & Economic Sciences, Wits School of Education, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. 2 Deputy Administrator & English Teacher of Michael Mount Waldorf School, Bryanston, South Africa. Elizabeth is reading towards a MEd at Rhodes University, South Africa.JOURNAL for Waldorf Education Vol 12.2, October, 2010 9yet informative start to this vast topic). Every aspect of the main lesson encompasses an artistic, intellectual and possibly physical task to thelearning process. Figure 2 demonstrates the level of effort (and pride) that each learner invests in his/her main lesson book. In every main lesson the teacher endeavours to create room for critical thought and abstractthinking. We encourage learners to ask questionsand challenge conventional wisdom (a task that keeps the teacher attentive and on top of matters). After a couple of weeks, having taught Waldorfeducated children, I found the learners far more \u0091engaging\u0092 and \u0091broad-minded\u0092 - as they have been encouraged to really think throughout theirschooling. Steiner felt strongly that teaching is an art (Clouder, 2003: 23). Fundamental to the art of Figure 2: An extract from a Class 11 learner's Astronomy main lesson book. education is the perception of the child and understanding childhood as an integrated physical and spiritual process (Clouder, 2003: 23). This willthen lead the teacher to an understanding of what needs to be taught; when; and how (Clouder, 2003: 23). \u0093It is essential that we develop an art ofeducation which will lead us out of the social chaos into which we have fallen. The only way out of this social chaos is to bring spirituality into the souls ofmen through education, so that out of the spirit itself men may find the way to progress and the further evolution of civilization.\u0094 (Steiner, in Childs,1991: i).

Great Barrington: Anthroposophic Press.10 JOURNAL for Waldorf Education Vol 12.2, October, 2010The children must be introduced to the play long before rehearsals are scheduled. e.g. if you are doing a play about Robin Hood in the 3rd term, then in the first term you need to introduce: the background to the stories of Robin Hood, giving a historical picture of the times the storiestook place and the prevailing themes or issues; the characters - depicting them as fully as youcan, bringing them to life; the story; do improvisations from critical moments in thestory - e.g. Robin meeting Little John on thelog crossing the river - ask children to improvise dialogue and actions; set writing exercises around key moments in the play: e.g. get them to write a letter such asRobin Hood would have written to Maid Marion saying what he thinks of Little John; Lots of language exercises, e.g. design a proclamation that the Sheriff of Nottingham might have made to be put up everywhere outlawing certain behaviours and which mighttrigger men leaving to join Robin Hood. The point is for the whole class to be introduced to the whole play \u0096 story \u0096 without actually knowing they are going to do it as a play and withoutknowing which part they will take. This work could be done in regular English classes, so long as it involves lots of languagework, speaking spontaneously and which asksthem to think about the play and the charactersand to understand the main themes. After some time when you pick up the play to begin work, you once again go through this stagebut more quickly - overview, characters, story in ascene by scene way. Then the teacher MUST SPEAK THE WHOLE PLAY FOR THE CLASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is so essential - that it should be a law! The children must not see the play, they must notread it for themselves, they must HEAR IT FORTHE FIRST TIME.Steiner even insists that at lower class levels the class teacher knows every word of the play. Why is this? Because children speak the way the words are arranged on the page, so if they read itfor themselves, they often give the speeches strange inflections or flow or pronunciation. Once they have said the line - they tend to always say itthe same way, so it is essential that they hear it said in the best way that the teacher can manage. This reading can be taken in small bouts - one scene at a time with some discussion or gamesfollowing. But at no time does the teacher let on any of the casting - it must remain a secret.However, I often ask the children to write me letters if there is a part they really would like. This often does not change my mind, but it can be revealingand helpful if you have some questions around casting. Then the whole class reads the play one scene at a time. You ask them to sit in a circle, when it istheir turn to read, (just read around the circle, each person reading the next speech, do not havechildren take parts!) Ask them to speak loudly, clearly and slowly without rushing to drama. The main point of all this work is to get to know the play without fixingit. Children who read well, or who think they aregood actors will often read fast, rush to conclusionsabout what is happening or who the charactersare and miss deepening their understanding. Only when the whole play has been read through in this way do you cast the play. I do a big build up to this - drum roll, make them wait till an auspicious moment. Because thismarks a huge stage in putting on a play. The wholeproject moves on from being the WHOLE play,which we all consider, into PARTS, for when youcast it, it is as though the play shatters into piecesand each child picks up a piece. It is also essential that you prep children to understand that there is no such thing as a bigpart or a little part - that this stage is like life: weall must take a part and we are all important, andone of the most important things children (and theirPutting on a Class Play with ChildrenRobyn Hewetson, Hawkes Bay, New ZealandJOURNAL for Waldorf Education Vol 12.2, October, 2010 11teacher) discover in doing a play is that we need each other more than we know! we simply cannot do the play if one person fails! Once the play is cast - the speaking in parts rehearsing begins. If you read any \u0091direction\u0092courses they always tell you to begin with blocking- staging - Rudolf Steiner did not! He suggests that the play is above our heads - in the realm of cosmic word - and we are in theprocess of bringing it to earth. This process is a downward one, beginning with the words, progressing to gestures and ending with stagingand prop handling etc. So the first stage is working on the words. This is the most important part of a play - if you look atShakespeare you will see a singular thing - there are almost no directions!!!!! The play is in the words. The best way for children to learn words is not by reading but by hearing, so I establish a Buddy for each child and I work one-on-one with each child. Set the language in a clear healthy place,full of breath, coming out into the room, full of enthusiasm and form and you are 99% of the way towards having a play. I arrange the children loosely where they might be on stage and help them to get their lines all theway out. The next trick is to know where the linesfit in the play \u0096 so weaving the play into a new form, made up from the lines which each student now \u0093owns\u0094, is the next stage. When the lines are in \u0096 and becoming automatic \u0096 then you introduce gestures. Try to find out what the character is doing with their hands toemphasise their speech. It is important for allteachers to have lessons with Steiner\u0092s 6 basicgestures for stage - too hard to be described here. When lines and gestures are flowing, then you can move the play. It is astounding how easy thisis when the other parts are learned. The other hugely important thing is the way characters relate to each other on stage. Manypeople make the mistake of directing a play as if itwere a natural event, or the same way as screenacting is done. This is quite wrong. The play is not done for the players themselves, but for the audience, so the teacher must learn tolook at the play from the audience\u0092s point of viewand direct it from there. The actors must look to the audience for the bulk of their performing. See for yourself how important it is to you to see themouth of the speaker or singer when you are in the audience. There is no reason EVER for an actor to speak to the back of the stage!!!!!! Remember - that when you and your class perform this play - it has never been seen before- you found the script, you learned it, you cast it,but when you all put it together it is now completely new, fresh, created by you and as such it is an entirely new creation being given to the earth. Lastly, never forget that the nature of the performing arts is that it is always happening inthe NOW. The audience pays money to go andsee people in the act of creation! They are working and people come to watch that work as it takes place. It is a marvellous thing. If we go to a gallery,we go to see the work that an artist has done, if we go to the theatre we go to see the artist in the act of creating, we participate in that creation andadd to it by our response. Lastly - and it is beating an old drum now - remember always that the purpose of all aspectsof theatre is to increase the repertoire of responses for both the actors and the audience. You want the actors to respond to each other, and indeed totheir own creation; and we want to allow the audience time to respond. All good reasons for not rushing on. The main task of all this work is to increase our ABILITY TO RESPOND to life. Good luck. If you have a chance, ask a speech and drama teacher to give you all short courseson this vital and fabulous art. Robyn Hewetson is a New Zealander who qualified as a state school teacher before training at Emerson College in Steiner Education. After working with a class in England, she went on to do the 4 year speech and drama training in London School of Speech Formation with Maisie Jones followed by 21 years in America including work in Steiner Schools and in corporations teaching speech to business people. Back in NZ she teaches at Taruna College on a variety of courses, works with adults with disabilities at Hohepa Homes and has a business called 'WELL- SPOKEN'. Robyn also gives creative speaking, poetry and presentation skills classes to corporations, groups and individuals.12 JOURNAL for Waldorf Education Vol 12.2, October, 2010It seems this is a question that needs to be asked of schools and teachers. The Waldorf School is characterised by both the independence of its teachers and its origins in the work of Rudolf Steiner with a group of teachers towhom he entrusted a task with specific detail anddirection. This also characterises the spectrum ofpossibility in which curriculum can be developed,at one end arbitrariness, at the other fixeddogmatism (either from State or literal non-imaginative interpretation of R Steiner). Schoolsand teachers need to find their way between thesetwo threats: Charybdis, the whirlpool of individualcreativity which can get lost in itself and Scylla,the nymph once beautiful and turned into adevouring monster by a witch. We have at our disposal, in this work, the treasure of indications and suggestions whichRudolf Steiner gave both to the teachers and alsoto his other students and audiences. This hasgiven a structure and framework around which theendeavour of the Waldorf School movement hasgrown and flourished now for nearly 90 years, notonly in Europe but in all the hemispheres of theWorld, on every inhabited continent. What are the steps of building a new curriculum in a Steiner/Waldorf school? 1. Look for Steiner\u0092s original indications Karl Stockmeyer (1955) did an invaluable job producing one of the first collations of Steiner\u0092sindications for the Waldorf School teachers.Without it we would have the enormous task of finding Steiner\u0092s many indications distributedamongst lectures, conferences with teachers andhis writings. In his work is a compilation of extractsfrom Steiner\u0092s indications to teachers aboutcurriculum, methodology and school governance. With each extract there is also a reference to its source which allows going back and reading theoriginal context of the extract. Can you discernthe principle embodied in the indication? 2. Look at the secondary literature There has been 90 years of creative teachers working with Steiner\u0092s indications and developingexcellent curricula for their own time and place.Rawson and Richter\u0092s (2001) curriculum bookbelongs to this section but is not confined to it.There are many hundreds, if not thousands ofbooks which have been based on Steiner\u0092s original indications and adapted to particular times and locations. Some of these resources are excellent,some are dated, some maybe quite wrong.Discernment and a knowledge of the primaryindications is needed to make true judgement atthis step. 3. Look at what your Place and Time offers to the education process. Each curriculum developer (that is: every teacher!) needs to become aware what can be integrated with the curriculum from the local environment and the time in which they live. There maybe further steps as well as these, however, these steps, I think are the main ones in creating new curriculum for Steiner/Waldorf schools.How do we go about developing Curriculum in aWaldorf School?Peter Glasby, Mt Barker, South Australia pglasby@adam.com.au Between the whirlpool ofCharybdis and the rocks of Scylla.

It is the parents who lay the foundation of the education of the will. Rudolf Steiner has helped us to see how it is the will that must develop first and be the anchor,for without the integration of thinking and feeling with action and deed, a truly moral and responsiveadult cannot emerge. It is thrilling to examine the dictionary definition of will: \u0091( n) impulse to act; conscious adoption of a line of action\u0092. Right there lies the enigma of the will: that it can be both unconscious and conscious, for the definition of impulse is a \u0091sudden strongurge to action; tendency to act at once without deliberation\u0092, quite the opposite of a conscious lineof action which is defined as \u0091knowing and aware\u0092. This most concrete and mainstream revelation of the fundamental polarity of the will is in perfectresonance with all that Rudolf Steiner had to sayabout it, and is the foundation of my work. In my struggle to find a universal and accessible language for parents there has arisen a simplepolarity which they can clearly grasp: the Little Self is the basic, instinctive pole of self-focus, self- protection and reaction that we all begin with (the\u0091Lower Self\u0092, the animal/nature pole) and the Big Self is the evolved, uniquely human, conscious, mindful, higher intelligence (The Higher Self, thespiritual form of will) which has self-control and is able to selflessly act for the good of the whole. Steiner described that at the end of life human beings come to an awareness of what they havenot achieved and what they wish they could have done, and this mysterious wish germinates into agathering of impulse to incarnate again with fresh intention. This thought can become a vigorous inner activity for those who work with parents outof anthroposophy, but it does not need to be imposed upon the parents. If they wish to furtherpursue these distillations represented in common language and universal experience then they are free to do so. So how do we help this fresh intention which the child brings? How do we parent the will andeducate it for the best possible outcome? Will is aword that many parents find difficult to use. Often, however, ordinary words that the \u0091parent in the street\u0092 can grasp can be found in the layering ofSteiner\u0092s descriptive sentences beyond his initial statements. These include action, doing, deed, urge, drive, movement, body, instinct, impulse andhabit. Will is primarily a movement. From here-on in this article I will use the language that I use with parents. Taking examplesfrom the world that the parents live in we begin with the body-based drive or urge to go and get the world, which is there at birth. A Little Self is primarily urge and action plus desire . First let\u0092s look at the urge or drive: it is unstoppable from the moment the children wake till the moment they go to sleep. It flows like a river unchecked. It is unconscious and learns only through experience.Parenting the Will Talking with parents in a universal languageMary Willow, Wellington, New Zealand 14 JOURNAL for Waldorf Education Vol 12.2, October, 2010 The body builds its knowledge through imitation and repetition of the actions and responses of others. Its job is simply to go, either towards something that is attractive (in sympathy) or away from something that is repulsive (in antipathy). Itis connected to the primitive reflexes of thehindbrain, the fight-or-flight reactions of thecerebellum. The body does not do complexreasoning. It \u0091reads\u0092 the experience perfectly,without words, and adjusts. It learns to recognizewhat is safe and unsafe. It can act on its own inemergencies to get the child to safety or it can bedirected by the feelings or thinking. The urge to act is a power can be likened to a horse that needs a rider. In early childhood thereis no rider yet: the \u0091true child\u0092 is coming slowly overthe horizon and arriving bit by bit. (This concepthelps parents as they often confuse their child\u0092sLittle Self will with the Big Self \u0091true child\u0092 andtherefore do not want to \u0091crush the child\u0092s spirit\u0092by imposing their parental direction upon it. Thisof course results in many parents avoidingboundaries.) Current brain research shows that the brain is not adult (Big Self) until after 25, as Steiner described.Throughout childhood, parents need to develop the \u0091dream horse\u0092 so that it becomes responsive as well as spirited. Desire is unconscious, self-focused and self- serving. Its job is to never be satisfied. It simply wants (out of sympathy) or doesn\u0092t want (out of antipathy) and it cares about nothing but itself. Ithas no restraint, cannot listen and has no tolerancefor frustration. It can be likened to a mischievousimp. The 2 year-old having a tantrum because she wants another ice cream right after the first, is completely ruled by desire. Because its nature isto never be satisfied the child whose desires arealways indulged is not a \u0091happy camper\u0092. Theclassic example is girl in \u0091Charlie and theChocolate Factory\u0092 who demands \u0091I want another pony!\u0092 So the Imp (desire) gets on the Bull (urge to go) and \u0091tally-ho!\u0092...off they go on a rampage into the world, simply wanting everything (or not) andwanting it now (or not!). A bit like Thing One and Thing Two in \u0091The Cat in the Hat\u0092. With the development of each of the three gifted abilities of action, feeling and thinking there is always first a stage of \u0091making it one\u0092s own\u0092. Thisis the \u0091me\u0092 phase and is most strong about 2 yearsinto each 7-year cycle of development, after which the child begins to gradually accommodate others. The 2 year-old is the classic Little Self. The 9 year-old is the 2 year-old of the emotional developmentphase (7-14 years) and the adolescent is the 2year-old of the thinking development phase (14-21 years). Each of these \u0091me\u0092 nodes are crisis and transition points with the behaviour being classically Little Self each time. (This concept helpsparents enormously in disengaging their anger andengaging their empathy for their children.) The Little Self can be likened to Gollum in \u0091The Lord of the Rings\u0092. The scene of Gollum going up the mountain with Sam and Frodo, fighting between his Little Self who desires the power ofthe ring (\u0091my Precious\u0092) and his Big Self who isdesperately trying to do the right thing, can bringus to tears of compassion for him as he struggles and gradually loses the fight. JOURNAL for Waldorf Education Vol 12.2, October, 2010 15Little Self is very reactive and cannot put others before itself. It says \u0091you hit me... I hit you back\u0092. Big Self on the other hand is fully conscious and aware of its actions. It can discern weigh, judge,defer, give and share. It has self-control, overview(the big picture) and its thinking, emotions andactions are all communicating to each other andare integrated. Big Self says \u0091you hit me... but I choose to not hit you back\u0092. This illustration helps parents to understand the problem of choice in early childhood. The childunder 7 is mostly a Little Self. When we givechoices to children under 7, particularly before theappearance of reasoning around the age of 3.5years, we are giving those choices to Little Self,i.e. to desire . Choosing means standing outside of subjective experience and separating oneselfinto an objective position in order to weigh andjudge. Little children are not ready for this and areburdened and stressed by the act of choosing.They cannot see the possible outcomes yet andare dominated by their desire which usually wants Reference Sara B.

As the child grows andthe \u0091true child\u0092 or \u0091baby adult\u0092 tries to arrive andride the horse, he or she finds that the horse isused to choosing whatever it wants to do and willnot be directed into anything difficult or challenging.This results in an adult who cannot truly meet theother and respond. From here the parents are taken into a study of what helps the Little Self to grow into a Big Selfand how stress and anxiety cause regression inboth children and adults. How the children reactto stress depends upon their genetic make-up,sensory-motor function, individual history,temperament and environment (not to mentiontheir spiritual make-up, spiritual history, karma anddestiny!). The parent\u0092s inner reactions andthoughts are as hugely influential on the child\u0092sdevelopment and wellbeing as the outercircumstances. The parent is the ground under thechild and it is the parent who must transform first.This is why parenting the will is truly a path of initiation. Mary Willow is a Parent Educator.

Dr Michaela Gloeckler, the leader ofthe Medical Section, had brought together, for the first time, anthroposophical practitioners from both the Medical and the Educational professions. Itwas the celebration of the 50th anniversary of Dr Eugene Kolisko (1893-1939) \u0096 the first School doctor at the Stuttgart Waldorf School. Such wasthe depth of this first meeting, that I know I have never been able to absorb and put into practice the many gems that were shared all that time ago. I believe it was also symbolic that during that Conference, the Berlin wall came down \u0096 and a whole continent began to re-unite after years ofseparation. Approximately every four years since 1989, Kolisko Conferences have been held in differentcountries: England, USA , Finland, Australia andin 2006 Kolisko was held in nine countries \u0096Michaela travelling to each one \u0096 Hyderabad inIndia, Taiwan, South Africa, Philippines, Ukraine,Australia, Mexico, Sweden and finally France.Early this year, Michaela was the leader of theHawai\u0092i Kolisko, but could not attend the Koliskoin the Ukraine or New Zealand, due to herhusband\u0092s ill health . The participants at our Conference were appreciative of those doctors and nurses whostepped in at such short notice to fulfil thedemanding tasks of the Conference: Doctors RuthBaker, David Ritchie and Michael Sargent; nurses- Jocelyn Freeman, Mary Willow and many otherscontributed to step into Michaela\u0092s role. We, theparticipants, were humbled by realising just howmuch Michaela had given over so many years in sacrifices, and, on the other hand, admiring of the strengths and depth of experience and knowledgeof the speakers who volunteered at such shortnotice and inspired us with their sharing and insights. Due to the planned 2010 Sydney Kolisko and International Post Medical training (another impulse of Michaela\u0092s - to train qualified doctorsin Anthroposophic Medicine) , being transferred to our Kolisko premises, we were able to include over 100 Australians and some participants fromthe USA . Doctors, nurses, therapists, teachers and parents: in all we numbered over 500. Our Conference opened with the verse Dr Steiner had given to doctors: Once, in olden times There lived in the souls of the Initiates Powerfully the thought That by nature, Every person was ill And education was seen as a healing process Which brought to the child, as it matured, Health for becoming a true Human being.Connecting with Today\u0092s Children: Body, Soul and Spirit KOLISKO CONFERENCE, JULY, 2010Neil Carter, Christchurch, New Zealand St Peter\u0092s School, Cambridge, New Zealand Dr Ruth BakerJOURNAL for Waldorf Education Vol 12.2, October, 2010 17Many colleagues over the years have said to me how they found \u0093that verse\u0094 \u0091difficult\u0092 to appreciate, especially the part about the humanbeing ill. For myself, I felt I could begin to appreciate it much more as it was performed in eurythmy andspoken powerfully. Dr Simon Bednarek , in his warm introduction, reminded me that our spirit or ego can not be \u0091sick\u0092 but it is the soul that, in itstask here on earth, seeks resolutions, new paths, ones that cannot be resolved in the spiritual world, but only be achieved here on earth. It is in thesoul realm that healing is sought. Simon gave the background to how this particular Kolisko Conference had been formed, by asking the Waldorf teachers in New Zealand what their questions were - and out of theiranswers came the themes: empathy, encounter, communication, connecting with children and the extremes of not being able to connect due toAutism, ADD and anxiety. Simon encouraged us to examine moments (or longer periods) in our own lives where we mayhave experienced feelings similar to autism, ADD or anxiety. He shared his own moments with us - which levelled the playing field - helped us relaxand be warmed into the theme. We were then treated to four days of enriching, empowering andencouraging experiences to deepen our work andlife in connecting WITH ourselves, our family, friends, colleagues and children. The first afternoon included the welcome from Simon Bednarek and an address by Dr JohnAngus, the New Zealand Children\u0092sCommissioner, who heads the work of the Task Force for Action on Violence within Families. Sue Simpson, David Ritchie, Florian Osswald (soonto be the new co-leader of the Pedagogical Section at the Goetheanum) and Hartmut Borries all delivered in-depth insights into our current socialand spiritual situation with regard to \u0091connecting\u0092. We were also treated to a short play written by Thornton Wilder that depicted a soul\u0092s decision to incarnate again to earth . The evening gift from a group of eurythmists connected with the Titirangi School, including theirentire class seven, was a warmly receivedwelcome to our Conference. Each day followed a rhythm of an artistic Florian Osswald (Switzerland) Mary Green (Weleda)18 JOURNAL for Waldorf Education Vol 12.2, October, 2010experience engendered by short written expressions as though from children who experienced Asperger\u0092s, ADD and finally, on thelast day, anxiety. Robyn Ritchie enacted and read out the imagined speech of an anxious (over sensitive) child who had just returned from a\u0091nightmarish\u0092 class camp. The mood in the hall was one of huge empathy and respect. And in the artistic group that Iwas part of, there was such concentration and reverence as we placed pastel colours or lines upon thepaper. The resulting discussions with the group of 20 showed how much this exercise had increased our desire toconnect and find the right actions to help such children. After morning tea, we entered more into the thinking realm with excellentlectures from the three doctors mentioned above. The afternoons werewill related, with numerous workshops connected loosely or tightly with the References: Mitchell D.S.

Impression of a socially isolated child Mike Caris (participant) and Kathy Macfarlane ( organiser and speaker)JOURNAL for Waldorf Education Vol 12.2, October, 2010 19\"Self-worth is a predicator of learning\" \u0096 this is the theme that stood out for me, from all the varied and high quality opening addresses of ourAustralia-N.Z. Kolisko Conference. Dr David Ritchie stated that amongst the socio-economic factors which are known to influence learning, the most important is found to be the dependability of a child\u0092s home life and environment. From a huge study of childrennumbering in the thousands, socio-economicfactors are found to be crucial, as well as natural(genetic) endowments. At 12 months of age, most children in this study could be described as having reached a similarstage of development. But by 4 years of age, mosthad diverged a lot, according to their socio-economic circumstances. Above all, the criterionwas: \u0091Did they have care that was safe and predictable, at home, and/or at school, depending on their age?\u0092 David said that teachers\u0092 pearls of wisdom have to fall on this preliminary base of loving care.Children need to feel they are of some value withinthe class, in order to actually learn. The conclusionto be drawn from this is we need to strive to truly individualise our teaching practice, FOR EACH CHILD. For me, the aim of the Steiner curriculum then became clearer; in as much as we can tell thestory of the great universe and all its elements, asa human story, interrelated and connected in its different parts to the human being, then each individual child can relate to it in their own way,out of the human element. This would be the art of teaching. Further, the opportunity to get to know each child and thus to understand each one, is promoted by the structure of the Steiner schools,where teaching one group of children over several years is the norm. But to truly individualise needs a conscious liveliness at every step, an aim to strive for, rather than merely a claim. David said in his talk that predicators for child development and education are the same as for salutogenesis1 - Is the world comprehensible? - Can they manage the world? - Is the world meaningful for them? The relevance of these findings from salutogenesis is reinforced by the successfulresults of a programme with children and parents from the severely deprived neighbourhoods of Echo Park, Los Angeles. 2 Running this cutting- edge \u0093Centre for Non-Violent Education and Parenting\u0094, Ruth Beaglehole, (a former New Zealander ), said they have now conclusivelydemonstrated that a youngster who has had an abusive/dysfunctional upbringing, does not have to repeat any of the same offensive behaviour. Thekey to being able to do it differently is being able to find meaning in their life stories. The mechanism is through empathy and mirror neurones3. She said that while the default position is a struggle tocomprehend one\u0092s life of pain, and to take it out on one\u0092s children, that we have mirror neuronesin our higher brain, which are in particular changed through experiencing empathy.Education and Integrity of SelfMargaret Snowdon, Christchurch, New Zealand New Zealand Kolisko Conference Opening, July 10th, 2010, N.Z . 1 Salutogenesis is a term coined by Aaron Antonovsky, a Professor of Medical Sociology. The term describes an approach focusing on factors that support human health and well-being, rather than on factors that cause disease. More specifically, the \"salutogenic model\" is concerned with the relationship between health, stress and coping. 'Learning predicates self worth' or vice versa\u2014\"predicate\" verb = 1 to proclaim; declare; affirm; assert. 2 To connote, imply 3 To base 2 Ruth Beaglehole, M.A., Founder of CNVEP: Centre for Non-Violent Education and Parenting, Echo Park, Los Angeles, Southern California. www.cnevp.org/new/ english/ruth.html. Radio New Zealand National: Nine to Noon 5th August 2010. www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/ninetonoon/2 0100805 3 see for example: http://www.mindpowernews.com/MirrorNeurons.htm20 JOURNAL for Waldorf Education Vol 12.2, October, 2010In such work, we can enable, for instance, teen mothers or violent youths, to tell their story, sometimes over and over again, in support groups,giving them words, a language, concepts which they lack, with which to make meaning of what has happened to them. The key is to makemeaning of their pain, and this then, if repeated through empathetic speaking and listening, activates their mirror neurones to re-wire the brain,changing the cycle of poor parenting/violence. Beaglehole claimed strongly that parenting issues are never about the child, they are aboutthe parent. Lone parent/s cannot possibly be expected to manage the task all by themselves. Support, support, to the extent that she felt surethat it takes three adults to raise one child. As she said, imagine how many for three children - 9! She felt it would be better, where possible, instead of taking children away from parents intowelfare, to send support into the home, to model better ways, and to above all exercise empathy. This research supports David Ritchie\u0092s statement about the \u0093end of Darwinism\u0094. It is notthe survival of the fittest genes only - genes arenot the whole story. The environment is just as important for development. What switches the genes on and off has now become the greatquestion. Relatively new neurobiological research, he said, shows that mirror neurones do not fire only when something is being done, as in motorneurones - when we act - but also when we are just watching, and even imagining, that, e.g., we are putting the cup over there. They developotherwise in the same way as motor neurones, but mirror neurones are what bonds us with our parents, teachers, caregivers. They are involved in our social learning. Certainty and predictability (dependability), of the environment play a big part in the development of mirror neurones. I interpret that as paying attention to rhythm. David stressedthat awareness of the importance of all of our senses, of the 12 senses, is highlighted in this regard. Children need time to watch, to observe,to repeat. There is a social deficit now, represented by insufficient development of the higher senses, so that a child for instance maynot notice - and even fall over another, on the way to their own goal. It would be therapeutic to do more of having half the class watch, while the otherhalf do. Perhaps there is too much \u0093doing\u0094 today? I think that the balance would be in more \u0093being\u0094 -in this connection of wholeness of being as theground of learning. I wondered about the developmental delays of ASD (autism spectrum disorder), ADD/ADHD, plus anxiety, which weconcentrated on for the bulk of the conference. I wondered what these diagnosed sensory- processing, neural-behavioural conditions; haveto do with being able to learn from a basis of experiencing self-worth? I realised that the fact that these conditions do share digestive problemsand nutritional deficiencies reveals here a link on the most unconscious and underlying physiological level - the link of leaky gut and dysbiosissyndrome 4 challenging the integrity of being. David introduced this bio-medical approach, thatwhen children\u0092s bio-chemistry goes wrong (e.g.antibiotics given early), the whole gut becomes inflamed; the child can\u0092t absorb its nutrition, and toxins develop. The integrity is breached. Davidsaid further that American research now reveals that the controversial MMR vaccine can disturb the gut and affect the brain 5. I found mention of this in a special research report on ASD and ADD/AHDD, in the Australia-N.Z. magazine Wellness 6. \u0093Parents of children on the autistic spectrum often talk about an obvious single event occurring before the child regressed. Some suspect a round of vaccines,pesticide exposure, heavy metal exposure, or 4 \"an imbalance in the intestinal bacteria that precipitates changes in the normal activities of the gastrointestinal tract or vagina, possibly resulting in health problems\" 5 See for example: http://www.autism-help.org/autism-causes-detailed.htm6 Wellness Magazine, April 2010; Special Report: Childhood Behavioural Disorders by Lucy Cannings, naturopath at Northern Beaches Care Centre, the practice focusing on autistic spectrum disorders, chronic fatigue, auto-immune conditions, allergies, and chronic gut issues. reception@ nbcc.net.auJOURNAL for Waldorf Education Vol 12.2, October, 2010 21some type of toxic factor the child has been exposed to. This supports the theory thatsomething is interfering with the normal functionof their cellular biochemistry.\u0094 The article first givesan example of how exposure to one heavy metal,lead, can affect virtually every system in the body,and produce symptoms which are strikingly similarto those found in the ASD spectrum and ADD/ADHD. Lead affects the central and peripheralnervous systems, the kidneys and blood.\u0093Epidemiological studies have shown that even lowlevels of lead (blood levels of 10-25 microgramsper decilitre) can have serious affects onchildren...There are usually no obvious signs ofsymptoms of lead poisoning, so its easy to miss.Symptoms that may be recognised are: Subtle behaviour changes such as irritability and a shortened attention span. Suppression of appetite with resulting weightloss. Sleep disturbance. Hyperactivity. Reduction in intelligence and short-termmemory. Children with moderate exposures, i.e. blood lead levels of 30-50 micrograms per decilitre, are at an even greater risk of requiring specialeducation, dropping out of school, and havingreading disabilities as a young adult.\u0094 Having described how a particular heavy metal has known and verified effects, the article wenton to discuss the role of vaccines. \u0093Biomedicalpractitioners in the ASD field believe thebiochemistry of some children is not able to dealwith vaccines. However the debate still rages.February 2010, The Lancet formally retracted anarticle it had published in 1998 that linked thethree-in-one vaccine with autism. Healthauthorities in Australia deny any links betweenautism and vaccination. Yet according to Generation Rescue 7, a U.S. based non-profit organisation headed by JennyMcCarthy and her partner, well-known actor JimCarrey, vaccinated children have an increasedchance of having a neurological disorder. Theycarried out the largest-ever health survey ofvaccinated versus unvaccinated children. Theresults were chilling, though not surprising amongthe ASD community. \u0091We surveyed over 9,000boys in California and Oregon and found thatvaccinated boys had a 155 per cent greaterchance of having a neurological disorder likeADHD or autism than unvaccinated boys\u0093Generation Rescue\u0094. The article goes on todiscuss and describe how some or all thesesymptoms; leaky gut and dysbiosis, failure todigest and detoxify, chronic inflammation,metabolic problems, nutritional deficiencies, andfinally, abnormal immune systems, are implicatedin the spectrum of sensory processing andneurological conditions that we were dealing within the conference. * * * * * * * The opening address by Sue Simpson (former Principal of Taikura Rudolf Steiner School andGeneral Secretary of the AnthroposophicalSociety in N.Z.), brought, for me, the quality ofself-worth by a different route. She concentratedon how do I, as a practitioner/ teacher, recognise,view and value a child\u0092s individuality among themany? Rudolf Steiner\u0092s 1920lectures \u0093Balance in Teaching\u0094 8; \u0093The College of Teachers must become aware that it is the teacher who must have a deep feeling for the esoteric\u0094.Do I, as a busy teacher, actually really see theother, this child, beyond appearances, \u0093beyond thesense-perceptible?\u0094 What is it, in every singlechild, which draws my interest, in wanting to guideand care for this child? She asked, \u0093What is theesoteric?\u0094 in this context, and suggested, on apractical level, it equates to having the deepestrespect for each person who stands before me.That when I am not there for my own personal needs, and when I can create a \u0093temple\u0094 space wherever I am, creating the right space to converse 7 http://www.generationrescue.org/ 8 Steiner R. Balance in Teaching 4 lectures, Stuttgart, Sept. 192022 JOURNAL for Waldorf Education Vol 12.2, October, 2010helpfully together with one another, that is the esoteric. Sue also questioned what kind of thinking lies behind the controversial National Standards nowbeing inserted by the government into N.Z. primaryschools in top-down fashion. \u0093Are they aboutenhancing childhood, or are they about cultivatingthe very bright and intelligent children who canmake this country rich? What is childhood about?\u0094 * * * * * * * John Angus , New Zealand\u0092s official Children\u0092s Commissioner, in his opening address to ourconference made the passionate plea: \u0093Why, whenwe treasure children in our private lives, are theirinterests given less weight in the public domain?\u0094He posed the great and challenging question aboutthe worth of a child in this country. \u0093Why, whenwe know poverty harms children, in particularyoung children, do they remain the group in ourcountry living in the greatest material hardship?He reminded us, movingly, of that great, freshsense of renewal and wonder that we experiencewhen a young child comes into the world/family.But three paradoxes can swamp this specialopenness. 1. Poverty . Children, as an age cohort in N.Z., are the most likely sector to be in poverty. They are twice as likely to live in poverty as the over 65s. It is clear from the statisticsthat they bore the biggest impact from thecontroversial benefit (welfare) cuts in the early90s. 2. Parental Time Poverty; Day Care Increasing. We have changed our family circumstances dramatically in the last decade or two.Although we have smaller families now, withfewer children needing our time investment,they are getting less of it in the crucial youngeryears. The fastest growth in child care is inthe under twos sector. Mothers have to work more. Children are in care longer; over the past 4 years, the number of hours childrenspend there has increased 17%. There is atrend to increasing market based and corporate child care centres.3.Social Disparities Persist in health and education, despite our knowledge of itsdeleterious effects. Up to one fifth of N.Z. children are too ill too often, or too far behind their peers educationally, or are poorlynurtured by families. The disparities are quite persistent; in hardship, or deprived and neglected, or stressed. Childrenmay be private treasures, said John Angus, but why are they public dross? Amongst various streams of thought which end up subsuming thetrue quality of childhood (including, he said, the ideas behind the National Standards!), John distinguished three ways adults think of childhood- and queried them. We at the conference found these a bit challenging at first, being a bit close to home, but found them rich food for thought, uponreflection. Three Common Adult Perceptions of Children. 1.Children as \u0093human becomings\u0094 a developmental view. The focus is on how children will turn out as adults. 2.Children as \u0093innocents\u0094 - the Romantic view, still a common Western perspective, stemming from the 18th century Enlightenment. (Rousseau et al) This movement has made significant contributionsto child protection movements. 3. Children as \u0093sinners\u0094 - children as souls inneed of salvation or redemption. Children inneed of moral guidance. I can see ourselves reflected in each of these schools of thought, and can see their contributions.But John Angus went further: \u0093could we, in addition to the above, see our role as partners with children, not as in charge over passive recipients?\u0094 And thus I was brought back to that idea of self- worth as the fundamental basis of all education. To allow the being of the child to appear, but also, as Dr Simon Bednarek added, to know that in the end it is also about ourselves as educators. To know thyself, as in when we ourselves sometimes become withdrawn/anxious, impatient/ hyperactive/overwhelmed/stressed, is to know the children. JOURNAL for Waldorf Education Vol 12.2, October, 2010 23The Sweltering heat of summer in April makes it no easy task to have trainings of any kind in the city of Hyderabad, South India! The city is abuzz in the mornings and evenings with the rush ofpeople travelling to their work places and back home - both places generally air cooled to keep away the heat and discomfort along with theaccompanying soul moods which often borders on anger and foulness... Yet we were \u0096 a pocket of \u0091Lovers of Waldorf Education\u0092 \u0096 daring to embrace the heat and yetmanaging to stay joyous and supportive of one another\u0092s learning process. The credit largely goesto the group of teachers who had come to train us \u0096 Peter Glasby, Dan Freeman, Guy Walker and Rosemary Glasby. Hyderabad has four Waldorfinitiatives \u0096 Sloka, the first Waldorf School of the city, Diksha, Prerana and Abhaya. The plan was to have a five day training module followed by atwo day session on the meditative aspects of Anthroposophy. Every morning started with the whole group of adults willingly turning into children (brats couldbe a closer description!) and playing out-door games led by the ever enthusiastic and never tiringDan Freeman. It brought the eighty oddparticipants together in a spontaneous manner making the teachers realize the value of such games when played with children and youngsters. This was followed by an introduction to adolescence and sciences from an anthro- posophical perspective. In those five days, Peter gradually led us into the world of the growing adolescent. It was also a lesson in understanding how the right approach to sciences can have a nurturing effect on the growing adolescent. He awakened in the participants the limitations of the purely materialistic perspective of the human being that is often portrayed from the dominant paradigm of science. The methodology of teaching the adolescent, actively working with the night to transform the lesson was practically experienced by the participants. After the introduction we had various group work shops. Organic Chemistry and Electro magnetism - led by Peter, Bothmer Gymnastics by Dan Freeman, Lazure painting by Guy Walker andShadow puppetry by Rosemary Glasby.INSPIRATIONS For Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy, Hyderabad, IndiaAnandhi, Grade Seven Teacher, Hyderabad, India Unloading the conference material at the venue, Abhaya School, Hyderabad, India Workshop participants playing games24 JOURNAL for Waldorf Education Vol 12.2, October, 2010The group that attended Peter\u0092s science workshop seemed to have a unityfrom two perspectives - their passion for sciences and their frustration at thelimitations posed by the mainstream approach to it. While those with a Waldorfbackground grew in the depth of understanding, those new to it seemed tofind space for questions that were perhaps long haunting them. As Mitaexpressed herself on the last day - \u0091I am still under the spell of Peter\u0092. As Ithought about this outburst of a deep soul movement I realized that one of her chief frustrations with themainstream manner of bringing Sciences was the alienating effect it had on life...and here was a way to connect the growing adolescent to the worldaround through Science. The team working with Bothmer Gymnastics made all the others feel a wee bit envious - what with all the excited screaming and laughter fillingthe school with life. To move and to move in ahuman way seems to be the need of the day. Thegroup worked with various exercises and indoorgames. Often one noticed participants limping afterthe session but nothing could keep them awayfrom it. The group with Guy Walker worked with colour exercises before getting to paint the walls of aclassroom. It was fascinating to watch howharmoniously he worked on the walls - a learningin allowing the inner movement to guide the outer.Our mistakes were generously pardoned, andeven more generously corrected - even if thatmeant repainting a whole wall. In our discussionshe mentioned the need to be aware that the closeran artistic work is to the physicality of what itrepresents, the farther it is from truth. At school we have begun to work with this thought actively. To distinguish the living forms from the dead forms calls for a kind of sensitivity that can only grow with time, repeated observation and innerdiscipline required to grow beyond personal likes and dislikes. Rosemary\u0092s group was hardly noticed - till the last day when they put up a fantastic set of Shadow Barometric pressure being demonstrated - part of the morning lecture on Adolescence and Waldorf Sciences Principles of chemistry being demonstrated by Peter GlasbyJOURNAL for Waldorf Education Vol 12.2, October, 2010 25 plays. A simple cardboard refrigerator box had transformed into a large beautiful screen for the shadow play. Stories were chosen in no time,puppets made and practiced in the quiet confines of the Kindergarten. On the last day we were invited to see the shadow plays. We were spellbound by the sheer beauty and life that seemed to flow from the screen to the audience - once again a reminder of what is health giving forchildren. The afternoons were filled with artistic activities - we could choose to do clay work, led by Peterand Rahul, wood work by Guy Walker and Veeru, or movement by Dan Freeman. The participants of wood work and clay work were carrying backwith them tangible things at the end of the week; those who worked with movement in relationship to child development carried that back with themas an inner light - a new sensitivity towards the growing child. This was followed by a week-end program at the Celebrity club. The two days were filled with practical as well as contemplative activities. Wehad an experience of \u0091Goethean observation\u0092, a glimpse into the spiritual influences of the heavenly worlds coupled with observation of the night skies,gymnastics and painting. Peter gave us information about the Anthroposophical society and the school of Spiritual Science. A mood ofinner quiet enriched the week-end and nearly everyone felt that this was too short! It was a very special week for all the participants who went on to their summer holiday not exhausted as a year end leaves us usually, butenergized and looking forward to the coming year. We are thankful to all the trainers. Special mention needs to be made about Jayesh Pillarisetty, who not only mooted the idea but also carried a considerable part of planning and organisation for the whole week. We need more such experiences- after all who can say \u0091enough\u0092 to inspirations? Dan Freeman making a point during the Bothmer workshop Rosemary Glasby with her team of shadow play participants hard at work26 JOURNAL for Waldorf Education Vol 12.2, October, 2010Out of the collaboration between the International Association for Steiner/Waldorf Early Childhood Education (IASWECE) and the International Forum of Waldorf/Steiner Schoolswithin the Pedagogical Section (Hague Circle), we would like to make Waldorf/Steiner kindergartens and schools aware of two conferences that willtake place shortly before and shortly after Easter 2012 at the Goetheanum, Dornach, Switzerland. The conference before Easter is for the world kindergarten and early childhood movement, andthe conference after Easter is for the world school movement. Both conferences will inviteparticipants to take up the same theme, which is described briefly below as a stimulus to begin working with this thematic area. We are striving to have a similar schedule and approach for both conferences. Further details willbe published in the next issue of the Journal of the Pedagogical Section at the Goetheanum #36. Outline of the Theme For the kindergarten and early childhood realm as well as for the entire period of schooling from class one to the entrance into adulthood, onetheme is carried through that must be recognized,considered and transformed into meaningfulpractice. This has to do with the incorporation of the \"I\" into the body. Expressed in other words: what dynamic relationship between the true I (self)and the body is created through education? In the first lecture of the Study of Man (GA 293) this relationship is spoken of as the task ofeducation itself: \"The task of education, conceived in the spiritual sense, is the harmonizing of the soul spirit with the life body. They must come into harmony with one another; they must be attuned to one another, for when a child is first born into the physical world, they do not as yet fit one another. The task of the educator, and of the teacher, is the mutualattunement of these two members.\u0094 The mighty process is described through which the \u0093soul spirit\u0094 comes to inhabit, step by step, thebodily sheaths. In the whole early childhood andkindergarten phase, this relates to questions of nourishment, care for and education of the senses, and the dramatic sequence of deeds characterized so simply as standing - walking - speaking- and thinking. These are mighty steps on the path toindividualization. Then, in school, when learning begins through the freed etheric body, thinking, feeling and willingcontinue to unfold up to the development of thecapacity for judgment, which means the self- confident use of one\u0092s intellectuality. In the upper classes, this intellectual capacity for judgmentdevelops through aesthetic to idealistic and finally to individual judgments. At each stage, there is a relationship to balance. How deeply will the \u0093I\u0094 penetrate the body - will itperhaps be held by the body as a prisoner? Or how loose is the connection to corporeality? It isactually the task of education as an art to produce this dynamic relationship - not through art but through instruction based on artistic laws. In short: here we are touching upon the essential aspects of educating and teaching.

Front cover - Robyn Hewetson provided these notes of their play performed at the NZ Kolisko Conference: \" A small group of five from Hohepa (Hawkes Bay) put on one of Thornton Wilder's wonderful \"Three minute Plays for Three Persons\". We chose to do \"The Birthof a Poet\", which is Thornton's imagination of the last moments in the spiritual world of a child who is destined to become a poet. The child meets two differentwomen just before he goes off to be \"born\" and hears from them some indications of what is to come. He is first told that he is passing by the place where all those who, in their previous lifetimes have been artists of eye, or ear, or finger. There they sit and watch the souls of those going towards birth. And, they choose the brighter spirits to give a gift to. This child is chosen. With great joy he celebrates and wants to rush off to get started with his life, but the woman warns him not tobe too eager for life and to wait until her sister comes as she, also has some things to give him. He is not happy about the delay and when he sees her sister, hegets more anxious. She brings the 'dark but necessary gifts'. These he tries to decline but is told he has to accept. These gifts are symbolised by a long goldenchain, hung about with pendants which she puts about his neck. We see the boy grow frightened and unsure of his destiny, but ask to know the meaning of thependants. She tells him the challenges that will come with his gifts and his joy changes to fear. But then she tells him goodbye and gives him his task: to be a voicefor those who cannot speak for themselves. She departs and her sister returns to accompany him to his birthing place. His last words as he leaves the stage are:\"Wait a moment, I am not yet brave..\" Cover Photo: From \"The birth of a poet\", two of the actors, Benjamin Nickelsen and Jackie Keil32 JOURNAL for Waldorf Education Vol 12.2, October, 2010 "}
