{"title": "Treatment of an Upper Extremity Chronic Repetitive Strain Injury of 28 Years Duration in a Professional Jazz Saxophonist Using 5% Dextrose", "author": "Andre Panagos", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "The treatment of chronic repetitive strain injury is a frustrating discourse of potential pathoanatomical causes and their treatments. This case describes an overlooked pathoanatomical cause and successful treatment for a chronic and debilitating repetitive strain injury of the upper extremities that lasted for 28 years and was resistant to a variety of conventional and alternative treatments in a professional jazz saxophone player. A series of fascial tissue infiltrations using 5% dextrose was used to successfully downregulate c-fiber activity within the upper extremities. This treatment resulted in the complete resolution of upper extremity pain and dysfunction with a full return to normal instrument practice and performance that has been sustained without recurrence for four years following treatment.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2019-02-22", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
