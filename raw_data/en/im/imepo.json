This is despite advances in technology and pharmaceuticals. Many of these interventions cause difficult side-effects and significantly reduce quality of life for patients. However, there are no studies that measure the 5-Year Survival and quality of life for individuals who choose to pursue evidence-based alternative therapies. Patients at Ayurvedic Naturopathic Medical clinic insisted to us to use Ayurvedic medicine in treatment of cancer. This led us on the path of exploring the efficacy of Ayurveda in management of Cancer. Our treatments have included Ayurvedic diet and lifestyle changes, Ayurvedic and western herbology, Ayurvedic detox program in conjunction with Vitamin C and Mistle Toe IV-therapy. The combination of these have led to positive results in quality of life, as well as 5-year survival. In this presentation, I will be presenting case studies of breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer and more. These cases highlight specific therapies and therapeutic principles that can optimize the efficacy of our medicine. 1) Seigel RL, et al. Cancer Statistics, 2016.
