We launched in September 2017 with two programs and 12 total participants. Today, with the support of our incredible team at the hospital, our coaches and instructors, volunteers, and of course, all of you, we now offer ten different programs with over 250 participants having enjoyed at least one of our classes. It is amazing to reflect that we have spent half of that time exercising, cooking, singing, painting and connecting on Zoom! I recognize that the past couple of years have been unbelievably challenging for many of us, and I continue to be awed by the generosity, compassion and support of this community. As we enter the season of holiday excitement, and stress, I wish you all moments of calm and reflection, and many more of connection and laughter! With gratitude, Sarah Sarah Cohen, Administrator Center for Parkinson's Disease Stony Brook Southampton Hospital EAT WELL with PD As the weather gets cooler, and we look ahead to celebrations and shared meals, it is a perfect time to explore new, seasonal recipes and learn tips and tricks to make healthier choices throughout the holiday season.

In November, Paula Montagna, Director of Clinical Nutrition will provide a virtual lecture on Power Foods for Parkinson's, and we will conclude our fall series in-person at the East End Food Institute for some (almost) healthy holiday baking.

Rock Steady Boxing Boxer Profile Introducing ..... Robin Young Roe! With a Parkinson's diagnosis, you have the option of being a Victim or a Warrior. Warrior is lots more fun and that is where Rock Steady Boxing comes in handy. For a couple of hours a week, I throw punches, slips and more in a vigorous program led by talented, inspiring coaches. During our sessions we work hard and laugh harder, leaving at the end of the session damp with sweat and renewed with the feeling that we are in control and ready for the battle. Coaches Corner Coach Sensei Michelle is just back from the national RSB Coach Convention in Denver, CO, where she networked with other coaches, attended lectures and led her own conference workshops for other RSB Coaches! Here is what she has to say: \"My time at the RSB Coach Convention in Denver was so rewarding. I was able to learn new drills that I can immediately apply in all of my classes, both virtually and in-person. I learned more about the science of Parkinson's and how high intensity interval training (HIIT) is helpful for creating new neuro pathways and stimulating older neurons. Finally, I had over 50 coaches attend my sessions on Boxing drills. We had a lot of laughs and everyone enjoyed the interactive partner drills that I taught them! I'm grateful for the opportunity and excited to use everything I learned in our classes!\" In the Know On September 22, 2022, the national Parkinson's community came together to urge members of Congress to co-sponsor and support The National Plan to End Parkinson's Act. This legislation will create a shared mission to prevent and cure Parkinson's by increasing research funding and awareness; improve access to care and ensure those living with Parkinson's receive the support they require and deserve.
