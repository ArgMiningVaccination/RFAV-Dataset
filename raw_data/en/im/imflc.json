Binge Eating has to do with our relationship to food and the first way we experience emotional regulation from our caregivers. So, a conscious relationship to food is one that is essential for a healthy lifestyle. Our psychological and emotional relationship to food is a complex one and is often connected to self-image and control, but there are many other aspects of eating disorders such as, genetic, psychological, environmental, social and biological influences. When a number of risk factors combine, these factors increase the likelihood that any one can develop a particular condition. The health implications of Binge Eating can be fatal, but it is a treatable condition. 3 HOW WE TREAT BINGE EATING At THE BALANCE we use a holistic and person-centered treatment method to help your 'recovery' with Binge Eating, talking therapies; including psychiatry, medical treatments and complimentary therapies to help relax and heal your body from the effects of Binge Eating These treatments are tailored specifically to help you to identify where and how your eating problem developed in your life and help you learn new skills that will enable you to make a healthy recovery.

THE BALANCE program work at teaching you new life changing skills and techniques that help to build resilience, enable you to take better care of yourself and develop a healthier life pattern. Following is an example of a weekly schedule: 5 MEDICAL TREATMENT AT THE BALANCE At THE BALANCE we offer clients a holistic approach to physical and mental health care. The term holistic means that our program incorporates all aspects of a person life and recognizes that each part of us is intimately interconnected to a whole so in terms of health care, it recognizes that all areas of a person's life need attention, in order to impact on the individual. This incorporates our model of Mind, Body and Life. Holistic medicine (also known as physiological regulating medicine and Biological Medicine) treats the whole person. The patient's symptoms are always considered to be the outward expression of an underlying dysfunction that can be remedied by stimulating the body's own regulatory forces. We search for the root causes of the patient's disease in order to give the body a chance to heal itself. This is why we give top priority to improving the patient's general metabolism, together with detoxification, purification and the latest methods of immune - stimulation, as well as other stimulating therapies. THE BALANCE biological medicine aims at strengthening the whole, so that diseases and susceptibility to disease can be overcome by the patient's own immune system and healing process. For this reason, our doctors utilize 'suppressive' medicines only during times of emergency, and not for chronic care management, because this type of medicine is most effective in acute situations. We are also slower to recommend certain operations, preferring first to apply our holistic therapy concept. As our patient, you are making a commitment to your health. With your cooperation and the THE BALANCE staff's input of experience and know how, susceptibilities can be detected, and the course of the disease reversed. It is important to note that our doctors have conventional medical degrees and specialized training in Biological Medicine, and in certain cases, conventional and holistic treatments will be integrated. 6 PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WEAKNESS AND THE ADRENAL GLAND Adrenal fatigue is a collection of signs and symptoms, known as a syndrome, that results when the adrenal glands function below the necessary level. Most commonly associated with intense or prolonged stress, it can also arise during or after acute or chronic infections, especially respiratory infections such as influenza, bronchitis or pneumonia... you live with a general sense of un-wellness, tiredness or \"grey\" feelings. People experiencing adrenal fatigue often have to use coffee, colas and other stimulants to get going in the morning and to prop themselves up during the day. \"The adrenal glands respond to all types of stress in the same way... It is important to know that all stresses are additive and cumulative. The number of stresses, whether or not you recognize them as stresses, the intensity of each stress, and the frequency with which it occurs plus the length of time it is present, all combine to form your total stress load.\" together with this it is necessary to be aware of connections in the body system: The digestive and glandular systems are closely related to the autonomic nervous system, which is also called the \"abdominal brain\". It consists of two parts, the sympathetic and the parasympathetic, which control all our involuntary body functions and must be rhythmically balanced with one another for our metabolism and immune systems to function properly. At RECORE we are able to measure this balance in a unique way via tools that assess what is known as Heart Rate Variability (HRV). By eliminating all influencing factors (e.g. dental foci, food allergies, mineral, vitamin and trace element deficiencies, electromagnetic stress, disorders of the autonomic nervous system, etc. more than 80% of all patients we treat for these basic disorders fully recover. Virtually all of our metabolic patients significantly improve thanks to our medicines, without having to take the drugs commonly prescribed that involve adverse side effects. With diabetes patients, the insulin dose they need can frequently be reduced. But especially the quality of life and overall wellbeing improve immensely. 7 THE COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT UPON YOUR ARRIVAL Quick facts Two days comprehensive health assessment Full medical check-up, clinical assessment, psychiatric assessment, extensive laboratory tests. Aim: identify any physical health issues or risks and/or identify underlying reasons for complex, often unspecific, physical or mental health symptoms. Detailed debriefing and report explaining all findings, treatment recommendations and prognosis. Suitable for individuals who have either specific health problems and seek the best possible solution recommendation, or for individuals who have complex symptoms of physical or mental health problems and want to investigate what underlying reasons could be and receive treatment recommendations. Suitable also for healthy individuals who want to prevent future illnesses, learn about risk factors, impact of lifestyle choices on physical and mental health, etc. 100% private and confidential, one client at a time 1) Full medical checkup Including ECG, Chest-X-ray, abdominal sonogram, physical fitness test and breathing volume test in order to determine his current physical and cardiovascular health. Basic Screening (blood): Hematology, liver values, glycaemia, blood lipids, thyroid activity Review of any available medical history (provided by the client prior to the assessment) Symptoms to be researched can be: high blood pressure, weight problems, post cancer- treatment fatigue and loss of energy, chronic or acute pain symptoms, chronic fatigue syndrome, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, circulatory problems such as erectile dysfunction or menopause symptoms as well as signs of ageing such as \"brain fog\", lack of concentration and forgetfulness, among many others. 2) A comprehensive psychiatric assessment Screening for depression, trauma, addiction, burnout etc. Identifying possible emotional reasons for physical symptoms (such as pain, constipation, heart racing, etc.) Review of any psychotropic medication, prior psychiatric diagnoses, etc. 8 3) Orthomolecular, lifestyle and nutritional assessment We will look at the bio-chemistry of the brain and body (neurotransmitter profiles, stress profiles, see laboratory tests below for more details). Identify energy levels and functioning of the different organs, possible damage and strategies for restoration of health. Specialized laboratory tests (see below). Food Intolerance testing: testing of allergic reaction to most frequent food allergen (food intolerances lead to chronic emotional symptoms, sleep problems, etc.) Lifestyle (exercise, sleep habits, eating rhythm and meals, etc.) has a significant impact on the emotional well-being, stress, anxiety, and cravings, as well as physical health. A lifestyle assessment will identify risk factors and issues around lifestyle choices. 4) The extensive specialized laboratory tests to check all relevant medical and biochemical parameters include: Hormone level screen: chronic stress often brings hormones out of balance, increases fatigue, decreases activities, libido and the immune system etc. Neurotransmitter screen in order to determine the current brain and emotional functioning and deficiencies (the \"Biochemistry of Happiness, Depression, Burnout\": testing of excitatory neurotransmitters such Adrenalin, Noradrenalin, inhibitory neurotransmitters such as Serotonin, GABA) Amino acid profile (testing of all essential amino acids which are crucial to build up enough neurotransmitters) Thyroid screen in order to determine metabolic functioning Metabolic screen to determine possible pre-diabetic conditions due to weight gain when on medication Vitamin screen in order to determine Vitamin and Mineral levels which often are out of balance when under medication and long-lasting stress Hair Mineral Test to determine the presence of heavy metals such as lead etc. in order to determine the interference with neurotransmitters and mood Gut biology (stool)-tests to determine intestinal health and functioning: we know today that gut health is an important contributor to brain functioning. Gut health can be restored and supports the successful withdrawal from many psycho- active/psychotropic medications while uptake of indispensable nutritional supplements will be supported by intact gut health. Parasites testing: some parasites literally \"eat up\" necessary nutrients and compromise the immune system. Stress Profile: evaluation of stress reaction (adrenal gland activity) Inflammatory parameter screen and testing stress on cell level: chronic stress and medication intake often triggers inflammatory reactions in the body and inflammation contributes to low mood and depression. Inflammation can be detected in the blood and successfully treated with nutritional supplements, targeted plant compounds and anti- oxidative vitamins. 9 LUXURY 5-STAR RESIDENCES AND PREMIER HOSPITALITY SERVICES Living in beautiful settings, you will experience being part of a safe and healthy surrounding.
