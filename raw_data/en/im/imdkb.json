Guest Reviews - CindyVisited July 2019 It was great to experience such a nice atmosphere where other solo travellers of all ages engaged together to exercise and improve health. It's outstanding for those who like me enjoy the outdoors and connecting with nature. - TimVisited April 2019 Excellent fitness classes and facilities. All very modern, brand new and looking spotless. Fitness in paradise, that's the best way to describe Thanyapura. - AshleyVisited January 2019 This is my 4th time in Thanyapura, I'm a big fan of this place and especially the Fusion Fitness programme, which is fantastic value. Customer care at Thanyapura and at Health and Fitness Travel is faultless. The variety of classes and the scope of what you can achieve when you are there is what makes me return every year. My advice is \"don't hesitate to book! Try everything and embrace the atmosphere. Big results will come your way!\" - DebbieVisited December 2018 I couldn't have chosen a better place for my 2 weeks holiday! Private swimming training was excellent. Same with meditation and all group classes. Members of staff are very friendly and helpful. My room was fantastic and location is gorgeous. - MikeVisited May 2017 My fitness holiday was a great experience! The facilities and amenities at the hotel are absolutely fantastic, it far exceeded my expectations. The fitness and training sessions were perfect and the trainers were of very high standard. All of the staff at the resort were so helpful, understanding and friendly. I would thoroughly recommend Thanyapura to anyone who would like to engage in sports, fitness and exercise training. I would most definitely like to return to Thanyapura again to continue training. Thank you for such an amazing experience! [Read more Read less](#read-more-review-234) - Kylie D, TripAdvisor ReviewVisited November 2015 We can not speak highly enough of all the Triathlon, Aquatic and tennis coachers. My husband, 9 year old son and myself, spent 10 days at the sports Hotel. It was an amazing holiday, can't wait to go back. My son wanted to do swimming, unfortunately at the time there was no swimming camps on offer. But this was not a problem, Marianne took him under her wing and put him in with her regular squad (children from the attached school). Marianne is an amazing coach and he loved every second with her. The children where also very welcoming to our son and made him feel at home. He was also invited to swim with the BIG kids at 5:30am, by Miguel, this made him feel very special. He also went for a road ride with Lucky, a coach from the triathlon group. He did 3 x private tennis lessons. ( all of these where add ons, but totally worth the money) Our son had a fabulous time, all credit to the coaching staff. My husband and myself join the triathlon package. We are not extremely fit, both of us over 40. We wanted to enjoy the experience, get help with swimming, running and riding. My husband could not swim 10mt. This was not an issue for the coachers, they gladly helped us - middle aged, out for the fun of it, middle of the pack - Athletes. They got us swimming to the best of our abilities, Riding with more confidence in packs, and running more efficiently. They happily shared their tips and tricks. Never did we feel out of place, we where always helped and encouraged. Never left behind. We where exhausted and happy. Even the elite athletes where welcoming and encouraging. The Hotel. The hotel reception seemed a little confused that we had driven our selves there, and could not find a hose (anything) to wash our bikes that had been on the back of our car and where very dirty. Also the signage could be better, we went to the first gate and they also didn't really understand what we where looking for (i.e. the hotel). The food was good, nothing exceptional, very standard. Apart from the smoothies nothing stood out as healthy. I would have loved a tasty meat pasta on the menu. Some pancakes for breakfast with chia seeds, LSA mix, rice bran, etc. Free range organic eggs and chicken (no hormones added), Organic beef (no antibiotics) clean food. Less sugar (yogurt). This is what I try to feed my family and on a healthy holiday it would have been great to get new ideas for clean cooking/ eating. The cleaning staff where always happy and helpful. They worked around our training/ napping schedules with ease. The room was clean and quiet. The sporting side to the holiday was above all expectations, can't wait to go back and do it all again.

I recently stayed there after booking a Fusion Fitness Program through Health and Fitness Travel. After consultation with the in-house Physiotherapist and Senior Fitness Instructor, the Thanyapura staff were happy to adjust my pre-organised program to suit individual needs. Everyone there was quite inviting and helpful. Their sports, fitness, health, relaxation and well-being facilities and services are top notch and they offer a range of options for training including individual, one on one personal training, group classes, and specialised packages/programs such as triathlon preparation. They offer a few different dining options as well which helps ensure you don't get bored with your meals which I really appreciated. As for accommodation, I stayed in the Garden Wing which had a lovely library right across from my room. The room itself was tastefully styled and very comfortable especially after a day of training.

The hotel has amazing sports facilities alongside it including 50m, 25m swimming pools, state of the art gym, indoor and outdoor tennis courts, running track, astro turf fields and multiple rooms for activities like yoga, Zumba, spinning, pilates etc. If you stay at the hotel you can use the majority of these facilities for free, except tennis courts and coaching which are an additional fee.
