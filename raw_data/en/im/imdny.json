Our cleanses are 3 or 10 day whole-body cleanses, in which our participants consume a seasonally-based and real foods diet, along with supplements that augment the cleanse. The goal at the end of each round of cleanses is to get each participant more comfortable with eating a healthy diet and engaging in a balanced lifestyle. The cost of each cleanse option varies per participant, as each individual may have different nutrient requirements or sensitivities. There are no service fees associated with the cleanses, cost is based upon supplements purchased. Group cleanses offer a valuable and motivating experience for cleanse participants. Plan ahead with a group of friends or co-workers and let's get healthy together, Sonoma! | | Sonoma Roots Natural Medicine 651 1st Street West, Suite B Sonoma, CA 95476 Shop Hours: M - Th: 10-5:30pm, Fri "}
