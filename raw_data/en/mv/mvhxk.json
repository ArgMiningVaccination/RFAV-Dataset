Made from food sources you actually recognize, natural supplements digest more easily. The body is better-equipped to deal with natural supplements, and supplements that come from organic sources are far less likely to have side effects than synthetic supplements. If you're looking for natural supplements for great values, look no further than our own Ward's store brand supplements. Made and bottled for us by a gluten-free, fair-trade pharmaceutical manufacturer in Colorado, the Ward's line offers excellent quality at a modest price. Our private label also supports Vitamin Angels, having donated over 11 million bottles of children's multivitamins since 2006. In addition to our store brand, we also offer a variety of other natural supplement brands. We research all our supplement suppliers and get to know them so we can be sure we are bringing you the best vitamins, minerals, homeopathics, and herbs available. Some of our Body Care Did you know that chemicals in your skin care products are absorbed into your bloodstream? We think that anything you put on your skin needs to be safe enough to eat. We strive not to carry products with suspect ingredients like petroleum derivatives, propylene glycol, sodium laurel sulfate, or parabens. We carefully choose every product in our healthy body care section. Part of the decision is based on a terrific information source\u2014 [Skin Deep Cosmetics Database](http://www.cosmeticsdatabase.com/splash.php?URI=%2Findex.php). Here, you can search for an ingredient or product and learn all about the safety of your favorite body care products. The Skin Deep website, developed by the [Environmental Working Group](http://www.ewg.org/), rates products on a scale of 0 to 10 according to the safety of their ingredients. Our goal when selecting products for Ward's shelves is to stay within the \"green\" safe range of 0 to 3. To raise the bar even higher, we also select products with an eye to fair trade practices, organic ingredients, local production, and social service. Last but not least, we try before we buy and choose only the best-smelling, gentlest, most effective and most delightful products we can find. We have safe, effective products for everybody in the family, from indulgent face creams and natural toothpastes and chemical free baby care to everyday staples like Dr. Bronner's Peppermint Castile Soap and [Beat It! All Natural Insect Repellent](http://www.beatitbugs.com) produced locally. Come in and check out our full line of products, it's always expanding! Here is a sample of the brands "}
