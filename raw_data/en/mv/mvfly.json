Make setting aside time for yourself pleasure with home scents created to support your mindful practices. Whether you're starting a new habit or just looking for ways to prioritize your health, creating a peaceful environment that relaxes all the senses may just be the positive reinforcement you need to get started and keep going. An Enlightening Home Fragrance Getting is a Zen state of mind that takes more than just finding a quiet place. If you've ever participated in a guided meditation, you were probably asked to focus in on a tranquil place that made you feel happy and relaxed. The guide alternately brought your attention to lapping waves or crunching leaves beneath your feet and reminded you to breathe. Our new home fragrance, Meditation, grabs your attention with Bergamot, Ginger, Cardamom, and Coconut. Relaxes you with Blue Iris, Lavender, Violet, Leaves, and Cedar. Grounds you with Sandalwood, Balsam, Amber, and Cashmere Musk. It's like a guided meditation partner helping you focus on the here and now for a more open mind and deeper inner connection. Why Meditate? Scenting your home, office, car, and even yourself is so personal and pleasurable. The important connections between your memories and the aromas around you can be a powerful tool in creating and sticking to healthier habits. But what's so great about meditation? According to the Mayo Clinic, meditation has been practiced for thousands of years, and only recently are we able to see the many benefits of this complementary mind-body medicine scientifically. A Deep State Of Calm & Relaxation A Clearer, Tranquil Mind Better Focus Newer Perspectives On Stressful Situations Stress Management Deeper Self Awareness Reduced Negative Emotions Increased Imagination & Creativity Increased Patience & Tolerance Chronic Pain & Blood Pressure Management Better Sleep Scenting Your Meditation Space For Success So, taking the time to align your chakras is about more than just clearing your mind of the jumble of thoughts and information it is bombarded with each day.
