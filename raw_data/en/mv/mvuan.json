This is not easy because immune response to the (say HIV) vaccine is only observed in the HIV vaccine arm. If we knew what the HIV-speci\u00afc immune response in placebo recipients would have been, had they been vaccinated, this immune response could be treated essentially like a baseline covariate and an interaction with treatment could be evaluated. Relatedly, the rate of infection by this baseline covariate could be compared between the two groups and a causative role of immune response would be supported if infection risk decreased with increasing HIV immune response only in the vaccine group. We introduce two methods for inferring this HIV-speci\u00afc immune response. The \u00afrst involves vaccinating everyone before baseline with an irrelevant vaccine, e.g. rabies. Randomization ensures that the relationship between the immune responses to the rabies and HIV vaccines observed in the vaccine group is the same as what would have been seen in the placebo group. We infer a placebo volunteer's response to the HIV vaccine using their rabies response and a prediction model from the vaccine group. The second method entails vaccinating all uninfected placebo patients at the closeout of the trial with the HIV vaccine and recording immune response. We pretend this immune response at closeout is what they would have had at baseline. We can then infer what the distribution of immune response among placebo infecteds would have been. Such designs may help elucidate the role of immune response in preventing infections. More pointedly, they could be helpful in the decision to improve or abandon an HIV vaccine with mediocre performance in a phase III trial. KEY WORDS: AIDS; 1 Introduction A vaccine contains innocuous material that provokes a response by the adaptive immune system. Following vaccination, the immune systems mounts a multi-faceted, and exquis- itely speci\u00afc counter-attack based on two types of white blood cells; B-lymphocytes and T-lymphocytes. These cells respond to speci\u00afc proteins of the vaccine material, proliferate 1Biostatistics Research Branch, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 6700B Rockledge wait to subsequently attack either \u00b0oating microbes or infected cells that display such peptides. B-lymphocytes produce antibodies which recognize proteins in the outer surface of the virus and neutralize their ability to infect cells. T-lymphocytes produce cells which either kill or aid in killing infected cells. The magnitude of each component of the adaptive immune response to the vaccine can be measured. Vaccine development focuses on induc- ing a strong, measurable immune response while ensuring that the vaccine is safe (see e.g. Halloran 1998, Nabel 2001, or Chan, Wang, & Heyse 2003). Establishing the role of vaccine induced immune response on actual protection of infection and disease is an important open problem in vaccine studies (Halloran 1998). A \\correlate of protection\" is the threshold for immune response, say xp, beyond which infections and disease do not occur (Lachenbruch et al 2000). Methods for estimating such a threshold are discussed in Plikaytis & Carlone (2005), Chan et al (2002), and Carey, Barker & Platt (2001). However, when immune response only occurs in the vaccinated group, validation of a correlate of protection, or more generally validation of of immune response as a true surrogate with a causative role, is problematic (Chan, Wang & Heyse 2003). Strictly speaking, one cannot know whether the measured immune responses, or other unmeasured vaccine induced changes are actually responsible for an e\u00b1cacious vaccine. For example, it could be that those individuals who achieve xpin response to a weak vaccine are more instrisincally \u00aft than others so that even if a more powerful vaccine achieved xpin everyone, not all would be protected. That this might be an actual problem was demonstrated in VAX004, the \u00afrst phase trial III of an HIV vaccine (The rgp 120 HIV Vaccine Study Group 2005, Gilbert et al 2005). Overall, the vaccine was not e\u00aeective, with infection rates of .067 and .070, respectively, in the vaccine and placebo groups based on 5403 volunteers. However, the antibody response to the HIV vaccine was strongly associated with infection risk in the vaccine group. Table 21 provides the relative hazard of infection as a function of antibody response quartiles, \u00afrst within the vaccine group and then when the placebo group is used as a control (see Gilbert et al 2005). Because antibody response to the HIV vaccine is only measured in the vaccine group, the latter half of the table has question marks in the placebo cells. Two hypotheses were postulated to explain these results (Gilbert et al 2005, Graham & Mascola 2005). The \u00afrst was that antibody response is identifying volunteers with di\u00aeerent constitutional ability to avoid infection but the vaccine induced immune response had no causative role. Call this the association hypothesis. The second was that the vaccine caused infections in those with the weakest immune response and prevented infections in those with the strongest immune response. Call this the causation hypothesis. As it stands, neither of these hypotheses can be evaluated on the basis of data. In this paper we introduce two new designs to help understand the role of immune response in vaccines. These designs can discriminate between the two hypotheses outlined above. The \u00afrst design is to inoculate everyone in both arms prior to randomization with an irrelevant vaccine, say rabies. Call this baseline irrelevant vaccination (BIV), and let W0 be the immune response to the rabies vaccine at baseline. Also de\u00afne X0as the immune response to the HIV-vaccine, which is measured just after randomization in the vaccine group. Randomization ensures that the relationship between W0; X0observed in the vaccine group is the same in the placebo group. Based on this relationship, the observed W0of a placebo participant can be used to infer his X0. Figure 1 illustrates how W0can be used to impute X0in the placebo group when they are very highly correlated ( \u00bd=:98). It is important to note that a rabies vaccine is not required|any baseline measurement that correlated well with X0would work, but an irrelevant vaccinization is a good choice. This type of thinking to predict a post-randomization characteristic only observed in the treatment group has been used before in heart disease (see e.g. Hallstrom et al 2001, or Follmann 2000). 3The second way to get at X0in the placebo group would be to vaccinate all the uninfected placebo recipients at the closeout of the trial with the HIV vaccine and then measure their immune response, say XC. If we make the assumption that XCis the same as X0, we e\u00aeectively obtain X0in many. Call this closeout placebo vaccination (CPV). Table 2 provides hypothetical data illustrating how CPV can be used to suggest that X0is associated with constitutional ability to remain uninfected, but has no causative role. Figure 1 and Table 2 are meant to informally illustrate how to infer X0in the placebo group. In the sequel, we develop formal methods that rely on the thinking of counterfactuals and causal inference. We also describe some simple methods, investigate performance of di\u00aeerent methods by simulation, and discuss some more elaborates approaches. 2 Model Based Approach Suppose that npatients per group are randomized to placebo or vaccine. Prior to ran- domization, all patients receive a rabies vaccine and the immune response to rabies vaccine, (W0), is measured before randomization. Patients are then randomized to either a placebo or HIV vaccine injection and shortly thereafter, immune response to the HIV vaccine ( X0) is measured in the vaccine group. At the closeout or end of the trial, all uninfected placebo recipients receive the HIV vaccine and shortly thereafter, immune response to this vaccine is measured ( XC). Let Ybe the infection indicator and Zbe the vaccine indicator. A schematic representation of a vaccine trial augmented with BIV and CPV is given in Figure 2. Our approach to using these data is perhaps best described using counterfactual reason- ing (Neyman 1923, Rubin 1974, 1977, 1978, and Halloran & Struchiner 1995). First, let W0ibe the baseline rabies-speci\u00afc adaptive immune response for patient i. This is seen in everyone. The response to HIV vaccination is di\u00aeerent. One can write X0i(z) as the (post) 4baseline HIV-speci\u00afc immune response to HIV vaccination. We call X0i(0); X0i(1) potential covariates; X0i(1) is measured in vaccine recipients while X0i(0) is not measured nor mean- ingful. We say that X0i(1) is realized in the vaccine group and unrealized in the placebo group. We next de\u00afne Yi(z) as the outcome for person ifollowing treatment z. We call the pairYi(0); Yi(1) potential outcomes. We also de\u00afne XCi(z; y) as the closeout HIV-speci\u00afc adaptive immune response for person iwhen given treatment zand following outcome y. Only XCi(0;0) is measured and meaningful. We make the following simplifying assumptions. \u00b2All patients receive the assigned injections so there is no noncompliance. \u00b2There is no missing data; W0; Y0are measured on everyone, X0is measured on all vaccinees and XCis measured on all placebo uninfecteds. \u00b2No infections occur between the time of randomization and when X0is measured, say the interval [0 ; m]. The \u00afrst two are for simplicity and can be relaxed. For example, if there is some noncompli- ance but it is governed an independent random mechanism, our methods could be applied to just the compliers. With data missing completely at random the methods can be applied directly to the observed data. If the data are missing at random, methods that incorporate covariates associated with missingness can be used. The last assumption is more likely to be met if mis small. If a few infections occur in [0 ; m] an analysis that throws them may be acceptable. We discuss how to modify our approach to incorporate infections during [0 ; m] in section 6. We next specify probit models for the e\u00aeect of the \\baseline covariate\" X0(1) on the probability of in both groups: pz(x) =P(Yi(z) = 1jZi=z; (1) 5where \u00a9() is the standard normal cdf. This equation speci\u00afes a model for a standard covariate by treatment interaction for a clinical trial. The probit is handy because it is easy to integrate overx, which we will need to do later. Note that (1) assumes that W0has no e\u00aeect on Y(z) once X0(1) and Zare in the model. This can also be relaxed, as we discuss in section 6. In the probit model for the vaccine group, \u00af2+\u00af3measures the relative e\u00aeect of the potential immune response in those who are vaccinated. Or put another way, the relative e\u00aeect of the realized potential immune response. In the placebo group, \u00af2measures the relative e\u00aeect of the potential immune response in those who are not vaccinated. Put another way, the relative e\u00aeect of the unrealized potential immune response. If \u00af2<0 then those who would have strong immune responses to the HIV vaccine are less likely to be infected than those who would have weak immune responses. If \u00af3<0, then the realized immune response is causative in reducing infections. Di\u00aeerent causal estimands can be used to quantify the e\u00aeect of the vaccine as a function ofX0(1). For example, following Hudgens and Halloran (2004) we x])\u00a1\u00a9\u00a11(E[Yi(0)jX0i(1) when \u00af3= 0, \u00a2 P(x) is free of x, this is not true for V E(x). IfX0i(1) were observed in everyone, estimation would be straightforward. Since X0i(1) is not observed in the placebo group, we require at least one of the following two assumptions to proceed: \u00b2X0i(1) can be viewed as a are iid mean 0. Call this time constancy of immune response. The \u00afrst assumption is true by design in randomized trials and allows us to impute X0i(1) based on W0iin the placebo group. While technically measured post-randomization this \\post-baseline\" covariate can be used as a baseline covariate. The second assumption allows us to replace X0i(1) with XCi(0;0) as a covariate in the probit model for placebo un- infecteds. Under the model X=x+U, one can think of xas the true time constant immune response which is observed subject to measurement error and our interest focuses on the regression of YonX. This assumption cannot be accepted uncritically as immune response can diminish with age, such as for herpes zoster, if the trial is long enough. Additionally volunteers might get subinfectious exposures to a virus that modi\u00afes immune response. This is thought possible for HIV where commercial sex workers showed immune responses to HIV but remained uninfected. However even here, the assumption might hold if the immune response is e\u00aeectively primed by subinfectious exposure pre-baseline and this response is maintained during the course of the trial. Additionally, this assumption can be examined, as we will discuss in section 6. Our \u00afnal assumption allows us to easily integrate over the distribution of X0(1)jW0 \u00b2The distribution of \u00bd. This assumption can also be relaxed but the integration would be more complicated. To estimate \u00af= (\u00af0; \u00af1; \u00af2; \u00af3), we use maximum likelihood. We begin by constructing a likelihood incorporating both BIV and CPV. The likelihood contribution for vaccinees is simple, Y i2Vp1(x0i)yi(1\u00a1p1(x0i))1\u00a1yi; 7where Vis the set of vaccinees. For uninfected placebo volunteers we use XCiin lieu of X0i and their contribution is Y i2P(U)(1\u00a1p0(xCi))1\u00a1yi; where P(U) is the set of uninfected placebo recipients. In the placebo infecteds, X0(1) is missing and we need to integrate p0(X0(1)) over the distribution of X0(1)jW0, to obtain their likelihood contribution. Under our last assumption, it follows that X0(1)jW0=wis normal with mean \u00b9\u00a4(w0) =\u00b9x+\u00bd\u00bex=\u00bew(w0\u00a1\u00b9w) and variance \u00be2 \u00a4=\u00be2 x(1\u00a1\u00bd2). The (integrated) probability for with W0=w0is thus p\u00a4 0(w0) depends on the moments of X0(1); W0which are unknown. We advocate estimating these moments using vaccine group data and regard them as \u00afxed in LBC. Because of this, the standard error estimates obtained by the Fisher information matrix are incorrect and we suggest using the nonparametric bootstrap method to obtain standard errors. We can also construct likelihoods based on augmenting the usual design with BIV alone or CPV alone. are, respectively, LB(\u00af) =(Y i2Vp0(x0i)yi(1\u00a1p0(x0i))1\u00a1yi) (Y i2Pp\u00a4 0(w0i)yi(1\u00a1p\u00a4 0(w0i))1\u00a1yi;) where =(Y i2Vp0(x0i)yi(1\u00a1p0(x0i))1\u00a1yi)8 number of placebo infecteds. The last \u00a9() in LC(\u00af) is just the probability a generic placebo patient is infected and equals E[\u00af0+\u00af1X0(1)] where X0(1) is normal (\u00b9x; \u00be2 x). Based on the estimated \u00afs it is a simple matter to plug them into a causal estimand. Standard errors and con\u00afdence intervals for causal estimands can be computed from the bootstrap. 3 Closeout Placebo Vaccination Alone The previous section outlined how BIV and CPV can be used to estimate the e\u00aeect of immune response using a model and likelihood. In this section, we show how closeout placebo vaccination by itself can be used without a model to assess immune response. The approach is inspired by Table 1 and Gilbert, Bosch, & Hudgens (2003). Denote by f0(x) and f1(x) the densities of X0(1) for the placebo and vaccine groups, respectively. In each group we can decompose the distribution of immune response into a mixture of those who would/did become infected and those who wouldn't/didn't. Thus we can write the immune response densities in mixture form: f0(x) where \u00b5`is the true proportion of infected volunteers in group `. In the vaccine group the mixed density and the two constituent densities are directly estimable as is \u00b51. In the placebo group \u00b50andf0(xjY= 0) are directly estimable, provided ( X0(1)jY= 0)D= To getf0(xjY= replace f0(x) with f1(x) and solve by subtraction. With these arguments and Bayes Theorem, one terms on the RHS can be estimated nonparametrically and thus so can the LHS. Interestingly, the di\u00aeerent conditional distributions of X0(1) can be compared to test the role of X0(1). To motivate these tests, consider Table 1. Suppose the counts in the Placebo Uninfected row were very similar over the 4 quartiles. This would suggest that unrealized potential immune response was unassociated with infection risk. Using the fact thatf1(x) =f0(x), the continuous analogue to seeing if the counts in the Placebo Uninfected row are similar can be written as H2 0:f0(xjY= 0) = f1(x)() p0(Y= 1jx) =\u00b50 Note that if the probit model (1) is correct, H2 0is equivalent to \u00af2= 0. Also note that H2 0 corresponds to the causation hypothesis that was suggested to explain Table 1. At the other extreme, suppose that the counts in the Vaccine Uninfected row were quite similar to the counts in the Placebo Uninfected row. This would suggest immune response has no causative e\u00aeect on infection. The continuous analogue is H3 0:f0(xjY= f1(xjY= 0)() p0(Y= 0,H3 0does not correspond to \u00af3= 0 even if (1) is correct, unless \u00af1= 0. Note that H3 0corresponds to the association hypothesis suggested to explain Table 1. Di\u00aeerent methods could be used to test equality of the densities speci\u00afed by H2 0andH3 0 such as t-tests, rank tests, or Kolmogorov-type tests. For a t-test of H2 0, one compares all X0i(1)s in the vaccine group to the XCis of the placebo uninfecteds. For a t-test of H3 0, one compares the X0i(1)s of the vaccine uninfecteds to the XCis of the placebo uninfecteds. 4 Simulation To assess these designs, we conducted a simulation under the model assumptions given in the previous section. We generated data where P(Y(z) = 1jZ=z; X 0(1) = x) is given by (1), 10andW0; X0(1) are bivariate Gaussian with correlation \u00b50=:10 selected risk, p`(Q(7=8)) p`(Q(1=8))=R`; where Q(7=8); Q(1=8) are the 7th and 1st octiles of the distribution of X0(1). Three scenarios were considered, chosen with the hazards of Table 1 in mind. \u00b2Assocation: Here R1=R0=:2 ,\u00af3= 0 and \u00a2 R0= R1=:11,\u00afk<0,k= 0;1 and \u00a2 P(x) depends on x. For each simulated data set maximum likelihood using LBC; LB, and LCwas used to estimate \u00af. We also constructed a probit likelihood based on observing X0(1) exactly in everyone. Estimates based on this likelihood correspond to an unattainable benchmark. The \u00afrst set of simulations used 10,000 replications and varied :25; :5; :75;1. We do not evaluate \u00bd= 0 as the model using BIV alone is unidenti\u00afable. Replications were not tallied when convergence was not attained which was very rare except for BIV alone with \u00bd=:25, when the estimates did not converge 2-3% of the time. Figure 3 provides the sample variance for the four estimates of \u00af, divided by the sample variance when X0(1) is used, as a function of \u00bdunder the Association and Causation sce- narios. Relative behavior of the di\u00aeerent estimates is similar under the Both scenario and not reported. For the estimates using CPV (C) alone or the benchmark (X), the sampling variability is free of \u00bd. The sample variance with CPV alone is from nearly 10 times to al- most 25 times larger than with the benchmark. The performance of BIV (B) alone depends profoundly on \u00bdwith \u00bd=:25 exhibiting extremely large sample variances for the Association scenario, and variances similar to CPV alone for the Causation scenario. For \u00bd > : 5, BIV 11and CPV+BIV, have similar variance ratios. We see that for large \u00bdCPV is unnecessary and for small \u00bdBIV performs poorly. For \u00bd=:25 both CPV and BIV are helpful. Our second set of simulations evaluate power and are given in Table 3 with n= 1000 or 2500, \u00bd=:25 or :50, and for the three scenarios: Association, Causation and Both. For the Wald tests, a nonparametric bootstrap standard error was calculated using the sample variance of 100 bootstrap resamples for each simulated trial. Resamples where convergence was not attained were thrown out which was rare except for BIV alone with \u00bd=:25. As before, BIV alone with \u00bd=:25 had problems with convergence and these were exacerbated in the bootstrap resamples. We begin by evaluating the Wald test. First, the benchmark has extremely high power, except for \u00af3under scenario B with n= 1000. For CPV+BIV, power is generally good to excellent for all scenarios with n=2500. For n=1000, power is degraded, especially with \u00bd=:25. For BIV alone, power is similar to CPV+BIV for \u00bd=:50 and much worse for \u00bd=:25. Generally, power for CPV alone is much worse than for BIV alone with \u00bd=:50 and moderately better with \u00bd=:25. The power of the t-tests is usually similar to CPV alone and close to at least .50 for scenarios A and C with n= 2500. We also did a few limited simulations to address speci\u00afc issues. In practice, one might want to perform CPV on a fraction of the placebo uninfecteds. For scenario A, we compared the estimates using CPV alone where XCwas obtained on everyone to where it was obtained on 1/2, 1/4, or 1/10 of the placebo uninfecteds. The sampling variance for either ^\u00af2or^\u00af3was about 60%, 300% and 1000% larger than when XCwas obtained in everyone, respectively. Second, we evaluated the procedures when the moments were set to their true values and not estimated. The sampling variance for CPV alone and for BIV alone was nearly halved when true values were used instead of estimated. For CPV+BIV, the sampling variability was only modestly reduced. For larger trials e.g. n= 8000 with low event rates, the performance 12of CPV and BIV relative to BIV+CPV might be better than shown in Figure 3 and Table 3 as the estimated moments of X0(1); W0would be more reliable. It also suggests that one might want to consider use of a full likelihood. For example, for CPV alone f0(xiCjYi= 0;\u00b9x; \u00be2 x) is the density for uninfect- eds, derived under (1) and a Gaussian model for X0(1). In summary, the new designs can be e\u00b1cient and powerful even with n= 1000 if \u00bd > :5. If\u00bdis modest, a larger sample size is required to achieve strong power as CPV is necessary. If\u00bdis large enough, CPV may be unnecessary, while if \u00bdis too small, BIV alone may be useless. With n= 2500 we have excellent power for scenarios A and C with \u00bd=:5 using BIV alone and good to excellent power with the BIV+CPV combination with \u00bd=:25. Even with CPV alone, power is greater than 50% for these two scenarios. This con\u00afguration is not unlike VAX004 suggesting augmented designs could have helped inform the debate about these two hypotheses. It is clear that the performance of the designs depends dramatically on speci\u00afc scenarios. In practice, careful analysis of performance would be required to settle on a speci\u00afc augmented design. We note that a correlation of close to .5 may be a realistic aspiration. In the VAX004 trial, the vaccine consisted of two strains of viral gp-120 which is a sequence of 120 amino acids that comprise the outer envelope of the virus. The two strains were denoted MN, and GNE8. Two non-overlapping regions of the envelope, prone to mutations, are called the V2 and V3 loop. The amino acid sequences for the V2 loop and V3 loop of the gp120 are completely di\u00aeerent and thus the immune response induced by these two di\u00aeerent loops should behave like responses to irrelevant vaccinations. Correlations between these loops were .42 and .44, respectively, for the MN and GNE8 strains. Correlations across strains were .34 and .48 (Figure 3 of Gilbert et al 2005). 135 Elaborations The methods of this paper can help decide if an improved vaccine is worth evaluating in a phase III trial. Suppose that after tinkering with the old vaccine, a new version were created which shifted the distribution of the immune response to the right by \u00a2. So in an obvious notation, we have X0(1)oldwith moments \u00b9xand\u00be2 x, while X0(1)newhas moments \u00b9x+ \u00a2 and\u00be2 x. We assume that a person with response xunder the old vaccine is infected with probability \u00a9(\u00af0+\u00af1+\u00af2x+\u00af3(x+ \u00a2)) under the new vaccine. Note that \u00a2 is missing from \u00af2as only \u00af3re\u00b0ects the causative e\u00aeect of immune response. Overall, we calculate the expected event rate with the new vaccine \u00b5new 1=Z \u00a9(\u00af0+\u00af1+\u00af2x+\u00af3(x+ \u00a2)) \u00c1(xj\u00b9x; \u00be2 x)dx: Based on the data from the trial of the old vaccine, one can estimate \u00b50and\u00b5new 1and then estimate the sample size required for a phase III trial of the new vaccine with improved immune response \u00a2. Or one might conclude that \u00b5new 1is too modest to proceed. Closeout placebo vaccination requires time-constancy of immune response. One way to examine this assumption would be to close-out some fraction of the placebo uninfecteds midway through the trial, vaccinate them and obtain their immune response, say XC=2. Equality of the distributions of XC=2andXCsupports time constancy of immune response provided the e\u00aeect of X0(1) on Ydoes not vary with time. To formalize this, let YC=2; YC be the infection indicators over half the trial, and the entire trial, respectively. If p0(YC=2= 1jX0(1))/p0(YC= 1jX0(1)) (6) then HT2 0:XC=2D=XC 14is consistent with time constancy of immune response on an individual level. Note that if (6) doesn't hold, there is no point in examining HT2 0. Testing HT2 0need not be very costly. Simple power calculations that for a 8800 person trial with 90 % power to detect a 10% versus 8% di\u00aeerence in infection rates, removing 10% of placebo uninfecteds halfway through would retain at least 88% power. Additionally, comparing XC=2in 440 \\halfway\" placebo uninfecteds to say the 3520 \u00afnal placebo uninfecteds, would give 97% power to detect a standardized di\u00aeerence (mean di\u00aeerence over standard deviation) of .20. Another way to examine time-constancy of immune response is to see if the relation- ships between W0; X0(1) and W0; XCare the same in the two arms. But this also requires assumptions. For example, if the following probit model holds P(Y= 1jW0; constancy of immune response. Note that HTW 0can be tested using data readily available from a CPV trial and does not require a partial closeout, halfway through the trial. Model (1) assumes that there is no e\u00aeect of W0on infection risk once X0(1) is in the model. One can specify generalizations to (1) that include W0as an additional main e\u00aeect, or even allow for interaction with treatment, P(Y= 1jX0(1); Z; W + \u00af5ZW 0);(8) and likelihood construction for this model would parallel construction based on (1). It is perhaps surprising that even for our setting where X0(1) is missing in the placebo group, this model with two interactions can be estimated provided CPV is performed. If CPV is 15not done, (8) is identi\u00afable provided, e.g. \u00af5= 0. With CPV one could test whether \u00af5 and/or \u00af3were 0. However, such tests would likely have poor power, as trials are powered for a treatment main e\u00aeect and estimating two interactions may be di\u00b1cult. In principle, W0could be any baseline variable correlated with X0(1) and a baseline irrelevant vaccination need not be performed. Presumably, however, W0based on BIV should have a much stronger relationship with X0(1) than a variable such as race, gender, or age. An additional issue with non-immunologically based W0is the perhaps greater concern that \u00af3and or \u00af5in (8) might not be zero. It is important to realize that if (8) holds with ( \u00af3; \u00af5)6= (0;0) then inference derived from \u00aftting (the incorrect) model (1) would be misleading. We made a simplifying assumption that there were no infections in either group until after X0(1) was measured. If infections do occur over the interval [0 ; m] we can still obtain consistent estimates of the parameters provided we derive a likelihood under more assump- tions. We illustrate one way. Consider a BIV design. Since the likelihoods in section 2 factor, L(\u00af) =Lv(\u00af0+\u00af1; \u00af2+\u00af3)Lp(\u00af0; \u00af2) and we can estimate \u00b5). For the vaccine group, let V(m) be the set of vaccinees who become infected over the interval [0; m] andV(R) be the rest of the vaccinees. Then under assumption (6) applied over [0 ; m], the likelihood for the vaccine group is proportional to 8 < :Y i2V(R)p1(x0i)yi(1\u00a1p1(x0i))1\u00a1yi\u00c1(x0i; w0i;\u00b5)9 where \u00c1is the bivariate normal density function. 6 Final Comments While this paper has focused on immune response to an HIV vaccine, it is clear that the methods would apply to any vaccine trial. Chan, Wang, & Heyse (2003) describe the role of 16immune response in vaccine development and point out the di\u00b1culty of establishing immune response as a surrogate for protection or disease burden as immune response is only measured in the vaccine group. The designs of this paper could in principle allow the issue of surro- gacy of immune response to be approached using more standard methods for establishing surrogacy where the surrogate endpoint is measured on everyone. This paper has focused on evaluating the e\u00aeect of immune response on preventing in- fections. Current thinking on HIV vaccines is that they may have their major e\u00aeect on post-infection outcomes, such as the viral load setpoint; the steady-state amount of virus in the bloodstream shortly after infection. The approach of this paper could also be applied to post infection endpoints, though this is necessarily more assumption dependent as the infected groups are not balanced by virtue of randomization (see Gilbert, Bosch, & Hudgens 2003 and Hudgens, Hoering & Self 2003) The simulations show the profound dependence of these methods on \u00bd. Fortunately, \u00bdcan be estimated well before closeout and inform the decision about whether and how much close-out placebo vaccination would be required. However even if \u00bdis large, there is some bene\u00aft in obtaining some CPV data as it provides a di\u00aeerent way to impute X0and can be useful as check of the imputation based W0alone. Additionally, if it turns out an unanticipated immune response to the HIV vaccine, say X0(1)uis strongly associated with infections and W0is independent of X0(1)u, a BIV alone design would have been a mistake. CPV o\u00aeers protection against this possibility. Finally, a simple t-test based on CPV data alone is appealing for its simplicity and transparency. Of course, CPV requires the strong assumption of time constancy of immune response. In practice, several vaccinations over several months may be necessary during which time infections might accrue and the immune responses might wax and wane in conjunction with the vaccinations so thought is required to pick a precise time to measure X0(1). Another 17approach would be do develop methods that explicitly model the time-varying nature of X0(1) and use time to infection as the outcome rather than a binary indicator of infection. Implementation of these designs could be done in an incremental fashion. Initially, small studies could be conducted to establish the extent of correlation between W0andX0(1), which irrelevant vaccine was most useful, and whether time constancy of immune response were plausible. If promising, an adaptive augmented phase III design could then be initiated.

The numbers provide the hazard relative to the overall placebo group, while the ?s emphasize that immune response is not measured in the placebo group and thus the relative hazards are unknown.

The vaccine group has an immune response to the HIV vaccine that is measured just after randomization/vaccination. The placebo volunteers who remain uninfected are vaccinated at the end of the study and immune response is measured then. Bold numbers are directly observed, italicized numbers are inferred. Randomization assures that roughly 100 placebo patients would be in each quartile, as occurred in the vaccine group. In this example, consistent with the association hypothesis, the vaccine has no overall e\u00aeect but identi\u00afes patients with an intrinsic ability to avoid infection.

The bivariate distribution between X0; W0is observed in the vaccine group. Randomization assures that this distribution and regression line also apply to the placebo group. While X0cannot be observed in the placebo group, W0is and provides the basis for imputation. A very high correlation between X0; W0is used to illustrate the concept. 2 1 0 1 221012 Immune response to Rabies VaccineImmune response to HIV VaccineVaccine Group ?? ?? ?? ???? ??? ??? ?? ???? ???? ?? ?? ?? ???? ?? ???????? ?? ???? ??? ???? ? ? ??? ?? ???? ??? ?? ????? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??? ? 2 1 0 1 221012 Immune response to Rabies VaccineImmune response to HIV VaccinePlacebo Group 24Figure 2: Schematic representation of augmented designs.

Under a traditional design, patients are vaccinated either with HIV vaccine (h) or placebo (p) and immune response to the HIV vaccine ( X=X0) is measured shortly thereafter in the vaccine group. Under BIV, both groups are vaccinated against rabies (r) and the immune response to rabies vaccine (W=W0) measured prior to randomization.
