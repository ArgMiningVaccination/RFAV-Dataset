Herein, differentially transcribed genes 23,129 and 23,550 mapped genes were detected in control and treatment groups, a total of 3238 geneswere differentially expressed between control and treatment groups. Of these genes, 328 genes (213 up-and 115 down-regulation) had signicant differential expression ( p<0.05) and an expression ratio (con- trol/treatment) of >2o r<0.5. Additionally, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) category and Kyoto Ency- clopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses, and found 266 genes in thetreatment group with annotation terms linked to the GO category. A total of 77 differentially expressedtranscriptional genes were associated with 132 predicted KEGG metabolic pathways.

Fluoroquinolone and tetracycline antibiotics are owing to their b-diketone func- tional group. Biological resistance to DKAs is of great con- cern in the environment due to their large production and wide usage (Yoon et al., 2010). DKAs are absorbed byhumans and animals in low amounts and then released to the environment as active metabolites. In recent years, DKA res- idues in the mg/L X.

Although their half-lives are not very long in the environ- ment, DKAs can create a \"pseudo-persistent\" phenomenondue to large doses and frequent application (Yahiat et al., 2011), which causes a serious threat to aquatic organisms and human health (Dong et al., 2010). DKAs can lead to serious environmental biological effects, such as severe liver and kidney toxicity and neuro- toxicity. For example, quinolone antibiotics may causesevere central and peripheral neurotoxicity resulting in medicine-source disease symptoms, such as bromyalgia, respiratory myasthenia gravis, myocarditis, and rheumatism( Y ue ta l . ,2 0 0 9 ) .A l t h o u g hs o m eD K A sh a v ew e a kh o r m o n e or mutagenic activity, they act on hormone-sensitive path- ways and have synergistic effects with other factors, whichcan lead to severe ecological risk (Sendzik et al., 2010). In vivo andin vitro experiments have validated that some DKAs interfere with endocrine system, including estrogenactivity, causing immune toxicity, feminization, reproduc- tive disorder, abortion, and cancer of the reproductive organs (Lemus et al., 2009). In detoxication metabolism studies,research found that a variety of DKAs affected not only the activity of cytochrome P450, but also those of (SOD) (Yu andYang, 2010; Wang et al., 2014). DKAs have strong genetic toxicity, such as DNA dam- age, cross-linking and adduct formation, DNA local hyper-methylation of kidney cells in Carassius auratus ,a n d teratogenic effects on Cyprinus carpio (Li et al., 2010; Khadra et al., 2012). These molecular-level results greatlyenhanced toxicity prediction accuracy among different spe- cies, different toxicological endpoints, and even different chemical structures (Goto et al., 2010). In general, most of the previous research on antibiotic toxicology was concerned with acute toxicity under high concentration ( mg/L to mg/L range) of a single drug as related to their effects on biological behavior, morphological development, hatching and survival, angiogenesis, etc. Pre- vious molecular toxicological studies focused primarily onthe expression level of individual genes and the detection of toxicity biomarkers in a single system. In recent years, the systems toxicology concept was put forward to describe theuse of omics technologies to provide information for inte- grated toxicity testing strategies via the creation of signa- tures toxicity. These signatures are then linked to underlyingpathways of toxicity and pathway information determined from biochemistry and molecular biology to improve the assessment of compound toxicity. The more advanced omicstechnologies allow acquisition of more reliable data for sys- tems toxicology studies (Heijne Danio rerio ) genome is version but remains incompletely annotated. Bioinformation approaches have been used to identify important zebrash genes and the majority of research involving zebrash RNA-sequencing has focused on immunity elds (Heged }us et al., 2009; Ordas et al., 2010). In recent years, the use of deep sequencing to study other biological subjects in zebrash has increased (Aanes et al., 2011; Aday et al., 2011). Atpresent, we can gain excellent insight into novel genes by deep sequencing, which has proven its utility for zebrash toxicology studies. Transcriptomic analysis, both descriptiveand quantitative, is important for interpreting the functional elements of the genome and for revealing the molecular con- stituents of cells and tissues. In this investigation, we usedthe next generation sequencing platform for high throughput analysis of zebrash transcriptome under DKA antibiotic stress. Based on our previous research examining biomarkers and behavior of zebrash exposed to DKAs (Wang et al., 2013), representative DKA species were selected for expo-sure to zebrash from the embryonic stage to adulthood at mg/L concentrations. A high-throughput RNA sequencing technique was used to compare transcriptional data of zebra-sh in control and DKA-exposure groups. We then obtained differentially expressed genes, compared the transcription differences between control and treatment samples, anddetermined specic gene markers for correlation with drug- induced diseases. From these data, the molecular mecha- nisms for chronic toxicity effects and the ecological risk toDKA exposure were assessed. Our data showed that the dif- ferentially expressed genes under DKA-exposure were closely related with immunotoxicology, and that they playeda key role in immunoregulation by zebrash. Moreover, the toxicological effects of DKAs were involved in neurobeha- vioral, metabolic and developmental toxicity, and cancer.Based on the transcriptomic results, we searched for the immune-relevant genes and metabolic pathways using gene ontology (GO) slim classication and KEGG analysis. Atthe same time, we studied the effects of DKAs on zebrash immune system according to histopathological analyses, and superoxide and an antioxidant enzyme with a substrate of free radicals. It can effectively clear free radicals resulting from biologicaloxidization, and thus is a direct indicator for aging and death. GSH is non-protein thiol compound synthesized in the liver and plays an important role in the body's defensesystem to remove free radicals and enhance immunity. The above indicators were used to verify the results of the tran- scriptome and to further demonstrate the toxicity effects ofDKAs on zebrash. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ethics Statement This study was carried out in strict accordance with the rec- ommendations in the guide for care and use of laboratory animals of Wenzhou Medical University. The protocol was1358 WANG ET AL. Environmental Toxicology DOI 10.1002/toxapproved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experi- ments for Wenzhou Medical University. All zebrash sur- gery was performed on ice and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Test Chemicals Six representative DKAs were selected in this study: cipro-floxacin 24390-14-5, 99%). These drugs were purchased from Ke Jian Biology Science and Technology Co., Ltd,Shanghai, China. As reported previously by our group, the 120-hpf NOEC (no observed effect concentration) of DKAs was 18.75 mg/L (Wang et al., 2014). Therefore, the9.38 mg/L mixture of DKAs was selected for transcriptome histopathological analysis, and mixtures of DKAs for biochemical assayaccording to our previous study (Wang et al., 2014). Zebrash Husbandry and Exposure Experiment Fertilized embryos (6-h postfertilization, 6 hpf) with good quality were collected and exposed in embryonic mediumfor control, and in embryonic medium with 9.38 mg/L DKAs for treatment. Embryos were randomly distributed in Petri dishes (100 mm) and exposed (50 embryos with 40 mLsolution per treatment) for 6 days. All embryos were hatched and survived without malformation at this stage. Zebrash larva with no malformations were then transferred into 2 Ltanks for the period of 6 to 30 days postfertilization (dpf). After 30 days, the zebrash larva were transferred to 12 L tanks until the end of the experiment at 90 dpf. Zebrashwere kept in a static system that received charcoal- dechlorinated tap water with a constant temperature of 2860.5 /C14C and 50% of the water renewed daily with freshly prepared solutions. Dead sh were removed from each tank on a daily basis. Feeding was initiated at day 6 and larva between 6 and 30 dpf were fed three times daily with zebra-sh larvae diet (Aquatic Habitats, Inc.); after 30 dpf zebra- sh were fed twice daily with freshly hatched live Artemia (Jiahong Feed Co., Tianjin, China). At 90 dpf, zebrash were placed in an ice bath for 2 to 3 min until they were gently anesthetized. Ten sh from differ- ent parental stock and tanks were pooled as one representa-tive sample for RNA isolation. RNA Isolation, Library Construction, and Sequencing For RNA isolation, sh were homogenized in liquid nitro- gen using a glass homogenizer, and centrifuged at 40,0003g for 10 min at 4/C14C. Total RNA was extracted from zebrash using TRIzol with a DNA-free TMkit (Ambion). RNA quality was analyzed using an Agilent 2100 Bioana- lyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) 260/OD 280>1.8 and OD with a spectrophotometer (Biotek Instruments, Winooski, VT). The RNA from adult zebrash for control and treatmentgroups was removed with a MICROBExpress TMkit (Ambion). The enriched mRNA was converted to a RNA- Seq library using the mRNA-Seq library construction kit(Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA) following manufacturer's protocols. The two samples were pooled for paired-end sequencing using the Sanger-modied Illumina protocol (Quail et al., 2008). Detection results showed that the sequencing depth was sufcient, and the length of sequenc-ing reads was 151 bp. Pyrosequencing generated base- space reads by sequencing-by-synthesis on single stranded templates. Released pyrophosphate (PPi) was indirectlydetected by luminescence production in a base-specic manner (Rothberg et al., 2008). RNA-Seq Data Analysis For resequencing, data analysis was performed directly onthe Illumina MiSeq integrated computer, requiring no spe- cialized servers or computing facilities. The generated151 bp reads to using Tophat not align uniquely to the genome were discarded (Sultan et al., 2008). The quality parameter was set to 30 for use in the Tophat pileup. Each base was assigned avalue based on the number of mapped sequence coverage. The quantitative unigene expression value and RPKM metric (reads per kilobase of exon per million mappedreads) were calculated with custom Perl scripts by nor- malizing the sequence coverage over the gene length and total unique mapped reads in the library (Mortazaviet al., 2008). Analysis of differential expression was determined to obtain the differentially expressed genes between control and treated samples as calculated on thebasis of total read counts per transcript using Bayesian methods. The number of uniquely mapped read-pairs for each gene in each sample was stored. The total numberof mapped reads in each lane was normalized using the total mapped reads in each lane. Finally, the differentially expressed genes were dened as those showing at least a2.0-fold change in transcription expression level as deter- mined by Bayesian statistical evaluation.TRANSCRIPTOME PROFILING OF DEEP SEQUENCING 1359 Environmental Toxicology DOI 10.1002/toxGene Ontology and KEGG Pathway Analysis Based on similarity searches with known genes, as well as their protein functional annotation, unigene sequences were annotated according to a Blast hit in the non-redundant (nr) and Swiss-Prot protein d atabase results with an E-value of less than 1025. Unigenes that did not have a homolog in these data- bases were scanned using ESTS can. After nr annotation, GO analysis of all differentially expressed genes was performedusing The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Inte- grated Discovery (DAVID) software to obtain GO annotations. These results were used to perform GO functional classica-tion in order to understand the distribution of gene functions at the macrolevel (Conesa et al., 2005). The KEGG database con- tains systematic analysis of inn er-cell metabolic pathways and functions of individual gene products. The biochemical path- way information was collected by downloading relevant maps from the KEGG database (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000). qRT-PCR Analyses of the Differentially Expressed Genes Primer sets were designed using Premier 5.0 software and synthesized by Shanghai Sangon Biotechnology Company (Shanghai, China). To validate the genes ( LOC100334180 and sdk1b ) of zebrash at the transcription in vivo , qRT-PCR was performed using the StepOneTMRT-PCR System (Applied Biosystem, Foster, CA). Total RNA was extracted from zebrash and added into RNA later to pre-vent degradation. The quality of RNA was analyzed as reported above (Zebrash husbandry and exposure experi- ment section). After the RNA was determined to be free ofprotein and salt contamination, cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription using a PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (TaKaRa, Japan), following an initial denaturation time of 5min at 95 /C14C, and 35 cycles of amplication comprised of a denaturation step for 1 min at 95/C14C. Each experimental group was performed using three technical replicates. Rela- tive quantication of the targets in each sample was deter- mined using the signal of b-actin as a stable reference gene. Histopathological Analysis The concentration for DKAs was set on the basis of no obvious malformation of zebrash when exposed at 9.38 mg/ L DKAs for 90 dpf. After anatomy, the liver of zebrash was removed, and xed in precooled glutaraldehyde at 4/C14C. Then,a series of pretreatment procedures dehy- drating, embedding, and sectioning) were performed accord- ing to Sendzik et al. (2010). The treated tissue samples were observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM). Statistical Analysis The experimental data were reported as mean 6SD (stand- ard deviation, n=3). Outliers were removed from each set of measured values, which were dened as values fallingoutside the range of mean 62SD. One-way ANOVA was performed to calculate statistical signicance followed by post hoc Dunnett's or Tukey's tests to independently com-pare each exposure group with the control group. All statisti- cal analyses were conducted using SPSS 18.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL) to assess the signicance at p<0.05 level, unless otherwise stated. RESULTS Transcriptome in Control and Treatment Groups The control and treated samples were each pooled for deep sequencing analysis using Illumina high throughput second generation paired-end sequencing. The deep sequencing pro-duced 9,013,934 and 13,519,220 clean reads representing a total of 1,361,104,034 (1.36 Gb) and 2,041,402,220 (2.04 Gb) nucleotides (Table I). All sequence reads were mappedto known genes in Ensembl Danio rerio Zv9 in order to reveal the molecular characteristics of the transcriptome between control and treatment groups. A total of 26,100 genes were identied with as few as one mapped read pairs, constituting 23,129 (88.6%, control) and 23,550 (90.2%,treatment) genes with detectable expression within the total known zebrash genes in the Ensembl database. As indi- cated in Figure 1, both the transcriptomes in control andtreatment groups showed a relatively continuous distribution of gene expression levels. Similar to previous RNA-seq stud- ies in other tissues, there were only a few genes which hadhigh expression levels, while most genes were expressed at very low levels. The dominant characteristics of the mRNA in the cell were heterogeneous and redundant, with a few types having extremely high abundance, but the majority having very low expression. In the clean reads database, the number of readTABLE I. Summary of RNA-Seq and SampleTotal Length 2,041,402,220 2.1 31022/C242.931031360 WANG ET AL. Environmental Toxicology DOI 10.1002/toxcopies reflected the quantitative level of gene expression. It has been documented in previous studies that RNA-seq canreadily detect gene expression levels across a broad dynamic range (Wang et al., 2009). The gene expression levels in zebrash ranged from 0.021 to 6748 RPKM, showing adynamic range of more than ve orders of magnitude in RNA concentration. The average read size in two samples was 151-bp with Q30 percentage up to 87.0% and GC con-tent up to 49.3%. All annotated genes were analyzed for evi- dence of differential expression. A total 3238 genes in the treatment group were differentially expressed when com-pared with the control group. Of those genes, 328 genes (213 up- and 115 down-regulated genes) were considered to be signicant with p<0.05 and an expression ratio (control/ treatment) >2o r<0.5. The top 15 differentially expressed genes and ve no differential expression genes are summar- ized in Table II; these genes were further applied to studiesof gene function, protein product, and comparative genomics. GO Slim Classication To determine the biological relevance of the gene pool, a GO analysis was performed using DAVID software forannotation and identication of novel genes expressed in zebrash. A total of 266 differentially expressed genes from zebrash were assigned for GO analysis based on matcheswith sequences of known functions. Comparing the distribu- tion of GO categories from the total Zv9 database (9631 Unigene clusters), the differentiallyexpressed genes with unknown functions in the treatment group fell within three classications: biological process, molecular function, and cellular component (Fig. 2). Withinthe 266 signicantly differentially expressed genes, a large proportion of genes was involved in cell, cell part (cellular component), binding, catalytic (cellular component), cellular process, metabolic process (biological process). In the cellu-lar component classication, most genes were involved in housekeeping functions, such as cell, extracellular, and organelle. For the molecular function classication, bindingwas signicantly enriched ( p<0.05) in the treatment group. For the biological process classication, genes functioning in immune system processes, cellular process, metabolicprocess, response to stimulus and biological regulation were enriched in the treatment group. For DKAs-exposed zebra- sh, the enriched categories of molecular function and bio-logical process suggest that the abundance of immunological reaction traits is of particular interest, which may infer an immune response. Metabolic Pathways by KEGG Analysis A total of 77 differentially expressed genes were associatedwith 132 predicted KEGG metabolic pathways, and thenumber of genes in different pathways ranged from 1 to 16. The four major pathways (metabolic pathways, human dis- eases, environmental information processing, and organis-mal systems) included over 51 genes. The most important pathways that may be relevant to bacterial ( Staphylococcus aureus ) infection included infectious diseases (13), immune diseases (5), endocrine system (7), immune system (3), PPAR signaling pathway (2), MAPK signaling pathway (2), transport and catabolism (3), carbohydrate metabolism (8),and other antihyperthermia stress and anti-oxidative stress pathways or gene families. These predicted pathways are likely to be useful for further investigation of their functionsin DKA-exposed zebrash. We Listed two differentially expressed and prostaglandin E receptor 2a (subtype EP2) (Supporting Information Fig. 1). qRT-PCR Results As listed in Table III, one gene (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1-like) was found to be down-regulated when compared with control group, while another (sidekick cell adhesion molecule 1b) was up-regulated. The up-regulated gene showed twofold up-regulation (5.11-fold for sdk1b ), and LOC100334180 was no obvious expression changes but associated with ATPase activity,coupled to transmembrane movement of substances. Histopathological Analysis The liver is the main immune and metabolic organ in humans and animals, and it regulates the body metabolic balance through large numbers of both innate and adaptiveimmune cells. Thus, the histopathological observation of zebrash liver tissue was conducted by TEM for control [Fig. 3(A,B)] and DKA-exposed treatment groups [Fig. 3(C- Fig. 1. Distribution of transcript entries and total transcript counts over different tag abundance categories. The per-centages of total transcript counts and number of differenttranscript entries per category are plotted on a logarithmicscale (base 10).TRANSCRIPTOME PROFILING OF DEEP SEQUENCING 1361 Environmental Toxicology DOI 10.1002/toxTABLE II.

In control liver tissue, the nuclei were circular with a smooth edge, and were surrounded by a large number of mitochondria. The endoplasmic reticulum was clearly visible and lipid droplets were small in size and number. In contrast,severe histopathological changes were observed in the DKA-exposed treatment group including chromatin conden- sation, clear or disappeared [Fig. 3(E)]; serious deformation of the cell nucleus occurred [Fig.3(F)]; and the nucleolus disappeared and the endoplasmic reticulum was not clear [Fig. 3(G,H)]. The liver histopatho- logical damage further veries the differences in geneticclassication and function from the transcriptome analysis. DISCUSSION We used next generation RNA-sequencing, a relatively unbiased technique, to analyze the whole transcriptome in DKA-exposed zebrash. The predominant gene clusterswere concerned with various cellular and metabolic biologi- cal processes and functions, including lipid binding, oxidore- ductase activities, and structural components for the immunesystem of cells or cell organelles. Both gene annotation and pathway analyses facilitated prediction of potential genes and their likely specic roles at the whole transcriptomelevel. Applying Blast analysis and functional annotation (e.g., DESeq, GO, and KEGG), we sampled an extensive and diverse gene expression catalog for DKA-exposedzebrash. Enrichment analyses of GO functions and KEGG pathways lend support to the biological derived from short-read sequencing This approach will assist in the discovery andannotation of novel genes that play key roles in decreased immunity, immune systems, and endocrine system disrup- tion during aquatic vertebrate exposure to DKAs. The goal of GO consortium is to produce a dynamic and controlled vocabulary that can be applied for all eukaryotes, even as knowledge of gene and protein roles in cells areaccumulating and changing. As can be seen from Figure 2, genes associate immune system process were account for large proportion after exposed to DKAs for 90 dpf. We canspeculate that maybe the immune system and metabolism of zebrash were affected under the long time exposure of DKAs. The rest genes associate other GO annotations were also need subsequent studies. The immune system is a com- plex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work togetherto protect the body against attacks by \"foreign\" invaders. The innate immune system of zebrash represents an evolu- tionary ancient part of vertebrate immunity and relies ongermline-encoded receptors, commonly referred to as pattern recognition receptors, to mediate immune responses (van der Vaart et al., 2013). Almost all living beings have adaptiveimmune systems, with humans and other jawed vertebrates having evolved a more perfected adaptive immune system that uses antibodies and T-cell receptors against all kinds ofpathogens and to avoid a repeat attack. Important signaling pathways potentially involved in regulation of immune response were also identied according to KEGG analysis Fig. 2. Gene ontology slim classication for the entire zebrash transcriptome. [Color gure can be viewed at wileyonlineli- brary.com]1366 WANG ET AL. Environmental Toxicology DOI 10.1002/tox(L\u20acu et al., 2012). Transcriptomic analysis provides a valua- ble tool for further study of the specic mechanisms result- ing from DKA exposure on the zebrash immune systemduring its complex life cycle. So we discussed the immune effect of DKAs on zebrash emphatically in this experiment. According to the transcriptome results, we found some genes functioned in immune system processes and oxidore- ductase activity. In our previous study (Wang et al., 2014),GSH concentrations in the 2.34 and 9.38 mg/L treatments were signicantly higher ( p<0.01 and p<0.05) than the control at 72 hpf, suggesting that the response was primarilyinduced at the end of the hatching period. With prolonged exposure time, GSH concentrations recovered to a level sim- ilar to the control at 96 hpf, with the exception of the37.5 mg/L treatment. However, GSH concentrations were signicantly inhibited at 120 hpf, especially for the 9.38 and 37.5 mg/L treatments ( p<0.01). At 120 hpf, activities in DKA-exposed groups ( p<0.05), a dose-dependent relationship between SOD activity and DKA concentration (Supporting Information Figs. 2 and 3).SOD and GSH are key enzymes providing antioxidant pro- tection to organisms for preventing immune damage. SOD is closely related to immune processes of aquatic organismsand plays an important role in improving the phagocytic defense capabilities and the body's immune function. There- fore, SOD is commonly used as an immune-evaluating indexfor aquatic animals (Elchuri et al., 2005). GSH is an impor- tant tripeptide providing detoxication functions and plays a direct or indirect role in cell life activities including regula-tion of gene expression, enzyme activity, metabolic regula- tion, protection of cells, amino acid transport, and immune function accommodation (Romeu et al., 2002). The balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and clearing is important to life processes. If the generationof ROS increases rapidly, it will result in oxidative stress and antioxidant defense balance disorders, leading to all sorts of biological macromolecular oxidative damage(Elchuri et al., 2005). The main function of SOD is remov- ing O 22to avoid the inhibition of catalase and glutathione peroxidase activity and ensure proper functioning of theenzymatic antioxidant system. Across all investigated DKA concentrations (2.34-37.50 mg/L), the SOD activities at 120 hpf were signicantly inhibited, suggesting that DKA expo-sure led to severe oxidative damage to zebrash larvae. At 72 hpf, a in GSH was induced by 2.34 mg/L DKAs possibly implying more ROS production. WithTABLE III. qRT-PCR Analysis Results Ensembl Version in qRT-PCR. \" 2\" indicates the down-regulated expression of genes in qPCR. Fig. 3. Histopathological analysis of liver tissue.TRANSCRIPTOME PROFILING OF DEEP SEQUENCING 1367 Environmental Toxicology DOI 10.1002/toxincreasing exposure time from 96 to 120 hpf, the GSH con- centration returned to levels similar to that of the control group. This may be explained by activation of other antioxi-dant systems to maintain normal levels of GSH. After DKA exposure, zebrash liver generated histopathologic lesions and inhibition of SOD activity, suggesting decreasingimmune function and disruption of the immune system bal- ance. Reduced GSH concentration and SOD activity along with liver injury suggested that long-term exposure to DKAsresulted in immune system disorder and a decrease in zebra- sh heterologous poison resistance. These SOD and GSH responses to DKA stress were consistent with the results ofthe transcriptome, i.e., some signicantly up- or down- regulated genes were closely related to the immune system and anti-oxidative stress pathways. In addition, the expres-sion quantity changes in multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1 or ABCC1) indicated possible damage of the immune system according to qRT-PCR results, despite of no signicantly differential expression in the transcriptome. Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) expresses in tumor cells caused by drug resistance, as well as in normal tissues. It outflows a variety of drugs as a member of the ATP-binding cassette family by using energy from ATPbinding and hydrolysis. Apart from outside resistance to drugs, which results in a reduction in drug concentration, MRP1 effluxes many endogenous conjugated organic anionsand metabolites of xenobiotics, which play a physiological and a protective role in both normal and harmful tissues (Wijnholds et al., 2000; Leslie et al., 2005). A majority ofchemotherapeutic drugs are transported by MRP1, which can mediate resistance mechanisms related to the specicity of intracellular GSH levels (Fig. 4) (Cole and Deeley, 2006).The reduced cellular GSH concentration affects MRP1- mediated drug transport, and MRP1 can cause multiresist- ance by means of promoting GSH conjunction with drugsand improving discharge of drugs from cells. Thus, GSH not only acts as an antioxidant but also plays an important role in xenobiotic elimination reactions. GSH promotes theexport of various xenobiotics in MRP1-overexpressing cells (Renes et al., 1999). The depletion of intracellular GSH by copper N-(2-hydroxyacetophenone) glycinate reduced MRP1 expression (Mookerjee et al., 2006). After long-term and low-dose exposure to DKAs, multi- drug resistance-associated protein 1 was down-regulated,and a similar decreasing trend was observed for the GSH concentration with prolonged exposure time after 120 hpf. The decreased multiresistance of zebrash possibly resultsfrom the declined chance of antibiotics, in their form of archetype or metabolites, conjunction with GSH, and the fur- ther transport barrier of exogenous substances mediated by MRP1. The transport barrier can lead to difcult discharge of toxic cellular substances, immune system disorder andoxidative stress injury. MRP1 also plays a role in the cellular efflux of reduced and oxidized forms of GSH, and thus con- tributes to many physiological and pathophysiological proc-esses influenced by these small peptides under conditions of oxidative stress (Cole, 2014). Several studies have demon- strated mediates GSH efflux during apoptosis(Hammond et al., 2007; Fico et al., 2008). Therefore, it can be inferred that the decreased GSH concentration is possibly related to down-regulation of MRP1 expression. However, itwas reported by Franco et al. (2014) that GSH depletion was independent of MRP1 activity, i.e., the down-regulation of MRP proteins and MRP transport activity did not regulate Fig. 4. Multiple mechanisms of ATP-dependent transport by MRP1. [Color gure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]1368 WANG ET AL. Environmental Toxicology DOI 10.1002/toxGSH depletion and/or apoptosis. Thus, further investigation is required concerning the relationship between the down-regulation of MRP1 expression and the decreased concentra- tion of GSH under DKA stress. MRP1 expression may also be affected by the Notch signal pathway (Fig. 5) (http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/), previous research has shown a relation- ship between expression of MRP1 and Notch1 in cancers (Meani et al., 2005; Yauch et al., 2008). Therefore, furtherresearch is required to investigate whether or not the expres- sion of MRP1 is still under the influence of the Notch signal- ing pathway when exogenous toxic substances invadenormal tissue. Overall, RNA-seq presents an effective and high through- put strategy for capturing molecular snapshots of chemical-induced biological states of a whole adult vertebrate. It also provides a sensitive and unbiased alternative to analysis with major advantages for detection of a broad range of transcrip-tional responses that occur during drug exposure, as exem- plied in this study using the DKA-exposed zebrash. Many candidate genes were proposed for their potential involve-ment in immune system reactions, and future work will be able to build upon these ndings to provide deeper insights into their functions and to understand their molecular basisfor immunology in model organisms. CONCLUSIONS Data obtained in this study provide abundant evidence that long-term DKA exposure to zebrash caused signicant damage to its immune systems. By deep sequencing, thou-sands of genes were found to be differentially expressed between control and DKA treatments, among which 328 genes (213 up- and 115 down-regulation) had signicant dif-ferentially expressed genes ( p<0.05) and >2o r<0.5. Through GO cate- gory and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, 266 genes inthe DKA treatment group were found with annotation terms linked to the GO category, and 77 differentially expressedtranscriptional genes were associated with 132 predicted KEGG metabolic pathways. Changes in concentrations of SOD and GSH under DKA stress were consistent with theresults of transcriptome, i.e., some signicantly up- or down- regulated genes were closely related to the immune system and antioxidative stress pathways. Serious liver tissue dam-age further veried the differences in genetic classication and function in the transcriptome analysis. These results pro- vide a foundation for establishing systems toxicology mod-els, explicating their ecological risk and treatment of medicine source disease.
