Chiropractors operate under the idea that proper body alignment\u2014specifically of the musculoskeletal structure and spine\u2014is key in the body healing itself. This means a chiropractic patient may be able to avoid surgery and decrease or eliminate the usage of pain medications. Manipulation encourages the joints to increase their mobility, particularly after there has been tissue injury from repetitive stress or a traumatic event. In today's sedentary culture where many people spend hours hunched over keyboards and screens, repetitive stress and poor posture have unfortunately become the cause of many injuries. Chiropractic care mostly focuses on relieving pain in the muscles, bones, connective tissue, and joints. This includes ligaments, cartilage, and tendons. In order to achieve a DC, a chiropractic doctor must undergo an undergraduate degree in addition to four years at a chiropractic college. When a patient first meets with a DC, a full medical history is taken and a physical exam is performed. Lab tests or diagnostic imaging may also be ordered depending on the pain or injury. Next, a treatment plan is devised. These plans often include manual adjustments where the DC manipulates joints with a controlled yet sudden force. In many cases, a DC might also include recommendations for changes in nutrition and exercise to optimize chiropractic adjustments. The ultimate goal of chiropractic care is to restore the injury site to its full function while preventing future injuries. Overall, chiropractic care is considered safe and effective, particularly for back pain, neck pain, and headaches. Other types of pains are also regularly treated with chiropractic adjustments, including fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis. Combining chiropractic treatment with deep tissue massage from an LMP is a great way to approach pain management in a non-invasive manner. From improving joint health and mobility to loosening tight muscles while maximizing contractility, many patients are pleasantly surprised at just how diverse chiropractic care can be. DCs are experts at minimizing the degeneration of connective tissues and joints, as well as decreasing chronic inflammation often related to subluxation. Your chiropractor can help get stagnant blood moving by improving circulation. A chiropractor can also help speed up recovery and optimize the function of the nervous system, making individual nerves operate more efficiently. Improve your immune system and individual organ function with just a few adjustments. Seeing a chiropractor has also shown to reduce hyperactivity for patients with anxiety while energizing those struggling with depression. Chiropractic care as a stress management tool is an avenue for managing the demands of daily life while improving your quality of life. It can also be used as a preventive tool for more than just injuries. Chiropractic care has been shown to help prevent disease and sickness, too. Integrated Pain Consultants is committed to providing patients with every safe, effective, and minimally invasive treatment available for chronic or acute pain. This includes: This type of therapy uses electric energy to treat pain and injuries. It is mostly used as part of physical therapy to relax muscles and prevent muscle atrophy while increasing blood circulation. Electrotherapy can also help increase range of motion, manage pain, and prevent deep vein thrombosis. It is especially effective at treating musculoskeletal conditions of the neck, back, and shoulder. In some cases, it is recommended as a treatment for osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia. Also known as therapeutic spinal traction, mechanical traction forces the spine to stretch and mobilize in a safe, controlled environment. The spine includes the cervix (neck). The patient lays on their back while the machine pulls for a set time. Mechanical traction is proven to be an excellent alternative to surgery for some patients, particularly for those with a herniated or bulging disc. The gentle traction force helps to create more space between the vertebrae while increasing circulation. It can also be used for carpal tunnel syndrome, headaches, pinched nerves, and shoulder or elbow pain. Manual therapy includes a series of skillful hand techniques and movements that aim to manipulate the joints and soft tissue. The goal is to increase range of motion, relaxation, and mobilize the tissue and joints. This helps to manage pain while reducing swelling and inflammation. There are many techniques within this practice, and each approach is customized for the patient's goals and pain. Manual therapy is a fantastic addition to any holistic pain management treatment plan, helping to increase mobility and prevent bodily function impairments. Myofascial tissue is one of the most overlooked parts of the body, and it plays a key role in mobility, flexibility, and injury prevention. Myofascial tissue is found covering nearly every part of the body. It's a thin, fibrous, and very strong type of connective tissue that supports and protects bones and muscles. Myofascial release is a hands-on method in which gentle, sustained pressure is placed on target areas where motion is restricted. The key to proper myofascial release is how long pressure is applied and to what degree. It can be used to increase strength, increase flexibility, and help encourage posture and movement awareness. Rehabilitating tissue affected by neuromuscular disorders includes addressing muscles and/or nerves. This approach includes a variety of customized exercises to help heal and manage pain associated with affected tissues and nerves. Neuro-muscular rehabilitation can include a number of approaches including manual manipulation, electromyography, mechanical traction, massage, chiropractic care, and much more. Therapy regimens that are personalized to each patient are a critical foundation for success. The exact therapeutic exercises will vary based on injuries, goals, and a patient's current state. Popular exercises include stretching, strengthening, postural work, and core exercises. These exercises will change throughout a patient's program as they progress and develop new skills and strengths. Unlike \"group classes,\" therapeutic exercises are customized for each patient, and designed and monitored by licensed professionals. LLLT is the newest, natural, non-invasive treatment that uses light wavelengths that interact with tissue to significantly speed up the healing process. This treatment can reduce or eliminate pain, minimize swelling and muscle spasms, and increase functionality. It's mostly recommended for patients struggling with a number of acute or chronic conditions. If you are suffering from a back pain issue, please contact Integrated Pain Consultants.
