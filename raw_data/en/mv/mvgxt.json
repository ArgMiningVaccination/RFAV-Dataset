You will get the most out of their energy if you show your crystals some love by regularly cleansing and charging them. That is why so many people use the full moon to cleanse and charge crystals, as part of a monthly ritual. Why Do You Need to Cleanse & Charge Crystals & Crystal Jewelry? Crystals can absorb and hold onto the energy they are exposed to. This is why you should cleanse and charge them to keep their energies clear so that they are most effective in supporting your positive intentions. By cleansing your crystals or crystal jewelry, you clear them of any negative energy they may have accumulated or simply the energy of other people when using them in practices with others. Once the energy of your crystals is cleansed, you can charge them again. By charging your crystals, you fill them up with positive energy that can be used for any purpose you choose. This energy will help to amplify the effects of the crystal's natural properties and increase their healing power. The more you use your crystals, the more energy they will accumulate, so be sure to cleanse and charge them often. How To Cleanse My Crystals & Crystal Jewelry There are several ways to cleanse crystals, and the best one depends on the situation and what type of crystal it is. Here are a few common methods: - Sunlight & Moonlight. This is a popular way to cleanse crystals. Just leave them out in direct sun or moonlight for a few hours. Be sure to keep an eye on them, especially if you're cleansing during the day, as some crystals might fade in bright light. - Salt Water. Soaking crystals in salt water can be a great way to clear away negative energy. Use ocean water, or add sea salt or Himalayan salt to warm water, and soak your stones for about 20 minutes. You could even skip the water and place them directly in salt, as long as your crystals are not soft and easily scratched. - Smudging: Burning incense, sage, or other herbs can be used to clear away negative energy when smudging. Hold your crystal over the smoke and allow it to absorb its cleansing properties for several minutes. - Visualization. Use your own inner power to cleanse a crystal. This method is handy because it can be used anywhere and anytime. Just hold the stone up in front of you in your hands and visualize a bright white light washing over the crystal and cleansing it. When cleansing and charging, be mindful that each stone has different properties and characteristics, and some of them might suffer under some elements. Make sure to check beforehand what care your specific crystals may need, especially if you want to use sunlight, salt, or water to cleanse them. How to Charge My Crystals & Crystal Jewelry Now that your crystals have been cleared, they are ready for charging. Charging crystals or crystal jewelry is essentially filling them up with positive energy, so their effects can be amplified. There are many different ways to charge crystals, here are just a few: - Sunlight & Moonlight. Just as when cleansing your crystal, exposing them to these powerful rays can charge their energy. If possible, place the stone(s) directly in front of either source and allow them to absorb the light's natural power for several hours. - Meditation. You can also use your own meditation practice to charge your crystals. Sit comfortably with both hands resting on the stones, and visualize a bright white light pouring into it. - Sound. Another beautiful option for charging your crystals is to use sound vibration to amplify their energy. Singing bowls or tuning forks work great when you're looking for high vibrations that resonate through every part of your being. Simply hold the stones near either source while they are ringing out loud so they can absorb the positive vibrations. - Bury them. Burying crystals in the soil is a great way to cleanse and recharge them with grounding energy. If you have access to a safe space outdoors where your crystals won't be disturbed, you can leave them buried for a day or even up to a week as you need. There are many methods for cleansing and charging crystals, but it's important to remember that there are no hard rules. Go with what feels right for you and your crystal. Trust your intuition when working with these powerful tools, and allow the stones to guide you on your spiritual path. Also, you are not limited to choosing only one method. Combine your favorite ones as you like, and combine this practice with your regular rituals for self-care. Using the Full Moon to Cleanse and Charge Crystals The full moon is a powerful time for cleansing and charging your stones. On this night, when the lunar energy is at its highest, you can harness the energy that comes from its glowing light. Simply place your crystals outside, or near an open window, under direct moonlight for a few hours or ideally overnight. If possible, place them on a natural surface to support the process with grounding energy. Direct moonlight is best, but if this is not available (it's a cloudy night), your crystals can still benefit from the energy during this time. Simply lay them out, set your intentions to charge them, and say your prayers or mantras of gratitude. This will clear away any negative influences that may have accumulated in each crystal while increasing their energy with positive vibrations. You can also perform other rituals during this time, such as setting intentions for yourself or creating a sacred space around where you live. When you invite a new crystal into your life, it's essential to make sure that they are charged with positive energy, especially if they belonged to someone else before you. It's a good idea to cleanse any new crystals and then charge them with your own energy so they are attuned to your needs and intentions.
