In the case of [epidemic] [diseases], which due to the [virulence]of their agents causes a common symptomatological picture in most susceptible individuals, the individualized [homeopathic medicine]( [homeopathic medicine]of the [epidemic genius]) should present similarity the set of characteristic [symptoms and signs]of the [patients]affected in the different stages of each [epidemic]outbreak.

Fulfilling these premises of good clinical practice, we developed the current protocol with the objective of investigating, in a randomized, double-blind and placebo- by the [disease].
