The second wave of coronavirus was triggered by many factors ranging from lax precautions to the amalgamation of new COVID variants that surfaced in India.

[readmore](javascript://) 02/10How dangerous are the new mutations of COVID-19? Viruses are programmed to change and evolve through mutations and newer strains. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), \"When a virus replicates or makes copies of itself, it sometimes changes a little bit, which is normal for a virus. These changes are called \"mutations\". A virus with one or more new mutations is referred to as a \"variant\" of the original virus.\" COVID-19 virus is a type of coronavirus, a large family of viruses. The mutations that have taken place from the old or the original strain are called COVID mutations or 'variants' of the original virus. Unlike the original strain, the mutations may differ in their ability to infect a person and may possess a different genome sequencing that may allow it to dodge antibodies and infect even the healthy and young individuals. While scientists are yet to determine the degree of severity and transmissibility of the new COVID strains, given the rapid spread of the virus in recent times, many experts hold the new strains responsible for the devastation. [readmore](javascript://) 03/10Different types of variants identified so far Multiple variants of the SARs-COV-2 virus have been circulating in and around the world. According to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), three classifications of COVID-19 variants are being monitored, namely Variant of Interest (VOI), Variant of Concern (VOC), and Variant of High Consequence (VOHC). B.1.1.7, also known as the UK variant, was found in the south-east of England and is currently identified as a Variant of Concern (VOC). Experts suggest that this variant was 40-70% more infectious than other variants and raises death risks to 60%. The Brazil variant, scientifically known as P.1, is believed to be more contagious and dangerous than the previous mutation. E484K, an escape mutation, allows the variant to evade the antibodies. B.1.351, the South African variant was found in at least 20 countries, including the United Kingdom. Akin to the Brazil variant, E484K mutation allows this variant to dodge antibodies. Additionally, N501 mutation makes it more contagious. Reportedly, the Indian origin double mutant virus variant, scientifically termed as B.1.617, was first identified around March end in the state of Maharashtra and continues to drive India's second wave of coronavirus. It contains E484Q and L452R mutations, which makes it more infectious and enables it to escape antibodies. Earlier reports had also suggested a 'Triple mutation' COVID variant that had been identified in parts of West Bengal, Delhi and Maharashtra. The most recent COVID-19 variant was detected in Vietnam, which is said to be a hybrid of two highly transmissible strains i.e. of UK and Indian variants.

Considering the severity of the second wave of coronavirus in India, experts believe that the cocktail of variants is what led to the devastating state of the country. By nature, viruses are meant to mutate. This suggests that the possibility of more COVID variants are high and unavoidable. In such a case, what we can do is protect ourselves from the virus with precautionary measures and keep away from high risk areas. That said, here's what you can do to protect yourself from the virus and also prevent the spread.

However, the contamination process may be the same for everyone. One of the easiest ways to contract the virus is through physical contact and/or aerosol transmission. Being in the company of more than one person only increases your chance of catching the virus and spreading it to other people. That said, it becomes extremely important that you avoid public gatherings and maintain social distance at crowded places.

As per research, it helps to reduce the risk of catching the infection, especially when you visit crowded areas which could be highly infectious.

However, over time, it may seem restrictive and may also have room for errors. That said, if you are eligible and have no serious pre-existing medical conditions, getting a vaccine is your only way to achieve herd immunity. While there is an air of scepticism around the COVID vaccines and even after getting the jab, you may still be susceptible to infection, vaccination will surely reduce the degree of severity and complications in your body.

Although, experts continue to look into matters of vaccine efficacy against the news COVID strains, according a recent study, both of India's vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, have proven effective against the \"Indian strain\" of coronavirus, known as B.1.617 Director, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) had mentioned that people who had received either of the two vaccines showed only mild signs of infection. In a twitter thread, he said, \"Initial positive neutralisation studies of B.1.617, both post-Covaxin sera, are correlatable with milder disease during post-vaccination breakthrough infections. This is a positive while we get quantitative data for better understanding of infection protection.\" Another study conducted by the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) had similar reports, but clarified that these were preliminary findings.

The second wave of COVID-19 took a heavy toll on children, which is why it is all the more important to protect them from the new variants of coronavirus. At such times, make sure you make them wear their masks, whenever they're outdoors. Gently restrict them from playing outdoors and make them wash their hands regularly. Do not allow visitors at home as they can be carriers.
