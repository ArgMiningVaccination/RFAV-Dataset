There are other ways to support your body naturally. Own It! Right now in this precarious time in human history, it seems like our health choices are being whittled away. Our freedoms are being taken away. Like those freedoms, your medical freedom is being whittled away. And I want to encourage you that you still have freedom. You still have it and own it! It's here, right now. All you have to do is own it. Stand in it, speak up, speak out and say no. Bridging the Gap Between Medical Care and Self Care What's happening right now in the modern medical profession? Just for the record, I'm not anti-medicine, I'm actually pro medicine. I think that some good things are happening in the world. Not that much though. I'm going to be honest. I think that in the modern medical system doctors and the medical profession have been indoctrinated into a specific way of healing that is not necessarily healing. It's more about suppressing symptoms and giving medications and going into the body and taking out an organ when it doesn't work. That's what they've been taught. And because they've been taught that one way and indoctrinated into that system, it's the only way that they can see. It's the only way that's been shoved down people's throats and it's not necessarily the right way for you. It certainly isn't the right way for me and my family. I feel blessed and grateful that I have the opportunity to say, no, I'm not going to take that medication and or injection and you should too. What we will do instead, change the diet, change the lifestyle, change the consciousness and heal the imbalances in the body. I want to encourage you that there are other options. There are other healing modalities. There are other ways to support your body and give it the nutrients and give it what it needs to move forward. I want to encourage you to speak up and speak out while you are still free, you still have your freedom. And that's very important because you need to retain your freedom in order to be able to support your body with what it needs. If you want to feel better and be healthier you are in the right place.
