We will work with each pet owner to outline a vaccination protocol that makes sense. It is our contention that veterinarians have been over-vaccinating pets for years! Sadly, some of these vaccinations have proven to be ineffective and harmful! We not only have holistic vaccinations but also are able to test your pet to determine if vaccinations are even necessary.
