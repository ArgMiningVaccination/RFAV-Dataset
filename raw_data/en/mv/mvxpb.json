After observing that the battlefield-wounded of World War II were more likely to survive if they received immediate, skilled anesthesia care, Vanderbilt physicians advocated that anesthesiology be established as an autonomous department. At that time, few medical schools possessed an academic anesthesiology service of any type. This tradition of pioneering in our specialty continues today. Our exemplary faculty provide top-quality clinical services for a full spectrum of medical specialties. Vanderbilt Anesthesiology is recognized as an innovator in perioperative management, healthcare information technology, clinical outcomes research, education and international capacity building. We also have high-caliber basic science and clinical research teams pursuing fundamental and translational knowledge to directly improve patient safety and care. Dr. Benjamin H.

Of these, more than 8,500 patients are seen annually in the Vanderbilt Interventional Pain Clinic, and approximately 25,000 Vanderbilt adult and pediatric patients receive anesthetic care during a radiologic, gastrointestinal, interventional or other diagnostic or therapeutic procedure. The department's faculty, residents, fellows, certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) and nurse practitioners provide care in our operating rooms and five adult intensive care units. All surgical specialties are represented, including adult and pediatric cardiac surgery, organ transplantation, robotic surgery, neurosurgery, and high-risk obstetrics. Anesthetics are provided by one of our highly skilled trainees or CRNAs under the direction of an anesthesiologist. We deliver the highest quality care in a safe and effective manner according to the Anesthesia Care Team model, using the unique skills of all team members. Members of our department actively participate in the multidisciplinary perioperative care of complex patient populations, including trauma and organ transplantation. VUMC provides trauma care for patients within 80,000 square miles and manages close to 8,000 acute trauma cases, admitting 4,700 of those annually. Last year approximately 800 patients were transferred directly to the OR from the emergency department to receive care for their acute traumatic injuries. Performing 611 solid organ transplants in 2020 and more than 10,000 since 1962, VUMC ranks as the nation's sixth largest transplant program by volume. The Vanderbilt Preoperative Evaluation Center (VPEC) offers preoperative evaluation before patients undergo procedures at VUMC. VPEC faculty, nurse practitioners and staff perform comprehensive preoperative assessment, including interfacing with primary care physicians, specialist consultants and surgeons, while also making direct decisions regarding preoperative testing. Offering both in- person and telehealth visits, the number of VPEC encounters exceeds 15,000 annually. Launched in July 2019, the Department of Anesthesiology Hi- RiSE (High-Risk Surgical Encounter) Service focuses on providing personalized, evidence-based perioperative medical care, from preoperative evaluation and optimization of underlying comorbidities to postoperative recovery, for patients at the highest risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality. As the role of the anesthesiologist evolves into that of a perioperative consultant, our diverse team of experts remains at the forefront of knowledge and is fully engaged in patient care, from diagnosis to operative recovery. A full-time perioperative teaching service is available 24/7 for consultation, utilizing system-wide information technology and mobile applications to support clinical decision-making, capture data and measure outcomes, such as the quality of recovery after surgery. Each of our anesthesiologists is a member of one of our nine divisions, with many providing care in a secondary division.

Located in West Nashville, VHBM consists of seven operating rooms, featuring orthopedic and urologic surgeries. It has four extended recovery bays allowing for overnight observation. VHBM is one of the few surgery centers in Middle Tennessee routinely performing outpatient total joint surgery. The state-of-the-art facility also includes the first lithotripsy laser operating room table in the United States, the third in North America. The Ambulatory faculty members are actively involved in the Society for Ambulatory Anesthesia (SAMBA) through committee service and presentation of abstracts at the society's annual meetings. Our Ambulatory Surgery Center Medical Directors also participate in the Association of Anesthesia Clinical Directors (AACD). Their abstract describing a scheduling tool for Ambulatory Anesthesia won second place at the Spring AACD 2021 meeting. Resident and fellow education are important missions of the division. Two regional anesthesia fellows spend a combined 32 weeks with the Ambulatory Division refining their procedural skills. They also help train two residents a month who learn a combination of nerve blocks - both single shot and catheter placement. As health care systems push traditional in-house surgeries like total knee replacements to outpatient surgery centers, our trainees learn how multimodal analgesia featuring regional anesthesia can allow for same-day discharge. Outpatient surgery is often preferred to inpatient surgery for a variety of reasons. Lower costs and convenience are often popular advantages for the patient. The Ambulatory Division is committed to providing high quality patient care in an efficient ambulatory surgery center environment. In addition, it seeks to be a national leader in establishing Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols to streamline care 23,000 AMBULATORY PROCEDURES 4,000+ PERIPHERAL NERVE BLOCKS ADMINISTERED All stats based on annual numbers for both its orthopedic and urologic patients. 11Fellowship Details ACGME-accredited program Ten positions available each year Core rotations include CVICU, SICU, NCU, Trauma ICU, care, subspecialties and research Anesthesiology Critical Care Medicine Division Chief: Christopher Hughes, MD, MS, FCCM Associate Chief: Liza Weavind, MBBCh, MMHC Clinical The Division of Anesthesiology Critical Care Medicine (ACCM) provides critical care services in the burn ICU, cardiovascular ICU, neurological ICU, and surgical ICU at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, in the surgical ICU at the Tennessee Valley Healthcare System (TVHS) Veterans Administration Medical Center in Nashville (Nashville V A), and in the medical/surgical ICU at Vanderbilt Wilson County Hospital.

The teaching curriculum includes daily didactic sessions consisting of lectures, research studios, quality improvement training, echo case review, journal clubs, mortality and morbidity conferences, board preparation, simulation training, and many others. Leadership Division faculty have leadership roles in organizations such as Society of Critical Care Medicine, American Society of Anesthesiologists, Society of Critical Care Anesthesiologists, Early-Stage Anesthesiology Scholars, Society for Technology in Anesthesia, and American Delirium Society. Division clinical administration leadership includes medical directorship of the burn, cardiovascular, neurological, and surgical ICUs at VUMC and the perioperative service and surgical ICU at Nashville V A. Additionally, division faculty are active in directorship of the Center for Experiential Learning and Assessment and the Critical Illness, Brain Dysfunction, and Survivorship Center at VUMC, in the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine critical care immersion programs, and in the VUMC Institutional Review Board. Research Division faculty present at regional, national, and international academic conferences and publish in major general medical, critical care, anesthesiology, and surgery journals. Faculty have received funding for research from the NIH (R01 and K23 grants), FAER, and industry. Areas of investigation include mechanistic work (acute kidney injury, delirium, cognitive and functional impairment, sepsis), clinical management strategies (sedation, oxygen tension, rapid response teams, alarms and remote monitoring, cognitive and physical training, medication reconciliation), and education (simulation, 4 R01 GRANTS 5 CAREER DEVELOPMENT AWARDS 60+ PUBLICATIONS evaluation processes). 12 ACGME-accredited program Five positions available each year Core rotations include adult cardiac, thoracic, pediatric cardiac, TEE and ICU Electives include heart failure, TEE, CT for adult cardiac surgery, thoracic surgery, interventional pulmonology, electrophysiology and structural heart disease at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). A subset of the division's faculty members also provides anesthetic care for liver transplantation and critical care services in the adult cardiovascular intensive care unit. The division provides anesthetic care for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (on- and off-pump) surgery, valvular surgery, heart and lung transplantation, ECMO, adult congenital procedures, pulmonary endarterectomies, hybrid procedures, aortic surgery and ventricular assist device (V AD) insertions. VUMC tied for first place as the busiest heart transplant program by volume in the United States in 2019 and was the busiest program in the world in 2020. VUMC performed 148 heart transplants in 2020, the most of any transplant center in the world. Of the 148 transplants performed, 124 were adult hearts, 23 were pediatric hearts and one was the world's first heart- lung transplant in a COVID-19 patient. This growth in the heart transplant program is in part due to the innovative use of hearts from hepatitis C-positive donors, Donation after Circulatory Death (DCD), which expands the donor pool by 30 to 40 percent, and use of the TransMedics Organ Care System. The V AD program at Vanderbilt currently places about 50 devices per year. The division's structural heart disease program employs the newest techniques involving transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), (TEE) is an integral part of the division's clinical practice and is performed on all adult cardiac surgery patients, in electrophysiology to guide placement of left atrial appendage occlusion devices and to guide transcatheter valve procedures. With the addition of two additional state-of-art hybrid operating rooms in 2021, the division is set to further grow the structural heart disease program at VUMC. Division faculty members conduct research in vascular biology, precision perioperative medicine, acute kidney injury and the perioperative inflammatory response.

Neurosurgery and other neurologic services continue to expand at VUMC as well as the complexity of the patients and procedures. Three neurointerventionalists run a busy neurovascular service in state-of-the-art interventional hybrid operating rooms dedicated solely to neurosurgical procedures. VUMC is certified as a comprehensive stroke center and provides care for patients requiring acute stroke interventions. VUMC has designated neurosurgical operating rooms where anesthesia services are provided for operations, including brain tumors, blood vessel malformation, aneurysms, stroke intervention, trauma, complex spinal procedures, functional neurosurgery, and chronic pain management. The Division of Neuroanesthesiology also provides specialized anesthesia services for \"awake craniotomies, \" when patients are kept under sedation rather than general anesthesia to facilitate speech and motor mapping during surgery in order to preserve the most vital areas of the brain. Development and practice of evidence-based perioperative ERAS pathways and guidelines have improved patient outcomes and reduced length of ICU stay and overall hospital length of stay. The division includes five full time faculty and six CRNAs, as well as CRNAs from other divisions. Additionally, several faculty from the CCM and MSA Divisions contribute significantly to the division's work. Faculty are actively engaged in resident, medical student and allied health professional education. The division offers one Neuroanesthesiology fellowship position each year, and it is certified by the International Council on Perioperative Neurosciences Training (ICPNT). The Neuroanesthesiology faculty make significant contributions at national and international meetings, such as SNACC, SEA, IARS, AACD and NCCS, and provide leadership in these organizations. Neuroanesthesiologists face many unique challenges, including lengthy procedures (which may last more than 16 hours), unusual patient positioning and unexpected intraoperative events, such as seizures or intracranial hemorrhage. Residents on the neuroanesthesia rotation, as well as the faculty leading the training, discover that the ability to make an immediate impact on an operation and enchance the patient's long-term 1,700 SPINE SURGERIES4,000+ NEUROSURGICAL 600+ NEURO INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURES 160+ DEEP BRAIN STIMULATOR PLACEMENTS All stats based on annual numbers outcome is both exciting and gratifying. 14Multispecialty Adult Anestheisology The Division of Multispecialty Adult Anesthesiology (MSA) is the Department of Anesthesiology's largest division, providing perioperative anesthetic care in 60 operating rooms and procedure suites for a wide variety of surgical services, including general surgery, orthopedics, urology, plastic surgery, ophthalmology, vascular surgery, otolaryngology, hepatobiliary surgery, liver and renal transplantation and oral/maxillofacial surgery. The division has 55 faculty members, most of whom have significant subspecialty training and expertise. Since 2014, our Perioperative Consult Service (PCS) has provided co- management of surgical patients, beginning with the decision to operate and continuing throughout the period after hospital discharge. Starting from a pilot program involving colorectal surgical patients, the PCS has quickly grown to include care of orthopedic trauma, abdominal wall reconstruction, surgical weight loss, hepato-biliary- pancreatic/surgical oncology, gynecologic oncology and urology patients. MSA division faculty provide our anesthesiology residents a variety of both introductory and advanced clinical experiences and make numerous contributions to the department's educational programs for medical students, residents and fellows. Additionally, MSA faculty members teach and supervise residents from other specialties, as well as student registered nurse anesthetists who rotate in the MSA division. Division faculty members pursue a wide range of academic interests, including perioperative cognitive dysfunction, echocardiography, ultrasound imaging, regional anesthesia, airway management, information technology, point-of-care diagnostics and perioperative medicine, with a common goal of providing safer and more efficient perioperative care and throughput.

APS is led by Edward Y aghmour, MD, and PCS is led by Matthew McEvoy, MD. Together these services provide preoperative evaluation and preparation, intraoperative care, acute postoperative care and pain management to Vanderbilt University Hospital, Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt and the Tennessee Valley Healthcare System (TVHS) Veterans Administration Medical Center in Nashville. By providing care before, during and after surgery, these services give patients better, more personalized care throughout the entire perioperative care period. With widespread use of regional anesthesia and other opioid-sparing pain management techniques, these services have led to a more than 80 percent reduction of in-hospital opioid use and a more than 66 percent reduction in opioids prescribed at discharge. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) care pathways are evidence-based protocols designed to improve pain control and facilitate faster recovery for patients. PCS/APS is a national leader in ERAS implementation. Across the Adult, Children's and V A hospitals, the department cares for several thousand patients each year, and APS and PCS perform over 7,000 regional blocks (not including our ambulatory locations). PCS/APS continues to develop ERAS protocols that improve patient outcomes and address the common reasons for prolonged hospital length of stay. Beyond this clinical work, the clinicians routinely give presentations at national and international meetings related to ERAS and non-opioid pain management. APS and PCS at VUMC are staffed by 24 anesthesiologists, with representation from multiple divisions. APS and PCS also include 10 advanced practice providers, fellows and residents. Developing and implementing pediatric ERAS protocols are also an important focus of the Pediatric Acute Pain Service, staffed by six pediatric anesthesiologists and one pediatric pain nurse within the Division of Pediatric Anesthesiology. Though the pediatric surgical patient is quite different from the adult patient, the basic concepts of ERAS are the same. \"Setting expectations preoperatively and utilizing multimodal opioid-reducing perioperative strategies enhance the patient's experience, reduce perioperative complications and lead to earlier discharge from the hospital, \" states Drew Franklin, MD, MBA, Service Director of Pediatric Acute Pain at Children's Hospital. At the TVHS Veterans Administration Medical Center in Nashville, a perioperative care service (V A-PCS) was started in 2016 through the collaboration of the TVHS's Department of Anesthesiology, Pain Management & Perioperative Medicine and VUMC's Anesthesiology Department and Anesthesiology Critical Care Medicine Division. The staff for this service includes seven critical care anesthesiologists and eight acute care nurse practitioners. Collaborations exist with multiple departments. 7,000+ REGIONAL BLOCKS PERFORMED EACH YEAR BY APS AND PCS 3,500 PCS PATIENTS PER YEAR 15-20% REDUCTION IN COST THROUGH PCS COLLABORATIONSMultispecialty Adult Anestheisology Division Chief: Michael Pilla, MD 80%+ IN-HOSPITAL OPIOID USE & 66%+ REDUCTION IN OPIOIDS PRESCRIBED AT DISCHARGE Eight ERAS pathways have been developed since 2016. 16Obstetric Anesthesiology Division Chief: Jeanette Bauchat, MD, MS Fellowship Details ACGME-accredited program Two positions available each year Core rotations include experiences in maternal-fetal medicine and neonatology, with abundant time for research and trainingThe Division of Obstetric Anesthesiology, led by Division Chief, Jeanette Bauchat, MD, MS, provides dedicated, 24-hour, in-house obstetric anesthesia care for over 4,600 deliveries at Vanderbilt University Medical Center annually\u2014over half of the deliveries are considered high risk. The division provides a full complement of techniques for labor analgesia and operative deliveries. The faculty are consultants and critical care specialists for high-risk obstetric patients, abnormal placentation cases and intrauterine fetal surgeries. The division performs anesthesia services for gynecological surgeries in a suite of three operating rooms adjacent to the labor and delivery unit. The division faculty also assume leadership roles in quality initiatives to improve maternal health, including the use of multidisciplinary simulation training for obstetric emergencies. The division works collaboratively with other medical specialties to ensure women in the perioperative period have optimal outcomes. The division collaborates with the VUMC maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) group in caring for mothers with congenital heart defects and other co-morbidities. The obstetric anesthesiologists work with the MFM, gynecologic oncology, urology and emergency general surgery physicians in the care of patients with abnormal placentation and fetal surgery. In conjunction with the department's perioperative consult service, division faculty and staff provide anesthesia care using multimodal, enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols for gynecological cases and cesarean deliveries. The division sponsors a highly regarded, ACGME-accredited obstetric anesthesia fellowship led by Fellowship Director Holly Ende, MD.

The division's average yearly case volume is approximately 450 cardiac surgeries and 1,100 cardiac catheterizations and electrophysiologic procedures. Our program performed 23 pediatric heart transplants in 2020, ranking 3rd in the United States. Our division oversees the care of the congenital cardiac population for noncardiac operations and procedures, providing or coordinating the appropriate anesthesia care for each child. The division also provides care for the growing and increasingly complex adult cardiac population in a collaborative effort with specialists at both VUMC and Children's Hospital. Beyond the operating rooms, members of the division are involved in providing care for patients undergoing procedures in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit and are called upon for their vascular access expertise and teaching throughout Children's Hospital. The educational mission of the division is multifaceted. Pediatric anesthesiology and adult cardiothoracic anesthesiology fellows rotate on the service. Senior anesthesiology residents rotate with the service on an elective basis. The division additionally provides educational experiences to student nurse anesthetists, emergency medicine fellows, critical care fellows and pediatrics residents. Our faculty participates in departmental didactics including the pediatric anesthesia rotation lecture series, basic resident lecture series, pediatric fellow lecture series, resident and fellow journal clubs and mock oral board sessions. Division faculty members are involved in a range of research activities, with Brian Donahue, MD, PhD, serving as research mentor in both the Pediatric Anesthesiology and the Pediatric Cardiac Anesthesiology Divisions.

We plan to expand these services into the Chattanooga area in fall of 2021. The service includes 20 full-time anesthesiologists, 7 part-time anesthesiologists, 20 CRNAs, 19 nurse practitioners, 2 anesthesiology residents, 1 fellow, 7 medical instrument technicians and 7 administrative support staff. The service is heavily engaged in educational activities within TVHS as well as nationally. The TVHS Anesthesiology Service has been recognized nationally as best practice for its Perioperative Care Service, which was started in 2016. Since implementation, this service has been credited with savings in excess of $10 million/year by decreasing patient ICU and hospital length of stay to below national benchmarks. This service has also been instrumental in decreasing in-hospital and long-term opioid use by greater than 80 percent of baseline in the surgical patient population. TVHS has the only service in the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 9 that provides comprehensive complex pain management, including invasive procedures like radiofrequency ablation, spinal cord and peripheral stimulator implantation, suboxone implants and inpatient ketamine infusions for unremitting pain and detoxification. The ketamine clinic has been successful in many ways, including helping veterans wean themselves from their narcotics completely. We are working closely with the Psychiatry Service to expand the low dose ketamine infusion program for depression at our two main facilities. The service is credited with over 6,000 surgical and 5,000 non-OR procedures, 6,000 pain clinic visits, 3,500 interventional procedures and 2,500 telehealth and videoconnect visits across three campuses. In addition, the Anesthesiology Service is responsible for oversight of the facility surgical intensive care, perioperative service, Rapid Response Team, moderate sedation program and resuscitation and airway management activities. Faculty members teach at national conferences and the national simulation center, along with serving as a resource to several other facilities in key areas such as the ERAS protocols, ketamine infusion program for complex chronic pain and opioid detoxification, laborVeterans Affairs Anesthesiology Service PROVIDES ANESTHESIA SERVICES FOR OVER 125,000 VETERANS A YEAR 9,500 PAIN CLINIC & INTERVENTIONAL VISITS 6,000 OR PROCEDURES 5,000 NON- OR PROCEDURES 2,500 TELEHEAL TH AND VIDEOCONNECT VISITS mapping and workload capture. Nurse Anesthetists Chief: Brent Dunworth, CRNA, DNP , MBA The Vanderbilt University Medical Center Department of Anesthesiology continues to set the nationwide standard for true collaborative practice and innovation in its approach to patient care, involving anesthesiologists and residents, certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), student registered nurse anesthetists (SRNAs) and anesthesia technicians. Serving as Chief CRNA and Director of Advanced Practice in Anesthesiology, Brent Dunworth, CRNA, DNP DNAP , serves as the Associate Chief CRNA. The past year was one of tremendous clinical growth for Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

The Center for Experiential Learning and Assessment Under the leadership of Arna Banerjee, MBBS, CELA offers medical learners at all levels a simulation education on computerized, life-like mannequins. CELA was endorsed by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) as one of approximately 40 centers in the nation officially approved to deliver certified educational programs. Anesthesiologists can receive continuing medical education (CME) simulation training at CELA that qualifies for American Board of Anesthesiology Maintenance of Certification in Anesthesiology (MOCA\u00ae) credit. To achieve the ASA endorsement, the CELA program met strict criteria, which includes having strong leadership and the necessary equipment, facilities and personnel to provide consistent, effective training. Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG) ASPIRE (Anesthesiology Performance Improvement and Reporting Exchange) Quality Improvement Project ASPIRE is the quality improvement (QI) arm of the MPOG. The goal is to improve the care of patients undergoing anesthesia by reducing unexplained variation in practice and collaborating with anesthesia providers to define best practices. Participating sites work together to build quality measures, review best practices and exchange ideas for improving patient outcome. ASPIRE has developed numerous quality measures, spanning several anesthesia care domains . The Department of Anesthesiology at VUMC joined MPOG ASPIRE in 2020 and has the full support of departmental leaders. In an effort to mobilize resources and develop a cohesive plan for implementation of ASPIRE quality measures department wide, the ASPIRE Task Force, led by Miklos Kertai, MD, PhD, was created. The task force identified 3 Adult specific measures and 3 Pediatric specific measures on which a QI project would initially focus. Of note, there are 22 ASPIRE measures that have been identified. A key component of ASPIRE includes monthly feedback emails showing departmental compliance with ASPIRE measures and then later provider level performance data. The project vision and timeline were introduced at Grand Rounds in January of 2021 to department groups: attending physicians, CRNAs, fellows, residents and SRNAs. Ultimately, this QI project will improve patient care with the delivery of detailed feedback to anesthesia providers. In addition, the provision of education that is ASPIRE measure specific will further enhance best practices in anesthesia.

His group works to better understand the entire spectrum of volume status through translational research of venous waveforms and device development. NIV A developed to optimize hemodynamic assessment in three key ways: signal capture using non-invasive wrist sensor, signal deconstruction by mapping individual amplitudes within a patient's waveform, and signal decoding using NIV A. Fredric T. (Josh) Billings IV , MD, MSCI The research program of Frederic T. (Josh) Billings IV is supported by several NIH grants. He is focused on developing new therapy for perioperative organ injury by evaluating and affecting mechanisms of surgery-induced organ injury. His research includes surgical patients and their tissues, preclinical models, and clinical trials. Broadly this includes studying and manipulating the patient response to acute surgical stress, but specifically he is investigating the impact of variable oxygen administration on putative mechanisms of organ injury. These mechanisms include excess production of reactive oxygen species, impaired vascular function, and heme-protein mediated tissue damage. His group studies the impact of oxygen on these processes so that they can determine the optimal oxygen administration throughout the perioperative period to reduce organ injury. This addresses a large unmet need for millions of patients, because oxygen administration during surgery is highly variable, unguided, often excessive, and potentially harmful. Julia Bohannon, PhD Julia Bohannon's NIGMS-funded research seeks to understand how severe burn injury impacts innate immune cell metabolism and mitochondrial function, leading to greater susceptibility to infection in these patients. Her lab is investigating toll-like receptor signaling pathways and how these pathways can be harnessed for therapeutic benefit in restoring immunometabolic dysfunction after severe burn to enhance resistance to infection. Using mouse models of burn injury and infection, as well as immune cells collected from human burn patients, her lab is studying the therapeutic impact of toll-like receptor agonists on improving immune function and protection against infection after severe burn injury. Stephen Bruehl, PhD Stephen Bruehl's lab is supported by NIH funding to study topics related to pain and opioid risks. Ongoing projects are examining the role of oxidative stress mechanisms in long-term pain outcomes following total knee arthroplasty (R01AG048915), evaluating the mechanisms underlying effects of mindfulness training and spinal manipulation therapy on chronic low back pain (R01AT009680), and testing whether endogenous opioid and endocannabinoid mechanisms contribute to associations between stress and increased opioid misuse risk (R01DA050334). Eric Delpire, PhD Eric Delpire's research is funded by two NIH grants and a Leducq Foundation network for excellence grant, the goal of which is to expand the NIH funded research. He studies the regulation of transporters involved in salt reabsorption in kidney by protein kinases and adaptor proteins. The kinases serve as rheostats stimulating sodium reabsorption in conditions of potassium deficiency. The research also involves cotransporters involved in the control and maintenance of cell volume. Jerod Denton, PhD The Denton laboratory has several NIH-funded programs aimed broadly at the molecular pharmacology and structure- function relationships of ion channels. Three funded programs employ high-throughput screening of small-molecule libraries, medicinal chemistry, and voltage clamp electrophysiology to develop first-in-class inhibitors of potassium channels expressed in the kidney (Kir4.1/5.1), sperm (SLO3), and vascular smooth muscle cells (Kir6.1/SUR2B) to explore their therapeutic potential for hypertension/edema, contraceptive targets, and treatment of patent ductus arteriosis, respectively. A newly funded 5-year R01 will leverage LRRC8 channel chimeras to explore structure-function relations of volume using single-particle MD, MS, MSCI For his K23 award from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Robert Freundlich is studying the use of novel clinical informatics tools to conduct pragmatic clinical trials. He is focusing on a pragmatic clinical trial to prevent reintubation after cardiac surgery. In addition to his research interests, he has completed his Master of Science in Clinical Investigation (MSCI) as well as obtained board certification in clinical informatics over the course of the K23 funding period. He plans to use these skills and experience in the future to conduct additional pragmatic clinical trials leveraging the electronic health record. Brad Grueter, PhD The nucleus accumbens is an essential hub in the reward system, integrating cognitive, contextual, sensory, and affective information into behavioral outcomes. The proposed work will test the hypothesis that feed forward microcircuits within the nucleus accumbens regulate motivated behavior and are hijacked by drugs of abuse. By defining circuits and synaptic mechanisms recruited by drugs of abuse, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH and NIDA 's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burdens of addiction. 35NIH Funded Research Antonio Hernandez, MD, MSCI, FCCM, FASE Antonio Hernandez is studying synthetic toll-like receptor 4 agonist to induce trained immunity for the purposes of augmenting the innate immune response against severe sepsis and nosocomial pneumonia and preserving organ function during renal ischemia. His work is focused on clinically relevant models of infection and injury, with a goal of reducing nosocomial infection in post-operative and critically ill patient populations, and preservation of organ function. These studies are funded by the NIH Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) K08 123345. He is mentored by Edward Sherwood. Christopher Hughes, MD, MS, FCCM Christopher Hughes has funding from the National Institute on Aging to evaluate whether a pragmatic program combining computerized cognitive training and physical training throughout the perioperative period will improve long-term cognitive and disability outcomes in older patients having major surgery. Additionally, he will be evaluating mechanisms of impairment through blood biomarkers and brain magnetic resonance imaging. In separate funding from the National Institute on Aging, Dr. Hughes is evaluating the alpha2-agonist guanfacine as treatment for delirium in critically ill patients, including whether it can improve hospital course and post- discharge outcomes. Marcos Lopez, MD, MS For his K23 award, Marcos Lopez has designed and performed experiments to measure vascular reactivity and oxidative damage in patients having cardiac surgery recruited into a randomized clinical trial of oxygen treatment during cardiac surgery. He is testing the hypotheses that 1) normoxia during cardiac surgery improves endothelial function compared to hyper-oxygenation and that intraoperative oxidative stress correlates with postoperative endothelial dysfunction, 2) arterioles isolated from mediastinal fat collected from subjects randomized to normoxia have superior endothelium- dependent and -independent vascular reactivity compared to those from hyperoxygenated subjects, and 3) that perioperative endothelial dysfunction is associated with postoperative kidney and brain injury. His goal is to identify novel mechanisms of perioperative organ injury in order to improve prevention and to identify novel treatments. Edward Sherwood, MD, PhD Vaccines, which act by priming the adaptive immune system to induce highly specific, long-lived resistance to infection, are among the greatest advances in medicine. Recent studies show that the innate immune system also retains memory of prior pathogen exposure and becomes primed to elicit a robust, broad-spectrum antimicrobial response to subsequent infection. Research by the Sherwood lab shows that treatment with TLR4 ligands, such as monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), confers innate immune memory and resistance to a broad array of clinically important pathogens. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving innate immune memory are poorly understood. The Sherwood lab has shown that remodeling of macrophage metabolism is essential to generating innate immune memory. Ongoing NIH-funded research in the Sherwood lab is designed to determine how metabolic reprogramming drives innate immune memory in macrophages and determine the ability of diverse microbial ligands to induce innate immune memory. The goal of this research is to develop new drugs that can treat and prevent infections in vulnerable patient populations. Heidi Smith, MD, MSCI, FAAP Heidi Smith has funding from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to determine whether sedation impacts the prevalence of delirium, length of mechanical ventilation, and development of long-term cognitive impairment or post- traumatic stress symptoms. Ventilated pediatric patients are frequently over-sedated, and the majority suffer from delirium, a form of acute brain dysfunction that is an independent predictor of increased risk of dying, length of stay, and hospital costs. Universally prescribed sedative medications\u2014the GABA- ergic benzodiazepines\u2014worsen this brain organ dysfunction and independently prolong duration of ventilation and ICU stay, and the available alternative sedation regimen using dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 agonist, has been shown to be superior to benzodiazepines in adults and may mechanistically impact outcomes through positive effects on innate immunity, bacterial clearance, apoptosis, cognition, and delirium. The mini- MENDS trial will compare dexmedetomidine and midazolam and determine the best sedative medication to reduce delirium and improve duration of ventilation and functional, psychiatric, and cognitive recovery in our most vulnerable patients\u2014 survivors of pediatric critical illness. Loren Smith, MD, PhD Loren Smith's long-term research goal is to diminish postoperative organ injury and improve patient outcomes by developing novel methods of perioperative protection, particularly lipoprotein-based therapies. Dr. Smith's research team demonstrated a novel association between preoperative high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration and a decreased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery and demonstrated that statin exposure strengthens the association between a high preoperative HDL concentration and a decreased risk of AKI after cardiac surgery. Smith continues to investigate the perioperative role of lipoproteins in the prevention of postoperative organ injury and as a systemic signaling mechanism during acute stress. Her translational research program utilizes clinical research studies in surgical patients, in vivo mouse models, and in vitro experimental techniques. 36VUMC's Center for Research and Innovation in Systems Safety (CRISS), directed by Matt Weinger, MD, is a highly interdisciplinary and collaborative center, with projects spanning numerous clinical domains and disciplines. Using a range of human factors, usability and systems engineering, cognitive psychology, and implementation science techniques, CRISS studies performance during patient care and in realistic simulations to better understand how and why care deviates from optimal, then designs and studies interventions to improve care safety and quality. CRISS investigators include anesthesiologists, PhD researchers, nursing and design staff, and faculty collaborators across Health Sciences and in the School of Engineering. CRISS is particularly interested in designing and evaluating medical technologies and the use of electronically generated clinical data to identify evolving events and support decision-making. CRISS explores the nature of expertise, clinician communication, situational awareness, the workload and stress of individual clinicians and of teams, teamwork, individual and group performance-shaping factors, alarms, human-technology interactions and novel methods of information presentation to improve care processes and outcomes. CRISS provides internal and external consulting services for numerous customers. At VUMC, CRISS faculty and staff currently provide support for a number of health informatics and quality improvement initiatives. CRISS conducts formal usability testing of software applications and of medical devices. Externally, CRISS is involved in numerous academic collaborations to re-engineer medical processes, improve clinician decision-making and enhance the usability and usefulness of clinical technology. For example, CRISS has provided more than a dozen years of support to the Department of Veterans Affairs to improve its national EHR system, including the development, testing and implementation of decision support tools in several clinical domains. CRISS also helped to create a national standardized approach to human factors and user-centered design in V A healthcare.

The committee oversees the development and conduct of industry-sponsored and investigator-initiated research by providing guidance to assure optimal study design and protocol development as well as managing essential research services and programs. The mission of V ACRAC is to: Promote a culture of large and robust clinical trials that would, in turn, provide high-quality evidence to inform perioperative practice nation-wide. Promote high-quality, high-impact clinical research tailored to the experience and expertise of individual clinicians and accessible to all members of the department. Create opportunities for junior investigators to learn the process of clinical research. Mentor investigators throughout the research development and implementation process. Promote Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and ensure regulatory compliance. V ACRAC is co-chaired by Edward Sherwood, MD, PhD (Vice Chair for Research), David McIlroy, MB.BS., MD, MClinEpi (Medical Director, Perioperative Clinical Research Institute), Pratik Pandharipande, MD, MSCI (Vice Chair for Faculty Affairs), and Matthew Shotwell, PhD (Department of Biostatistics). The committee's membership is composed of established clinical investigators in the Department of Anesthesiology. Any member of the Department of Anesthesiology may submit a clinical research proposal as a 1-page on-line submission including a brief background to the clinical problem, a primary hypothesis for testing, and the likely significance of the result of the proposed study. All proposals undergo rapid review by a small research committee, with written feedback provided, including a traffic- light style triage system and advice on what may be required to advance the project. Resource intensive projects are typically triaged into a more intensive V ACRAC studio where investigators present their proposals to senior clinical researchers within the department for real-time discussion and dialogue aimed at refining the study methodology. Currently active studies included a mix of funded and unfunded studies, investigator-initiated and industry-sponsored studies, single-center and multi-center clinical trials, observational and retrospective studies. The department and institution strongly support the initiation, development and execution of large pragmatic trials. Recent or current clinical trials with which we are involved include the multicenter REGAIN trial of general anesthesia vs regional anesthesia after hip fracture, the single- center COPE-iOS trial testing the effectiveness of cognitive and physical exercise to improve outcomes after surgery, a single-center study of pharmaco-genomic guided beta-blocker administration in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, large pragmatic trials of intraoperative ketamine and high-flow nasal cannula to PhD38The Benjamin Howard Robbins Scholar Program was initiated in 2007 to support the professional development of department early-stage physician-scientists. The program builds critical research skills under direct mentorship of established scientists with the goal that all Robbins Scholars establish vigorous, independently funded research programs. The program is named in honor of the department's first chairman, a renowned physician-scientist. The BH Robbins Scholar Program is multidisciplinary, encouraging and supporting mentorships and collaborations that extend well beyond traditional boundaries of anesthesia. Scholars apply and are rewarded on a competitive basis. Department Chair Warren Sandberg, MD, PhD, notes, \"The BH Robbins Scholar Program provides a unique mentored research experience for early-stage investigators that includes a two-year multidisciplinary fellowship devoted to research. Our Robbins Scholars benefit from one-on-one mentorship, a wealth of research and educational resources, protected research time and a stipend during their residency and fellowship.

The major pillars of AFA are faculty development, engagement and well-being through: Academic appointments and promotions The Career Development Award (CDA) and Academic Achievement Award (AAA) programs Annual faculty reviews Mentorship program Wellness and support initiatives Communication skills program (CLARITY) Our Mission The mission of AFA is to encourage professional development and advancement, while supporting service to the department, institution, specialty and society, and to advocate for and facilitate a fulfilling work experience. AFA 's vision is that all faculty members in the department will attain their full potential in their professional careers. We hope to achieve this vision ensuring that all faculty members are empowered to contribute to excellence according to their unique interests and roles across the tripartite mission of clinical, academic and educational practice. We aim to foster faculty members' sense of meaning and purpose, connection to their calling and sense of belonging in the VUMC professional community. Our Key Functions Since its start in 2008, AFA has grown to encompass a broad range of functions in support of the department's faculty. Some AFA functions occur at specific times each academic year while other functions are ongoing, as shown in the Professional Development Cycle figure.Office of Anesthesiology Faculty Affairs MAY JUN JULY AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC JAN FEB MAR APRGOALSPROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT CYCLE CLINICAL EXCELLENCE EDUCATION SCHOLARSHIP SERVICE YEAR-LONG PROGRAMS APPOINTMENTS & PROMOTIONS, MENTORSHIP PROGRAM, CLARITY, AND WELLNESSANNUAL A&P COMMITTEE RETREAT: REVIEW OF ALL FACULTY AAA DISTRIBUTIONS: REVIEW OF RESULTS AT FACULTY MEETING DIVISON CHIEFS REVIEW CDA REQUESTS WITH FACULTYANNUAL CDA MEETINGCDA LETTERS SENTSPRING A&P COMMITTEE MEETING CDA REVIEW PROCESS ANNUAL FACULTY REVIEW MEETINGSCV UPDATESACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AWARD (AAA) APPLICATIONS AAA REVIEW PROCESSSUBMISSIONS of Anesthesiology Faculty Affairs Appointments and Promotions AFA oversees the critical functions of evaluating and approving initial faculty appointments as well as subsequent promotions and career track changes. This function is executed by the department's Appointments and Promotions Committee (APC), which annually assesses each faculty member's academic and career progress. The APC votes to recommend faculty to enter the promotion process that leads to the submission of a promotion packet to the School of Medicine for consideration. All full professors in the Educator or Scientist tracks are eligible to serve on the APC. The APC generally has 12-14 members who are selected by the AFA Vice Chair to serve staggered three-year terms to ensure fair repre - sentation across divisions. Career Development Award (CDA) Program The CDA Program aims to provide clinical faculty with academic and administrative days, allowing dedicated time to advance their careers, achieve success in administrative roles and contribute to the missions of the department and institution beyond direct patient care. Each year, faculty submit CDA applications based on their planned administrative, educational, scholarship and academic service goals. The CDA Committee, consisting of APC members and the department's division chiefs, uses an NIH-style grant review process to evaluate the applications. After an initial review, the CDA Committee meets to discuss all applications via a transparent process based on published guidelines, considerering prior success of faculty and alignment with departmental missions. The resulting CDA allocation recommendations are reviewed and approved by the department chair. Academic Achievement Award (AAA) Program The AAA Program provides annual merit-based financial incentives to encourage professional development and academic achievement. It recognizes faculty contributions to the department's numerous missions beyond direct patient care, especially in the areas of education, scholarship and professional service. Annual Faculty Reviews AFA coordinates annual faculty reviews, a time to celebrate faculty successes, identify challenges and provide faculty an opportunity to discuss career goals with senior departmental leadership. An individual letter is generated based on the meeting that includes summative feedback and specific recommendations. The objective is to create individualized career development plans aligned with each faculty member's unique career goals and to maximize support for well-being of faculty. Mentorship Program A new departmental mentorship program was introduced by AFA in FY21 to pair faculty with mentors aligned with their desired career development path. The mentorship program is based on approximately 50 scholarly hubs within the department, which are arranged thematically into affinity groups that cover broad areas of basic science, education, quality improvement, clinical research, systems engineering, informatics, clinical operations, genomics and clinical and administrative service. A tiered approach through which hub mentors are assigned senior mentors serves to boost the efficacy of the program. At time of publication, 53 faculty have had initial and follow-up quarterly meetings with their assigned mentors to outline steps for career advancement. Wellness and Support Initiatives Faculty in an academic medical center have extremely demanding jobs with associated stressors that can degrade well-being and disrupt work-life integration. To address these pressures, our office is supported by Dr. Amanda Stone, PhD, clinical psychology, who serves as our Faculty Wellness Director. AFA works to identify and address issues related to the well-being of faculty and has designed wellness initiatives that include strategies to address burnout and a webpage of wellness resources and opportunities for support. CLARITY CLARITY is a departmental program designed to enhance the written and oral communication skills of clinicians, researchers and staff\u2014from faculty and fellows to managers and administrative staff.

The products are costly to patients \u2014 as high as $15,000 on top of the expense of a transplant. And they are sometimes not well accepted in patients because they degrade over time and are derived from multiple patients. The best blood, of course, is always one's own, said Clayne Benson, MD, director of liver transplant anesthesia at the Vanderbilt Transplant Center. Benson is pioneering new approaches to conserve blood products by better utilizing a patient's own blood, which has the potential to improve outcomes in patients, cut health care costs and conserve the limited supply of donated blood \u2014 especially important in the time of COVID-19, when occasional shortages of products have occurred. One approach Benson is studying is Acute Normovolemic Hemodilution (ANH), which is used for liver transplant patients who come into the operating room with adequate red blood cell and platelet counts and whose blood is clotting properly. \"We will take their own blood out of them and replace that blood with other fluids, like generic fluids we use, \" said Benson, assistant professor of Clinical Anesthesiology. \"Y ou dilute out the blood that is left and so when they bleed that diluted blood, you're not wasting much. And when they need their own blood back, you give it back to them. That allows you to give a smaller amount of blood products from the blood banks, so less foreign blood is used.\"We've been able to show that you can do that, and you can save money and foreign blood. \" Though it is being studied in the liver transplant population, the method could also be useful for other organ transplants and trauma cases requiring large blood transfusions, Benson said. Kara Siegrist, MD, assistant professor, Cardiothoracic Anesthesiology Division, has been working alongside Benson in the ANH research. \"The ANH project is just one example of the advancements in exemplary patient care we strive to achieve to provide the best, safest and most cost-effective health care to some of the sickest patients in the hospital, \" she said. \"With the volume of liver transplants we do at VUMC, even little cost savings on an individual level can add up to big savings for the hospital system. I'm proud to be part of such a wonderful multidisciplinary team of physicians and nurses all working together for the good of our patients. \" Benson's interest in blood product conservation was inspired by necessity, when he served in the Special Operations Surgical Team (SOST) in the Air Force about a decade ago. The team served injured military personnel in the field, such as in Afghanistan, where the traditional assortment of blood products are not available. In that situation, medics would take blood from other soldiers whose blood matched the injured, which is fresh and not degraded. That experience piqued his interest in applying those lessons to the hospital setting. Another area of study is retrieving the blood of organ donors to go along with organs at the time they are retrieved, then transfusing the blood into donors' bodies, which is not typically done today. Benson noted that VUMC is part of a multicenter study of a device called TransMedics, affectionately known as Heart in a Box. Blood from heart transplant patients is retrieved at the time the heart is removed and then perfused into the organ en route to VUMC for transplant. Preliminary data shows the hearts can be preserved longer before transplant, expanding the supply of organs. Benson foresees expanding that program to livers. \" All these things require a team, \" Benson said. \"I've been lucky to have on the surgical side, Sophaclis Alexopoulos, MD, chief of Liver Transplantation, who has been very supportive of all of these things, in addition to all the surgeons on the team. When I first became the director of liver transplant anesthesia, we didn't do ANH, but some team members on the anesthesia side were enthusiastic about it, as well as some of the surgeons. But it took some time and once they saw the benefit of it, then they were all on board. \" The Liver Transplant Anesthesia team includes, from left, Clayne Benson, MD, Kevin Furman, DO, Philip Leisy, MD, and Kara Siegrist, MD. (Photo by Erin O. Smith)55From article by Nancy Humphrey originally published in the VUMC Reporter on Jan. 14, 2021 Following a Thanksgiving surge that led to record numbers of admissions of patients with COVID-19, residents and fellows from multiple disciplines have come together under the direction and supervision of critical care attendings to provide the best care to critically ill patients in Vanderbilt University Medical Center's COVID-19 Intensive Care Unit. In addition to the physicians and nurses staffing the unit on the eighth floor of Medical Center East, fellows and residents from at least 12 programs, including Pulmonary Critical Care, Cardiovascular Medicine, Anesthesiology Critical Care, Anesthesiology and Surgery, as well as residents from other programs provide additional support to the Medical Intensive Care Surge Team. \" As physicians we are trained to meet patients where patient needs are, and we don't always get to define that. I've been very proud of these residents and fellows who have stepped up to care for patients in a global crisis, \" said Kyla Terhune, MD, MBA, associate professor of Surgery and Anesthesiology, vice president of Educational Affairs and associate dean for Graduate Medical Education. \"In some ways it's a historical opportunity to serve as a physician and provides a great deal of learning, but it's certainly also a tragedy and not what anyone anticipated or wanted. For those residents and fellows where it falls within their educational curriculum and skills, they are appropriately contributing the most - but they need support when the patient numbers surge like this, \" she said. Greg Roop, MD, a third-year Anesthesiology resident, left his pediatric anesthesia rotation when he was asked by a chief resident to help staff the COVID-19 ICU during Thanksgiving week. He was paired first with a Pulmonary Critical Care fellow, then with a Cardiology fellow after that. \" Anesthesiology residents are uniquely positioned to transfer into this type of care \u2014 so much of what we do in the OR can be transitioned to the ICU setting particularly in terms of ventilator management and hemodynamics, \" Roop said. \"The transition was great. I have to give a lot of credit to the pulmonary critical care faculty and staff and the entire internal medicine department. They realize that residents from other specialties don't necessarily care for these patients all the time and they were very patient as they taught us how to manage them. The credit goes to them for their patience and being willing to share their knowledge with us. \" Roop said his experience left a positive impact upon his training as a physician. Working with others from other specialties and seeing how they approach a situation was invaluable. It was an opportunity to learn in ways he never imagined. \"It was really interesting for me to interact with Pulmonary Critical Care faculty and fellows. While every specialty has the best interest of the patient in mind, we all approach these problems from different perspectives. \" Roop said while there was \"some fear of the unknown\" in caring for patients critically ill with COVID-19, he feels grateful to have contributed to their care. \"It's a very unique situation and it was definitely a challenge. We're navigating the unknown and we have to put our heads together and try to come up with different ways to treat these patients, \" he said. \"The clinical course of some of them was unlike anything I had seen previously, and it's like our hands were tied a bit. But I am very honored toResidents, fellows step up to help care for COVID patients Anesthesiology resident Greg Roop, MD, is among the group of fellows and residents from numerous programs to provide additional support to the Medical Intensive Care Surge Team.

His research has focused on a small number of proteins that carry ions across the membranes of cells. This is relevant to the way neurons communicate with each other and the transport of molecules between different body compartments across epithelia. His latest efforts involve understanding the structure and relevant features of these transporters. In 2015, a mother of a young girl suffering from many ailments reached out to Delpire. The young girl had a mutation in NKCC1, which is one of the transporters he is studying. She discovered Delpire's name associated with many publications when she googled the transporter. \"For her, I was providing many pieces of information that possibly explained her daughter's condition. For me, she was introducing me to an opportunity to expand my research, \" he said. This expanded research focused on understanding the mutation's effect on the transporter. This led to NIH funding, the creation of new mouse models, and a half dozen publications. Delpire has met the family on two occasions to connect. \"They know the basic research I do is unlikely to cure or save their daughter, but they are grateful for the research that tries to better understand the relationship between the mutant transporter and the disease, \" he said. He is now in contact with many mothers since uncovering several additional cases after the release of his first report in 2016. Delpire said he is grateful for this recognition and his association with research that focuses on human health. Delpire said the Department of Anesthesiology and its leadership do a lot to make him feel supported in his research. Even though the department is a clinical one, a majority of faculty support the mission of basic science. The institution also supports basic science research. Delpire holds the first BH Robbins Directorship in Anesthesiology Research, which was awarded by the institution in 2017. \"I am also very grateful for the endowed directorship given to me knowing that it took commitment, time, and energy for the department to accumulate the necessary funds for the directorship to be established. This allows me to expand my funded research and to investigate new research avenues, \" Delpire said. Rather than point to a specific high point, he is most proud of the expertise he has accumulated. His career is a slow progression with well-defined interests and goals. \"The beauty of science is that nothing is ever completed. Even as an expert, I still learn every day, and that keeps me going with Eric Delpire's lab studies biological membranes and their impermeability to water, small molecules, and ions. (Photo by Jenelle Grewell) with both strength and humility. \" 57By Jenelle Grewell Amanda Stone, PhD, joined the Department of Anesthesiology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in 2018 as research faculty investigating psychological factors influencing pediatric pain. Since then, she has also taken on the role of the department's Wellness Director. In May of 2021, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development awarded Stone a K23, which will last until April 2026. This mentored career development award funds both advanced training and a research project evaluating parent and child factors, such as beliefs about medications or anxiety that may influence opioid use at home following pediatric adenotonsillectomy procedures. \"This award will allow me to further my training in advanced statistical models, pediatric acute pain care, communicating research results to public audiences, and leading an interdisciplinary research team, \" she said. The Department of Anesthesiology supported Stone in earning her K23 in several ways. Her primary mentor, Stephen Bruehl, PhD, provided guidance, training in a new research area (individual differences in responses to opioid analgesics), publication opportunities, and critical feedback throughout the grant writing process. The department provided her training opportunities such the B.H. Robbins Program and T32. The Perioperative Clinical Research Institute collected pilot data for her K23 applications and provided administrative support for the grant submission process. Stone earned both her master of science and her doctorate at Vanderbilt University. When Stone was a graduate student, her mentor was Lynn Walker, PhD, who at the time was the division director for Adolescent and Y oung Adult Health in the Department of Pediatrics. She has one of the longest running NIH funded research careers in the U.S. for pediatric pain. Bruehl was involved as a co-investigator on her last few grants, which allowed him to serve as a second mentor. \" At my dissertation defense, Walker made it clear to the committee that she would like to find a way for me to come back to VUMC on faculty. She was planning to retire and wanted someone to continue her legacy. Bruehl saw this as a potential opportunity to grow his lab in the Department of Anesthesiology, \" she said. She has several responsibilities in her role as Wellness Director for the department. She provides consultation to faculty and leadership on ways to facilitate wellness in the professional environment, serves as a liaison with VUMC wellness initiatives, helps facilitate quarterly trainings in conjunction with the Office of Anesthesiology Faculty Affairs, and is available to provide resources to department members who have wellness related questions. \"By definition, wellness refers to the quality or state of being healthy in body and mind, especially as the result of deliberate effort . It is important to recognize and intentionally address both systems level factors and individual factors contributing to wellness, \" she said. Stone's background as a pediatric psychologist trained her at the intersection of healthcare, family systems, and mental health. She thinks about how social and environmental contexts people operate within influence health. In turn, people exert influence on these social and environmental contexts, affecting the health of the system or organization. Catherine Clark, Senior Program Manager, Office of Anesthesiology Faculty Affairs, said Stone's role has allowed the office to expand on the enhancement of the engagement and development of the department's faculty. \"Our mission involves considering the impact of our programs and decisions from multiple perspectives, \" Clark said. \"So, it is important to have Stone's lens for the ways we can account for the mental and emotional health and well-being of our faculty. Not only mitigating stress and burnout but providing support that translates to higher job satisfaction and realization of career goals, including that of ever-improving patient outcomes. \" Stone has also facilitated and helped equip others to facilitate a number of group discussions within the department over the past year related to wellness during COVID-19 and important department initiatives like diversity and inclusion.
