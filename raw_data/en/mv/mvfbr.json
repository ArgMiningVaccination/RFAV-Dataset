Federal government websites often end in .gov or .mil. Before sharing sensitive information, make sure you're on a federal government site. The site is secure. The https:// ensures that you are connecting to the official website and that any information you provide is encrypted and transmitted securely. Please contact your Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC). MACs can be found in the [MAC Contacts Report](https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/reports/local-coverage-mac-contacts-report.aspx?contractType=all&stateRegion=all&contractorName=all&contractorNumber=all). For the most part, codes are no longer included in the LCD (policy). You will find them in the Billing & Coding Articles. Try using the [MCD Search](https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/new-search/search.aspx) to find what you're looking for. Enter the code you're looking for in the \"Enter keyword, code, or document ID\" box. The list of results will include documents which contain the code you entered. Please Note: For Durable Medical Equipment (DME) MACs only, CPT/HCPCS codes remain located in LCDs. All other Codes (ICD-10, Bill Type, and Revenue) have moved to Articles for DME MACs, as they have for the other Local Coverage MAC types. NCDs do not contain claims processing information like diagnosis or procedure codes nor do they give instructions to the provider on how to bill Medicare for the service or item. For this supplementary claims processing information we rely on other CMS publications, namely Change Requests (CR) Transmittals and inclusions in the Medicare Fee-For-Service Claims Processing Manual (CPM). In order for CMS to change billing and claims processing systems to accommodate the coverage conditions within the NCD, we instruct contractors and system maintainers to modify the claims processing systems at the national or local level through CR Transmittals. CRs are not policy, rather CRs are used to relay instructions regarding the edits of the various claims processing systems in very descriptive, technical language usually employing the codes or code combinations likely to be encountered with claims subject to the policy in question. As clinical or administrative codes change or system or policy requirements dictate, CR instructions are updated to ensure the systems are applying the most appropriate claims processing instructions applicable to the policy. Enter the CPT/HCPCS code in the [MCD Search](https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/new-search/search.aspx) and select your state from the drop down. (You may have to accept the AMA License Agreement.) Look for a Billing and Coding Article in the results and open it. (Or, for DME MACs only, look for an LCD.) Review the article, in particular the Coding Information section. If you need more information on coverage, contact the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) who published the document. The contractor information can be found at the top of the document in the Contractor Information section (expand the section to see the details). If you don't find the Article you are looking for, [contact your MAC](https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/reports/local-coverage-mac-contacts-report.aspx?contractType=all&stateRegion=all&contractorName=all&contractorNumber=all). Was your Medicare claim denied? Here are some hints to help you find more information: 1) Check out the Beneficiary card on the [MCD Search](https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/new-search/search.aspx) page. 2) Try using the [MCD Search](https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/new-search/search.aspx) and enter your information in the \"Enter keyword, code, or document ID\" box. Your information could include a keyword or topic you're interested in; a Local Coverage Determination (LCD) policy or Article ID; or a CPT/HCPCS procedure/billing code or an ICD-10-CM diagnosis code. Try entering any of this type of information provided in your denial letter. 3) Contact your [MAC](https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/reports/local-coverage-mac-contacts-report.aspx?contractType=all&stateRegion=all&contractorName=all&contractorNumber=all). 4) Visit [Medicare.gov ](#)or call 1-800-Medicare.
