Thank youfor hearing me, and and HR154 because itisawaste ofvaluable state resources. Additional labeling requirements ofgenetically engineered will just addcost toallfarmers, wholesalers, andretailers. Genetically engineered foods onthe market have nodifferent stories oftobacco, asbestos, andDDT. Originally declared safe, they caused widespread death anddisease.Although their impact wasvast, most ofthepopulation wasspared. The same cannot change occurred alittle over adecade agowhen genetically modified (GM) crops were introduced. Their influence onhealth hasbeen largely ignored, butrecent studies show serious problems. Genetically modified organisms (GMO5) have been linked tothousands oftoxic orallergic-type reactions, thousands of sick, sterile, anddead livestock, anddamage tovirtually every organ andsystem studied inlabanimals.' Nearly every independent animal feeding safety study shows adverse orunexplained effects. GM foods were made possible byatechnology developed inthe 1970s whereby genes from onespecies areforced intotheDNA of other species. Genes produce proteins, which intum cangenerate characteristics ortraits. Thepromised traits associated with GMOs have been skyhigh\u2014vegetables growing inthedesert, vitamin fortified grains, andhighly productive crops feeding and/or pesticide production. Herbicide tolerant soy, corn, cotton, andcanola plants areengineered with bacterial genes thatallow them tosurvive otherwise deadly doses ofherbicides. This gives farmers more flexibility inweeding andgives theGM seed company lotsmore profit. sign acontract tobuyonly thatseed producer's disease resistant GMHawaiian papaya, well under acreage. THE FDA'S \"NON-REGULATION\" OFGM FOODS Rhetoric government since theearly 1990s proclaims thatGMfoods arenodifferent from their natural counterparts forcenturies. (FDA) haslabeled bethesubject amount ofpeer-reviewed studies (orequivalent) issues attheFDA from 1979 \"Inthisarea, todoandtoldthem todo.\" TheAgbiotech company with thegreatest influence was clearly Monsanto. According totheNew York Times, \"What Monsanto wished forfrom Washington, Monsanto and,byextension, its foods House anunusually generous policy ofself-policing.\" oversaw itsdevelopment wastheFDA's Deputy Commissioner forPolicy, Michael Taylor, whose position had been created especially forhimin1991. Prior tothat, Taylor was anoutside attorney forboth Taylor's GMO policy needed tocreate theimpression thatunintended effects from GM crops were notanissue. Otherwise their GRAS status would beundermined andtheywould need theextensive testing andlabels that arenormally required Butinternal memos made public from alawsuit showed thattheoverwhelming among theagency scientists wasthatGM crops hard-to-detect Various departments spelled outindetail, listing allergies, toxins, nutritional effects, andnew diseases aspotential dangers. They urged superiors torequire long-term safety studies.3 Inspite ofthewarnings, according topublic interest Druker theFDA's internal files, \"References totheunintended negative effects ofbioengineering were from drafts statement (over theprotests ofagency scientists).\"4 tothescientific notonly their existence Theofficial FDA policy stated, \"The agency isnot aware ofanyinformation showing thatfoods derived bythese other foods inanymeaningful oruniform way.\"6 Insharp contrast, aninternal crops willreceive thesame consideration forpotential health risks asanyother new crop plant. This stance istaken despite good reasons tobelieve thatspecific risks may exist. ...Governments should never have allowed these products intothefood chain without insisting onrigorous testing foreffects with precautionary regulation ofthetechnology.\" to 2GMOS ARE INHERENTLY UNSAFE There areseveral reasons why GMplants present unique dangers. Thefirst isthattheprocess ofgenetic engineering itself creates cellisthen cloned into aplant turned on oroff.Inaddition, theinsertion process causes holistic andnot-well-understood changes among large numbers ofnative genes. One study revealed thatupto5%ofthenatural genes altered their levels expression ofproteins produced inmetabolic activities.\"3 Although the accidental changes plants\" might produce \"unexpected high concentrations ofplant toxicants.\"4 GMcrops, they onGMfoods, which designed onthefalse stillcarries significant risk. Itsnewly created GMprotein, such astheBt-toxin, may be forhuman health (seebelow). Moreover, evenifthatprotein issafeinitsnatural organism, once itistransferred into new differently. Aharmless protein may betransformed into adangerous ordeadly version. This happened with atleast oneGM food crop under development, GM peas, which were destroyed before being commercialized. FDA scientists were also quite concerned about thepossibility ofinserted genes spontaneously transferring intotheDNA ofbacteria inside ourdigestive tract. They were particularly alarmed atthepossibility ofantibiotic resistant marker (ARM) genes transferring. ARM genes areemployed during gene insertion tohelp scientists identify which cells successfully integrated theforeign gene. These ARM genes, however, remain inthecellandarecloned intotheDNA ofalltheGMplants produced from thatcell. OneFDA andcreate super untreatable with antibiotics. Although thebiotech industry confidently asserted thatgene transfer from GMfoods wasnotpossible, Another worry byFDA scientists wasthatGMplants While nostudies have looked atthebioaccumulation issue, herbicide tolerant crops certainly have higher levels ofherbicide residues. In fact, many countries hadtoincrease their legally allowable levels-\u2014by upto50times\u2014in to2008.\" And asRounduel becomes less effective, farmers arenow using more toxic herbicides, such as2-4D, which increased by237% from 2004 to2006.' 3Alloftheabove risks associated GMfoods Thefollowing section highlights some oftheproblems thathave been identified. GM DIET SHOWS TOXIC REACTIONS INTHE DIGESTIVE TRACT Thevery firstcrop submitted thatdidlook found problems. Mice data ontwolines ofGMtomatoes, both using thesame inserted gene. They voluntarily elected to market only thevariety that was notassociated with thelesions. orinflammation.30 Microscopic analysis ofthelivers ofmice fedRoundup Ready soybeans revealed altered gene expression andstructural and functional changes (seephotos).3' Many London, saidthatalthough thelong-term consequences oftheGMsoydietarenotknown, it\"could lead toliver and consequently toxemia.\"32 Rats fedRoundup Ready soybeans alsoshowed structural changes intheir livers. ~ Theliver cells from soy~fed cellnuclei Liver cellnucleoliControl GMSoyFed 5Thelivers ofsoy-fed ratsshowed unique changes.

Female ratswere fed GMsoy,starting twoweeks before they were mated.

There was anestimated 10,000 sheep deaths intheregion in2006, with more reported in2007. Post modems onthesheep andprolapsed uteruses. Many young calves andadult buffaloes died. GM CROPS TRIGGER IMMUNE REACTIONS AND MAY CAUSE ALLERGIES Allergic reactions occur when theimmune system interprets something asforeign, different, andoffensive, andreacts accordingly. AllGM foods, bydefinition, have something foreign anddifferent. And several studies show thatthey provoke reactions. Rats fed GMpeas provoked aninflammatory response inmice, reactions inpeople.56 Itmight bedifficult toidentify whether GMfoods were triggering allergic responses inthepopulation, since very fewcountries conduct regular studies orkeep careful records. Onecountry thatdoes have anannual evaluation istheUK. Soon after GM soy wasintroduced intotheBritish diet, researchers attheYork Laboratory reported that allergies tosoyhadskyrocketed by 50% inasingle year.57 Although nofollow-up studies were soywasthecause, inwhich Ready\" from hasnever food supply. Because people aren't usually allergic toafood until have (WHO) andothers recommend oftheprotein toseeifthey share characteristics with known allergens. Onemethod before were established andthe recommended additional tests were notconducted. Iftheprotein does trigger reactions, from totheherbicide tolerant protein, GM soybeans contain aunique, unexpected protein, which likely came about from thechanges incurred during thegenetic engineering process. Scientists found thatthisnewprotein wasable tobind with 1gB antibodies, suggesting thatitmay provoke dangerous allergic reactions. The same study revealed thatonehuman subject showed askinprick immune response only toGM Ifashortage ofenzymes caused food proteins tobreakdown more slowly, then they have more time to trigger allergic reactions. Thus, digestive problems from GMsoymight promote allergies toawide range ofproteins, notjust Infact, ofthe identified intheUKsoyallergy study areamong those related toglyphosate exposure. [The allergy study identified irritable bowel syndrome, digestion problems, chronic fatigue, headaches, lethargy, andskincomplaints, including acne and eczema, allrelated tosoyconsumption. Symptoms ofglyphosate exposure include nausea, headaches, lethargy, skin rashes, and burning oritchy skin. Itisalsopossible thatglyphosate's breakdown product AMPA, which accumulates inGM after each spray, might contribute toallergies.] Itisinteresting tonote soybeans allergies, who areallergic to peanuts.63 Given thestartling increase inpeanut allergies, scientists should whether thiscross-reactivity hasbeen amplified inGM soy. BT-'rOxIN, PRODUCED INGM CORN AND COTTON, MAY CAUSE ALLERGIES Foryears, organic farmers andothers have sprayed crops with solutions containing natural Btbacteria asamethod ofinsect control. Thetoxin creates holes Bt-toxin isnotfully forexample, showed animmune intheir small intestines.66A 2008 Italian government found thatBtcorn provoked immune responses inmice.67 Moreover, whennatural Btwassprayed over areas around Vancouver andWashington State gypsy moths, about 500people reported reactions7071727374 have long acknowledged that\"people with systems may beparticularly natural during digestion andheat. IfBt-toxin causes allergies, then gene transfer carries serious ramifications. IfBtgenes relocate tohuman gutbacteria, our in!estinalfiora may beconverted intoliving possibly producing Bt-toxin inside ofusyear after year. TheUK Joint Food Safety andStandards Group alsodescribed gene transfer from adifferent route. They warned thatgenes from inhaled pollen skin, respiratory, andintestinal reactions.79 Thesymptoms started with those living closest tothefield and spread tothose further away.

GOVERNMENT EVALUATIONS MISS MOST HEALTH PROBLEMS Although thenumber ofsafety studies onGMfoods isquite small, ithasvalidated theconcerns expressed byFDA and others. Unfortunately, government safety assessments worldwide arenotcompetent toevenident(ft most ofthepotential health problems described above, letalone bacteria.

Unlike pharmaceutical testing, GM research has nostandardized procedures dictated byregulators. GM studies arenotusually published inpeer-reviewed journals kept secret andgovernments. There islittle money available forrigorous independent research, socompany evidence usually goes unchallenged andunverified. Most importantly, whereas drugs canshow serious side-effects andstillbeapproved, GM food cannot. There isnotolerance foradverse reactions; feeding trials must show noproblems. Thus, when industry studies show problems (inspite oftheir efforts toavoid them), serious adverse They've gotbadscience down toa science. 14PROMOTING AND REGULATING DON'T MIX While such self-serving behavior may beexpected from corporations, how come government bodies letsuch blatant scientific contortions pass without comment? One reason isthatseveral regulatory agencies arealsocharged with promoting theinterests biotechnology. position USgovernment anditisbeing deployed with almost nothought whatsoever Canadian regulators aresimilarly conflicted. TheRoyal Society ofCanada reported that,\"Inmeetings with senior managers from thevarious Canadian regulatory departments ...their responses uniformly stressed theimportance relationships with ~\" scientists ontheEuropean Food Safety Authority (EFSA) GMO Panel arepersonally aligned with biotech interests.

Butmainstream media around theworld industry, legal threats bybiotech companies, andinsome cases, thefearoflosing advertising accounts. This lastreason isparticularly prevalent among thefarm press, which receives much ofitsincome from thebiotech industry.

There islittle hope that these foods have health benefits andmounting proof that they aredetrimental. Ichoose tonot purchase foods that use GMOcrops. Iwant toknow what foods those are. The Dept ofHealth will need toknow also; how canhealth officials know theorigin of allergic reactions andother illnesses that can stem from genetically engineered crops if these foods are notlabeled? Please give uswhat the Japanese, Chinese and Europeans already have. Mandate andenforce the labeling ofgenetically modified organisms. Thank youfortheopportunity foods weeat. It's theonly right toalways this information available to us -oneach andevery label ofevery food that wemight want toconsume.

From mystudies asahealth advisor Iknow that asahuge cause ofsomany health issues confronting humans andanimals these days. Thebig seed and agcompanies don't want non-GMO labels onthe food because they know many people don't want toeat GMOfoods. They fear they will lose business andthey areright. The problem wehave nowisthat most people don't even know that they're already eating GMOfoods three times aday.

Asyou are aware issues offood safety andpublic health are andvital tothe welfare ofour guidelines, recommendations andregulations forproducts consumed onaregular basis. Often the manufacturers will take aproactive step toprovide basic information onthe products they sell. Clear labeling ofproducts allow usconsumers theopportunity informed and wise decisions. HR154isthefirst inproviding avehicle forproviding Hawaii consumers with specific information ongenetically engineered food products. For many health conscious consumers, reading labels isacritical process indetermining iftheproduct offers more benefits than liabilities regarding nutrition, ingredients andcomposition ofthefood product. Fortoo long themanufacturers ofGEfood products have resisted sharing information about their products. This unfortunate choice onthepart ofthemanufacturer hasleft consumers inthe dark Bysupporting HR154, youwill beable toensure information about theproducts onthe market andallow for informed decision making regarding personal health andfood safety. Inclosing, your support ofHR154 and HCR 178will help toaddress themyriad ofconcerns that citizens have with GEfood products. Public health andfood safety aregrowing concerns for many inHawaii; HR154 and HCR provide approach toinforming consumers ofthe products available andallow tochoose based upon types ofingredients, processes andcomposition offood products Thank you again forallowing this opportunity toshare mymanao onthis important subject.
