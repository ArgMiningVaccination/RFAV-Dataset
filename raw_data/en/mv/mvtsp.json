Some natural treatment options \u2014 including stress reduction, exercise, capsaicin, and oatmeal \u2014 may help. Psoriatic [arthritis](/articles/7621.php) (PsA) is a psoriatic condition, which means it is related to [psoriasis](/info/psoriasis/). Some people with PsA also experience psoriatic nail and skin changes. Psoriatic conditions tend to occur in cycles. They feature periods of flare, when symptoms worsen, and periods of remission, when symptoms reduce or disappear for some time. Current medical treatment options can help slow the progression of PsA, prevent flares, and relieve symptoms, but natural and alternative remedies can also help a person relieve their symptoms. Some approaches aim to relieve symptoms, while others help reduce the risk of a flare. However, not all of these remedies have scientific evidence to support them. The following natural remedies may help with PsA: 1. Turmeric Curcumin, which is a component of turmeric, appears to have anti-inflammatory properties. The authors of a [review](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2698668) People can add turmeric to food or take turmeric capsules. [How can turmeric help with psoriasis?](/articles/314306.php) 2. Capsaicin Capsaicin is the compound that makes chili peppers hot. Some [research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163725820302746) suggests that creams containing capsaicin may numb pain receptors, bringing relief to painful joints. A person can apply these creams to the affected joints. 3. Epsom salts Taking a warm bath with Epsom salts may help reduce joint pain and [inflammation](/articles/248423.php). Epsom salts contain [magnesium](/articles/286839.php), a mineral that promotes bone health and may soothe itchy skin. Warm water also helps loosen joints and relieve pain. The temperature should be [92-100\u00b0F](https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/healthy-living/managing-pain/pain-relief-solutions/heat-therapy-helps-relax-stiff-joints) (33-37.8\u00b0C). However, Epsom salts can stimulate the release of [insulin](/info/diabetes/whatisinsulin.php) and may therefore not be suitable for people with [diabetes](/info/diabetes/). 4. Fish oil Fish oil contains [omega-3](/articles/40253.php) fatty acids. These fats [may ease](https://www.arthritis.org/living-with-arthritis/arthritis-diet/anti-inflammatory/the-arthritis-diet.php) painful swelling by reducing inflammation. Possible sources include omega-3 supplements, oily fish such as tuna, and other cold-water fish. 5. Ginger [Ginger](/articles/265990.php) is a root and a spice that appears to have anti-inflammatory properties. The [Arthritis Foundation](https://www.arthritis.org/living-with-arthritis/treatments/natural/supplements-herbs/guide/ginger.php) suggests that ginger may help people with [rheumatoid arthritis](/info/rheumatoid-arthritis/), another inflammatory type of arthritis. 6. Exercise Exercise can boost a person's overall health and quality of life. It can also reduce stiffness, strengthen muscles, aid in weight management, and lower the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Massage therapy A massage therapist with knowledge of PsA can help relieve joint discomfort and release tight muscles and joints. Getting a massage can provide significant relief from arthritis-related discomfort. 9. Acupuncture A qualified acupuncturist can insert needles at various pressure points to relieve chronic pain. Some [evidence](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2698668) However, acupuncture can be expensive and may trigger skin symptoms in some people with psoriasis. 10. Acupressure A therapist can apply pressure to different areas of the body to reduce pain, stimulate the immune system, and release tension. [Stress](/articles/145855.php) and [fatigue](/articles/248002.php) can occur with PsA and may trigger a flare or worsen symptoms. Managing stress may help reduce inflammation.

Meditating, practicing yoga, and getting enough sleep each night may help a person manage stress and promote relaxation. 12.

One reason is that itching and pain can make it hard to sleep. To encourage high quality sleep, a person can try these tips: - Make sure the room is dark and the temperature is comfortable. - Leave cell phones and other devices outside the room. - Go to bed and get up at the same time every day.

Meditation and mindfulness Mindfulness involves being aware of the body, how it is feeling, and any changes that may signal an approaching flare. It also involves being aware of any situations that may cause unnecessary stress. Meditation can help people manage pain and stress. People with PsA may experience skin symptoms in addition to arthritis. Here are some remedies that may help soothe the skin: 15. Apple cider vinegar Applying apple cider vinegar to affected areas of skin may help with scalp psoriasis. However, people should not use apple cider vinegar if the affected areas are cracked or bleeding. 16.
