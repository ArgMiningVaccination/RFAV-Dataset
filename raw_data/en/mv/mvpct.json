[Hepatitis B](https://www.webmd.com/hepatitis/hepb-guide/default.htm) infection can cause serious problems failure](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-liver-failure), long-term [hepatitis](https://www.webmd.com/hepatitis/understanding-hepatitis-basics) B infection, [cirrhosis](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/cirrhosis-liver), and [liver cancer](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/understanding-liver-cancer-basic-information). Preventing infection can prevent these problems. [Hepatitis B vaccine](https://www.webmd.com/children/vaccines/hepatitis-a-and-b-vaccines) is a genetically engineered (man-made in the lab) piece of the virus. It does not contain live virus, so you cannot get hepatitis from the [vaccine](https://www.webmd.com/children/healthtool-childhood-immunizations-guide). This vaccine works by helping the body produce [immunity](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/10-immune-system-busters-boosters) (through antibody production) that will prevent you from getting infection from hepatitis B virus. Hepatitis B vaccine does not protect you from other virus infections (such as [HIV](https://www.webmd.com/hiv-aids/understanding-aids-hiv-basics) virus which causes AIDS; [hepatitis A](https://www.webmd.com/hepatitis/digestive-diseases-hepatitis-a), [genital warts](https://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/hpv-genital-warts/genital-warts) and other problems).The vaccine is recommended for people of all ages, especially those at an increased risk of getting the infection. Those at an increased risk include [health care](https://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/rm-quiz-insurance-basics) personnel, lab workers who handle [blood](https://www.webmd.com/heart/anatomy-picture-of-blood) and patient specimens, police, fire and emergency medical personnel who give [first aid](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/wound-care-10/slideshow-first-aid-essentials) treatment, hemophiliacs, [dialysis](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/kidney-dialysis) patients, people who live with or spend much time with people with long-term hepatitis B infections, people with multiple sex partners, men who have sex with men, sex workers, injection drug abusers, and people traveling to high-risk areas. [Vaccines](https://www.webmd.com/children/vaccines/immunizations-vaccines-power-of-preparation) may not fully protect everyone who receives them. How to use Hepatitis B Virus Vacc.Rec(PF) Suspension Read all [vaccine](https://www.webmd.com/children/vaccines/immunizations-vaccines-power-of-preparation) information available from your [health care](https://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/rm-quiz-insurance-basics) professional before receiving the [vaccine](https://www.webmd.com/children/healthtool-childhood-immunizations-guide). If you have any questions, ask your [health care](https://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/video/what-is-the-aca) professional. This vaccine is usually given by injection into a muscle ( [shoulder](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/picture-of-the-shoulder) or thigh) by a health care professional. Injection under the [skin](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/skin-conditions-faq) may be used if you have a bleeding disorder. Your health care professional will give you a vaccination schedule (usually a series of 2 to 4 injections), which you must follow closely for best effectiveness. If you have an illness with fever at the time a vaccination is scheduled, your health care professional may choose to delay the injection until you are better. The dosage and vaccination schedule is based on your age, medical condition, risk of [hepatitis B](https://www.webmd.com/hepatitis/digestive-diseases-hepatitis-b) exposure, and the brand of vaccine used. If you are receiving the first [hepatitis B vaccine](https://www.webmd.com/children/vaccines/hepatitis-a-and-b-vaccines) injection at a time when your health care professional feels you may have been exposed to [hepatitis B](https://www.webmd.com/hepatitis/hepb-guide/default.htm), you will also receive an injection of [hepatitis](https://www.webmd.com/hepatitis/understanding-hepatitis-basics) B immune globulin (HBIG). HBIG is a dose of [antibodies](https://www.webmd.com/baby/antibody-testing) against the virus and will immediately help protect you from developing an infection. These antibodies only last a few months. For long-term protection, it is important to follow your vaccination schedule for the hepatitis B vaccine exactly. Side Effects Pain/soreness/redness/swelling at the injection site, fever, [headache](https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/migraines-headaches-basics), tiredness, [sore throat](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/understanding-sore-throat-basics), [nausea](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-nausea-vomiting), [diarrhea](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-diarrhea), loss of appetite, and [dizziness](https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/understanding-dizziness-basics) may occur. If any of these effects last or get worse, tell your [health care](https://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/rm-quiz-insurance-basics) professional promptly. Rarely, some people have symptoms such as [fainting](https://www.webmd.com/brain/understanding-fainting-basics), dizziness, [vision](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/vision-basics) changes, or [ringing in the ears](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-tinnitus-basics) just after getting a [vaccine](https://www.webmd.com/children/vaccines/immunizations-vaccines-power-of-preparation) injection. Tell your [health care](https://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/video/what-is-the-aca) professional right away if you have any of these symptoms. Sitting or lying down may help, since these symptoms usually don't last long.

If you are a [hemodialysis](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/hemodialysis-20667) patient, you may not respond as well to the vaccine and will need to have [hepatitis B](https://www.webmd.com/hepatitis/digestive-diseases-hepatitis-b) antibody levels checked yearly. If [antibodies](https://www.webmd.com/baby/antibody-testing) drop too low over time, you may be given another dose of vaccine (often called a booster shot). If you have [immune system disorders](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/autoimmune-diseases) (such as due to [HIV](https://www.webmd.com/hiv-aids/understanding-aids-hiv-basics) infection, certain cancers such as [leukemia](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/lymphoma/understanding-leukemia-basics)/ [lymphoma](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/lymphoma/lymphoma-cancer), [cancer](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/health-check-cancer-risk/default.htm) or [radiation](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/what-to-expect-from-radiation-therapy) treatment), your body may not make enough antibodies to protect you from [hepatitis B](https://www.webmd.com/hepatitis/hepb-guide/default.htm) infection. Antibody levels may be checked after the vaccine series. Older adults may not make as many antibodies to the vaccine. Talk to your health care professional for more details.
