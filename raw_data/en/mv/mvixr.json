Botox has become increasingly popular... People are hosting Botox parties as well as some 20 somethings are lining up for injections. But what's Botox, really? Are there alternatives? . Is there a natural way to achieve the same effects without Botox? . Botox's official name is botulinum toxin, which can be a potent neurotoxin and referred to as the very poisonous biological substances known. It inhibits the release of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction, which paralyzes the muscles that are surrounding. Injection of the toxin in specific tissues induces localized muscle relaxation which smooths the overlying skin and reduces the appearance of [wrinkles](https://www.skin-beauty.com/peter-thomas-roth-un-wrinkle-fast-acting-serum.html). I first discovered on botulinum toxin in medical school as a toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum found in a contaminated home canned foods, which damages nerves and may leads to paralysis and death. Afterwards, I find individuals are getting it injected in their bodies... hmmm...seems a bit odd if you think about it. Proponents of Botox say it is safe, and there have been short term studies on it indicating its security. I have concerns about both short term and long term outcomes. Many people today encounter their lower eyelids drooping, uneven smiles, along with other indicators that their facial muscles aren't quite working right. Additionally to possible adverse effects or practitioner error, many men and women complain that it's painful and expensive. And, others may frequently say that something does not look natural, about a face that's been Botoxed. Some specialists believe Botox can in fact make your muscles more susceptible to sagging than it might by natural aging. Since injecting Botox is basically freezing the muscles, it can cause the muscles to weaken ever since it is no longer able to contract on its own. I will leave the choice up to you, but in the 2 weeks it can take for Botox to kick in, you could, instead, be on your way to a smoother, more youthful looking skin without the toxins. While Botox technically is natural, it's a known toxic substance. The great news is that there are natural non toxicity alternatives that are able to keep your skin looking smooth and youthful.
