At UWS 'rote learning' - or memorising information - is not the main method of teaching. You will, instead, be required to understand and apply concepts and theories and to critically examine and present a range of arguments to support your conclusions. Lectures and tutorials In undergraduate courses you will have many hours of lectures, tutorials and classes each week, as well as substantial amounts of unstructured time that you will be expected to spend on individual reading and research. You will be required to study a full load of subjects - normally four or more units (subjects) per teaching session (in some instances a minimum of three units can be studied and still be regarded as full-time). Generally, your study will be undertaken on a UWS campus involving a combination of lectures and tutorials for the majority of the course.Class participation and understanding You will be expected to participate in class discussions and to question your lecturers and tutors if you do not understand what is being taught and discussed. In Australia it is not considered bad manners to express views that are different from those expressed by your lecturer, tutor, or academic supervisor. In fact, it is encouraged. Many academic staff members deliberately provoke discussion in order to help them explain the subject being studied. Class times and assignments Lecture and class times for all subjects will be given to you when you enrol during Orientation Week. All students are required to be at lectures and tutorials at the specified times. You may be penalised if you do not comply. At the beginning of each teaching session you will be given 'deadlines' (final dates) for the completion of assignments in all your subjects. If you fail to meet these deadlines you may be penalised even though you have completed your work.Assessments Assessment methods vary from program to program. To pass most subjects students will be required to complete a number of assessment tasks during the semester. These may include essays, research papers, oral presentations, fieldwork, laboratory practicals, mid-term examinations, final exams and other assessment tasks. The University acknowledges that some students encounter difficulties when they begin their university studies. It therefore provides academic support programs on most campuses to ensure that students are given the best opportunities to succeed. Visit www.uws.edu.au/ about/facilitiesAttendance and academic performance Attendance at class and submission of required work is also a condition of your student visa. The University is required to report poor attendance and poor academic performance of student visa holders to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC). www.uws.edu.au/about/ teaching Class in session at Parramatta campus7 university of western sydney - international prospectus UNDERg RaDU atE 2011 UWS and Yo U UWS Life - where will the riverside parklands at Parramatta campusWith campuses spread across Greater Western Sydney, UWS offers one of the largest choices of campus locations of any australian university.

For many students it represents the start of a new era, maybe moving out of home and a significant investment of their time and energies to achieve a dream.' Professor Janice Reid, AM Vice-Chancellor University of Western Sydney The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) requires student visa holders to have AUD$18,000 per year for living expenses. Although it is impossible to predict your exact expenses, this section gives you some indicative costs plus useful information about general living costs. A two bedroom apartment in Parramatta costs about AUD$300 per week in rent. Share with a friend and your rent will be around AUD$150 per week plus utilities and the cost of furnishing your apartment to your taste and lifestyle. Bring some lightweight items from home to make your new apartment feel like home (for example, a decorative couch throw cover, and photos). A lot of these costs vary depending on your lifestyle - you may require more or less than what is indicated on the table. Living in Sydney is affordable compared to major European cities and there are always great bargains to be found that can keep your costs down. It is just a question of looking! There are lots of cheap places to eat, 'party' and indulge in cultural pursuits. There are special discounts available to students - so make sure you ask! Remember, your living expenses are separate from your tuition fees. As it can often take some time for money to be transferred from your home country to Australia, you will need to bring enough money with you to cover your expenses for the first few weeks. Foreign currency can be exchanged for Australian currency at Sydney Airport. If you arrive on a weekend (Saturday/Sunday) and do not change some currency at the airport you may not be able to change it until the next working day. If you want to use cash, you may only use Australian currency.Budgeting tips There are many ways to reduce your costs for example: \u00bbbringing your lunch to campus \u00bbcooking at home \u00bbtaking public transport \u00bbbuying a pre-paid mobile phone \u00bbliving close to campus.UWS Life - Cost of Living Blacktown campus cafe29 university of western sydney - international prospectus UNDERg RaDU atE 2011 UWS and Yo U The costs given below are to be used as guidelines only.

The three majors offers are: computer forensics, networked systems and systems programming. Computer Forensics Major Computer forensics focuses on the gathering of evidence (often as part of an investigation) from computers and computer networks. Such evidence may consist of actual files (e.g. an image) or the traces of a user's activities that are left in the activity logs of operating systems, browsers, databases, web proxies, or network firewalls, etc. Identifying such evidence requires in-depth technical knowledge of the interactions between hardware, the operating system, programs, and the network. Similarly, knowledge of cryptographic techniques is required where data has been encrypted and/or obfuscated. This major develops this requisite knowledge; it also develops the skills necessary to ensure that evidence is not corrupted, and can be documented and presented in an intelligible manner. * Indicative tuition fees only.

locations: BA = Bankstown CA = Campbelltown HA = Hawkesbury PA = Parramatta PE = Penrith \u00b0The B Natural Science key program in Environment and Health is offered in distance mode only. ^ The B Nursing (Graduate Entry) 4643 requires completion of 170 credit points i.e. 1st year 100 credit points; 2nd year 70 credit points. The first year includes a prerequisite introductory unit which is worth 20 credit points (UWS units are usually 10 credit points) studied in the summer session. Therefore, annual fees are set out as follow: 1st year $26,000; 2nd year $18,200. Total estimate 2011: $44,200. Note: All students will need to successfully complete the prerequisite introductory unit called 'Introduction to Nursing' before being allowed to continue their study in the B Nursing (Graduate Entry). This unit has been organised to enable student feedback from week one (1). Students will be alerted in week three (3) of study if they are at risk of not passing the unit. If students do not pass the prerequisite introductory unit, they will automatically be made an offer into the standard three (3) year B Nursing program (code 4642) for the February 2011 intake. Alternatively, students may nominate another UWS course for which they would like to be assessed. A special orientation program for B Nursing (Graduate Entry) students is normally held prior to course commencement. 97 university of western sydney - international prospectus UNDERg RaDU atE 2011

During the course, students concentrate on basic grammar and sentence structure, then progress to more complex texts. 2. English for Academic Purposes I - Through general course work, seminars, factual reports and assignments, EAP I introduces students to academic writing, reading, listening and speaking skills. 3. English for Academic Purposes II - This course provides students with a broad academic language foundation and introduces students to a range of academic texts, building on the skills developed in EAP I. 4. English for Academic Purposes III - In EAP III, students develop their English language skills to an advanced level of academic writing, listening, reading and speaking. This course is excellent preparation for university. Students who complete it successfully do not have to take any further English language tests to gain entry to UWS. Advanced Academic English Skills Module A: Reading and Writing If you have either IELTS 6.5 or above, but a low score in reading/writing, or need to polish your writing skills before entry to further studies, Module A provides you with the intensive writing and reading practice you need. Module B: Speaking and Listening Module B focuses on providing you with high-level spoken communication skills for work or further study. It will also help improve fluency, pronunciation and public speaking skills. This course combines well with Module A.

As a result, Chloe opted for the Foundation Studies course at UWSCollege, providing a pathway straight into a degree at UWS upon successful completion of the course. Chloe is now enjoying her third year of a Bachelor of Social Science at UWS. 'The whole experience was really good - it was very international, and I met so many different people. The staff taught me things which were valuable for uni, like how to write essays and reference properly,' Chloe says. 'The course gave me a taste of uni before I went straight into a degree. It taught me extra skills, and definitely prepared me for the workload. It was probably the best thing I have ever done.'UWS International University of Western Sydney Locked Bag 1797 Penrith NSW 2751 "}
