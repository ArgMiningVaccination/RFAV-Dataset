There is no escaping the health consequences of climate variability. The challenge before our society now is to create one that is climate resilient. A climate resilient society is one that has assessed its vulnerability to clima te change and has defined priority mitigation and adaptation measures. With this vision in mind, the Department of Health & Family Welfare has come up with an action plan to create a climate resilient health system. The goal of a climate resilient health s ystem is to have a health system in place that not only withstands the onslaughts of climate variability but also sustains human health in the midst of uncertainties. We would like to mention at the outset that any approach to climate change related action has to be organic and dynamic. The planning has to be fluid. This means that informed by new evidences and also by climate change itself, which is hugely unpredictable still, our policies and plans will be reviewed and modified as per need. This action pl an draws heavily from the World Health Organization Operational Framework for building climate resilient health systems (WHO 2016) and the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India's draft National Action Plan on Climate Change & Human Healt h (MOHFW 2016). The importat climate sensitive illnesses in Manipur are Water & Food borne disease (Diarrhea & Typhoid), Vector borne and zoonotic disease(Malaria, Den gue , Japanese Encephalitis), Air Borne , Cardio Pulmonary & respiratory Allergic Diseas e (COPD, Asthma, Lung cancer & Heart Disease) and Extreme heat and thermal stress (Heat Stroke & Heat Fati gue). Detailed budget break up has been put up in Chapter 22. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT We express our gratitude to members of State task Force, SNOs of concerned Programmes and Officers of Public Health Unit of Medical Directorate for providing valuable data, comments and feedbacks. Chapter 1 Introduction Climate change is defined as: \" a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods .\" It affects social and envi ronmental determinants of health like -clean air, safe drinking water, sufficient food and secure shelter. Climate change may negatively affect human health through a number of ways, but the commonly experienced are increased frequency and intensity of hea t waves leading to rise in hea t related illnesses and deaths, increased precipitation, floods, droughts and desertification ncosting lives directly . High temperature is known to increase the level of 'ground level ozone' and other 'climate altering pollutants' other than carbon dioxide, which further exacerbate cardio -respiratory and allergic diseases and certain cancers. Beside these, there is incre ase in transmission and spread of infectious diseases, c hanges in the distribution of water -borne, food borne and vector -borne diseases and effects on the risk of disasters and malnutrition. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC ) came into force on 21st March 1994. Since then many steps were initiated to reduce the effect of climate change at meetings like \"Rio Convention 1992\", Kyoto protocol 1997\", 2011\",\" Nationally Determined Contributions\" (NDC s) at Conference of Parties 21\". India is signatory to \" Male' Declaration\" wherein health sector has to be strengthened so as to make it climate resilient. According to Male' Declaration, it is desired that health -care facilities should be prepared & climate -resilient, particularly in promoting to encourage that these are able to withstand any climatic event, and that essential services such as water, sanitation, waste management and electricity are functional during such events. Further, for climate resilient, the health department has to undertake measures to initiate the greening of the health sector by adopting environment -friendly technologies, and using energy -efficient services. Initiative s undertaken by Government of India are: a) Identification of Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MOEF&CC) as nodal ministry; b) Formulation of National Environmental Policy2006; c) Formulation of Prime Minister's Council on Climate Change fo r matters related to Climate Change. MoEFCC has developed National Action Plan on Climate Change with eight missions. Later on four new missions (including Health Mission) were identified. The Health Mission aims to reduce climate sensitive illnesses thro ugh integration with other missions under National Action Plan for Climate Change (NAPCC) as well as through programmes run by various ministries. As a follow -up action, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare ( MoHFW ) constituted a National Expert Group on Climate Change & Health (NEGCCH) to prepare National A ction Plan on Climate Change and Human Health (NAPCCHH) and recommend strategies for indicators, miti gation, capacity building etc. National Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC ) is identified as the 'technical nodal agency' by MoHFW for the proposed National Mission on Health. The Centre for Environmental and Occupational Health Climate Change & Health (CEOH&CCH) , NCDC , Delhi, conducted four regional consultations in 2017 -18 invo lving all the states and Union Territories' of the country. Regional consultations aimed at sensitising states and Union Territories on reassessment of diseases' morbidity and mortality with respect to climate variability and extremes have been conducted. These regional consultations had participations from ministries and department of states and UTs including Senior Regional Directors, Regional Directors from Regional Office of Health & Family Welfare, State Nodal Officers, State Surveillance Officers, Nat ional Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme, Officers from Integrated Diseases Surveillance Programme, representatives from identified Centre of Excellence, representatives from Regional Centre of Meteorological Departments, Ministry of Environment Fores t and Climate Change and Central Ground Water Board. . . Chapter 2 Climate Resilient Health System Climate Change vs Health Resilience: 'Resilience' may be defined as the \"capacity of a social - ecological system to cope with a hazardous event or disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain its essential function, identity, and structure, while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation.\" Accordingly, a climate resilient health system may be defined as the one that is capable to anticipate, respond to, cope with, recover from and adapt to climate -related shocks and stress, so as to bring sustain ed improvements in population hea lth, despite an unstable climate. There are ten components that together provide a comprehensive approach to integrating climate resilience into existing health systems: 1. Leadership & governance, 2. Capacity building on climate change and health, 3. Vulnerability and adaptation (V&A) assessments; 4. Integrated risk monitoring and early warning; 5. Research to reduce uncertainty on local conditions, gain insight into local solutions and capacities, and build evidence to strengthen decision -making; 6. Climate resilient and sustainable technologies and infrastructure; 7. Management of environmental determinants of health; 8. Departments and programs that can become climate -informed; 9. Managing changing risks of climate e xtremes and disasters and lastly, 10. Climate and health financing. It is a cumulative process to build health system resilience to climate change. It starts with making resilience a goal and then, being responsive and efficient and providing social and finan cial protection to the people. For the whole health system to become more climate -resilient, its independent building blocks (i.e. leadership and governance, health workforce, health information systems, essential medical products and technologies, service delivery and financing) have to become climate resilient. As per the available evidences, it is known that change or variation in climate at any geographic location may affect the pattern of morbidity and mortality among the dwelling population. To prote ct health of people, it is necessary that health department of all states must consider the climate change as an emerging threat in causation of most of the illnesses and hence must undertake measures to adequately address this issue.

Chapter 6 Climate Sensitive Diseases prevalent in the State Geo-physical & Climate variables: Manipur can be characterized as two distinct physical regions: an outlying area of rugged hills and narrow valleys, and the inner area representing the features of flat plain topography with all associated landforms Type of Climatic or extreme events (hea t/ cold/ drought/ flood/ cyclone/other) Manipur state is susceptible to anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The dataset of surface temperature variation observed during 1954 - 2011 shows an increasing trend in both the minimum and maximum tempe ratures (Figure 1&2). When the maximum temperature has increased from 26.5 oC to 27.3 oC, the minimum temperature has increased from 13.8 oC to 15.3 oC. Even the night temperature has rapidly risen as compared to day time temperatures because the greenhous e gasses act as a glass house by trapping longwave radiation radiated by earth surface. Seasonal variability of minimum and maximum surface temperatures in Manipur was from 4 oC (January) to 21.5 oC (July) and 21.5 oC (January) to 28.9 oC (July) respective ly. As per the spatial pattern of minimum temperature, an increasing trend was observed over the region. Southwestern parts of the state i.e. Jiribam, Chur achandpur, Bishnupur, Thoubal, Imphal parts of Tamenglong and Chandel ha ve experienced an increase in both minimum and maximum temperature of 1.75\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C respectively in the last 100 years. Figure 1: Mean Maximum Temperature in Manipur (January 1954 - December 2011) Figure 2: Average monthly rainfall pattern over Manipur (1901 - 2000) To examine the current variability in precipitation over Manipur in the last 57 years (1954 - 2011) the daily precipitation datasets were analyzed. Annual rainfall quantum varies from 956.5 to 2269.9 mm over Manipur as displayed in Figure 3. National Data Centre, IMD, Pune has also reported in a compiled \"National Monthly m e a n Maximum and Minimum Temperature and Total Rainfall Dataset\" that the average monthly total rainfall has varied from 12.2 mm (January) to 407.3 mm (July). The decadal assessment of monthly rainfall reveals that the period of raining days in Manipur has extended from monsoon months i.e. June-October to pre -monsoon months like April and May. Few districts of central a nd southern Manipur experienced a marginal decrease in precipitation over Imphal (east & west), Bishnupur, Thoubal, Tamenglong, Jiribam, Chandel in the last 100 years whereas the northern districts of Manipur i.e. Senapati and Ukhrul has observed a conside rable increase in precipitation. Figure 3: Annual precipitation at Imphal, Manipur Source: National Data Centre, Indian Meteorology Department (IMD), Pune. Atmospheric CO2 concentration has also risen by more than 30% since pre -industrial times, from equilibrium level of about 280 ppm in 1880, to the current observed level of 390 ppm. Flood Situation in Manipur: Almost two third population of Manipur is concentrated in the Manipur Valley, which has only 8.2% area of the state. Rivers from these hills flow into valley and very often lead to flash floods every year. Thus river flooding is a regular hazard faced by the State. All the major river systems in the State are vulnerable to flooding, as captured in the Vulnerability Atlas. Elements at Risk: The four valley districts in Manipur, namely Imphal East, Imphal West, Thoubal and Bishnupur are most vulnerable to floods. usually occurring in the state/ UT with potential to affect health status of the population.

Risk mapping and vulnerability assessment of different areas of the five priority districts will be done based on available mortality and morbidity data of climate sensitive illness by interlinking with other depa rtments and using modern scientific tool including GIS mapping. The specific objectives of implementing risk mapping, vulnerability, and seasonal trend assessment assessment are to: i.Ensure there is sound understanding of the main health risks posed by climate change and of the most vulnerable population groups in the state; ii. Ensure baseline information on capacities and gaps within the health system to face the challenges associated with climate change is collected for analysis and appropriate adapt ation plans; iii. Ensure status of communities/population's well - being post extreme climate events/disaster; b. Activities: i. Identification of communities most vulnerable to climate variability and change and associated health risk exposures through profiling or use of existing data. ii. Assess capacity of the health system to cope with climate change health risks and mapped for appropriate intervention (e.g. diagnostic and treatment capacities, laboratory and clinical practice). iii. Assessment of health care infrastructure at all levels (especially in the disaster prone areas) in response to CSDs (dengue, diarrhea, malaria , JE. Water borne disease, airborne illness). iv. Conduct post extreme climate event/disaster assessment and outreach for affected population considering CSDs and mental health. v. Engage health personnel in all processes of relocating communities and in stitutions to 'safer' sites. vi. Develop proposals, recommendations and plans for adaptation strategies to address identified gaps. vii. Synthesize climate, seasonal trends in disease and other relevant data/parameters (exposure, adaptive capacity) Chapter 7 Health Adaptation Plan for Acute Respiratory Illnesses attributed to Air Pollution Air pollution is a major environmental risk to health. The formation, transport and dispersion of many air pollutants is determined partly by climate and weath er factors such as temperature, humidity, wind, storms, droughts, precipitation and partly by human activities known to produce various air pollutants. It is thus logical to assume that climate change will influence the dynamics of air pollution. By reduci ng air pollution levels, states can reduce the burden of disease from stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and both chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including asthma29,30. Two major types of Air Pollution: 1. Ambient (Outdoor) Air Pollution 2. Household (Indoor) Air Pollution Ambient (Outdoor) Air Pollution and Household (Indoor) Air Pollution Definitions Ambient (Outdoor) Air Pollution: The World Health Organization (WHO) defines ambient air pollution as potentially harmful pollutants emitted by industries, households, cars, and trucks. Most fine particulate matter comes from fuel combustion from vehicles, power plants, industry, households, or biomass burning Household (Indoor) Air Pollution): Pollutants emitted by the incomplete combustion of so lid fuels or kerosene for cooking, heating and lighting are associated with serious health risks. Other indoor air pollutants include mould, building materials, home products, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and naturally occurring gases like radon. Ambient (outdoor air pollution) in both cities and rural areas was estimated to cause 3.7 million premature deaths worldwide in 2012. Air pollution also affects health by causing acid rain; eutrophication due to nitrogen oxides, emission in air from power pl ants, cars, trucks, and other sources; Haze; toxic effects on wildlife; Ozone depletion; Crop and forest damage etc. Over 4 million people die prematurely from illness attributable to the household air pollution from cooking with solid fuels. 3.8 million p remature deaths annually from non -communicable diseases including stroke, ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer are attributed to exposure to household air pollution41-43. Prominent causes of Ambient Air Pollu tion in the state of Manipur: 1. Pollution by Automobiles 2. Dust -fall due to bad road management 3. Brick kilns 4. Stone crushers Prominent causes of Household Air Pollution in the state of Manipur: 1. Use of biomass, kerosene as fuel for cooking 2. Burning of waste, cow dung, coal Other factors contributing to increase of Ambient/ Household air pollution in the polluted cities 1. Commercial earthmoving activities 2. Huge amounts of stubble burnt in the fields as a way of preparing the ground for the nex t crop. 3. Auto -rickshaws and taxis run on fuel that has been adulterated by other, cheaper ingredients 4. Construction work 5. Slashing and burning of fresh forest during February - March every year for preparation of the field for agricultural crop under Jhum prac tices adds huge amount of fumes and particulates into the atmosphere. Air Quality Index: Air Quality Index is a tool for effective communication of air quality status to people in terms, which are easy to understand. It transforms complex air quality data of various pollutants into a single number (index value), nomenclature and colour. Air Quality Index (AQI) Category Good 0-50 Number of AQI monitoring stations within state: 1. By State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) - 2. By System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) - Vulnerability Assessment for air pollution : Data of vulnerable population district wise: Following group of people having high risk towards hazards of air pollution.

Following criteria are used to declare a heat wave: a) Based on Departure f rom Normal o Heat Wave: Departure from normal is 4.5\u00b0C to 6.4\u00b0C o Severe Heat Wave: Departure from normal is >6.4\u00b0C b) Based on Actual Maximum Temperature (for plains only) o Heat Wave: When actual maximum temperature 45\u00b0C o Severe Heat Wave: When actual maximum temperature 47\u00b0C The adverse health effects of hot weather and heat -waves are largely preventable. Prevention requires a portfolio of actions at different levels, these actions can be integrated in a defined heat -health action plan. National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) prepared Guidelines for Preparation of Action Plan -prevention and management of Heat wave -2017, wherein the roles and responsibilities of various agencies were identified. Emergency Medical Relief (EMR), Minist ry of Health and Family Welfare prepared detailed guidelines on prevention and management of heat related illnesses - 2015 wherein patho -physiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, management, prevention and public health action plan for manag ing heat related illnesses has been explained. To declare a heat wave, the above criteria should be met at least at two stations in a Meteorological sub -division for at least two consecutive days. A heat wave will be declared on the second day. State may enter their State specific inputs related to the same Manipur state is susceptible to anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The dataset of surface temperature variation observed during 1954 - 2011 shows an increasing trend in both the minimum and m aximum temperatures. When the maximum temperature has increased from 26.5 C to 27.3 C, the minimum temperature has increased from 13.8 C to 15.3 C. Even the night temperature has rapidly risen as compared to day time temperatures because the greenhouse gas ses act as a glass house by trapping longwave radiation radiated by earth surface. With projected increase in surface temperature, increase in frequency and intensity of extreme events such as increase in night temperatures, increase in number of warm days , extreme heat and heavy precipitation etc. in the future due to anthropogenic causes, human health impacts are likely to escalate with respect to their virulence and spread to hitherto disease -free areas.

In Vector -borne diseases (VBD), insects carry virulence of the pathoge n in the vector from one host to another. Vector -Borne are climate -sensitive diseases, found in warmer climates as well as vulnerable due to ecological shifts. Its distribution and incidences depend on climate change, international trade, and travel, etc. It is a major public health problem in several countries, while India is among the top geographical hotspots for such diseases. There are several reasons for VBD such as lack of hygienic practices, awareness, diagnostic facilities, under -reporting system, poverty and lack of medical facilities, all this causes the high burden of morbidity and deaths, particularly in marginalized and vulnerable communities. Besides these, the effect of variation in the global climate has been well established for the disease s that spread through vectors or transmitted from animals to humans.

Chapter 1 2 Health Adaptation plan for Nutrition related illnesses Introduction Climate variability and extremes of weather events affect food quantity and quality through reducing production, poor storage, pathogen infestation, disrupted supply chain, hike in market price. Malnutrition and consequent disorders, like retarded child gr owth and development have been identified as one of the health threat by the Working Group -II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Climate change result in food insecurity, namely, food availability, food access ibility, food utilization, and food system stability. Drought occurrence diminishes crop yield, dietary diversity, supply chain disrupted, increase in market prices, also reduction in animal and aquatic products are being experienced. These factors reduce overall food consumption, and may therefore lead to macro as well as micronutrient deficiencies. For India, a proactive approach is critical as nearly half of children (48%) aged less than five are chronically malnourished, more than half of women (55%) and almost one -quarter of men (24%) are anaemic (NFHS -3). The health of the vulnerable population is further threatened by the changing climate. For instance, in Gujarat, during a drought in the year 2000, diets were found to be deficient in energy and sev eral vitamins. In this population, serious effects of drought on anthropometric indices may have been prevented by public -health measures48,49. There are certain positive effects of climate change too, like modest reductions in cold -related morbidity and m ortality, geographical shifts in food production, and reduced capacity of disease - carrying vectors due to exceeding of thermal thresholds. These positive effects will however be increasingly outweighed, worldwide, by the magnitude and severity of the negat ive effects of climate change. Relevant inputs may be put by the state ........................................................................................................................... ...........................................................................................................................

Chapter 1 3 Health Adaptat ion plan for Allergic illnesses Introduction Climate variability and frequent change in weather and extreme events affects have been linked to increase in illnesses of lungs and cardio -vascular system. The IPCC AR5 mention few studies which states that ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are linked to highe r incidence of few skin carcinoma for every 1\u00b0C increment in average temperatures36. However, exposure to the sun also has beneficial effects on synthesis of vitamin D, with important consequences for health. Accordingly the balance of gains and losses due to increased UV exposures vary with location, intensity of exposure, and other factors (such as diet) that influence vitamin D levels. The excess of exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation(UVR) even within the ambient environmental range may results in sunburn, photo -ageing, cataracts, immunesuppression and skin melanomas37. UVR induced immune -suppression may influence occurrence of various infectious diseases as well as affect vaccine efficacy. There is evidence to sup port a relationship between sunburn during childhood and adolescence and skin cancer in adulthood. The World Health Organization (WHO) has argued that school sun protection programmes should be emphasised, because a sizeable portion of lifetime sun exposur e occurs during childhood and adolescence. Similarly, personal exposure studies among outdoor workers found that individuals engaged in road construction, horticulture, roofing and other outdoor occupations received ~20 - 26% of the total daily ambient sol ar UV radiation levels.

Chapter 19 Health adaptation plan for Disaster management Introduction Human Health vs Extreme weather events States and UTs may have recorded raised morbidity and mortality due to effect of extreme weather conditions viz frequent and severe episodes of heat waves, floods, droughts andfires as a direct impact of climate variability and affecting population at larg e. Climate change can result in more hot days, resulting in more periods of 'drought', 'dust storms', or'heavy rains (precipitation)', and even'flooding'. The health gets directly affected due to injuries, hypothermia, hyperthermia, drowning and indirectly through population dislocation, crowding, poor living conditions, faeco -oral transmission of gastro -intestinal pathogens causing water and food borne illnesses, respiratory illness and other infectious diseases (e.g., leptospirosis, vector -borne disease, cholera and also mental illnesses)48-50.

Chapter 20 SAPCCHH: Capacity building and system awareness Capacity building will be based on the baseline and follow -up situation which should be assessed periodically. Communication and training are crucial in adaptation to variability or changes in the climate. Communication programmes based on a thorough needs assessme nt must aim to enable and empower people, in particular, the illiterate, poor and other vulnerable people such as women, children, the elderly, people suffering from debilitating medical problems and those living in coastal areas, highlands and urban slums . Such programmes should have adequate and appropriately designed communication tools that are locally suitable, popular and comprehensible. Effective communication and public awareness activities/advocacy: sensitize, orient and take support of leaders/ op inion makers / stakeholders/ celebrities/ civil societies. Communication intervention for target audience: Appropriate, efficient and cost -effective measures include clear and timely information covering who is involved; what happened; when it happened; where it happened; and why or how it happened or what may happen - how, why, where, among whom and how to face it. State and district level capacity building institutions needs to be identified for capacity building of health staff: include training and im parting technical skills for case management, risk assessment skills, entomology, epidemiology, climate models, disaster management, meteorology, monitoring and evaluation, and research. Conducive institutional and management arrangements to ensure involv ement of private sector by forming public private partnerships. Hospital and all other health -care systems must be strengthened. Involve community in the process of strengthening and in managing and maintaining the system. Inventory management: standardiz ed list of adequate and appropriate logistics medicines, kits, equipment and machines along with efficient storage systems. Specific strategies and standard operating procedures for managing climate sensitive diseases need to be developed in light of the future impacts of climate change with prevention in mind. Communication interventions in schools are effective approaches for which teachers would need materials and training to educate the children.

MoHFW, State DoHFW, District Health Officers and the individual health facilities will be involved in regular internal monitoring. External Monitoring will be done by an independent agency. a) Internal: Monthly / quarterly progress monitoring for climate sensitive illnesses has to be done at all levels, i.e. District to State to MoHFW. These Monthly / Quarterly Progress Reports should include a collation / aggregation of the data / information compiled in each h ealth care facility. The District Cell will have the responsibility of collation / aggregations of the data / information compiled in each health care facility and submit to the State Cell which will validate and forward the data to the National Cell. b) Exte rnal: Each state should commission an independent evaluation every 2 years. At the minimum, the audit should cover one well performing district and one slack performing district. The agency to conduct the SAPCCHH Implementation Audit should be chosen based on the background, experience in the State's health sector, environmental auditing and reputation of reliability. The recommendations of the audit should be developed into an action plan to strengthen the existing system.

Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external force such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions, and persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use. The Framework Convent ion on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in its Article 1, defines climate change as: \" a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods3\". The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate change attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric composition, and climate variability attributable to natural causes4,5. Climate change is perceived to be among the greatest health risks of the 21st Century4,5. It affects social and environmental determinants of health like -clean air, safe drinking water, sufficient food and secure shelter. Climate change, together with other natural and human -made health stressors, influences human health and disease in numerous ways (Fig:1). Fig:1 . LikelyImpacts of Climate Change on Human Health Source: https://www.cdc.gov/climateandhealth/effects/default.htm Climate change may have various imp acts, but most commonly observed negativeeffects on human health are seen as rise in illnesses and deaths. The climatic variables costing lives directly are identified as increase in frequency and intensity of heat waves, increased precipitation, floods an d droughts17-18,26. High temperature is known to increase the level of 'ground level ozone' and other 'climate altering pollutants' other than carbon dioxide, which further exacerbate cardio -respiratory and allergic diseases and certain cancers. Beside th ese, there is increase in transmission and spread of infectious diseases, c hanges in the distribution of water -borne, food borne and vector -borne diseases and occurrence of disasters and increased probability of malnutrition. The marginalised populations a mong all are found to be more adversely affected due to variability and change in climatic conditions. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 2,50,000 additional deaths p er year, resulting from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. These deaths will further have financial implications which are estimated to be between US$ 2 -4 billion/year by 203013,14,16. Diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, dengue and choler a are all sensitive to climate change due to effect on the viability and the geographical distribution of the mosquitoes and micro -organisms, which prefer a wetter, warmer world. India is a highly populous country, undergoing industrialisation, with large scale rural to urban migration, chaotic, unplanned urbanization, depletion of forest cover and requirement of high energy demand makes it more vulnerable to adverse impacts of climate change. As evident from various literature worldwide, t he health effects may occur either due to direct or indirect causes of climate change or extremes of weather. A) Direct Impacts of Change in Climate and Weather on Health: Changes in temperature and precipitation and occurrence of heat waves, floods, droughts andfires directly impact health of people. 1. Air pollution Air pollution is a major environmental risk to health. The formation, transport and dispersion of many air pollutants is determined partly by climate and weather factors such as temperature, humidity, wind, storms, droughts, precipitation and partly by human activities known to produce various air pollutants. It is thus logical to assume that climate change will influence the dynamics of air pollution. By reducing air pollution levels, countries can reduce th e burden of disease from stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and both chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including asthma29,30. Ambient (outdoor air pollution) in both cities and rural areas was estimated to cause 3.7 million premature deaths worldwi de in 2012. Air pollution also affect health by causing acid rain; eutrophication due to nitrogen oxides emission in air from power plants, cars, trucks, and other sources; Haze; toxic effects on wildlife; Ozone depletion; Crop and forest damage etc. Over 4 million people die prematurely from illness attributable to the household air pollution from cooking with solid fuels. 3.8 million premature deaths annually from non -communicable diseases including stroke, ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulm onary disease (COPD) and lung cancer are attributed to exposure to household air pollution41-43. 2. Heat -Stress and Related Impacts The IPCC Special Report on Extreme Events (SREX)6 has a mention that there has been an overall decrease in the number of cold days and nights, and an overall increase in the number of warm days and nights, at the global scale. If there has been an increase in daily maximum temperatures, resulting in incr ease in number of heat -related illnesses. As per t he basic processes of human thermoregulation, the health effects are seen when body temperature rises above 38\u00b0C i.e. physical functions are impaired with experience of weakness (heat exhaustion), when body temperature rises further to 40.6\u00b0C, the risk of physical and cognitive functions get impaired (heat syncope), risks of organ damage, loss of consciousness, and death increase sharply at further rise in body temperature usually above 40.6\u00b0C (heat stroke). Various factors interplay in occurrence of these morbidity and mortality majorly affecting mainly the vulnerable population especially in the vulnerable regions21-23. The vulnerable population implies the demography (extremes of age, sex, population densi ty, pregnant womenand certain occupations ), Health Status (like proportion of malnourishment, suffering with infectious and/ or chronic diseases, mental or physical disability), socio -economic status (poor/ marginalised - more vulnerable), type of occupatio n or socio -cultural practices. The vulnerable regions implies unplanned urban housing, proportion of slums, drought risk zones, water -stressed zones, food -insecure zones and remote rural areas Numerous studies have reported increase in temperature -related m orbidity (hospital admissions or emergency presentations), events due to cardiovascular, respiratory, and kidney diseases. These impacts have been related to the duration and intensity of heat. Health risks during heat extremes are greater in people who ar e physically active. Eighteen heat -waves were reported in India between 1980 and 1998, with a heat -wave in 1988 affecting ten states and causing 1,300 deaths. Heat -waves in Odisha, India during 1998 to 2000 caused an estimated more than two thousand deaths and heat -waves in 2003 in Andhra Pradesh, India, caused more than 3000 deaths. The significant correlation between mortality and high temperature and high heat index has also been documented. 3. Drought, Storms and Floods Climate change can result in more hot days, resulting in more periods of 'drought', 'dust storms', or'heavy rains (precipitation)', and even'flooding'. The health gets directly affected due to injuries, hypothermia, hyperthermia, drowning and indirectly th rough population dislocation, crowding, poor living conditions, faeco -oral transmission of gastro -intestinal pathogens causing water and food borne illnesses, respiratory illness and other infectious diseases (e.g., leptospirosis, vector -borne disease, cho lera and also mental illnesses)48-50. The reason primarily is due to contamination of water and sewage disposal. 4. Ozone Ozone is a secondary pollutant, formed via sunlightdriven photochemical reactions involving precursor hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrog en. Ozone pollution is projected to increase because warmer temperatures enhance these reactions. Ozone is a powerful oxidant that has been persistently associated with damage to structure of airway or lung tissue. It contributes to more severe symptom of asthma, increase in other respiratory illnesses and deaths. High concentration of ground -level ozone accompanied with Heat waves result in higher frequency and severity of cardio -pulmonary attacks34-36. Similarly, combination of high level of Ozone and dus t storms or alteration of allergens or all, will result in outbreaks of asthma and allergic rhinitis. 5. Ultraviolet Radiation The IPCC AR5 mention few studies which states that ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are linked to higher incidence of few skin carcinoma for every 1\u00b0C increment in average temperatures36. However, exposure to the sun also has beneficial effects on synthesis of vitamin D, with important consequences for health. Accordingly the balance of gain s and losses due to increased UV exposures vary with location, intensity of exposure, and other factors (such as diet) that influence vitamin D levels. The excess of exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation(UVR) even within the ambient environmental range may results in sunburn, photo -ageing, cataracts, immunesuppression and skin melanomas37. UVR induced immune -suppression may influence occurrence of various infectious diseases as well as affect vaccine efficacy. There is evidence to support a relationship between sunburn during childhood and adolescence and skin cancer in adulthood. The World Health Organization (WHO) has argued that school sun protection programmes should be emphasised, because a sizeable portion of lifetime sun exposure occurs during chil dhood and adolescence. Similarly, personal exposure studies among outdoor workers found that individuals engaged in road construction, horticulture, roofing and other outdoor occupations received ~20 - 26% of the total daily ambient solar UV radiation leve ls. B) Indirect Impacts of Climate and Weather on Health: Indirect impacts are due to ecological disruptions, rising sea level, changing temperatures and precipitation patterns which leads to crop failures, shifting patterns of disease'vectors, water - borne dis ease, vector -borne disease. Climate dependant diseases particularly affecting the vulnerable pop ulations include the following: 1. Air-Borne and Cardio -Respiratory Illnesses : Climate change influences various illnesses including respiratory tract infections like asthma, rhino -sinusitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), respiratory viral diseases (Avian Influenza) & circulatory collapse posing danger to cardiac patients. The cited reasons are poor air quality, high ozone, dust storms, extreme heat, desertification, alteration of allergens, change in timing and duration of survival and transmission cycle of respiratory virus, alteration in bird migration. Further the other contributory factors are demographic factors (age, sex, immunity status, pre gnant women, prevailing endemic illnesses etc) low socio -economic status, overcrowding, poor hygienic conditions, accessibilities to health care facilities, population with tuberculosis, immune -compromised level, or mentally or physically challenged people37-39. 2. Vector -borne diseases (VBD) : Climate change and other weather parameters have significant impact on vector borne diseases such as Malaria, Dengue, Chikungunya, Japanese Encephalitis, kala-azar, and filariasis. The known parameters are temperature, humidity, wind, rainfall, flood and drought, affecting 'distribution of vector' and 'effectiveness of transmission of pathogen' through vectors. The temperature affects: vectors' survival, population growth, feeding behaviour, susceptibility to pathogen, incubation period, seasonality of vec tor activity as well as pathogen transmission. The roles of rainfall on vectors are: increase in breeding sites due to increase in surface water, increase vegetation and expansion of vertebrate hosts, flooding bring vertebrate host close to human populatio n41-43. Other factors affecting VBDs are population growth, population displacement, socio -economic status, changes in residential pattern, changes in land use, water projects, agricultural practices, housing projects, international travel, resistance of diseases vectors and pathogens, accessibility to health care and diagnostic facilities. 3. Water borne &Foodborne diseases such as typhoid, hepatitis, dysentery, and others caused from micro - organisms such as Vibrio vulnificus and Legionella are some climate -dependant infectious diseases. The increase in temperature is seen to be associated with increased survival and abundance of micro -organisms44,46. The decreased precip itation and drought result in decrease availability of safe -water, reuse of wastewater, contamination of water sources, transmission from vertebrate to human or human to human etc. Flooding cause contamination of water source as well as disruption of sewag e disposal system, further contributors are population displacement, overcrowding, poor sanitation and hygiene, subsequent faeco -oral contamination and spread of pathogens etc 4. Malnutrition and consequent disorders, like retarded child growth and developmen t have been identified as one of the health threat by the Working Group -II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Climate change result in food insecurity, namely, food availability, food accessibility, food utili zation, and food system stability. Drought occurrence diminishes crop yield, dietary diversity, supply chain disrupted, increase in market prices, also reduction in animal and aquatic products are being experienced. These factors reduce overall food consu mption, and may therefore lead to macro as well as micronutrient deficiencies. For India, a proactive approach is critical as nearly half of children (48%) aged less than five are chronically malnourished, more than half of women (55%) and almost one -quarter of men (24%) are anaemic (NFHS -3). The health of the vulnerable population is further threatened by the changing climate. For instance, in Gujarat, during a drought in the year 2000, diets were found to be deficient in energy and several vitamins. In t his population, serious effects of drought on anthropometric indices may have been prevented by public -health measures48,49. There are certain positive effects of climate change too, like modest reductions in cold -related morbidity and mortality, geographi cal shifts in food production, and reduced capacity of disease - carrying vectors due to exceeding of thermal thresholds. These positive effects will however be increasingly outweighed, worldwide, by the magnitude and severity of the negative effects of climate change. Annexure B Steps to Reduce Impact of Climate Change The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) came into force on 21st March 1994. The \"Rio Convention\", was adopted out of three conventions identified at \"Rio Earth Summit\" in 1992. Today, this convention known as \"Convention of Parti es\" has 197 countries. Industrialized nations agree under the Convention to support climate change activities in developing countries by providing financial support for action on climate change. This was followed by first Conference of Parties (COP1) that took place in Berlin in 1995. Another milestone was Kyoto protocol, which was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, on 11thDecember 1997. The Parties agreed -for were made bound for 'targets'for reducing emission. The Kyoto Protocol places a heavier burden on developed nations under the principle of \" common but differentiated responsibilities \", owing to high level of GHG emissions by developed nations by their industrial activity for approximatel y 150 years. The detailed rules for the implementation of the Protocol were adopted at COP -7 in Marrakesh, Morocco, in 2001, and are referred to as the \"Marrakesh Accords.\" Its first commitment period started in 2008 and ended in 2012. The Cancun Agreement came up in 2010 at COP -16 in Cancun, where Governments decided to establish a \" Green Climate Fund \". The fund will support projects, programmes, policies and other activities in developing country using thematic funding windows. The objective was to enhanc e action on adaptation, international cooperation and coherent consideration of matters relating to adaptation under the Convention. At COP17, Durban Platform , Enhanced Action drafted, where governments clearly recognized the need to draw up the blueprint for a fresh universal, legal agreement to deal with climate change beyond 2020, where all will play their part to the best of their ability and all will be able to reap the benefits of success together. The Durban outcome recognized, in its spirit and int ention that smart government policy, smart business investment, and the demands of an informed citizenry, all motivated by an understanding of mutual self -interest, must go hand in hand in pursuit of the common goal. At COP 21 in Paris, Parties to the UNFC CC reached a historic agreement to combat climate change and to accelerate and intensify the actions and investments needed for a sustainable low carbon future. The Paris Agreement requires all Parties to put forward their best efforts through \"Nationally Determined Contributions\" (NDCs) and to strengthen these efforts in the years ahead. India has undertaken many initiatives in pursuance to the obligation implied by UNFCCC like: a) Identification of Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MOEF&C C) as nodal ministry for matters related to Climate Change; b) Formulation of National Environmental Policy2006; c) Formulation of Prime Minister's Council on Climate Change to advice proactive measures, facilitate inter -ministerial coordination and guid e policy in relevant areas. The Hon'ble Prime Minister of India office had released a National Action Plan on Climate Change in June 2008. NAPCC addresses the urgent and critical concerns of the country through enhancement of the current and planned progra mmes presented in the Technology Document. It identifies measures that promote our development objectives along with yielding co -benefits for addressing climate change effectively. It outlines a number of steps to simultaneously advance India's development and climate change related objectives of adaptation and mitigation. The NAPCC identified eight national missionsinitially : 1. National Mission on Sustainable habitat 2. National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem 3. National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture 4. National Solar Mission 5. National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency 6. National Water Mission 7. National Mission on Strategic Knowledge for Climate Change 8. National Mission for \"Green India\" The reconstituted Prime Minister Council on Climate Change (PMCCC) reviewed the progress of eight national missions on 19th January 2015 and suggested formulation of four new missions on Climate Change viz. 1. National Health Mission 2. National Mission on \"Waste to Energy Generation\" 3. National Mission on India's Coastal areas 4. National Wind Mission In this background, the proposed 'Health Mission' was undertaken by Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India under the umbrella of 'National Action Plan on Climate Change' by MoEFCC. As a follow -up acti on, MoHFW constituted a National Expert Group on Climate Change & Health (NEGCCH) under the chairmanship of Dr Vishwa Mohan Katoch, Former Secretary (Health Research), Government of India and DG (ICMR ) to prepare action plan, recommend strategies for adapt ation and response plan for diseases occurring due to climate variability and change. TheNational Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC ) was identified as the nodal agency for 'Health Mission' by Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India. An exp ert group was constituted with members' representation from DteGHS, MoEFCC, ICMR, DST, NDMA, CGWB, of of Earth Sciences, TERI, NEERI etc. Annexure C India's Strategic Framework for Adaptation of Human Health against Climate Change India's Health and Family Welfare System derives strength from several institutes and infrastructures of the GOI, multi -lateral institutes, and NGOs including the National Institute of Malaria Research; Indian Institute of Tro pical Meteorology, India Meteorological Department, Director General of Health Services, Indian Council of Medical Research, National Centre for Disease Control and many others. Measures that would help address the imminent challenges would include develop ment of an integrated early health warning system , state specificemergency response plan , along with increased capacity to pro vide health care to the most vulnerable and the marginalized populations. Therefore, a fundamental area of intervention would inc lude strengthening of local monitoring of appropriate climate and disease variables. This would be directed at building temporally and spatially disease specific database . A strong surveillance would help develop effective prevention strategies, aid epidem iological understanding and predictive computations. Improvements in information infrastructure that are innovative and that promote interdisciplinary collaborations have been identified as areas that require strengthening in India (Bush et al. 2011). The linkage of health with environmental and climate change determinants is well recognized. Consequently, coordination and synergies with other Ministries becomes crucial to yield health benefits. To facilitate joint action and Inter -Ministerial cooperation , it is imperative to develop feedback mechanisms of health trends to related Ministries and agencies to enable health statistics to leapfrog. Health sector in preparedness for climate change needs urgent, serious, and multifaceted action, which should inc lude: 1. Strengthen/ develop coordination forhealth relatedearly warning and surveillance systems in specific areas (e.g. heat waves, floods, air pollution, ultraviolet radiation, vector borne, water - borne and infectious diseases) through an integrated diseas e surveil lance system. 2. Feedback mechanisms to other ministries responsible for several ecological determinants of health particularly - air, water, food, fuel and human resource. 3. Development of risk maps for climate sensitive diseases for each geographical area. 4. Strengthening/ developing response action based on innovative or new strategies or technological approaches to increase access, early health care advice/ referral and health tracking system incorporating Aadhaar card number to assist surveillance an d generate trends. 5. Undertake case studies and research and pilot test new approaches aimed at building health resilience in climatically sensitive locations. The proposed 'Health Mission' will take a multi -pronged approach to address the health -related aspects of climate change through the strategies listed in the National Action Plan for Climate Change and Human Health (NAPCCHH). The Health Missions seeks coordination with other missions identified under the umbrella of National Action Plan for Climate c hange (NAPCC) listed earlier in this document. The targets achieved by other national missions launched under the NAPCC will also scale down the morbidity and mortality of various types of illnesses. Annexure D Integration of Health Mission with other Ministries and missions on climate change The frequency and magnitude of occurrence of \"morbidity and mortality\", \"acute and chronic\" \"communicable\" or \"Non -Communicable\" illnesses depends on socioeconomic status, residence, occupation, level of n ourishment, underlying illness, availability of safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, overcrowding, pollution, extreme weather, chemical exposures, agricultural practices, governance (local, state and national level), access to health facilities, tra ined/ skilled health manpower, laboratory support, and religious practices etc. The strengthening of the National Programmes under various ministries will raise the level of health of people through direct or indirect impacts by reducing risk factors. To n ame the beneficial national programmes/ schemes are:NamamiGange Programme, Mid Day Meal Programme, Integrated Child Development Schemes, Indira Gandhi MatritvaSahyogYojna, DeenDayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti ormation, GraminBhandaranYojna, Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, Livestock Insurance Scheme, National Urban Livelihood Mission, Smart Cities Mission, National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, National Programme for Prevention and Cont rol of Diabetes, Cardiovascular diseases, Cancer and Stroke , National Mental Health Programme , National Iodine Deficiency Disorder Control Programme , Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP ), National Programme for Control and Treatment of Occupationa l Disease , National Programme for the Health Care for the Elderly , National Programme for Prevention and Control of Deafness and Universal Immunization Programme . The MoHFW seeks to coordinate & collaborate with other Ministries, departments & NGOs/CBOs. These Ministries & Departments are: Ministry of Environment, forest & Climate Change , Ministry of Information & Broadcasting ,Ministry of Human Resource Development ,Indian Council of Medical Research , Ministry of Agriculture ,Medical Council of India , Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Min. of New & Renewable Energy, National Disaster Management Authority , Ministry of Women and Child Development, Indian Instit ute of Tropical Meteorology, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Department of Space , Department of Science & Technology ,Council of Scientific & Industrial Research, Ministry of Home Affairs , Defence Research & Development Organization ,Indian Council of Agricultural research ,National Institute of Malaria Research , Food Safety and Standards Authority of India ,Department of Health Research , National Environmental Engineering Research Institute , Community Based Organizations , Public Health Foundation of India etc. The possible health impacts of other missions under NAPCC are foreseen as follows: Annexure E Water - borne Diseases Food -borne Diseases Malnutrition Other Respiratory, Cardiovascular & other Illness Extreme Weather Related Health Events Zoonotic Diseases 1.

The salient points of recommendations of regional consultations are as follows: Representative from Regional Centre, Indian Meteorological Department suggested to use the term ' Climate Variability' to study the health consequence as Climate Change is more vast and generic term. The geographical distribution, mapping and epidemiology of the diseases like vector borne, water borne etc should be done at the earliest in each state/ UT. \"Personal Cooling Garment \"or equivalent devices developed by other agencies may be advocated for use if it is (these are) found appropriate. Existing surveillance system like IDSP should be u sed for disease related data capture, through expanding of reporting units and regularly conducting review meetings may be weekly. As population is indirectly related and resulting to climate change, population policy may be revised. Vector survival and br eeding are known to be affected by the climate variability hence programme on vector borne diseases control should be revised to check diseases occurrence in new areas. For dealing with the extreme heat events, reconsider the following for issue of health related advisories: o OPD timings in healthcare settings o Drugs and vaccine storage o Norms for Working hours at workplace o School timings etc Detailed plan for each climate sensitive illnesses should be laid down by each state/ UT considering planning for present illnesses and also with scope to include new/ emerging or re-emerging climate sensitive illnesses. The state while drafting their state health action plan for climate change should also refer the Joint Monitoring Meeting report of IDSP. Rapid Respo nse Teams may be trained at state level using infrastructure of CSU, IDSP and medical colleges. Participants proposed rules and regulations formulation should be in place for the factors which are directly or indirectly affecting weather and climate and he nce the human health. Actionable points/ good initiatives/ practices should be shared so as the same can be adopted by other states/ UTs. Chairman proposed a 'Climate Change Health Forum' to include all experts as informal members. This forum will help in sharing of experience,meeting outputs and further it will bring all together to contribute in terms of feedback, suggestions. The available data of states and UT need to be linked to climate/ weather data for which the assurance was given by the representa tive from Regional Centre Meteorological Departments.
