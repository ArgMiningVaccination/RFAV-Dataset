The frequency of testing varied depending on whether there was an outbreak. Vaccines The COVID-19 pandemic has led the world to undertake the largest vaccination campaign in human history. In record time, unprecedented scientific and governmental efforts have resulted in the acquisition of immunizers utilizing different technologies (nucleotide acids, viral vectors, inactivated and protein-based vaccines). Currently, 33 vaccines have already been approved by regulatory agencies in different countries, and more than 10 billion doses have been administered worldwide. Despite the undeniable impact of vaccination on the control of the pandemic, the recurrent emergence of new variants of interest has raised new challenges. The recent viral mutations precede new outbreaks that rapidly spread at global proportions. In addition, reducing protective efficacy rates have been observed among the main authorized vaccines. Besides these issues, several other crucial issues for the appropriate combatting of the pandemic remain uncertain or under investigation. Particularly notewor... International Journal for Research in Applied Science and Engineering Technology (IJRASET) 2021 COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) is a quite contagious disease this is derived from Orthocoronavirinae family. SARS-CoV-2 viruses are single-stranded, plus-stranded RNA virus that infect numerous animal species, inclusive of humans, and cause respiration, neurological, and liver illnesses. SARS-CoV-2 is generally transferred through respiration droplets during close contact including speaking, coughing, sneezing, and shouting. Typical common symptoms of COVID-19 include respiratory symptoms like Fever and cough, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and neurological manifestations. COVID-19 has currently been recognized using a viral nucleic acid RT-PCR test primarily based totally on affected person nasopharyngeal and throat swabs. The CT score could play a important function in the prognosis of COVID-19 infected patients if the RT-PCR test for swabs became negative at an early stage. COVID-19 patients with comorbidites like Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, Asthma, Deep Vein Thrombosis, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Cardio Vascular Disease, Obesity, Renal Disease, Liver Disease and other comorbidities can develope life-threatening situation. Remdesvir is the primary preference of medication, an antiviral agent that works via way of means of inhibiting viral replication in the body. There is a higher death rate in men while in comparison to women, hypothetically because of sex-based immunological or gendered differences. Vaccines are regarded as the maximum efficient way to halt the pandemic. 2021 2021 Background: COVID-19 vaccines related side effects have a determinant role in the public 66 decision regarding vaccination. Therefore, this study has been designed to actively monitor safety 67 and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines globally; Methods: a multi-country three-phase study in68 cluding a cross-sectional survey to test for the short-term side effects of COVID-19 vaccines among 69 target population groups. In the second phase, we will monitor the booster doses side effects, while 70 in the third phase, the long-term safety and effectiveness will be inquired. A validated self-admin71 istered questionnaire will be used to collect data from target population; Results: the study protocol 72 has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with the identifier NCT04834869; Conclusions: CoVaST is 73 the first independent study aims to monitor the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines following booster 74 doses and the long-term safety and effectiveness of vaccines. 75 International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine-related side effects have a determinant role in the public decision regarding vaccination. Therefore, this study has been designed to actively monitor the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines globally. Methods: A multi-country, three-phase study including a cross-sectional survey to test for the short-term side effects of COVID-19 vaccines among target population groups. In the second phase, we will monitor the booster doses' side effects, while in the third phase, the long-term safety and effectiveness will be investigated. A validated, self-administered questionnaire will be used to collect data from the target population; Results: The study protocol has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, with the identifier NCT04834869. Conclusions: CoVaST is the first independent study aiming to monitor the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines following booster doses, and the long-term safety and effectiveness of said vaccines. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 2022 Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease We sought to assess breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections in vaccinated individuals by variant distribution and to identify the common risk associations. The PubMed, Web of Science, ProQuest, and Embase databases were searched from 2019 to 30 January 2022. The outcome of interest was breakthrough infections (BTIs) in individuals who had completed a primary COVID-19 vaccination series. Thirty-three papers were included in the review. BTIs were more common among variants of concern (VOC) of which Delta accounted for the largest number of BTIs (96%), followed by Alpha (0.94%). In addition, 90% of patients with BTIs recovered, 11.6% were hospitalized with mechanical ventilation, and 0.6% resulted in mortality. BTIs were more common in healthcare workers (HCWs) and immunodeficient individuals with a small percentage found in fully vaccinated healthy individuals. VOC mutations were the primary cause of BTIs. Continued mitigation approaches (e.g., wearing masks and social distancing) are warr... Anatolian Current Medical Journal Aim: COVID-19 is an important public health problem in world and Turkey. The present study aimed to compare the clinical and laboratory findings and mortality rates among vaccinated and unvaccinated COVID-19 inpatients.Material and Method: We included patients receiving inpatient treatment in COVID-19 wards of our hospital between April 25 and October 22, 2021. The patients were divided into two groups: those with and without the COVID-19 vaccine. We extracted patient information from anamnesis files and the hospital information system. Then, we recorded the patients' epidemiological and laboratory findings and vaccination status. Patients with at least two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine were considered \"vaccinated.\" We performed Fisher's exact test and Chi-square test to analyze the data. All statistical analyses were performed in SPSS, and a p-value <0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.Results: The study included 63 vaccinated and 83 unvaccinated patients. With a mean...
