I believe that each person has an innate healing power within that may have become blocked. Obstacles to cure may be an offending food, an environmental toxin, a hormone or biochemical imbalance, a painful emotional or physical injury or stress. Without identifying the cause, we are just masking the symptoms. - Treatments are carefully and individually designed to do no harm. - My goal is to promote optimal wellness through education without judgment or blame. - Each person is treated with compassion, dignity, and respect in exploring every dimension involved in the healing process involved towards achieving optimal vibrant health. Acupuncture & Traditional Chinese Medicine Chinese Medicine is based on the concept of building, moving, or balancing Qi, the vital force. After a thorough history and a tongue and pulse diagnosis, I use acupuncture, herbs, cupping, moxibustion, infrared, and tui na massage to rebalance the Qi.
