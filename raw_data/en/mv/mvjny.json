As described in our paper,we made this allowance for several reasons.

Moreover, the adjustment recommended by Torg erson is based on an assumed refusal rate of 10%. Therelevance of cancer patients' refusal rates to that anticipated for postacute general medical patients is not immediately obvious, although the numbers are inter esting. In our study the actual refusal rate was 5%(6/119), a figure described by Parmar as \"a goodapproximation in most [conventional trial] situations.\" 1 Parmar further notes that if refusal rates are low,approaching those occurring after randomisation inconventional trials, there may be no practicaldifference between randomised consent and a standard design with regard to dilution. In all intention to treat analyses, any nonsignificant finding can constitute a type II error. However, in thisstudy we see no additional risk accruing as a result ofthe randomised consent design. 1 Parmar MKB. Randomization before consent: practical and ethical considerations.

Mumps, measles, and rubella vaccine and the incidence of autism recorded by general practitioners:a time trend analysis James A Kaye, Maria del Mar MeleroMontes, Hershel Jick Abstract Objective To estimate changes in the risk of autism and assess the relation of autism to the mumps, measles, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.Design Time trend analysis of data from the UK general practice research database (GPRD).Setting General practices in the United Kingdom. Subjects Children aged 12 years or younger diagnosed with autism 198899, with further analysisof boys aged 2 to 5 years born 198893.Main outcome measures Annual and age specific incidence for first recorded diagnoses of autism (that is, when the diagnosis of autism was first recorded) inthe children aged 12 years or younger; annual, birthcohort specific risk of autism diagnosed in the 2 to 5year old boys; coverage (prevalence) of MMRvaccination in the same birth cohorts.Results The incidence of newly diagnosed autism increased sevenfold, from 0.3 per 10 000 person yearsin 1988 to 2.1 per 10 000 person years in 1999. Thepeak incidence was among 3 and 4 year olds, and 83%(254/305) of cases were boys. In an annual birthcohort analysis of 114 boys born in 198893, the riskof autism in 2 to 5 year old boys increased nearlyfourfold over time, from 8 (95% confidence interval 4to 14) per 10 000 for boys born in 1988 to 29 (20 to43) per 10 000 for boys born in 1993. For the sameannual birth cohorts the prevalence of MMRvaccination was over 95%.Conclusions Because the incidence of autism among 2 to 5 year olds increased markedly among boys born in each year separately from 1988 to 1993 whileMMR vaccine coverage was over 95% for successiveannual birth cohorts, the data provide evidence thatno correlation exists between the prevalence of MMRvaccination and the rapid increase in the risk ofautism over time. The explanation for the markedincrease in risk of the diagnosis of autism in the pastdecade remains uncertain. Introduction The possibility that the mumps, measles, and rubella(MMR) vaccine may be causally related to the risk ofautism is currently causing substantial concern. Thisproposition originated primarily from a publication byWakefield et al in 1998 that described 12 case reportsof children who were diagnosed with ileallymphoidnodular hyperplasia followed by behaviour disordersthat were clinically diagnosed as representing autism. 1 In eight of 12 children the behaviour disorder was\"linked\" in time with MMR vaccination by the parentsor the child's physician. In June 1999 Taylor et al published in the Lancet the results of a study in which they identified childrendiagnosed as having autism in the North East Thamesregion for birth cohorts from 1979 to 1992. 2They reported that the incidence of autism started toincrease in children born in the late 1980s DrugSurveillanceProgram, BostonUniversity School ofMedicine,11 Muzzey Street,Lexington, MA02421, USA J a m e sAK a y e epidemiologist Maria del Mar MeleroMontesepidemiologist Hershel Jick associate professor ofmedicine ejkaye@narsil.com BMJ 2001;322:460-3 460 BMJ VOLUME 322 24 FEBRUARY 2001 bmj.com on 3 February 2021 at Mayo Clinic Libraries.

They also provided estimates of the coverage(prevalence) of MMR vaccination from 1987 to 1995,which rose to over 90% by 19889. They found no temporal association between MMR vaccination and theincidence of autism within one to two years of vaccination, and there was no \"clustering\" of cases in the two tofour months after vaccination. In a subsequent letter to the Lancet 's editor Wakefield described the study by Taylor et al 2as containing a \"fundamental flaw\" and cited data fromthe United Kingdom (north west London) and theUnited States (California) based on the time trend ofautism occurrence by birth cohort in relation to theintroduction of the MMR vaccine. 3In both areas a dra matic increase in the incidence of autism was reportedin temporal association with the rapid introduction ofthe vaccine. We used the UK general practice research database (GPRD) to evaluate further the temporal relation ofMMR vaccine and the incidence of autism. Subjects and methods The data in the UK general practice research databaseare firmly established in numerous publications to beof high quality and completeness 4and, in particular, the recording of vaccinations in this database has beenfound to be virtually complete (H Jick et alunpublished data). 5We initially tried to conduct a case control analysis comparing children who received theMMR vaccine and those not vaccinated in relation tothe diagnosis of autism. Only about 3% of cases andcontrols, however, did not receive the vaccine, andtherefore there was too little information to provide ameaningful estimate of relative odds. We thereforeconducted a time trend analysis to explore the relationof the MMR vaccine and the diagnosis of autism overtime. We identified 305 children aged 12 or younger whose diagnosis of autism was first recorded (firstrecorded diagnosis) during the years 1988 to 1999(from among 3 092 742 person years of observation inthe base population). We reviewed the detailed computer recorded information for each of these children. Weestimated annual incidence (regardless of age at firstrecorded diagnosis) and age specific incidence (regardless of year of first recorded diagnosis). Some practicesstopped providing information before 1999, andtherefore the person time available in the later yearswas smaller than that in the earlier years. Subsequent analyses were restricted to 114 boys born in 198893 who had a first recorded diagnosis ofautism at age 2 to 5 years (2471 months) \u2014that is, dur ing 19909. Annual birth cohorts were analysedseparately. For each annual birth cohort, we estimatedthe four year cumulative incidence (risk) of diagnosedautism with the exponential formula: cumulativeincidence = 1 exp(\u00d3I k\u00c4t), where Ikrepresents the estimated age specific annual incidences for theindividual birth cohort and \u00c4t is one year. The prevalence of MMR vaccination among children registered in the general practice research database within60 days of birth who had at least two years of recordedfollow up was also calculated separately for eachannual birth cohort. Statistical analyses were performed using S TATA, ver sion 7.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas). Results The estimated yearly incidence of diagnosed autismamong children aged 12 years or younger (305 cases)increased sevenfold, from 0.3 per 10 000 person years in1988 to 2.1 per 10 000 person years in 1999. Themedian age at first recorded diagnosis of autism was4.6 years and did not vary substantially over time (table).The peak ages at first recorded diagnosis were 3 yearsand 4 years (fig 1). Two hundred and fifty four of thecases were male. About 81% (248/305) of the cases werereferred to a specialist for evaluation of the diagnosis. To assess more precisely the possibility of a tempo ral association between MMR vaccination and the riskof autism, we analysed data for consecutive annualbirth cohorts of boys born during 198893. For eachannual birth cohort, we estimated the four year cumulative incidence (risk) of a first recorded diagnosis ofautism at age 25 years.

The four year risk of diagnosed autism increased nearly fourfold, from 8(95% confidence interval 4 to 14) per 10 000 for boysborn in 1988 to 29 (20 to 43) per 10 000 for boys bornin 1993 (P < 0.0001 by score test for trend in odds(fig 2)). In contrast, the prevalence of MMR vaccinationamong children registered in the general practiceresearch database with at least two years of follow upwas virtually constant (about 97%) for each successiveannual birth cohort and was similar among males andfemales (data not shown). Among the vaccinated children, the median age at first MMR vaccination was 14 months, and 95% ofthose vaccinated received their first MMR vaccinationby age 20 months. Among 110 cases of autism in boysaged 2 to 5 years born in 198893 for whom MMR vaccination could be assessed, the distribution of age atfirst MMR vaccination was nearly identical to that ofthe population as a whole, and 109 (99%) werevaccinated, a prevalence nearly identical to that in thegeneral population. Discussion Previous publications have reported that the overallincidence of clinically diagnosed autism began to risein the late 1980s, and that the incidence occurspredominantly in boys. 236This study shows that the incidence has continued to increase during the pastdecade. Our analysis of the risk of diagnosed autism forboys aged 2 to 5 years showed a progressive increasefor each successive birth cohort from 1988 to 1993,during which time the prevalence of MMR vaccinationwas over 95%. It should be noted that the MMR vaccineis given first at about 15 months of age and that autismis not typically diagnosed until age 2 years or later. If the MMR vaccine were a major cause of the increasing incidence of autism then the risk of autismin successive birth cohorts would be expected to stoprising within a few years of the vaccine being in full use.This was not the case in our study as the cumulativeincidence for boys ages 2 to 5 years rose almostfourfold in the 1993 birth cohort (with follow up to1999) compared with the 1988 birth cohort, whereasthe prevalence of MMR vaccination was over 95%.Thus no time correlation exists between the prevalenceof MMR vaccination and the incidence of autism ineach birth cohort from 1988 to 1993. We recognise that the diagnosis of autism in our study was not confirmed from original records butconsider that differential misclassification of thediagnosis in vaccinated and unvaccinated children isunlikely to vary over the period of the study. Time trend analysis for the evaluation of the relation of an exposure to an illness is a relatively crudemethod. This is particularly true where the exposureand the illness are both rising during the period ofstudy as such a correlation may be coincidental anddue to changes in other factors that are correlated overtime with the outcome illness. Nevertheless, when theincidence of an illness is rising rapidly in each birthyear cohort at the same time that an exposure is steadyand almost universal, the exposure cannot be theexplanation for the rapid increase in incidence that wasobserved. The increase in recorded diagnoses of autism that we observed in the UK general practice research database could be due to increased awareness of the condition among parents and general practitioners, changing diagnostic criteria, or environmental factors not yetidentified. A strength of our study is that we were ableto use population based data in the general practiceresearch database to estimate the birth cohort specificincidence of autism recorded by general practitionersas well as the prevalence of MMR vaccination. A limitation is that we have not yet obtained and evaluated fullclinical record information from general practitionersto describe more fully the characteristics of childrendiagnosed as having autism and to explore otherpossible explanations for the marked increase in theincidence of this illness during the past decade.Nevertheless, these results provide evidence against acausal relation between MMR vaccination and the riskof autism.

(Accepted 8 February 2000) What parents are told after prenatal diagnosis of a sex chromosome abnormality: interview andquestionnaire study Lenore Abramsky, Sue Hall, Judith Levitan, Theresa M Marteau Abstract Objective To investigate how the prenatal diagnosis of a sex chromosome anomaly is first communicated to parents.Design Health professionals were interviewed by telephone and the conversation was taped; parentswere sent questionnaires at 1 month after diagnosisand those who responded were sent another at6 months.Participants 29 health professionals who had recently informed parents that a sex chromosome anomalyhad been identified in an apparently anatomicallynormal, viable fetus. 23 mothers and partners whohad been informed of such a diagnosis.Main outcome measures Health professionals' knowledge about sex chromosome anomalies andparents' responses to information provided by healthprofessionals.Results Analysis of the telephone interviews identified great variation in what different healthcareprofessionals know, think, and say about the same sexchromosome anomaly. The small numbers and thelow response rate for the questionnaire (39% forwomen and 30% for men) meant that statisticalanalysis was not appropriate.Conclusions It is essential for obstetric units to have an established protocol for giving results and for allstaff who communicate results to parents to haveaccurate, up to date information about the conditionidentified.Introduction Most fetuses and babies with an extra sex chromosome are not identified 1because there are usually no indications for karyotyping.2-6However, a sex chromo some anomaly is sometimes detected prenatally whenamniocentesis is performed to exclude Down'ssyndrome or other serious chromosomal anomalies.Conditions in which there is an extra sex chromosomeare fundamentally different from those such as Down'ssyndrome in which affected individuals have recognisable characteristics that can be explained bylaboratory findings. Prenatal detection of sex chromosome anomalies and other karyotypes or genotypesthat may have no phenotypic consequences or onlymild ones will become more common as testingbecomes more widely available. 7Understanding the difficulties faced by health professionals in disclosingthe prenatal diagnosis of a sex chromosome anomalycan highlight some of the problems that may beencountered during the prenatal detection of otheratypical laboratory findings in fetuses with phenotypesthat are likely to fall within the normal range (table 1). We investigated how the prenatal diagnosis of a sex chromosome anomaly is first communicated toparents. We did not test a hypothesis but hoped to generate discussion about this issue. The first communication to parents is important because it may affect howinformation presented later is interpreted or evenwhether it is sought. 8-10Previous studies have looked at counselling that occurred once clinical geneticists Table 1 Fetal karyotypes and characteristics26 Condition FrequencyCharacteristics Treatment Intelligence quotient Fertility Other considerations 47XXY (Klinefelter's syndrome) 1 in 800 males About 1015 points lower than siblings Infertile May have gynaecomastia Testosterone from puberty 47XYY 1 in 1000 males About 10 points lower than siblings Fertile May have behavioural problems None 47XXX (Triple X) 1 in 1000 females About 20 points lower than siblings Fertile None None45X (Turner's syndrome)* 1 in 2500 females Unaffected Infertile Short stature; may have congenital malformationsOestrogen from puberty; growth hormone *Turner's syndrome is common at conception but 98% of fetuses will be miscarried.Papers Editorial School to: L Abramskyl.abramsky@ic.ac.uk BMJ 2001;322:463-6 463 BMJ 322 24 FEBRUARY 2001 bmj.com on 3 February 2021 at Mayo Clinic Libraries.
