Central to OVH's ethos is resourcing the BILAPOC healing experience and the recognition of the imperative need to establish safe and empowering spaces, where people from all walks of life can address the emotional, physical, and spiritual toll inflicted by systems of oppression. After the Covid-19 pandemic hit in the spring of 2020, OVH shuttered the doors of its healing studio in downtown New Haven, took a short pause, and then made the brave decision to evolve into a virtual healing community moving all of its offerings to the land of Zoom. OVH has served thousands of people with its core free weekly offerings. We are proud of our contributions and grateful to the communities we serve. At this 4 year juncture, OVH has decided to take a much needed hiatus from its active operations. This temporary pause has been prompted by a deep-seated desire to rethink and reconfigure the organization's foundational structure and array of offerings. This pause is not a departure from its core mission, but rather an intentional and reflective interval that OVH is taking to refine and re-envision its role in promoting healing justice and wellness.
