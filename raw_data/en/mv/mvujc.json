Viruses, bacteria, drugs, toxins (poisons/chemicals), excess alcohol intake, or autoimmunity (your immune system attacking your own body), can cause the inflammation. What is a virus? A virus is a small microorganism that is made up of nucleic ac id (either RNA or DNA) and enclosed in an envelo pe of protein. It can mult iply only within the cells of an animal host (or in plants with some types of viruses). Do viruses cause hepatitis? At this time there are five known viru ses that cause hepatitis and liver damage: A, B, C, D, and E. The viruses were nam ed in order of their discovery. These viruses - which may all cause very simila r symptoms - are very different. They differ in how they are transmitted and tr eated, as well as how severely and persistently they may impact the body. Hepatitis A - E A B C D E Transmission Route Fecal/oral route (ingestion of fecal material via contaminated food, water or oral/anal sex) Injection drug use Contact with Infected blood Seminal fluid Vaginal secretions Injection drug use Infected mother to newborn Contact with infected blood or body fluids Infected mother to newborn Not easily transmitted through sex Same as Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Requires co-infection with HBV Fecal/oral route (outbreaks are associated with contaminated water supply in some other countries) Incubation Average 28 days Range 15 - 50 days Average 60 - 90 days Range 45 - 180 days Average 42 - 49 days Range 14 - 182 days Range 21 - 90 days Average 40 days Range 15 - 60 days Symptoms Young children usually have none Adults usually abrupt Jaundice Fatigue Abdominal pain Adults more likely than children to have symptoms Jaundice Fatigue Abdominal pain 80% without symptoms Jaundice Fatigue Dark urine Abdominal pain Loss of appetite Usually abrupt Jaundice Fatigue Abdominal pain Loss of appetite Nausea and Usually abrupt Abdominal pain Loss of appetite Dark urine Fever Jaundice Fatigue 1/12/2009 Page 6 of 41 Symptoms (continued) Loss of appetite Nausea Diarrhea Fever Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Joint pain Nausea vomiting Nausea and vomiting Mortality rate from acute disease 0.3 - 0.6% overall 1.8% in adults >50 years old ~100 deaths/year in the U.S. (rare) 0.5% - 1.0% 0.2 - 0.4% 2 - co-infection to 30% HBV super- infection 1 - 2% 15 - 20% in pregnant women Chronicity No 6 - 10% (adults) 25 - 50% (children <5 years old) 70 - 90% (infants) 85% persistent infection 70% chronic liver disease 2 - 70% No Vaccine Yes Yes No Indirectly (vaccination against HBV protects against hepatitis D) No Prevention Vaccine Post- exposure immune globulin Washing hands Safe sex Not sharing IV drug equipment; bleach & water clean- up Vaccine Post- exposure immune globulin Safe sex Not sharing personal items, IV drug equipment IV drug equipment bleach & water clean-up No vaccine Safe sex Not sharing personal items Not sharing IV drug equipment bleach & water clean-up Indirectly: vaccination against HBV protects against hepatitis D Safe sex No vaccine Avoid potentially contami- nated drinking water What is hepatitis C? Hepatitis C is a RNA virus that is spread by contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person. Hepatitis C is one of the leading known causes of liver disease in the United States. About one third of people with new hepatitis C infection develop symptoms that may include fatigue, mild fever, flu-like illness, nausea and vomiting, stomachache, loss of appetite or jaundice. Up to 80% of people who have just been infected with hepatitis C may have no symptoms. They may not ev en know they are infected. Many people first learn they are infected with this virus when they begin to have symptoms of liver damage. This is often years later. 1/12/2009 Page 7 of 41 People with new (acute) hepatitis C infe ction may be treated, but the timing of treatment and types of treatment to use are still being studied. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definition of acute hepatitis C: http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hepat itis/resource/surveillance.htm#DisSpec AcuteC Between 60% and 85% of persons with hepat itis C infection develop chronic hepatitis C, which persists over a long period of time. Fatigue is the most common complaint of people with chronic disease. Other symptoms may include mild upper right abdominal pain, poor appetite, and muscle and joint pain. What is the liver and what does it do? The following is information from \"C ARING FOR YOUR LIVER,\" Hepatitis Foundation International, 30 Sunrise 07009 1-800- 891-0707, www.hepfi.org/livi ng/liv_caring.html . \"The liver, the largest organ in your body, plays a vital role in regulating life processes. Its primary functions are to refine and detoxify everything you eat, breathe, and absorb through your skin. It is your body's internal chemical power plant, converting nutrients in the food yo u eat into muscles, energy, hormones, clotting factors and immune fact ors. It stores certain vitamins, minerals, and sugars, regulates fat stores and cont rols the production and excretion of cholesterol. The bile, produced by liver cells, helps you to digest your food and absorb important nutrients. It neutraliz es and destroys poisonous substances and metabolizes alcohol. Before you were born it served as the main organ of blood formation. It helps you resist in fection and removes bacteria from the blood stream, helping you to stay healthy. Storing iron is anot her important task it performs. In essence your liver serves as your engine, pantry, refiner y, food processor, garbage disposal and \"guardian angel\". Your liver is your silent partner, your internal chemical power plant, and a non-c omplaining organ. Unfortunately, it doesn't usually let your know it is in tr ouble until the damage is far advanced. It needs your help to keep it healthy. One of the most remarkable accomplishm ents of this miraculous organ is its ability to regenerate. Three quarters of t he liver can be removed and it will grow back in the same shape and form within a few weeks. However, overworking your liver can cause liver cells, the em ployees in your power plant, to become permanently damaged or scarred. This is called cirrhosis. Alcohol, drugs and even some prescribed and ov er the counter drugs such as acetaminophen, as well as viruses, environmental pollut ants and some metabolic disorders can cause liver cell damage. Medicine should never be taken with alcoholic beverages. Remember they are all m ade up of chemicals and could be potentially hazardous to your precious liver cells. 1/12/2009 Page 8 of 41 Fumes from paint thinners, bug sprays, and other aerosol sprays are picked up by the tiny blood vessels in your lungs and carried to your liver where they are detoxified and discharged in your bile. The amount and concen tration of those chemicals should be controlled to prevent liver damage. Make certain you have good ventilation, use a mask, cover your skin and wash off any chemicals you get on your skin with soap and water as soon as possible.\" Why is hepatitis C a major health problem? Hepatitis C is the most common chronic bloodborne infection in the United States. At least four million Americ ans are thought to have been infected with HCV. Of these, about 3.2 million are chroni cally infected. About 70% of persons with chronic hepatitis C infection develop liver disease, which can progress to cirrhosis (scarring), liver failure, and/or canc er of the liver. Severe liver disease from hepatitis C infection accounts for most of the liver transplants in the U.S. Currently, persons aged 40 to 49 years have the highest number of cases of HCV infection, and in this age group, the number of case s is highest in African Americans (6.1 percent). Estimates vary on the percentage of perso ns chronically infected with HCV who go on to develop cirrhosis. These projections can be as low as 2 to 4 percent in children and young women to as high as 20 to 30 percent in middle-aged people who had received blood transfusions. T he following factors have been found to increase the risk of more serious liver disease in persons with chronic hepatitis C: older age at the time of infection; male gender; having a compromised immune system; being also chronically infected with hepatitis B; and higher levels of alcohol use. Lower amounts of alcohol al so may increase the risk of liver dam age associated with HCV. Other factors, including iron overload, nonalc oholic fatty liver disease, schistosomal (parasite) co-infection, m edications that may damage the liver, and environmental contaminants, also may have important effects. It is estimated that 10, 000 to 12,000 people in the Un ited States die each year from chronic hepatitis C. The costs associated with hepat itis C are considerable. It is estimated that well over $600 mi llion are spent nationally each year on medical care and lost wages related to hepatitis C. A study published by Wong and colleagues in the American Journal of Public Health (2000; 90:1562-1569), estimated the fu ture hepatitis C morbidity, mortality, and costs in the United States for the year s 2010 through 2019. They based these estimates on data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, published literature on the morbidity and mortality from chronic liver disease and hepatocellula r carcinoma, and cost estimates for patients with hepatitis C tr eated at a university hospital. Their conservative model projected 165,900 deaths from chr onic liver disease attributable to HCV, 27,200 deaths from hepat ocellular carcinoma, and 10.7 billion dollars in direct medical costs for this disease for the 10-y ear period. For the same time period, 1/12/2009 Page 9 of 41 they projected 54.2 billion dollars cost to society from premature deaths of persons less than age 65 and 21.3 billion dollars in cost incurred as the result of disabilities related to cirrhosis and liver cancer. What other health problems might persons with chronic hepatitis C experience? Persons chronically infected with hepatitis C might also occasionally experience the following health problems: Rheumatoid symptoms such as painful joints Keratoconjunctivitis sicca\u2014a dr ying and inflammation of the outer surfaces of the eyes as a result of insufficient tears Lichen planus\u2014a disorder of the skin consisting of violet-colored, flat lesions that are often itchy. The lesi ons usually occur on the wrists, shins, lower back, or the genital area and sometimes on the scalp. Glomerulonephritis\u2014infla mmation of the kidneys Lymphoma\u2014a type of cancer involving the lymphocytes Cryoglobulinemia \u2014 a condition c haracterized by the presence of cryoglobulins (abnormal plasma pr oteins) in the blood. These cryoglobulins can cause restricted blood flow to the skin and to the vital organs (sometimes). Porphyria cutanea tarda\u2014a condition characterized by the development of bullous lesions (blisters) following mi nor trauma or sun exposure to the skin Psychological disorders\u2014up to 30 to 40 percent of persons with hepatitis C infection experience depression. Why do most persons with hepatiti s C become chronically infected? The hepatitis C virus mutates rapidly. Mu tations or changes in the protein capsid (capsule) that surrounds the virus parti cle may help it evade the body's immune system. Is there a vaccine or other drug to help prevent hepatitis C infection? No vaccines or immune globulin products to prevent hepatitis C are currently available. Developing a vaccine will be difficult because the hepatitis C virus includes several genotypes, and the vi rus undergoes constant mutations. Should people with hepati tis C be vaccinated against hepatitis A and B? Persons with hepatitis C should get hepatitis A and B vaccines to protect the liver from being infected with thes e common viruses. Persons with chronic hepatitis C may suddenly develop life-thr eatening illness if also infected with another hepatitis virus. Vaccines for hepatitis A and B do not provide protection against hepatitis C. 1/12/2009 Page 10 of 41 For information regarding other immunizations: http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/4042hepc.htm How can the healthcare provider obtain reimbursement for clients needing hepatitis A and B vaccines? (Show this to your physician) Adapted from information from the Seattle-King County Department of Public Health in conjunction with Peter Shalit, MD. If routine services are covered : hepatitis A and B vaccines, along with most other vaccines, are considered \"routine injections\" by most insurers. These injections are only covered if the insurer provid es a benefit for \"routine serv ices\" such as physicals and injections. Not all insurers provide a benefit category for \"routine services\". If routine services are NOT covered , vaccine may be reimbursed by using: CPT and ICD 9 codes: when any medical pr ocedure is billed, such as immunizations, the procedure is given a code called a CPT code, and the as sociated diagnosis is given an ICD 9 code. The key is to find the code that will allow immunizations to be covered by the insurer. For HIV+ clients use the immunos uppressed patient diagnosis code . In the case of HIV or other immune system disorders, most insurers will cover hepatitis A & B vaccines because of the risks and costs associ ated with these illnesses. For patients with HIV, hepatitis B vaccine has a specifi c CPT code (90747: hepatitis B vaccine for immunosuppressed patients). Most insurers cover hepatit is vaccines even if the patient doesn't have the \"rout ine services\" benefit. There is not yet a specific CPT code for hepatitis A vaccine for persons with HIV or other immune system disorders. To bill an insurer for the immunization, use the appropriate ICD-9 diagnosis code to identify HIV (ICD-9 code 042) or other immune system disorder, along with the appropriate CPT code (90747 for Hep B immunosuppressed or 90730 for Hep A). For HIV-negative or unknown patient status , use the \"exposure\" dia gnosis code. Insurers will consider payment for hepatitis A & B vaccines when a patient is exposed to hepatitis A or B but does not show signs and/or symp toms of the disease. In these cases you would use the appropriate CPT code (90730 fo r hepatitis A vaccine, 90746 for hepatitis B vaccine) and use the ICD-9 diagnosis code of \"V01.9 = exposure to infectious agent\" (this diagnosis code is appropriate to use in many situations). If denied , identify an appropriate \"h igh-risk group\" for your client. This method usually requires a call to the insuran ce company and, in some cases, a letter written by the doctor following a denial of payment . ) See below for a comprehensive list of risk groups for Hepatitis A & B. Important: to protect your patient's confiden tiality, discuss the Risk Factor/Group with the patient prior to contacting the insurance company! Last: To reduce the number of instances where the insurance company will not cover the vaccine, inquire prior to sending the initial claim to the insurance company. Once a 1/12/2009 Page 11 of 41 claim has been received and denied it w ill take a good deal more effort to receive reimbursement from the insurance company. At that point you woul d need to assess the cost and time associated with the appeal and the specific pa tient's situation; i.e., the patient's ability to pay for vaccine or whet her the patient can be referred to another setting, such as a local STD Clinic. Hepatitis A Risk Groups: Persons in these groups are at risk for hepatitis A virus infection and should be vaccinated: Men who have sex with men Persons traveling to or worki ng in countries that have hi gh or intermediate rates of hepatitis A Children in communities that have high rates of hepatitis A and periodic hepatitis A outbreaks Illegal-drug users Persons who have occupational risk for infection Persons who have chronic liver disease Persons who have clotting-factor disorders Hepatitis B Risk Groups: Persons in these groups are at moderate or high risk for hepatitis B virus infection and should be vaccinated: Men who have sex with men Immigrants/refugees from areas of high HB V endemicity (Asia, Pacific Islands, Sub- Saharan Africa, Amazon Basin, Eastern Europe, Middle East) Children born in the United States to immi grants from areas of high HBV endemicity Alaska natives and Pacific Islanders Household contacts and sex partners of people with chronic HBV infection People who have or who have had sexually transmitted diseases Heterosexuals with more than one sex partner in six months Users of illicit injectable drugs Health care workers who have c ontact with blood and body fluids Adopted children from countries where HBV is endemic Hemodialysis patients Recipients of certain blood products Clients and staff of institutions for the developmentally disabled Inmates of long-term co rrectional facilities References: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A person infected with either acute or chronic hepatit is C may infect other people, especially if no safety measures are taken. The virus is found in the blood and is spread by direct contact with blood and blood products. People who received blood transfusions before 1992 or blood products before 1987 account for 7 - 20% of all hepatitis C cases in t he United States. Donor blood is now carefully tested in the laboratory for hepatitis C. The highest risk of becoming infected with hepatitis C cu rrently is with intravenous drug use. Injecting illegal dr ugs accounts for 60% of all hepatitis C cases. Hepatitis C virus transmission mi ght also occur via intranasal cocaine use, especially if there is sharing of instruments that are contaminated with blood from bleeding nasal membranes. People can be infected with the virus when they use needles, toothbrushes, and nail files that contain blood from an infected person. People who have ac upuncture, body piercing, or tattooing done are at risk if the equipment used is not sterile and was used on persons infected with hepatitis C. These procedures should be done using proper infection control practices that include washing hands, usin g disposable gloves, disinfecting work surfaces, and using sterilized or disi nfected instruments and materials. A small proportion of people with hepatitis C infection report no known history of exposure to blood or to drug use. T hey might have been exposed when a cut or wound came in contact with bl ood from an infected person. Hepatitis C may also be spread through se xual contact, although this is not a very efficient method of transmission. People who are co-infected with the HIV and hepatitis C viruses appear to transmi t the hepatitis C virus more often through sexual contact than those without an HIV infect ion. People with many sex partners are at increased risk of c ontracting hepatitis C. A person with multiple sex partners, regar dless of infection status, should use latex condoms to help prevent the spread of this virus as well as other infections that can be transmitted through sexual contact. People with hepatitis C infection who have one long-term sex partner do not need to c hange their practices. The partner's risk is low, but not absent. To lower this small risk, they can use barrier precautions such as latex condoms and ask their doctor about having their partner tested. More studies on sexual transmission are needed. For every 100 infants born to HCV-infect ed mothers, between 2 and 7 become infected at the time of birth, depending on whether the mother is HCV RNA 1/12/2009 Page 13 of 41 positive at delivery or not. In women who are co-infected with HCV and HIV, up to 20 percent of their babies will become infected with HCV. There is no treatment that can prevent this from happe ning. Avoiding fetal scalp monitoring and prolonged labor after rupture of me mbranes might help reduce the risk of HCV transmission to the infant. Most inf ants who are infected at birth have no symptoms and do well dur ing childhood. More studies are needed to see if these children will have problems later. Current information indicates that babies do not become infect ed with hepatitis C from their mothers' breast milk. Howeve r, mothers who have cracked or bleeding nipples should use formula feedi ng until their nipples are healed. Who are the major high-risk groups for hepatitis C? 1. People who have been notified t hat they have received blood or blood products from a donor who te sted positive for hepatitis C. 2. People who received a blood transfusion or solid organ transplant (such as a kidney, liver, or heart) before July 1992. 3. People with blood clotting pr oblems who received treatment with a blood product made before 1987. 4. People who have ever injected street drugs, even once many years ago. 5. People who were ever on long-term kidney dialysis. 6. Persons with accidental injuries due to contaminated needles or other sharp objects, which hav e been exposed to blood from a hepatitis C positive person. 7. Children born to HCV-infected women. 8. Persons who have received inject ions with non-sterile syringes or received other non-sterile medical pr ocedures. This is primarily a problem in developing countries. What about coinfection with HIV? Among the estimated 40 m illion persons infected wit h Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) worldwide, approximately 4 - 5 million are also chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus. In the United States, an estimated 25 - 30% of persons with HIV infection, or about 300, 000 persons, are coinfected with HCV. For those persons with a history of intr avenous drug use as the most likely mode of HIV exposure, the prevalence of HCV co infection is highest, at 70 - 90%. For those persons whose likely mode of HIV exposure is sexual, coinfection ranges around 5 - 10%. Coinfected persons are more likely to transmit both viruses vertically (from mother to child at birth) and sexually. Coinfection is associated both with higher viral titers of HCV and accelerated disease progression, especially when CD4 levels decline. Within 10 to 15 years, 15 - 25% of coinfected persons develop cirr hosis while only 2.5 - 6.5% of those without HIV (monoinfected per sons) develop cirrhosis. For this reason HCV is considered an opportunistic infection. Liver diseas e associated with HCV is an increasing cause of morbidity and mo rtality in HIV positive persons. 1/12/2009 Page 14 of 41 While HCV in coinfected persons can be successfully treated with pegylated interferon and Ribavirin, the success rate is generally less than in monoinfected people. Nearly two thirds of coinfect ed persons who are tr eated for chronic HCV fail to reduce the virus to undetectable levels (sustained virologic response). What resources are available at no cost for clinicians caring for patients with hepatitis C?

Health care workers who have had acci dental needlesticks from sharps used on an infected source may develop hepatitis C. After needlestick or sharps exposure to HCV-positive blood, about 2 health care workers out of 100 will become infected with HCV. Recent surve ys of health care workers, however, have shown them to have approximately the same prevalence of hepatitis C infection as the general population. Any healthcare worker who is exposed to blood should receive the hepatitis B vaccine. After an accidental needle stick with infectious blood, fewer than one healthcare worker out of 100 (0.3%) will bec ome infected with HIV. Up to 30 out 1/12/2009 Page 15 of 41 of 100 will get Hepatitis B if the exposed person has not been vaccinated and the source is hepatitis B \"e\" anti gen positive (a sign of high in fectivity). If the source is not \"e\" positive, infectivity is lower. What should be done when a health care worker has an occupational exposure to blood or body fluids? Immune globulin and antiviral agents are not recommended for post-exposure prevention of hepatitis C. When HCV infection is i dentified early, the person should be referred for medical management to a specialist knowledgeable in this area. http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pr eview/mmwrhtml/rr5011a1.htm (exposure to HBV, HCV, and HIV) HIV) www.cdc.gov/mmwr/previe to and HIV) The Post-Exposur e Prophylaxis Hotline (for healthcare providers): 1-888-448-4911 Have persons caught the hepatitis C vi rus from having medical or dental procedures in the U.S.? Medical and dental procedures done in the U.S. do not pose a risk for the spread of HCV given that standard infection control practices are adhered to. There have, however, been some isolated repor ts that HCV has been spread between patients in hemodialysis units where supplies or equipment may have been shared between patients, or in isolated incidents w here sterile technique was not used in clinical settings. Several studies of the transmission of HCV in countries outside the U.S. have found evidence of HCV transmission from medical or dental procedures in which needles or other medica l equipment were reused without adequate disinfecti on or sterilization. What should people do if they have hepa titis C or think they are at risk? Many people carry the virus for 20 - 40 years before serious symptoms appear. Most will never develop serious problem s (though drinking alcohol can greatly increase the likelihood of developing serious problems). Persons with hepatitis C can protect their livers from further harm by: 1. Getting a medical evaluation for chronic liver disease and possible treatment. (Persons are encouraged to discuss their disease with their primary healthcare provi der. Gastroenterologists and hepatologists are health care pr oviders who specialize in the treatment of liver diseases and other digestive organ diseases.) 2. Not drinking alcohol. 1/12/2009 Page 16 of 41 3. Consulting their physician or pharmacist before starting any new medicines, including over-the-co unter and herbal medicines. 4. Getting vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. 5. Avoiding work with or exposure to solvents, cleaners, pesticides, etc. Persons with hepatitis C can reduce the risk of infecting others by: 1. Not donating blood, body organs , other tissue, or semen. 2. Not sharing toothbrushes, dental appliances, razors, manicure scissors, or other personal care ar ticles that might have blood on them. 3. Covering cuts and sores on t he skin to keep from spreading infectious blood or secretions. Persons who are injection drug users: 1. Should stop using a nd injecting drugs. If at all possible, they should enter and complete subst ance abuse treatment, including relapse-prevention programs. 2. If they continue to use drugs, t hey can lessen their risk of getting hepatitis C or spreading it to others by: a. Washing hands before and after giving injections. b. Using a new sterile syringe each time they prepare and inject drugs. c. Not reusing or sharing any equipment used to prepare or inject drugs such as syringes , needles, cottons, or water. Otherwise, used equipment should be sterilized or disinfected first (see below). d. Using sterile water to prepar e drugs. Clean tap water can be sterilized by boiling it for one minute. e. Using a new or disinfect ed container (\"cooker\") and a new filter (\"cotton\") to prepare drugs. f. Cleaning the injection site with a new alcohol swab before injection. Sterilizing/disinfecting equipment: Sterilize needles, cookers, and other injection equipment between EACH use. Boiling for 20 minutes will ster ilize equipment and kill HIV and many other disease-producing pathogens. Clean all injection equipment with bleac h. Although this process is less effective than using new equipment eac h time, or sterilizing between each use, it is much easier, less time-cons uming, and may offer a more realistic approach, especially when other options are not available. 1/12/2009 Page 17 of 41 Instructions for bleaching (NOTE: It is not known whether this will kill the hepatitis C virus. Therefore, using new equipment each time and NOT sharing any injecting e quipment is always safest): 1. Fill syringe with water, shak e well, and then empty. Do not empty syringe back into the remaining water. Do this three times to flush out all residue. 2. Fill syringe with full strength chlorine bleach (normal liquid household bleach), shake well, a nd then empty. Do not empty syringe into the remaining bleach supply. Do this three times to allow bleach to cover all surfaces. 3. Fill syringe with water, shake well, and then empty. Do not use water previously used to flush the first time; use fresh water. Do not empty syringe back into the remaining water. Do this three times to flush out all remaining bleach. What are the drug treatment resources in our community? 211 Texas: Dial 211 for information about and referrals to social service agencies and organizations throughout the state of Texas. https://www.211texas.org/211/ What other information should persons with hepatitis C know? 1. HCV is not spread by sneezing, kissi ng, hugging, coughing, food or water, sharing eating utensils or drinking glasses, or casual contact such as shaking hands. 2. Having HCV is not a reason to be excluded from work, school, play, child- care, or other group settings. Persons with hepatitis C can handle food as part of their work without infecting ot hers. Infected health care workers also can continue to work in a health care setting. As recommended for all health care workers, those who ar e HCV-positive should follow strict aseptic technique and standard precaut ions, including appropriate use of handwashing, protective barriers, and care in the use and disposal of needles and other s harp instruments. 3. As noted by Hepatitis Foundation Inte rnational (HFI), \"fatigue is a common problem. Finding a happy balance between relaxati on and activities is helpful. Frequently, short naps between activities or outings prevent overwhelming fatigue at the end of the day. Don't pl an too many activities for one day, instead space them out over a week. Separate the activities requiring a lot of energy with less str enuous ones. Allow yourself time to regroup while still keeping busy. If your workday is exhausting, try arranging flexible hours or a work-fro m-home option. Telecommuting, the computer-modem connection, creates new opportunities everyday.\" 4. HFI further goes on to say, \"In addi tion to the physical symptoms, hepatitis can cause emotional stress. It is important to have people you can count on for support and encouragement. Talk to friends and loved ones about difficulties you experience and what you need from them. People are not 1/12/2009 Page 18 of 41 mind readers, and open discussions can help minimize problems and misunderstandings. Support from lov ed ones and friends makes coping easier. Try not to set unreasonable standards for your self or anyone else.\" 5. Becoming involved with a support group may help both the HCV-infected person and his/her family and/ or significant others.

Test Full Name Purpose of Test Normal Range Comments EIA Enzyme Immunoassay Tests for antibody to HCV Negative Most widely available lab test to check for hepatitis C antibody. Can't tell if infection is new (acute), chronic, or no longer present. The rate of false positives is high in groups of people with low rates of infection. Antibody is detectable within 15 weeks in 80% of people and within 6 months in 97% of people. Negative result is sufficient to exclude HCV diagnosis in immune- competent persons. Inexpensive. RIBA Recombinant Immunoblot Assay Supplemental test to confirm anti-HCV reactivity Negative Widely used in the past to confirm diagnosis of HCV antibody, a marker of past or current infection. PCR is now more widely used. Useful as supplemental test for persons screened in non-clinical settings and in persons with a positive EIA who test negative for HCV RNA. PCR Qual Polymerase Chain Reaction Qualitative Detects actual presence of virus Negative Single negative result may only reflect a transient decline in viral level below the level of detection of the test. Repeat test in 6 months to rule out HCV. Once HCV infection is confirmed, repeat testing using a test with limit of 50 IU/mL or less is not helpful in management of untreated persons except for determining whether an acute infection has resolved spontaneously. A single positive test confirms active HCV replication. 1/12/2009 Page 19 of 41 PCR Quan Polymerase Chain Reaction Quantitative Detects amount of virus Non-detectable Significant variability exists between available tests. Should use same specific assay used initially. Little correlation between disease severity and progression with HCV RNA level but provides information to guide treatment. ALT Alanine Aminotransferase Elevation suggests liver injury or disease Adult/child: 5-35 IU/L or 8-20 U/L (SI units) Elderly/Infant: may be twice as high as adult Formally known as SGPT. Enzyme found primarily in the liver. Most ALT elevations are caused by liver abnormalities. Many commonly used drugs may cause increased ALT levels. Not specific for HCV. Approximately 30% of patients with HCV infection have normal ALT levels. Inexpensive but relatively insensitive means of assessing disease activity. AST Aspartate aminotransferase Liver injury or disease causes a release of this enzyme into blood stream Adult: 8-20 U/L or 5-40 IU/L, females tend to have slightly lower values than males. Elderly: values slightly higher than adult. Child: values similar to adult. Newborn/infant: 15-60 U/L Formerly known as SGOT, an enzyme that exists in liver cells. Pregnancy may cause decreased AST levels. Exercise may cause increased AST levels. Drugs may cause increased levels. Not specific for HCV.

Liver biopsy Type of test: Microscopic examination of tissue. Liver biopsy is a valuable method of gradi ng the severity of disease and staging the degree of fibrosis of the liver. It is also helpful in ruling out other causes of liver disease, such as alcoholic liver inju ry or iron overload. It cannot be used to diagnose HCV infection. There are potential risks asso ciated with the procedure, and the role of liver biopsy in the management of hepatitis C is currently being debated. Possible complications may include puncture of the lung or gallbladder, infection, bleeding and pain, but these complications are rare. Before scheduling the biopsy, the physician will take blood samples to make sure the patient's blood clots properly. T he patient should inform the physician of any medications they take, especially those that affect blood clotting, like blood thinners. The patient wi ll have to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen, and anticoagulants one week before the procedure. For this procedure, a specially desig ned needle is inserted through the abdominal wall and into the liver. A piece of liver tissue is removed for microscopic examination. Liver biopsy is used in the diagnosis of various liver disorders such as cirrhosis, hepa titis, granuloma and tumors. The liver biopsy is performed by a physi cian and takes about 15 minutes. However, after the procedure is finished the patient will stay for observation for approximately 1 to 2 hours. During the liver biopsy the patient lies on hi s/her back or left side. The area to be punctured is anesthetized locally. The pat ient is asked to exhale and hold the exhalation. This causes the liver to descend and reduces the possibility of a punctured lung. Frequently, th e patient practices exhala tion two or three times before insertion of the needle. While the patient is ex haling the physician rapidly introduces the biopsy needle into the liver to obtain liver tissue. The needle is then withdrawn from the liver. The proce dure is generally not painful, but the patient may experience discomfort during t he injection of the local anesthetic and during the needle insertion. A small dressing is placed over the needle insertion sight and the patient will be instructed to lie on his/her right side. In this position the liver is compressed against the chest wall, thereby decreasing the risk of hemorrhage or bile leak. The patient's vital signs are checked frequently for evidence of hemorrhage (increased pulse, decreased blood pressu re) and inflammation of the membrane lining the abdominal cavity (increased temperature). 1/12/2009 Page 22 of 41 The tissue sample is sent to the laborat ory to be examined under a microscope. Abnormal findings (which may indicate liver disease) could include tumors, abscesses, cysts, hepatitis, or infiltrati ve diseases such as amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, fibrosis and cirrhosis. The patient is usually inst ructed to have someone take them home. They should remain in bed (except to use the bathroom) for 8 to 12 hours, depending on the physician's instructions. The patient shoul d also avoid exertion for the next week so that the incision and liver can heal. One might expect some soreness at the incision site and possibly some pain in the right shoulder. This pain is caused by irritation of the diaphragm muscle and sh ould disappear wit hin a few hours or days. Because a favorable response to current HCV therapy occurs in 80 percent of patients with genotype 2 or 3, it may not be necessary to perform liver biopsy in these patients to make a decision to treat. Genotyping There are six known genotypes and more than 50 subtypes of the hepatitis C virus. The different genotypes vary by geographic region. Approximately 70 - 75% of persons in the United States hav e genotype 1, with fr 1b. The genotype of infection is helpful in defining the epidemiology of hepatitis C. Knowing the genotype or serotype (genoty pe-specific antibodies) of HCV is helpful in making recommendations and co unseling regarding therapy. Patients with genotypes 2 and 3 are almost three times more likely to respond to therapy with alpha interferon or the combinatio n of alpha interferon and ribavirin. Furthermore, when using combination therapy, the recommended duration of treatment depends on the genotype. For patients with genotypes 2 and 3, a 24- week course of combinat ion treatment may be adequat e, whereas for patients with genotype 1, a 48-week course is re commended. For these reasons, testing for HCV genotype is essential prior to treatment. Once the genotype is identif ied, it need not be tested again; genotypes do not change during the course of infection. There is little evidence showing differences in clinical outcomes of disease progression among people with different genotypes. It is possible to get re-infected by a second genotype. Who should be tested for HCV infection? The Centers for Disease C ontrol and Prevention have developed the following set of recommendations for sc reening and testing for HCV: Persons who should be tested routinel y for HCV infection based on their increased risk for infection: 1/12/2009 Page 23 of 41 Persons who ever injected illegal drugs, including those who injected once or a few times many years ago Persons who were treated for clo tting problems wit h a blood product made before 1987 when more advanced methods for manufacturing the products were developed Persons who were notified that t hey received blood from a donor who later tested positive for hepatitis C Persons who have ever been on long-term kidney dialysis Persons who received a blood tr ansfusion or solid organ transplant before July 1992 when better testi ng of blood donors became available Persons who have signs or symptoms of liver disease (e.g., abnormal liver enzyme tests) Persons with documented HIV infection Persons who should be tested routi nely for HCV based on a recognized exposure: Children born to HCV-infected women (after 12 - 18 months old) Healthcare workers after exposure (e .g., needle sticks or splashes to the eye) to HCV-positive blood Persons for whom routine testing for hepatitis C infection is of uncertain need: Persons who have received trans planted tissue (e.g. corneal, musculoskeletal, skin, ova, sperm) Intranasal cocaine and other non-injecting illegal drug users Persons with a history of tattooing or body piercing Persons with a history of multiple sex partners or sexually transmitted diseases Long-term steady sex partners of hepatitis C-positive persons Persons for whom routine testing is not necessary: Health-care, emergency medical, and public safety workers unless a needle stick or sharps exposure has occurred from a positive source Pregnant women unless they have risk factors for HCV infection Household (nonsexual) contacts of HCV-positive persons unless an exposure to a contaminated source has occurred such as razors or sharps from an HCV-pos itive household member Where can I be tested? Persons with insurance coverage, Medi care or Medicaid should see their physician for hepatitis C testing. 1/12/2009 Page 24 of 41 Confidential hepatitis C testing may be available for those at highest risk . Call Austin/Travis County Health & Human Se rvices Department at (512) 972-5580 for further information. What are the resources for Veterans? The Central Texas Veterans Health Care System serves client s from Hillsboro to San Marcos, with approximately 50,000 vete rans in the cent ral Texas area. Austin has a large clinic an d there are smaller clinics in the surrounding area. It is estimated that there are 5,000 vete rans with hepatitis C in this area, with approximately 35% of these in Austin. Testing is done through the VA primary care clinics and the client is then referred to a hepatitis C clinic. Clients are normally seen within 30 days of t he initial consult with a primary care provider. Treatment is offered to eligib le clients who meet treatment criteria based on NIH and VA guidelines. All c lients are provided needed vaccines and followed up on a yearly basis. Clients with meld scores of 15 and above are referred for evaluation of liver transplantation. There are four designated transplant facilities. Call (800) 423-2111 for more information. What are the treatments for ch ronic hepatitis C infection? In the U.S., four different treatment regimens have been approv ed for hepatitis C: 1. Interferon used alone 2. Combination therapy wit h interferon and ribavirin 3. Pegylated interferon used alone 4. Combination ther apy with pegylated inte rferon with ribavirin Combination therapy results in better tr eatment responses than with interferon alone, but the highest response rate s have been achiev ed with pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin . Genotype determinations influence treatment decisions. Current ly the best indicator of effective treatment is a sustained viral response (SVR), defined by the absence of detectable HCV virus in the blood at 24 weeks after the end of treatment. Sustained viral response rates of about 45 - 50% have been achieved in patients with genotype 1 compared to rates of abo ut 75 - 80% in pati ents with genotypes 2 and 3. Twenty-four wee ks of treatment appears to be sufficient for persons with genotypes 2 and 3, while patient s with genotype 1 nee d 48 weeks of treatment. Ribavirin, when used alone, does not work. Interferon may be given several times a week or daily as an injection. Pegylated Interferon is usually given once 1/12/2009 Page 25 of 41 a week as an injection. Ribavirin come s in capsules that are taken by mouth twice each day. Some studies suggest that treatment with in terferon and ribavirin may help reduce the risk of liver cancer in HCV patient s with cirrhosis, but more studies are needed to confirm this relationship. What are the side effects of interferon therapy? Periodic blood tests are required to monitor white blood cells and platelets because interferon may interfere with t heir production by depressing the bone marrow. Common side effects of interfer on (occurring in more than 10 out of 100 patients) include: fatigue, muscle ac hes, headaches, nausea and vomiting, skin irritation at the injection site, low-grade feve r, weight loss, irritability, depression, mild bone marrow depression (shows up in the white blood cell and platelet counts), and reversible hair loss. Most of these side effects are mild to moderate in severity and can be managed. Interferon has an antigrowth effect that could be damaging to the developing embryo and fetus; therefore, it should not be taken during pregnancy. What are the side effects of ribavirin? The most common side effects of ribavirin are: anemia, fatigue and irritability, itching, skin rash, and nasal stuffiness, si nusitis, and cough. Ri bavirin should not be given to women who are pregnant or who are not using an effective method of birth control. A male patient should not impregnate a female partner while he is taking ribavirin. Ribavirin has been fo und to cause birth defects in animal studies. This drug can also make some persons' skin more sensitive to the sunlight, so excessive sun exposure should be avoided while on ribavirin. What can be done about the side e ffects of interferon or ribavirin? You should report what you are feeling to y our doctor. Giving interferon at night or lowering the dose of the drug may re duce some side effects. In addition, taking acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol) can reduce flu-like symptoms. Antihistamines may relieve nasal stuffines s from ribavirin therapy. Check with your doctor, however, before using acet aminophen, antihistamines, or any other drugs to alleviate these symptoms. Patient adherence is critical to success of treatment of hepatitis C. Patients and healthcare providers should both be aler t to problems with side effects of treatment. Psychological conditions, particularly depression, are common among persons with hepatitis C and are frequent si de effects of interferon. A person's mental health should be assessed bef ore beginning therapy and monitored regularly during therapy. Antidepressant s may be useful in the management of depression. People with a hi story of past IV drug us e should be encouraged to obtain appropriate care before beginning in terferon injections (such as 12-step programs, etc.). 1/12/2009 Page 26 of 41 Who should be treated? The June 2002 NIH Consensus Statement stat es that all patients with chronic hepatitis C are potential candidates for t herapy. Treatment is recommended for those with an increased risk of developing cirrhosis (when healthy liver cells are killed and replaced with scar tissue). This is defined as having viral load levels higher than 50 IU/mL, a liver biopsy with port al or bridging fibrosis (formation of fibrous tissue), and at least moderate in flammation and necrosis (tissue death). Many people with chronic hepatitis C have not been treated because of their injection drug use, signific ant alcohol use, age, or other conditions. But it has been shown that HCV therapy has been successful even when people have been using drugs or alcohol, or are on dai ly methadone. Continued alcohol use during therapy affects response to treat ment, and alcohol abstinence is strongly recommended before and during antiviral therapy. Treatment should be considered on a case-by-case basis. A large number of HCV-infected persons in the United States are in prison. Also, people who are uninsured or have publicly funded healthcare may be more likely to be infected with HCV. Successful treatment may reduce transmission. All HIV-infected persons s hould be screened for HCV. Patients with both chronic hepatitis C and HIV infection may have a faster course of HCV disease. Treatment is recommended on a case-by-case basis. Many factors must be considered in starting treatment, including genotype, presence of fibrosis, motivation of per son, symptoms, presence of other diseases, and the person's age. American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice guideline: Diagnosis, Management, and Treatment of Hepatitis C: https://www.aasld.org/eweb/docs/hepatitisc.pdf Can children be treated for chronic hepatitis C? Diagnosis and testing (including liver biop sy) of children suspected of having chronic HCV should proceed as with adults. Because of the high rate of clearance of t he HCV virus within the first year of life, and the level of anxi ety that may be caused by an early positive test, routine testing for HCV RNA in infants bor n to HCV-infected mothers is not recommended. Testing for anti-HCV may be performed at 12 - 18 months or later. If an earlier diagnosis is desi red, PCR for HCV RNA may be performed at or after the infant's first well- child visit at 1 to 2 months. Children aged 3-17 who are infected wi th hepatitis C and are considered appropriate candidates for treatment may receive therapy with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin, administered by those ex perienced in treating children. 1/12/2009 Page 27 of 41 Safety and effectiveness of treatment in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. Treatment of children under the age of 3 years is contraindicated. What about herbal remedies - are they helpful or can they be harmful? It is important to check with your doc tor or pharmacist before taking herbal medicines. Some herbal products can act ual cause injury to the liver. Harmful products include (but are not limited to t he following): comfre y; gordologo herbal tea; and alternative medicine in hepatitis C. In: Hepatit is C, ed. By Liang TJ, and Hoofnagle JH , San Diego: Academic Press, 2000). Some of the herbal medici nes that have been used in treating hepatitis C are CH100, 90-11 granules. Strader and Zimmerman (see above reference) note in their review \"these agents may be effective either in pr omoting recovery or in [lessening] the ongoing liver injury.\" They caution, however, that none of these agents have been studied adequately for their effectiveness or safety. Persons with liver disease should use all herbal and nonprescription drugs with caution. An objective reference about di fferent herbal remedi es can be found in PDR for Herbal Medicines , 2nd edition, Montvale, NJ: Medical Economics Company, 2000. U.S. Food & Drug Administra tion, Center for Food Safe ty & Applied Nutrition: http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/supplmnt.html Where can I find information on alternative therapies? Acupuncture: http://www.nccaom.org Massage: www.amtamassage.org National Center for Complement ary and Alternative Medicine: http://nccam.nih.gov 1/12/2009 Page 28 of 41 What about diet? Diet and Hepatitis C* Foods and Beverages Recommendations General Diet Eat a well-balanced, low-fat diet. A diet high in complex carbohydrates may be helpful in providing calories to maintain weig ht. Frequent small meals may be more easily tolerated. Alcohol Total avoidance of all alcohol is recommended. Excessive intake can lead to cirrhosis. Damage can occur in even some moderate \"social drinkers.\" Iron Avoid taking iron supplements and restrict intake of iron-rich foods such as red meats, liver, and iron- fortified cereals. Avoi d cooking with iron-coated cookware and utensils. Ex cess iron can be damaging to the liver, and high iron levels can reduce the response rate of patients to interferon. Fat Maintain normal weight. Overweight people often have liver-related abnormalities such as fatty deposits in the liver, which improv e when weight is lost. Diabetics should follow a sugar-restricted diet. Sodium Cirrhosis may lead to abnormal accumulation of fluid in the abdomen (ascites). Patients with this condition must restrict sodium (salt) . Sodium intake should be 1000 mg. a day or less. Patients without ascites should not overindulge in salt intake, but restrictions are not as severe. Protein Adequate intake is needed to build and maintain muscle mass and to assist in liver healing and repair. Individual intake is de pendent on one's weight. *See chart below. Patients should consult their physician regarding specific recommendations. Weight Recommended average protein intake for regeneration of liver cells in non-cirrhotic patients Maximum recommended protein intake for patients at risk for encephalopathy 100 lbs. 45-68 gm.

USDA Food Pyramid: http://www.mypyramid.gov/ 1/12/2009 Page 29 of 41 What about liver transplants for persons with HCV? Liver transplantation is surgery to remove a diseased liver and replace it with a healthy liver from an organ donor . A liver transplant is necessary when diseases such as chronic hepatitis C infection caus e cirrhosis to such an extent that the liver stops working. Liver transplantation is usually done wh en other medical treatment for end-stage liver disease cannot keep a damaged liver f unctioning. About 80 to 90 percent of people survive after liver transplantation. Survival rates have improved over the years because of drugs like cyclospori ne and tacrolimus that suppress the immune system and keep it from attacki ng and damaging the new liver. The recurrence of HCV infecti on (as detected by polymeras e chain reaction) almost always occurs after liver transplant in persons with HCV infection. However, despite re-infection, survival after transpl ant is fairly good. For more information regarding organ donation, ca ll Texas Organ Sharing Alliance (Austin office) at 512-459-4848 or go to United Network for Organ Sharing at www.unos.org . For more information regarding transplanta tion, go to National Foundation for Transplants at www.transplants.org or TransWeb Organ Transplantation Information Site at http://www.transweb.org . How should a person who is diagnosed with HCV handle their work and employer? A person with hepatitis C infection can face challenges in the workplace. First, if coworkers or employers find out about his/ her infection, they may become very concerned about the possibility of transmission of the vi rus to them. Education about transmission is important to reduce anxiety and help prevent discrimination against the employee with hepatitis C. Lite rature from local, state, or federal health agencies can also he lp clear up misconceptions about the disease such as \"airborne spread\" or being able to get it \"from the restroom or telephone.\" It is important that the em ployee with hepatitis C not share personal items with coworkers such as combs, nail files, and toothbrushes. These items could have minuscule amounts of blood on them, which could transmit the virus to someone with non-intact areas of ski n or mucous membranes. HCV-infected employees will need to deci de whether to inform their employers about their disease status. Each perso n needs to consider the impact that his/her disease will have on their job in te rms of the effect of work on their health; the effect of their health condition on work performance; and chances of exposing other workers or customers to the virus (very low probability). Under the Americans with Di sabilities Act (ADA) an employer must help a person with hepatitis C identify ways to accommodat e his/her disability. However, the employee must still be able to perform the essential functions of his/her job. Reasonable accommodations that may hel p a person with hepatitis C function optimally in his/her job include: 1/12/2009 Page 30 of 41 Flex time Shorter workdays Telecommuting from home To be protected under the ADA, a person mu st inform their employer that they have hepatitis C. If unable to work, a person with hepatitis C may need to apply for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI).

National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Database: www.clinicaltrials.gov 1/12/2009 Page 34 of 41 What are the reporting guidelines health care professionals must follow for infectious diseases incl uding hepatitis C? Beginning 12/20/00, all newly diagnosed case s of hepatitis C were reported to the local, regional or state health departm ents. As of Spring 2007, only acute cases of hepatitis C are reported. Health professionals may call (512) 458-7676 or (800) 705-8868 for information and obtain reporting forms at http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/idcu What is the government doing about th e hepatitis C problem in the U.S.? In 1999, the Texas legislature passed House Bill 1652 that earmarked state money for seroprevalence studies, public and professional educ ation concerning hepatitis C, and provided f unds for screening persons for HCV. These funds were cut in 2004 because of budgetary constraints. In 2001, the following bills were passed in Texas: House Bill 767 requires six hours of training during each tw o-year licensing period relating to HIV, hepatitis C, and sexually transmi tted diseases in continuing ed ucation for chemical dependency counselors. House Bill 768 amended the Health and Safety Code to change the name of the HIV/AIDS Interagency Coordinating Council to the Interage ncy Coordinating Council for HIV and Hepatitis, and to include policies and program activities re lating to hepatitis among the council's concerns. The bill added the Texas Departme nt on Aging and the Texas Work force Commission to the list of agencies represented on the council. This council was disbanded due to budgetary constraints. Senate Bill 338 required the Texas Department of He alth to develop a state plan for the prevention and treatment of Hepatitis C. House Bill 2650 amended the Occupations Code to require a licensed nurse who renews a license on or after June 1, 2002 to participate in at least two hours of continuing education related to hepatitis C in a two-year licensing peri od. This was a one-time requirement. Senate Bill 1006 requires a licensed hospital, in a case of accidental exposure of certified emergency medical services personnel, a firefight er, a peace officer, or a first responder who renders assistance at the scene of an emergency or during transport to the hospital, to blood or other body fluids of a patient who is transported to the hospital, to take reasonable steps to test the patient for hepatitis B or hepat itis C if the report shows there is significant risk to the person exposed. In January 2003, a federal bill \"The Hepat itis C Epidemic Control and Prevention Act\" was drafted. This bill closely mi rrors the Texas House Bill 1652 passed in 1999.
