No Coord ination Provision In spite of the rules listed above , the plan that has no provis ion regarding coordinatio n of benefits will pay first. If you are covered under a motor vehicle or homeowner's insurance policy which provides benefits for medical expenses resulting from a motor vehicle accident or accident in your own home, you shall not be entitled to benefits under this Agree ment for injuries arising out of such accident to the extent they are covered by the motor vehicle or home owner's insurance policy.
