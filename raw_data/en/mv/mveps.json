Combined with a free blood glucose meter upgrade and reading downloads, we make the self-management of diabetes easier with expert support and advice. What is diabetes? Diabetes is a complex condition affecting the entire body. Requiring daily self-care, diabetes can have a significant impact on quality of life and life expectancy. While there is no known cure, you can live a long and enjoyable life by learning about and effectively managing your condition. With three types of diabetes - type 1, type 2 and gestational - all are complex and should be taken seriously. How does it affect the body? Someone with diabetes is unable to maintain healthy levels of glucose - a form of sugar and our main energy source - in the blood. Unhealthy levels of glucose in the blood can lead to both long and short term health complications. In order to function properly, our bodies need to convert glucose from food into energy. A hormone called insulin is essential for this conversion. In people with diabetes, insulin is no longer produced or production is not sufficient. When people with diabetes eat glucose it's unable to be converted into energy. Instead, the glucose stays in the blood and results in high blood glucose levels. Blood glucose levels (glycaemia) can be monitored and managed through self-care and treatment. Diabetes risks Diabetes is is a serious condition with a range of potential complications, including: - Increased risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney failure and disease, limb amputation, depression and anxiety - Blindness in working age adults Symptoms Type 1 diabetes can often be diagnosed quickly as symptoms can be sudden and life-threatening. Type 2 diabetes may not be noticed at all, while symptoms may be seen as part of getting older. Common symptoms of diabetes include: - Increased thirst - More frequent urination - Feeling tired and lethargic - Increased hunger - Cuts that heal slowly - Itching and skin infections - Blurred vision - Unexplained weight loss (type 1) - Gradual weight gain (type 2) - Mood swings - Headaches - Dizziness - Leg cramps Prevention Type 1: Currently, type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented. Researchers are currently studying the autoimmune process and environmental factors that lead to development in order to prevent the occurrence in the future. Type 2: It is estimated that 58% of type 2 diabetes can be prevented, or the onset delayed, through positive lifestyle changes including healthy weight maintenance, regular physical activity, managing blood pressure and cholesterol and not smoking. Immunisation Service Demonstrated to be a practical and cost-effective public health intervention, immunisation programs prevent around 2.5 million deaths per year worldwide. Not only protecting individuals, vaccinations protect the community by increasing the overall level of immunity and minimising spread of infection; also known as the concept of herd immunity. With one of the most comprehensive publicly funded immunisation programs in the world, Australia has been able to minimise occurrences of a range of diseases, including tetanus, diphtheria, haemophilus influenzae type B, poliomyelitis and more. The National Immunisation Program provides routine childhood immunisations for all children in Australia free of charge. A vaccination dose may contain vaccines against one specific disease or provide immunity against several. This helps to reduce the number of injections required. What we do Our qualified pharmacists are trained to administer a number of vaccinations to the adult public, including the yearly flu vaccine (fluvax), measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) and the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine (Boostrix aka the whooping cough), hepatitis A and Cholera. This is a paid service for those who may not see their doctor to maintain a vaccination schedule. This service may not be suitable for all and you might be referred to your doctor in some situations. Side effects Immunisations are safe and effective, however all medication can come with some side effects. In virtually all cases, immunisation side effects are not as serious as symptoms of actual diseases. If experienced at all, side effects are usually minor and temporary. Side effects can include: - Mild fevers - Pain and redness at the injection site - Muscle aches - Tiredness Things to remember - Immunisation from an early age is recommended for all children in Australia - The National Immunisation Program outlines recommended vaccines and ages to obtain them - Some groups are at higher risks than others and may require additional vaccinations - Remain within the clinic for at least 15 minutes following your vaccination to be monitored for side effects - Serious side effects or allergic reactions to vaccines are rare How to book your vaccination Simply follow the link below or call Brassall Pharmacy on 3201 6570 [https://www.medadvisor.com.au/Network/BrassallPharmacy](https://www.medadvisor.com.au/Network/BrassallPharmacy) Daily Living Aids We stock a wide collection of the Making Life Easy range of daily living aid products.
