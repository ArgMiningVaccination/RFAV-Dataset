No. The hepatitis B vaccine is a preventive vaccine. People who have a current infection or have recovered from a past infection receive no benefit from the hepatitis B vaccine series, though there is no risk to receiving the series. The hepatitis B vaccine is important for family members, sexual partners and close household contacts. Individuals should be tested and vaccinated if they do not have a current infection or have not recovered from a past infection. Additional Resources: Find more [Frequently Asked "}
