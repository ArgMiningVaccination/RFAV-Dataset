ABSTRACT Added study abstract Made consistent with updated TACL protocol format. EXPERIMENT AL DESIGN SCHEMA Referenced Protocol Section 4.2 for more details regarding rationale for Fitbit distribution timing differences between intervention arm and control arm. Added clarification of EOI and EOC acronyms Clarified acronyms in the schema and provided protocol reference to explain timing of Fitbit distribution for control vs intervention arm 1.0 1.1 Added grammatical corrections and clarifications to be consistent with the statistical sections of the protocol. Improved clarity of protocol verbiage 3.3 Clarified that the age criteria should be determined at diagnosis Clarify the age criteria is applied at time of diagnosis of ALL and not the time of enrollment into study 3.4 Explicitly state an eating disorder excludes a patient from enrolling into the trial. While this was previously included under \"psychiatric disorders,\" explicitly stating highlights this exclusion criteria to ensure it is not missed 4.0 Clarified that standard of care approaches to physical therapy and dietary education differ among institutions and are allowed on the control arm. Data will be captured in the eCRF. Clarifies that the trial does not dictate standard of care fo r dietitian and physiotherapy involvement for the control arm. As standard of care likely differs among sites, relevant data for the control arm will be captured for future comparison. 4.1 4.2 Where feasible, RD (Registered Dietitian) visits should be conducted in person, but may be held virtually if required. Intended to provide reasonable flexibility to obtain the dietary intake data and conduct the RD guidance should in -person RD visits become not feasible due to COVID resurgence or other exigencies. 4.2 Added that PT (Physical Therapy) visits may occur up to and including chemotherapy day 8 Due to logistics surrounding the requirements for a PT visit, timing for the initial PT visit was broadened to provide additional flexibility surrounding chemotherapy initiation. T2020 -003 Protocol version 05/28/2021 1SEP 2022 5 CONFIDENTIAL TACL Internal Distribution Only SECTION CHANGE RATIONALE 4.2 Added rationale for why Fitbits are provided at different time points for control and intervention arms. Clarified that the Fitbit is part of the intervention during induction (to reduce sedentary behavior/physical inactivity) so is not provided to patients in the control arm. Following induction, the intervention is compl eted, and comparison between arms of Fitbit data for activity levels during the follow -up period will be informative as a metric of sustained efficacy from the intervention. 5.1.4 Added that antibiotic prophylaxis should be added to medications that should be reported in the eCRF Antibiotic prophylaxis would qualify as it influences rate of infectious toxicity. While an exhaustive list is not provided in protocol, antibiotic prophylaxis is now common enough to warrant specifically listing as an exampl e 6.1 Clarified that Treatment data (i.e., regimen, dose -reductions, etc) will be collected Reconciles discrepancy between database and protocol to clarify that treatment regimen and subsequent modifications will be collected. Chemotherapy administered is important context for this integrated trial. 6.1 Clarified that \"*\" indicates a reference to the intervention arm only Clarified language regarding DXA scans Removed \"device,\" which was incorrectly added. Clarified verbiage and corrected typos in the Assessment Table. 6.1 Added that PT visits may occur up to and including chemotherapy Day 8 Clarified that RD visits may be done virtually if required and as applicable. Reconciled the Assessment Table footnotes to match the timing and/or location of visits as described above for RD and PT visits in sections 4.1 and 4.2. 6.4 Clarified the follow up period is 5 years from completion of protocol therapy (i.e., this T2020 -003 trial) and not the patient's chemotherapy which continues for multiple years afterwards. Clarified confusion between protocol therapy (i.e., this protocol) and chemotherapy (i.e., the underlying regimen). EFS and OS to be calculated from end of p rotocol therapy, for a duration of approximately 5.3 years from diagnosis. Follow -up peri od from this change is ~2 years shorter, while maintaining adequacy of follow -up to answer the survival objectives. 7.0 Clarified that these are requested integrated biology specimens and that patients who refuse specimen collection may remain on protocol therapy and on study (e.g., those who refuse phlebotomy, Jehovah Witnesses, other reasons). All integrated biology is for research only, is not for safety monitoring, and contribute primarily to the exploratory aims. This additional notation clarifies that all patients may remain on study (and thus evaluable for the primary and secondary aims) even without providing integrated biology.

There were no substantive changes to the statistical design itself. Editorial changes made to improve clarity of the protocol. 10.3 10.3.5 Removed CRi as a response Editorial clarificatio ns CRi was removed as outmoded definition in era of MRD disease evaluation. Editorial corrections made to improve clarity of the protocol. 11.1 Added acronyms for AE and SAE Editorial corrections made to improve clarity of the protocol. 11.2 11.2.1 11.4 Clarified that the targeted AEs need to be reported in both arms even if not related to the protocol intervention. Separate from AE safety monitoring, certain toxicities are required for reporting for research purposes. Revised language to be consistent with the TACL protocol format Clarified verbiage to indicate toxicities being reported for research purposes versus adverse events required for safety monitoring. Made consistent with updated TACL protocol format. 12.1 Added language regarding compliance Made consistent with updated TACL protocol format. 12.4 Revised language to be consistent with the TACL protocol format. Made consistent with updated TACL protocol format. INFORMED CONSENT Removed reference to collecting waist circ umference in two weeks Corrected to make consistent with the body of the protocol. INFORMED CONSENT Clarified patients may refuse the blood and marrow collection and remain on trial Reconciles discrepancy with protocol verbiage for requested specimens. All specimens re quested are for research purposes, are exploratory in nature, and do not relate to saf ety monitoring - as such, patients may refuse and remain on study.

ABSTRACT Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric malignancy. Overweight and obese pediatric ALL patients have increased risk of relapse and poorer survival. Recently, we demonstrated that overweight patients also had higher rates of minimal residual disease (MRD) at end of induction; MRD is one of the most prognostic markers for eventual relapse. Even normal weight children gain significant body fat due to chemotherapy and develop much of the same physiology as those overweig ht. The Improving Diet and Exercise in ALL (IDEAL Trial) demonstrated that a comprehensive and personalized diet and exercise intervention during ALL induction therapy can reduce the risk of MRD, fat gain in those overweight, and chemotherapy -induced insulin resistance. The IDEAL2 trial is a successor, randomized Phase 2 trial enrolling 230 patients through the TACL pediatric leukemia consortium to investigate an updated diet, exercise, and sedentary behavior intervention during ALL induction therapy (28 da ys). Patients will be randomized between the IDEAL2 intervention and routine care. Following induction, patients will be followed for 2 months until the end of the next treatment phase. The primary endpoints for the study are (1) to reduce MRD and (2) to l imit chemotherapy -induced fat gain. The secondary endpoint for the trial will examine adherence to the intervention across participating centers. Exploratory endpoints investigate potential improvements in rates of toxicity, patient -reported quality of lif e, and biologic exploration of the underlying mechanism of overweight -induced chemotherapy resistance in ALL.

Body mass index (BMI) normalized for age/sex is a well -validated surrogate measure for body composition in children and adults. BMI has been used to study the effect of overweight/obesity (OW/OB) patients on clinical outcomes from ALL therapy . From these studies, OW/OB h as emerged as a significant contributor to risk for relapse and poorer survival in children and adults newly diagnosed with NCI/Rome high -risk B -ALL ( HR B -ALL).1-6 Multiple studies have shown that OW/OB increases risk for relapse and death by 31 -50%,2,3 a finding we confirmed by meta - analysis of over 8,000 children.5 We have shown that the adverse impac t off OW/OB on ALL outcomes begins from the very beginning of therapy; in a cohort of ~200 children treated with Children's Oncology Group (ALL) regimens, patients with hig her BMI were more likely to retain minimal residual disease (MRD), a marker of chemoresistant leukemia , following induction (Fig. 1A) . Being OW/OB at diagnosis also added to relapse risk beyond that from MRD alone (Fig1 B). Multivariable analysis controlling for traditional predictors found obesity was associated with a more than two -fold increased risk for MRD (OR 2.57, 95%CI 1.19 -5.54,p=0.016).4 The associat ion of OW/OB with relapse has since b een replicated in the recently concluded multi -consortia adolescent and young adult (AYA) ALL trial C10403.6 Of note, while this association was demonstrated in children treated with COG regimens, and AYA treated with COG -style indu ction therapy on C10403, a similar analyses in children treated within the St Jude Children's Research Hospital Total series did not demonstrate the same effect.7 The increased risk for MRD may therefore be limited to patients receiving a \"four or similar ; these regimens are nonetheless used to treat a significant majority of pediatric and AYA ALL in the United States. As persistent MRD at the end of induction (EOI) for ALL has emerged as an important predictor of relapse ,8-10 As a result, MRD at EOI and/or end of consolidation (EOC) typically results in escalation of therapy intensity for many patients (e.g., immunotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT] ),11-13 thereby increasing acute and long -term morbidity. Finally, OW/OB is associate d with acute treatment toxicity, including dose -limiting hepatic and pancreatic damage,14-16 thrombosis,16,17 and possibly further increasing relapse risk.19-21 Being OW/OB during induction therapy for ALL thus places patients at risk for poorer acute and long - term outcomes. 2.2 Pathophysiology of OW/OB -induced chemoresistance. There are multiple potential linkages between OW/OB physiology and ALL chemoresistance. We have shown that adipocytes directly protect ALL cells from chemotherapy , and in fact, secrete CXCL12 that attracts ALL cells to migrate into close proximity to adipocytes .22- 24 Insulin resistance (IR) increases ci rculating insulin, which activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Ras/Raf pro - and anti chemoresistance pathways.25-31 Low adiponectin reduces inhibition of these pathways, thus further amplifying insulin signaling. Activation of these pathways is known to cause chemoresistance in four of the chemotherapy drugs that serve as the backbone of HR B -ALL induction: glucocorticoids, vincristine, anthracyclines, during ALL induction, which may directly impact chemosensitivity and has also been independently associated with poorer EFS .37-39 In parallel with glucose metabolis m, free-fatty acids (FFA) may contribute to chemoresistance. FFA are a source of energy and precursor to phospholipid synthesis . We have demonstrated that ALL cells induce adipocytes to release FFA which are then absorbed and used to spur ALL proliferation .23 The obese secrotome therefore has many pathways by which to influence ALL chemoresistance, several of which will be explored via integrated biology as outlined below. 2.3 Who is at risk for OW/OB -mediated chemoresistance? Between 25-50% pf youth in the United States are OW/OB at diagnosis, with even higher prevalences in some ethnic subsets.3,4,18,40 OW/OB children generally have higher fat mass (FM), greater IR, increased circulating metabolic fuels, and conve rsely, lower adiponectin . However, even children who are lean at diagnosis are at significant risk for developing gain in FM and acquire many Figure 1: OW/OB and EOI MRD 2022 13 CONFIDENTIAL TACL Internal Distribution Only of the se metabolic changes associated with OW/OB physiology , potentially resul ting in similar OW/OB -induced resistance ALL induction chemotherapy includes high -dose glucocorticoids and asparaginase, both of which can induce IR in patients who are lean at diagnosis and, of course, worsen IR in those already OW/OB .41,42 We explored this in a prospective trial in HR B -ALL patients inclusive of body composition measured by dual-energy X - ray absorptiometry (DXA).43 Both lean and OW/OB subjects in the trial developed similar OW/OB physiology, as indicated by elevated fasting glucose (lean vs. OW/OB, mean 121\u00b15.7 vs. 122\u00b14.8mg/dl, p=0.761) and 32% vs. OW/OB 29%, p=0.817). Most startling, l ean subjects on the trial gained up to twice their starting FM during the induction phase alone (p0.001) and concurrently lost lean mass (LM) (p<0.001), thus shifting the percentage body fat even higher.44 Thus, HR B -ALL induction causes lean patients to become physiologically and physically obese . All patient s, those lean and OW/OB , are therefore at -risk from OW/OB chemoresistance and may benefit from early intervention. 2.4 OW/OB -mediated chemoresistance is potentiall y reversible . We examined BMI at diagnosis and serial BMI data from the Children's Oncology Group HR B -ALL trial CCG1961 . In 2,008 children treated on the trial, we replicated previous findings that obesity at diagnosis was associated with increased risk for poorer 5 -year EFS (HR 1.40, 95%CI, 1.13 - 1.73). We then analyz ed survival for 1,581 children with serial BMI data . In this subset, we found those childr en who became - or remained - obese during pre -Maintenance therapy experienced increased risk for poorer EFS (HR 1.51, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.41 and HR 1.43, 95%CI 1.04 to 1.96, respectively). However, patients starting therapy obese and then gaining a healthy BMI had no difference in EFS as compared to those never obese (HR 0.99, 95%CI 0.62 to 1.58) (Fig 2).14 This suggested that the effects of OW/OB on chemoresistance and relapse could be modifiable . Based on this data, w e recapitulated these findings in mouse models of obesity and ALL. In a syngeneic ALL mouse model of diet-induced obesity (DIO),45 we mimicked implementing a diet intervention in patients receiving \"induction\" chemotherapy . Following chemotherapy, the intervention group was switched from a high - to a low -fat diet (HLFD) which resulted in superior survival vs. mice maintained on a high fat diet (HFD, p<0.001). Survival in the H LFD group was even higher than non -DIO mice raised on a LFD (p=0.008) (Fig. 3A) . This indicat ed that OW/OB patients may particularly benefit from diet interventions. We replicated this experiment under new cond itions to study whether changes in fat or in calorie intake were responsible for these effects. Using the same DIO/ALL model, HFD mice were switched either to a LFD or remained on HFD but with 30% caloric restriction (CR). In this experiment, survival was unexpectedly lower in all groups, even in the untreated vehicles with ALL. The model nonetheless showed a significant increase in mean survival time for HCR vs. HFD (47\u00b13.5 vs. 36\u00b13.0 days, p=0.045), though HFD (41\u00b14.7 days, p=0.356) (Fig 3B). These findings show that caloric restriction, and not fat reduction alone, is likely important to reverse OW/OB chemoresistance. These findings were consistent with another animal model showing that intermittent fasting (i.e., a more severe form of restriction) also improve d ALL survival.46 These models therefore complement the clinical trial data to provide in vivo biologic plausibility for efficacy of calorie restriction to improve disease response during ALL induction therapy.

Arrows (vincristine), *p<0.05, **p<0.01 CONFIDENTIAL TACL Internal Distribution Only 2.5 Results of the IDEAL 1 Trial. From this translational data, we conducted a non-randomized, controlled trial in patients 10 -21 years old testing a diet - and exercise -based intervention ( \"Improving Diet and Exercise in ALL [IDEAL]\" ) during HR B -ALL induction to reduce fat gain and to reverse OW/OB chemoresistance and decrease risk for MRD (NCT02708108 ). Patients were treated with COG HR B -ALL induction regimens consisting of daily glucocorticoid, weekly vincristine and daunorubicin, and a dose of pegaspargase. Fat mass was measured by DXA at diagnosis and EOI ; MRD was assessed by flow cytometry at EOI. The IDEAL intervention' was designed to induce a 20% caloric restriction from a combination of diet and increased activity. The diet prescription to achieve caloric restriction was a low fat (<25%), low carbohydrate (<55%), low glycemic load (<100/2000kcal), and high protein (20%) diet. The tri al enrolled 40 patients to receive the intervention and extracted data for a recent historical control (n=80) for comparison , a subset of whom (n=36) were similarly imaged with DXA as part of the previously mentioned prospective study of body composition (NCT0131794043). (A) Integration of IDEAL into HR B -ALL induction is feasible : Induction chemotherapy results in hyperphagia other psychological and physiological comorbidities . A key aim of the trial was to therefore test the feasibility of integrating the IDEAL intervention into the induction phase. Adherence goals were set a priori at 75% for the intervention and were assessable in 39/40 patients. Patients exceeded nutrition goals, with 82 % (95%CI 78 -87%) cumulative adherence to the overall diet, and excellent adherence to goal for each macronutrient , except fat intake (Fig. 4). Notably, 92% (36/39) of patients achieved a negative caloric balance throughout the entire induction period, a core aspect of the intervention . Average caloric intake was only 57\u00b13.8% of estimated requirements, in contrast to reported nutrition during HR B -ALL induction, where 58 -77% of patients ingested more calories than is recommended by diet guidelines.47 In cont rast, adherence to the PA component was poor (31.2\u00b15.8%) and physical inactivity/sedentary behavior (PI/SB) was common. Daily steps were measured by wearable accelerometers (Fitbit Flex \u00ae); average steps/day only 1,530 (IQR1,306), or <5th percentile day for healthy children (NHANES data).48 Finally, examination of logistics showed successful integrat ion of the study visits into clinical practice, exceeding the s et goal (80%) of completed dietitian and physical therapy visits (86.5%, 339/392 visits). (B) Improvement in chemotherapy efficacy : In the IDEAL trial, 38/40 subjects were assessable for EOI MRD (1 expired, 1 changed regimen). When stratified by BMI , 42% (10/24) of those MRD+ vs. 51% (18/35) of OW/OB patients in the historical control ; in those lean, 14% (2/14) were MRD+ vs. 27% (12/45) in the historical control. Multivariable analysis (Table 1) demonstrate d the IDEAL intervention was associated with a significantly reduced risk of EOI MRD positivity one-sided p=0.02 intervention also reduced risk of detectable MRD (>0.000%) compared to historical controls (OR 0.16, 95%CI 0.04 -0.52, one -sided p=0.002). Patients with OW/OB or higher baseline WBC remained at higher risk for EOI MRD. There was no significant interaction between BMI and the intervention in the model (p=0 .60). As screening for CRLF2+ ALL became routine at the outset of the IDEAL trial,49 we performed a sensitivity analysis and reclassified all case s in both cohorts with the cytogenetic risk algorithm in use during the time of the historical control (AALL08B150); we found a consistent benefit from the IDEAL intervention using the older cytogenetic classification too (OR 0.30, 95%CI 0.09 -0.84, one -sided p=0.01). As is key for an early phase trial, it is notable that the magnitude of the observed effect from IDEAL1 in this initial trial provides sufficient room for a smaller but positive effect in a randomized trial setting. The IDEAL trial thus demonstrated proof -of-principle that caloric restriction via the IDEAL inte rvention can improve disease response. 0102030405060708090100 767179% Adherence8994 A BC D E Figure 43: Adherence to dietary prescription.

(C) Reduc tion in chemotherapy -induced gain in fat mass (FM) and insulin resistance (IR) : Induction chemotherapy for HR B -ALL results in increased body fat, loss of lean muscle (LM)44,51 and worsening motor function in most patients .52 In the IDEAL 1 trial, 36/40 subjects were assessable for body composition by DXA; change in FM and LM was compared to the DXA subset of the historical control (n=36). For the overall cohort in aggregate , the IDEAL intervention did not significan tly reduce chemotherapy -induced gains in FM as compared to the historical control ( median change +5.1% [IQR15.8] vs. +10.7% [IQR16.0], p=0.125) . w hen stratified by BMI, patients who were OW/OB at diagnosis gained significantly less FM tha n contro ls (median change +1.5% [IQR6.6] vs. +9.7% [IQR11.1], p=0.024) and also versus lean patients in the IDEAL trial ( median change +1.5% [IQR6.6] vs. +20.5% [IQR23.6], p<0.001). As expected, patients who were fully adherent to the diet intervention gained the least FM (median change +2.4% [IQR13.7]). All patients in both cohorts lost significant amounts of LM. The IDEAL caloric restriction intervention did not prevent nor exacerbate LM loss in either group (OW/OB median change -13.1% [IQR11.0] controls -15.9% [IQR10.1], [IQR16.9], p= 0.834) . We also examined the impact of the intervention on OW/OB physiology as demonstrated by the clinical requirement for exogenous insulin from chemotherapy -induced IR. In the IDEAL 1 trial, we found that even though gain in FM was not reduced in the lean, the IDEAL1 intervention completely eliminated the need for insulin therapy in lean patients , a clear reduction when compared to lean patients in the historical control (0/14 vs. 7/20 pati ents, p=0.026) ; the same benefit was not in those OW/OB (10/23 vs. 6/21 patients, p=0.239 ). This suggest that in those only with chemotherapy -induced IR (i.e ., not exacerbated by preexisting OW/OB), the diet modification from the IDEAL1 intervention significantly reduced IR . Moreover, leptin is similarly secreted by adipocytes, is increase d in obesity, and is involved in circulating glucose uptake and metabolism.53 The adiponectin/leptin ratio (A/L) has thus been used as a sensitive measure of IR (increased A/L = decreased IR).54 In the IDEAL trial, increases in circulating A/L were significantly greater in patients treated with the IDEAL intervention versus controls (A/L 4.7 vs 1.9, p=0.039), further indicating reduced IR from IDEAL . Adiponectin itself was also significantly higher by EOI in IDEAL patients ve rsus controls (25.1 [SD 11.6] versus 11.3 [SD5.1], p<0.0001). T hus, t he first iteration of the IDEAL intervention was successful in preventing gain in FM in the OW/OB , appeared to reverse IR overall and even in lean patients who gained FM, but did not prev ent loss of LM. The lack of impact on LM , and potentially on FM in the lean, was potentially due to poor adherence to the exercise component and from high levels of physical inactivity and sedentary behavior (PI/SB). T2020 -003 Protocol version 05/28/2021 1SEP 2022 CONFIDENTIAL TACL Internal Distribution Only 2.6 Study R ational e Based on the translational data and successful early -phase trial, the current study will build upon these findings to adjust the dosing for each component and to validate the updated intervention in a randomized, Phase 2 trial. (A) Dosing Rationale : The d osing for calorie restriction in the IDEAL2 trial was increased to 15% from the IDEAL1 dose of 10%, supported by the level of caloric deficits achieved in the initial trial. The diet component targets remained unchanged . For the exercise component, the pre scribed dose was lowered from 200 minutes/week over 7 days in IDEAL1 to 150 minutes/week over 5 days . This lower goal was selected to improve adherence through greater motivation for a perceived attainable goal, while still conforming to weekly exercise recommendations. This more attainable dose and frequency will still achieve the 500 recommended metabolic equivalent (MET) -min/week for exercise guidelines in cancer patients and for general cardiovascular fitness and weight -loss.55,56 Reflecting the poor adherence to the home exercise program in the first iteration of the intervention, the prescription was modified to include at least weekly guided exercise sessions with a physiotherapist. Finally, a high level of PI/SB was identified in the IDEAl1 trial. PI/SB is associated with increased inflammation,57 increased post -prandial glucose,58 and metabolic inflexibility (i.e., the body's inability to adapt to fuel source).59 PI/SB thus may limit use of lipid stores (preventing FM loss). Even brief interruptions in PI/SB increase overall caloric expenditure and restore metabolic flexibility.59-61 Multiple studies have demonstrated efficacy for daily step goals to increase activity level and induce fat l oss.62 A new component of the intervention will consist of progressive individualized daily goals for steps/day and steps/hour. Control patients will receive a Fitbit tracker at EOI (post -induction) to aid in retention and for use during the observation -only Consolidation phase. Although being implemented primarily as a motivational tool to reduce PI/SB, measurement of steps and PI/SB by Fitbit devices correlate well with children (r=0.98, p< 0.001; r=0.94, p<0.001)63 and will provide another measure of home activity levels and patterns . These changes are summarized below in Tables 2 and 3. Table 2: Summary of changes to diet dose between IDEAL1 and IDEAL2 trials NUTRITION PRESCRIPTION is calculated from estimated energy requirements ; % macronutrients allowed refers to proportion of calories consumed. Table 3: Summary of changes to exercise dose between IDEAL1 and IDEAL2 trials PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PRESCRIPTION Trial Stage IDEAL1 IDEAL2 Frequency 7 days per week 5 days per week Intensity Moderate to Vigorous Moderate Time 30min/day 200min/week 30 minutes/day 150 minutes/week Type Aerobic exercise and resistance training Aerobic exercise and resistance training Location Unsupervised, Home only 1x/week Supervised +Home Progression None Maintenance of moderate intensity PHYSICAL INACTIVITY/SEDENTARY BEHAVIOR PI/SB Intervention None Daily step goals with movement reminders B) Correlative biology studies : As discussed above, OW/OB children generally develop insulin resistance (IR) with hyperinsulinemia, high leptin levels, and conversely, reduced secretion the -003 Protocol version 05/28/2021 Only insulin -sensitizer, adiponectin. Adiponectin/leptin ratio (A/L) is therefore a sensitive marker of IR , even in lean patients .64,65 IR and OW/OB are also associated with differences in the metabolome, including higher levels of circulating fuels, such as BCAA, FFA, and glucose. OW/OB chemoresistance signaling pathways in ALL: depicted in Figure 4, biologically, hyperinsulinem ia from IR results in increased PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 signaling IRS1/2, and MAPK -ALL chemoresistance , adiponectin is known to counter the effects of insulin -induced signaling by phosphorylating AMP -activated protein kinase (AMPK), which directly inhibits mTORC1 via TSC2 (not shown) and indirectly inhibits mTORC1 via AKT inhibition by PP2A. Adiponectin al so inhibits phosphorylation of IKK via AMPK and PPAR, thereby countering the anti - apoptotic effects of NF -B nuclear translocation. In IDEAL1, we found reduced insulin resistance (i.e., reduced circulating insulin) and increased adiponectin, thus potenti ally indicating reversal or reduction of OW/OB -mediated stimulat ion of these chemorestance pathways. We performed cytometry (Cytometry by Time Of Flight [CyTOF]) on viably frozen ALL cells from diagnosis and on MRD at EOI and validated the testing pan el. In IDEAL2, w e will now examine the implicated signaling pathways in ALL cells at diagnosis, in Day 8 PB MRD (present at 0.1% in ~60% of HR B -ALL patients) and in EOI MRD collected from patients receiving the intervention arm as compared to controls. Ex vivo stimulation of cells with insulin (+positive control) , adiponectin (+positive control ) will further elucidate ALL cell sensitivity to hormones in chemosensitive patients (MRD -negative) and chemoresistant patients (MRD the metabolome in OW/OB during ALL induction : Increased dietary intake and OW/OB are associated with increased systemic availability of fuels known to support rapid proliferation of cancer cells, including glucose, branched chain amino acids (BCAA), and, as above, free fatty acids (FFA).23,66 -70 Figure Leukemia signaling pathways implicated in OW/OB chemoresistance : OW/OB (red arrows) favors ALL survival via Pi3K/AKT/mTOR and Ras/Raf mediation proliferation; adiponectin is decreased, reducing AMPK activity, and releasing IKK to promote NF -B mediated anti -apoptosis . These are reversed in caloric restriction. * indic ates inclusion in mass version 05/28/2021 1SEP 2022 18 CONFIDENTIAL TACL Internal Distribution Only Increased levels of BCAA also cause IR and directly stimulates MTORC1 independently of AKT , while FFA and glucose reduce AMPK activation, thereby releasing its inhibition of AKT and MTORC1 (Figure 5).71-73 We hypothesized that caloric and macronutrient restriction will reduce these circulating fuels and thereby decrease OW/OB physiology and associated AKT and MTORC1 activity. We used metabolomics to assess 45 metabolites in EOI plasma collected from patients treated in the IDEAL1 trial. Of these, 20 were significantly different between OW/OB and lean patients at EOI (p<0.05, ANOVA), and were included in minimally restricted principal components analysis (PCA). PCA showed that OW/OB patients in the trial had increased levels of BCAA and FFA at EOI as compared to lean patients (p<0.05) (Fig. 6). Without a control group, we cannot conclude whether these levels were improved by the IDEAL intervention. In the current Phase 2 trial, we will examine whether caloric and nutrient restriction via the IDEAL intervention reduces circulating BCAA and FFA at Day 8 a nd at EOI as compared between patients in the intervention and control arms. Comparison of circulating fuels in those with and without MRD, and in the context of the mass cytometry results, will provide insights into the role of these fuels to modulate OW/ OB chemoresistance and/or IDEAL efficacy. 2.7 Study Significance The current trial is the first to test caloric restriction via diet and exercise/activity as a therapeutic modality to target chemoresistance in any pediatric or hematologic malignancy. Success of the intervention in a Phase 2 setting will lead to a Phase III trial to test efficacy of the IDEAL intervention within the National Clinical Trials Network, including for potential benefit in older AYA patients as well. Validation of efficacy from caloric restriction to improve chemotherapy efficacy has potential to result in a paradigm shift for a new modal ity to target chemoresistance. Correlative biology will identify OW/OB -associated pathways to further refine the IDEAL intervention and/or highlight new targetable pathways to improve ALL outcomes.

While \"lifestyle change\" is difficult to conceptualize and achieve, short -term concrete goals are generally received well by patients and families. In this context, the intervention proposed here is purposefully designed to not be a hol istic lifestyle change but a short -term intervention during induction , with a concrete goal to improve efficacy of T2020 -003 Protocol version 05/28/2021 1SEP 2022 22 CONFIDENTIAL TACL Internal Distribution Only therapy and reduce toxicity . Following the intervention period (induction phase), a two month limited observation period will continue until the end of consolidation to evaluate potential persistence of benefit . Standard of care approaches to physical therapy and dietiary education vary among institutions. Patients on the control arm may receive institutional standard of care PT and RD visit s. Data for these visit s will be captured. The following sections detail the treatment plan for the study . See Section 6.0 for description of nutrition and fitness/motor assessments performed by RD and PT at baseline in all patients and for the visit schedule for each trial arm. 4.1 ALL ENROLLED PATIENTS A) Education : All subjects will benefit from routine education promoting good nutrition and physical activity during cancer therapy . As outlined below, this education provides general information within the scope of standard of care for health promotion during cancer therapy. The education must include the following elements , may be conducted in -person , or with printed -materials, or by videoconference or telephone as applicable. and The education elements may be individualized by each site for the local population. See Study Manual for sample materials fulfilling the below requirements. Section 4.1: Table 1 Timing of education Begins as close as possible to diagnosis and prior to day 5 chemotherapy1 Dietary education (RD) Culturally appropriate healthy eating habits, including: (a) appropriately portioned, balanced meals and snacks to promote satiety (b) limiting refined sugar, including fructose (c) increasing lean protein, vegetables, and fruits. (d) portion size . May be accomplished using printed materials routinely available at the institution (e.g., My Plate [USDA], Traffic Light [Go, Slow, Whoa]). Exercise e ducation (PT) Culturally appropriate healthy exercise habits, including: (a) Benefits of physical activity during induction (b) F.I.T.T. principles (Frequency, Intensity, Time, Type) (c) 150 minutes/week of activity. May be accomplished using printed materials t o describe exercise during cancer therapy (e.g., Exercising is Medicine, American College of Sports Medicine [Appendix II]) Demonstration of different types of exercise to alleviate concerns for exercising during therapy is encouraged. 1Standard of care education including these elements occurring prior to enrollment may be used for study purposes. 4.2 PATIENTS RANDOMIZED TO INTERVENTION ARM Patients randomized to the intervention arm will have serial visits by a RD and PT to implement the IDEAL 2 diet and exercise prescription. Each patient will be prescribed three components as outlined below: (1) Dietary Prescription, (2 ) Exercise Prescription, and (3) Avoidance of Phys ical Inactivity/Sedentary Behavior. The intervention may be delivered in an ambulatory or hospitalized setting ; those hospitalized may receive more frequent RD and PT visits . Diet and exercise management during cancer therapy is considered dual -purpose as standard of care and for research purposes. The hallm ark of this intervention is individualization of the diet and exercise prescription to incorporate patient preferences into the initial plan, and importantly, s erial reassessment to adjust the \"menu\" of diet and exercise for changing tastes and abilities at each visit to promote adherence . Section 4.2: Table 1 (1) DIETARY PRESCRIPTION Timing of RD intervention Begins as close as possible to diagnosis and prior to day 5 chemotherapy At least weekly1 (approximately chemotherapy d ays 1\u00b13, 8\u00b13, 23 CONFIDENTIAL TACL Internal Distribution Only Calorie goal 15% daily deficit as determined by each subject's estimated energy requirement (EER)2 EER will be calculated using the Schofield equation for basal metabolic rate with an activity factor adjustment of 1.3 (light activity ) and adjusted body weight as per nutrition guidelines EER will be re -calculated weekly to maintain the caloric goal Calorie goal may be adjusted up by the RD for significant weight change s (7-day weight loss : 5-9.9%, may reduce deficit by 5%; may reduce deficit by 10% ).

Section 4.2: Table 3 (3) AVOIDANCE OF PHYSICAL INACTIVITY/SEDENTARY BEHAVIOR Timing Fitbit tracker to be d ispensed and setup at time of enrollment1 Continuous/Daily throughout intervention Motivational tool Wearable tracker CONFIDENTIAL TACL Internal Distribution Only Progression/Week Each week participant will be encouraged to increase their daily step goal by at least 1,000 steps/day (ex week 1: 1,000steps/day, week 2: 2,000 steps/day, week3: 3,000steps/day) Movement/Hour Reminders for 250 steps/hour (approximately w alking) during midday (10AM - 5PM) 1See study manual for registration information , connection with Fitabase Database , and instructions for setting step goals, movement reminders, and heart rate zones. As Fitbit feedback is part of the intervention, patients in the control arm will receive a tracker after the intervention phase ( at EOI ); Fitbit data will be compar ed betw een arms to evaluate for persistent benefit during the specified post -intervention follow -up period. Type of exercise: Aerobic exercise will be prescribed by the PT according to the patient preferences, patient setting, and ability. Resistance training will include therapy bands, hand -held weights, or equivalent. Each subject should specify preference for use of bands or weights (if available at home) for the duration of the intervention to ensure reproducibility across linear assessments. Determining moderate -intensity exercise : Moderate intensity for aerobic exercise will be defined as 50 - 70% max heart rate (HR). Max HR will be determined as HR follow ing a two -minute walk test78 conducted at first PT visit following enrollment . Moderate intensity for resistance training w ill be defined as 50 -60% of 1 repetition maximum (1RM) calculated using sub -maximal estimation from 10 RM. Self-assessment of moderate intensity (HR-anchored RPE) and Fitbit zones : While heart rate (HR) monitoring is ideal to gauge exercise intensity, sub jects in the Phase I trial were unable to accurately assess HR by measuring pulses . Rate of perceived exertion (RPE) will therefore be the primary method for subjects to assess home exercise intensity. RPE is often well -received, reproducible, and generally correlates with peak oxygen uptake.79 Subjects will be taught to gauge RPE using a validate d pediatric RPE scale (e.g., OMNI Scale of Perceived Exertion [Appendix II] or other ). HR for home exercises will also be available by the study -provided wearable tracker and will be customized to the moderate intensity zone . To improve accuracy, the PT will \"anchor\" each subject's RPE with actual exercise intensity by providing feedback for RPE as correlated with PT -measured HR at weekly visits. PT-measured HR will also be compared to that of the wearable tracker (if available at visit) to improve precision for guidance of home exercise intensity . This approach will allow a pragmatic translation of moderate intensity to the home environment during and post -intervention . Progression : At weekly visits, the PT will re -assess moderate intensity for res istance load and HR for RPE. For those with improving fitness, the dose for resistance training will be progressive through weekly increases in band color or weight load. For resistance bands, progression will be +1 color/week as tolerated to achieve linea r increases in resistance force in Newton (N) from \"increasing\" color bands stretched 50% elongation.80,81 In general, resistance band s are expected to provide reproducible force beyond trial duration (i.e., 5,700 cycles) with a maximum force difference of 0.98N.81 For those using weights, the load will increase by 5 -10% (depending on load vs available weight) per week as tolerated and as long as proper technique is maintained. For those with declining fitness (e.g., steroid myopathy, etc), the load will conversely be decreased to maintain moderate intensity. 4.3 Modifications for Toxicity Instances may arise throughout the course of induction therapy in which subjects may not be able to adhere to the prescribed diet, exercise , or PI/SB intervention due to complications from leukemia treatment. In cases of severe treatment -toxicity from the underlying regimen that is expected to resolve but pre cludes delivery of the diet and exercise prescription (e.g., severe typhlitis with prolonged NPO requiring TPN ), the intervention will be suspended until the subject is deemed to be able to resume by the primary treatment team. If toxicity precludes one co mponent of the intervention (diet or exercise), the other should continue as planned. The Study Chair and Vice Chair should be notified if either aspect of the intervention is suspended and dates documented in the End of Course CRF. T2020 -003 Protocol version 05/28/2021 1SEP 2022 25 CONFIDENTIAL TACL Internal Distribution Only There are no dose -modifications for toxicity not precluding delivery of the intervention ; dose -adjustments to diet and exercise are included in the weekly re -assessments by PT and RD. Note: weight loss is a potential but expected side effect of the short -term dietary intervention and does not constitute a toxicity (See section 5.1.6 ). 5.0 Supportive Care Patients may experience myelosuppression and immune suppression from their underlying chemotherapy during the study period. Best supportive care and treatment will be given as appropriate to each patient without restriction (antiemetics, antibiotics, transfusions, oxygen, nutritional support, palliative treatment for pain or cough, etc.). Aggressive supportive care improves outcome from ALL . The following guidelin es are intended to give general health direction for optimal patient care and to encourage uniformity in the treatment of this patient population. Notify the Study Chair of any unexpected or unusually severe complications. 5.1 Concurrent Therapy 5.1.1 Chemotherapy Patients will be receiving routine chemotherapy for treatment of their ALL during the study period. 5.1.2 Cranial Irradiation for CNS or non -CNS disease Radiation therapy is allowed during protocol therapy (with document ation). 5.1.3 Alternative Medications : Use of alternative medications ( e.g., herbal or botanical ) for anticancer purposes are not permitted during the study period. Alternative medication s for support ive care, including cannabinoids, are permitted and should be documented in the Concomitant Medication CRF as they may impact nutrition or obesity -associated toxicity (e.g., levocarnitine to prevent hepatotoxicity) . 5.1.4 Supportive Care Medications : Medication to prevent or treat toxicity should be prescribed according to institutional standard of care. Medications that may impact rate of a targeted toxicity (Section 6.1) should be recorded in the Concomitant Medication CRF (for example - ursodiol, anticoagulation , antibiotic prophylaxis, etc). Use of hyperglycemia sensitizing agents (e.g., metformin, others) and /or exogenous insulin MUST be documented in the Concomitant Medication CRF. 5.1.5 Investig ational Agents : Co-enrollment into a study using novel investiga tional agents during the induction phase (i.e. prior to the study primary endpoint), is not permitted. Enrollment into studies incorporating post -induction investigational agents is permitted. 5.1.6 Nutritional Support For patients in the control arm, nutritional support including appetite stimulants, oral supplementation, enteral or parenteral feeds can be provided as is routinely prescribed . For patients receiving the intervention, appetite stimulants are not prohibite d but should be used with caution (and documented in Concomitant Medications CRF). Other nutritional support (e.g., enteral or parenteral feeding, oral supplements) is permitted but nutritional requirements should be calculated to continue to meet the intervention macronutrient and calorie parameters (and documented in Concomitant Medications CRF) . As weight loss is expected, if nutritional supplementation exceeding the intervention parameters is deemed necessary, the supplementation should be discussed with the Study Chair/Vice -Chair to determine whether the intervention should be considered suspended or the subject should be considered off -therapy. 5.2 Blood Products Investigators should follow institutional guidelines regarding the administration of blood products. T2020 -003 Protocol version 05/28/2021 1SEP 2022 26 CONFIDENTIAL TACL Internal Distribution Only 5.3 Infection Control Investigators should follow the guidelines for the underlying HR B -ALL chemotherapy regimen and/or institutional guidelines regardi ng infection control during the study period. Specifically, h ospitalization throughout induction therapy, antibiotic prophylaxis, and non -pneumocystis jiroveci antifungal prophylaxis, are at the discretion of the study team. As is standard of care during ALL therapy, a ll patients should receive routine pneumocystis jiroveci , urgent evaluation of fever and/or signs of infection during induction therapy with empiric broad -spectrum antibiotics regardless of neutropenia, and evaluation for invasive fungal infe ction for prolonged fevers . 6.0 REQUIRED TO BE ASSESSIONED All protocol -specified hematology, blood chemistries, and bone marrow aspirations and/or biopsies are to be performed in the local laboratory at each investigational site. 6.1 Clinical and Laboratory Studies All entry/eligibility studies must be performed within 1 week prior to study enrollment.

All results must be submitted to the TACL Operations Center with study registration eligibility. Specific treatment regimen must be documented on TACL roadmap; chemotherapy roadmap to be provided at EOI inclusive of any changes or modifications . End of Course CRF will capture # of hospitalized vs ambulatory days and whether treatment was intended to be via ambulatory care versus mandatory inpatient hospitalization. 2 Initial WBC is the first WBC at the treating institution, or the WBC prior to intravenous fluids, whichever occurs first. If prior cytoreductive therapy has been administered and a WBC is available that was obtained within 72 hours prior to steroid therapy, then this pre-cytoreduction WBC should be used . 3 Hepatic function should be assessed including direct bilirubin, AST, and ALT; See Section 3.3.5 for abnormal hepatic function values requiring documentation at diagnosis. 4 In patients able to receive DXA scan at diagnosis , the scan should be performed as close as possible to diagnosis but must be completed prior to start of chemotherapy on Day 5 . In patients able to receive DXA scan at EOI , the scan should be completed prior to start of the next treatment phase and even if baseline scan not performed. Waist circumference should be measured as described in the Study Manual . 5 Bone marrow and p eripheral blood for correlative biology at diagnosis should be collected as cl ose to diagnosis as possible and prior to systemic chemotherapy (including cytoreductive therapy) is strongly preferred . Peripheral blood for ALL cells may be sent at diagnosis if circulating absolute blast count 1,000 u/L and no bone marrow aspirate is a vailable for any reason. For specimens collected o n Day 8, peripheral blood specimen (for viable leukemia cells ) must be collected prior to systemic chemotherapy on that day . 6 MRD by flow cytometry (as per Section 6.3 ). RT -PCR and/or NGS, results to be collected where available. EOC MRD is routinely performed for EOI MRD+ patients only and will be collected where available . 7 Initial RD and PT assessments are to occur as close to diagnosis as possible and, at latest , prior to start of chemotherapy on Day 5. However, if the PT visit is not feasible prior to day 5, the PT assessment may occur up to and including chemotherapy day 8. RD and PT support and guidance during cancer therapy are part of routine care. The 24-hour dietary recall will be performed via NCI ASA -24 online platform for uniform assessment and calculations (see study manual) ; Use of ASA -24 for the 24 -hour recall should be guided by RD (or dietetic technician) . RD visits should be in -person where feasible; however, for visits not able to be conducted in -person, it is permitted for the RD to complete the visit via videoconference or telephone 8 Assessed at weekly visit for intervention arm ; reported inclusive of supervised sessions. 9 Fitbit p rovided to Intervention Arm at enrollment, to Control Arm at EOI; d ata from Fitbit devices synced with patient cell phone /device .

Both morphology and MRD should be evaluated in this marrow. CSF should be evaluated for presence of refractory ALL as is routinely performed. Other sites of extramedull ary disease consistent with refractory ALL should be documented if present. Patients who have persistent EOI MRD 0.01% at EOI, and who continue with HR B -ALL therapy, should undergo a subsequent bone marrow aspiration at the end of consol idation (EOC) for evaluation of MRD and remission status as is routinely performed in HR B -ALL. Patients who are MRD <0.01% at EOI who do not undergo a routine repeat MRD evaluation will be considered MRD <0.01% at EOC as well. If either marrow evaluat ion is unable to be performed (or is unevaluable for MRD ), a marrow (or repeat marrow) should be performed within 14 days (based upon clinician's judgment) and prior to subsequent chemotherapy with MRD status assessed at this time point. 6.3 Evaluation of Minimal Residual Disease MRD will be analyzed using the flow cytometric approach utilized by the Children's Oncology Group (COG) and will be performed only in laboratories certified to perform MRD for COG studies. T hese laboratories have undergone quality assurance review by the COG to ensure accurate assessment of MRD to the high standard of a consortium trial. In general, MRD will be analyzed by multi-parameter flow cytom etry with a standardized three tube panel of antibodies. One million \"events\" are acquired per tube; data are analyzed following a hierarchical gating strategy to identify \"different from normal\" residual immunophenotype populations (i.e., MRD). Central review by the study hematopathologist (Dr. Wood) is available for MRD close to the threshold for positivity (i.e., ~ 0.01%) and/or challenging MRD as identified by sites. Some patients may receive additional MRD evaluations via RT -PCR (e.g., PH+ALL) or next generation sequencing (NGS); results from these additional evaluations will be where collected if available. 6.4 Required Observations Following Completion of Protocol Therapy Upon completing assigned protocol therapy or exiting the study, a All patients will be followed until 5 years from the end of first treatment attempt completion of protocol therapy (Section 8.1 ) until meeting off -study criteria ( Section 8.2) or until otherwise notified by the study committee that the study is closed. Sites should submit follow -up a minimum of every 6 months in the first year and then annually thereafter during this period (or until patient death) . Events such as patient death or relapse should be reported right away. The purpose is to assess remission status, administration of alternative therapies, and surv ival. The following data will be collected: 1) Disease status information a) Second malignancy (Date) b) Relapse of disease (Date) c) Death (Date and cause) 2) Use of : a) Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T -cell therapy b) Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) 7.0 CORRELATIVE BIOLOGY STUDIES The following samples for correlative biology are requested for all patients enrolled on study.

List of possible reasons for termination or temporary suspension of the study includes but not limited to PI/ sponsor/ funder decision, regulatory or other oversight issues, Review of SAEs/Unexpected/Related AEs, non - compliance, futility, Efficacy that warrants stopping, incomplete/ inevaluable data, endpoint was met. Upon premature terminati on of the study, the study may resume once the reasons have been fully addressed and satisfied by TACL Study Chair and/or any applicable regulatory agency (e.g FDA, etc. ) or Independent Ethics Committee (e.g. IRB, Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), etc.) 9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 9.1 Design Overview This is a randomized Phase 2 study in patients with HR B -ALL comparing the efficacy of one -time education + the IDEAL2 intervention (experimental) versus one -time education alone (control) in reducing the rate (probability ) of having detectable minimum residual disease at the end of induction therapy (EOI MRD) and in reducing gain in fat mass (FM) during induction. . Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to either the experimental or control arms using stratified, blocked randomization within four strata defined by presenting WBC (< 50K/uL, 50K/uL ) and body mass index (normal weight vs overweight/obese). Preliminary data from N = 120 patients with HR B -ALL suggests that (1) approximately 50% of patients will be OW/OB (BMI85%) , (2) that approximately 2 5% of patients will have WBC 50K/uL, and (3) that both WBC and OW/OB are significant independent predictors of EOI MRD probability with odds ratios of OR 3.9 (95%CI 1.5-10.2) and OR 3.5 (95%CI 1.3-9.3) for WBC 50 K/uL and OW/OB , respectively. Subjects will receive a standardized and individualize d intervention and thus the randomization scheme will randomize by subject. Section 9.1: Table 1 Control EOI MRD rate [Control EOI FM/Baseline FM] (proportion of Size Calculation T2020 -003 Protocol version 05/28/2021 1SEP 2022 31 CONFIDENTIAL TACL Internal Distribution Only Under the assumption of common odd ratio - i.e., that the experimental treatment arm will have a similar effect within each of the four strata on the odds -ratio scale - the test of the hypothesis H 0: 1 vs. H 1: < 1 will be based on a one-sided likelihood ratio test in the context of a logistic regression analysis of the indicator of EOI MRD on treatment, stratified by the four strata defined above - i.e., the test of H 0: 0 vs. H 1: < 0 in the binomial model () = + for log odds ratio , experimental treatment indicator , and stratum specific parameters and stratum indicator , = 1 ... 4. If the study continues to completion following the interim analysis (described below), based on a on e-sided Type I error 0.10 for the likelihood ratio test, assuming the EOI MRD probabilities and stratum membership percentages shown in the table, and with 220 patients randomized and evaluable for the primary endpoint of MRD, and in the context of the int erim futility analysis described below , there will be at least 80% power to detect a reduction in EOI MRD probability that corresponds to an odds ratio of 0.5 in the experimental intervention compared to controls. Should the observed odds ratio more cl osely resemble the Phase I trial ( = 0.29 in the experimental arm versus control), the study will have 0. 99 power to detect an odds ratio of 0.3 . Hence this study has sufficient power to detect plausible and clinically meaningful effects of the IDEAL 2 intervention on EOI MRD in HR B-ALL patients. While the rates for OW/OB and WBC50 found in the preliminary data are approximately similar to those seen in other consortia trial s of HR B -ALL in pediatric and AYA patients, the table below demonstrates several scenarios of OW/OB or WBC and shows that moderate changes to stratum proportions, including obesity rate, do not meaningfully impact power to detect differences in MRD between arms. The common odds ratio o f 0.5 corresponds to 10 -12% decrease in the overall EOI MRD rate when comparing IDEAL2 to control. If the odds ratio decreases 0.3 (Scenario M5), power increases to 0.99 and the reduction in the overall EOI MRD rate increases to 19% when 50% of the patient s are OW/OB and 25% of the patients have WBC 50K/uL 9.2: 1 Scenario OW/OB Ratio 0.3 16.6% 35.6% 220 0.99 * Target scenario Power analysis for the FM reduction objective was performed with simulations of 10,000 iterations to target the ratio of (EOI FM / Baseline FM) between the IDEAL2 and control group. Data were simulated assuming that the log2(EOI FM / Baseline FM) follows a Gaussian distribution. The mean and standard deviation of log2(EOI FM / Baseline FM) for each stratum in the control group was approximated from the pilot data available with 36 participants. Sample size of 164 (~220x0.75) is estimated after a survey of the participating sites for the availability of DXA scans for the measurements. Power was calculated with one -sided Type I error rate of 0.1 for the likelihood ratio test. Section 9.2: Table 2 Scenario OW/OB WBC 50 K/uL Rate ratio (IDEAL2 / Control) rate: EOI / Baseline FM [% change] rate: EOI FM / Baseline 50% 25% 0.87 Subject Attrition : We anticipate that ~1% of patients will die during induction chemotherapy due to treatment related complications and an additional 2 -4% will have treatment -related toxicity necessitating therapy change Protocol version 05/28/2021 2022 32 CONFIDENTIAL TACL Internal Distribution Only and/or precluding timely evaluation of MRD. In addition, as diagnostic hematopathology and enrollment criteria will be centrally reviewed, despite B -ALL being a common and typically straightforward diagnosis, we anticipate that a maximum of 3-5% of patients may be come ineligible upon central review after enrollment. The trial will enroll up to a maximum of 240 subjects ( ~110%) to ensure 220 patients evaluable for the MRD primary endpoint if all other considerations stay the same. We expect to enro ll 58-60 patients per year and anticipate that it would take 4 -4.2 years to complete the enrollment. 9.3 Endpoints 9.2.1 Primary Endpoint s: Whether the IDEAL2 intervention reduces the rate of MRD 0.01% at EOI as compared to the control arm. Whether the IDEAL2 intervention reduce s gain in FM during induction as compared to the control arm . 9.2.2. Secondary Endpoints: Whether patients are able to achieve 75% s elf-reported adherence to the diet and activity components of the IDEAL 2 intervention. 9.2.3 Exploratory Clinical Endpoints Differences between the intervention and control arms after induction and/or consolidation in : Rate of MRD 0.01 at end of consolidation (versus MRD <0.01% at either EOI or EOC) Lean mass (LM), physical inactivity (EOC only) , fitness ( 2-min walk test) , and motor function (BOT -2) Change in Mmacronutrient and micronutrient intake during induction and consolidation therapy. Use of immunotherapy ( i.e., CAR) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) Event -free, disease -free, and overall survival at three and five years (EFS, DFS, OS) Rates of d ose reductions of induction chemotherapy & obesity -associated treatment toxicit ies (hepatotoxicity, sepsis, fungal infection] ) Correlation and Kappa statistics of Body fat percentage, FM, LM by DXA versus with calculated RFM (%) , and RFM (kg) , and LM at diagnosis , and at EOI, and % change Association of cumulative and average hours of REM sleep on change in FM at EOI and /or EOC Serial change s in patient -reported quality of life via the PedsQL scale at EOI and EOC Correlative biology endpoints will exami ne differences in adipocytes, adipokines, ALL signaling , and the metabolome in those receiving the IDEAL2 intervention versus controls and in those with versus without chemoresistance (MRD positive versus negative) 9.4 Patient Evaluability Patients who reach the EOI time -point with a MRD assessment will be considered evaluable for treatment response for the endpoint of MRD. Patients who reach the EOI time -point with both a baseline and EOI assessment of FM will be considered evaluable for t reatment response for the endpoint of FM. Patients who complete at least half of planned induction chemotherapy days will be considered evaluable for the endpoint of adherence (measured over completed days). All patients enrolled in the study will be con sidered evaluable for purposes of the intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis and for all other endpoints. T2020 -003 Protocol version 05/28/2021 1SEP 2022 33 CONFIDENTIAL TACL Internal Distribution Only 9.5 Interim Monitor ing Interim futility analysis will be performed when 50% of patients (110 evaluable patients) have been enrolled and evaluated for MRD at EOI . The null hypothesis that IDEAL2 intervention does not reduce the rate of MRD 0.01% at EOI as compared to the control arm will not be rejected, and the study will be considered for termination, if the 95% lower confidence bound for the stratum -adjusted odds ratio ( = e) is greater than 0.5 at this time. The probability of consideration for early termination due to futility of the MRD endpoint is 0.46 when = 1 and 0.05 when = 0.5. These design characteristics were determi ned by simulations of 10,000 trials. Should the boundary for futility of the MRD endpoint be crossed , consideration for early termination of the trial will also include examination of potential benefit from the second primary endpoint (fat mass) and other clinical endpoints (e.g., treatment toxicities, quality of life , etc). 9.6 Analysis of primary and secondary endpoints Primary Endpoint s: Analysis of t he primary endpoint comparing EOI MRD positivity between treatment arms variables WBC) and all MRD -evaluable subjects. Balance of cytogenetics risk groups will be evaluated in the primary analysis for MRD . An a priori planned secondary The primary analysis for MRD will also include strata variables including , potential cofounding disease variables (i.e., cytogenetic risk), treatment regimen, and demographic features. A secondary intent -to-treat analysis will conservatively include all enrolled patients by conservatively considering inevalu able pateints as having the rate of MRD 0.01% . as time to event beginning from diagnosis . Analysis for the FM endpoint will mirror the primary endpoint analytic approach and will include evaluable patients and be analyzed in aggregate, within BMI strata, and include demographic variables. Differences in change in FM will be explored among demog raphic subsets. Secondary analyses will examine the influence of adherence, degree of caloric deficit, and treatment center on the endpoints of MRD and FM. Association of body composition and MRD will be explored. Secondary Endpoint: Analyses for the a dherence endpoint will be descriptive in nature and examine adherence rates in aggregate for the cohort and between the OW/OB and non -OW/OB strata in addition to potential differences among demographic subsets. Adherence will be assessed for the intervention overall, diet (overall, each component), exercise (self -reported adherence), inactivity (steps/day , movement goals ). 9.7 Analysis of correlative biology and exploratory endpoints Analys es for the exploratory and correlative biology endpoints will be primarily descriptive in nature. Survival analyses will estimate the EFS, DFS, and OS at 3 and 5 years and compare 3-year and 5 -year EFS, DFS, and OS between arms after accounting for stratification variables, cytogenetic risk, MRD response, and other potential confounders of disease response. For purposes of EFS and DFS , time to event is defined as time to first relapse, refractory disease (as determined by change in treatment regimen), second cancer, death from time of diagnosis or from time of remission (EOI) , respectively. OS is defined as timed from diagnosis to death or last follow -up. Although not a Phase 3 study, survival outcomes will be reported for demographic strata for, sex, race, and ethnicity as recommended by the NIH/NCI. 9.8 Inclusion of Women and Minorities The study is open to all participants regardless of sex, race, or ethnicity . Review of accrual to past studies demonstrates accrual of both sexes and all NIH -identified races and ethnicities to such studies. Analysis of v ariation in response rate due to biological sex, race, and ethnicity will be performed. 10.0 DEFINITIONS AND RESPONSE CRITERIA T2020 -003 Protocol version 05/28/2021 1SEP 2022 34 CONFIDENTIAL TACL Distribution Only 10.1 Cytogenetic and molecular risk stratification Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) , cytogenetic, and molecular studies should be performed to characterize the ALL biology. 10.1.1 Favorable cytogenetics ETV6 -RUNX1 Double trisom ies of chromosome Adverse Cytogenetics iAMP21 KMT2A as ABL-class or CRLF2 fusions) All patients should be screened for Ph -like by FISH, molecular studies, and/or LDA card wherever possible.

Any unfortunate or unintended signs or symptoms. T2020 -003 Protocol version 05/28/2021 1SEP 2022 37 CONFIDENTIAL TACL Internal Distribution Only Serious Adverse Event (SAE) : An adverse event is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Section 11.1: Table 1 Death of Patient An event that results in the death of a patient. Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been taken. This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form. An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is cons idered \"life -threatening\" if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death at the time of the event. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that hypot hetically might have caused death if it were more severe (ICH E2A) An adverse eve nt that is complicated by acute, life -threatening metabolic/cardiovascular complications (e.g. circulatory failure, hemorrhage, sepsis), life-threatening physiological conseq uences, need for intensive care unit/ emergent invasive treatment, fatal Hospitalization An event that results in an admission to the hospital for any length of time. This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility. Prolongation of Hospitalization An event that occurs while the study patient is hospitalized and prolongs the patient's hospital stay >24 hours Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth or any anomaly that results in fetal loss. Persistent or Significant Disability/ Incapacity An event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study patient. Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, or accidental trauma ( e.g., sprained ankle). Important Medical Event Requiring Medical or Surgical Intervention to Prevent Serious Outcome An important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based on medical judgment may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above ( i.e., death of patie nt, life -threatening, hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity). (e.g.seizures that do end up resulting in hospitalization ) Unexpected Adverse Event: Any event not consistent with the risk information described in section 11.2.1 as a potential AE from the behavioral intervention ( diet and exercise prescription ). Related Adverse Event: An adverse event defined as a having a reasonable and direct causal relationship with the diet and exercise prescription . In general, these follow a logical temporal sequence, exhibit a known response pattern, and cannot be reasonably explained by other factors (i.e., underlying chemotherapy or other comorbidity) . Examples of related adverse events are described in section 11.2.1 . Note, for purposes of this protocol, adverse events caused by underlying ALL induction chemotherapy are by definition unrelated to the IDEAL2 behavioral intervention. Adverse events occurring in patients not receiving the intervention on the control arm are also by definition unrelated to the IDEAL2 behavioral intervention. 11.2 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements for Low Risk Study T2020 -003 Protocol version 05/28/2021 1SEP 2022 38 CONFIDENTIAL TACL Internal Distribution Only As this is a study of a low-risk behavioral intervention, the adverse event reporting requirement for safety monitoring is limited to adverse events that are related to the IDEAL2 behavioral intervention as defined above in Section 11 .,1 or are listed in section 11.2.1 below . If a patient experiences a serious or unexpected adverse event as defined in section 11.1 that is possibly, probably , or definitely related to their participation in the IDEAL 2 behavioral intervention T2020 -003, the center must notify the TACL OPs center and the event must be repor ted per the T ACL SAE Reporting Manual and protocol section 11.3 . Adverse events possibly, probably , or definitely related to participation in the IDEAL 2 behavioral intervention T2020 -003 that do not meet the criteria for serious or are expected events as described in section 11.2.1 should be reported to TACL Operations via the Toxicities CRF in Medidata for the duration of the AE evaluation period . Data is due 7 days following the AE evalu ation period. Adverse events regardless of severity related to the patient's underlying ALL treatment protocol are common, expected, unrelated to th is behavioral research intervention, and do not require report ing unless specified below in protocol section 11. 2.1. 11.2.1: Targeted AE to be reported in both arms (CTCAE v5 Grade) In additio n to AE that are possibly, probably, or definitely related to participation in the IDEAL 2 behavioral intervention T2020 -003, tThe following AEs are considered unlikely but may possibly be related to the study diet and exercise intervention require reporting for both arms irrespective of attribution . Rare e lectrolyte abnormalities do not need to be screened routinely but may be resulted as part of an ev aluation of clinical symptoms. S hould the se AE be identified , attribution to the study intervention must then follow the criteria as described in protocol section 11.1. Hypoglycemia (Grade 3) Hypomagnesi umia, Hypokalemia, Hypophosphatemia (Grade 4) Anorexia (Grade 4) Fracture (any grade) Note: Distinct from AE reporting for safety monitoring, the trial includes targeted toxicity capture . The IDEAL2 intervention may reduce toxicities from routine chemotherapy (e.g., hyper glycemia/insulin use, pancreatitis, direct bilirubinemia 3mg/dl , etc). A complete list is located in the Toxicities CRF (with reportable grade) and require s report ing for both arms as a research endpoint (see Section 6.1) . 11.2.2: Duration of AE evaluation period From enrollment through the end of the induction chemoth erapy phase (defined as later of Day 36 or initiation of subsequent chemotherapy phase if delayed). While rare, s erious adverse events will require expedited reporti ng to the TACL Operations Center as described below. 11.3 Steps for r eporting Serious Adverse Events Investigators must immediately report any SAE or SSAR as defined above in Section 11.1 Table 1 and 11.2 (within 24 hours from learning of the SAE or SSAR) and include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the intervention caused the event. The investigator must submit a complete report within 72 hours no later than 7 calendar days after the SAE or SSAR notification to TACL Operations Center. For reported death, investigators should provide any additional information (e.g. autopsy report, terminal medical report, etc.) necessary for the Principal Investigator or the Study Chair and the Study Vice -Chair of the study to review the SAE or SSAR. T2020 -003 Protocol version 05/28/2021 1SEP 2022 39 CONFIDENTIAL TACL Internal Distribution Only Step 1 : Identify the adverse event using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Event reporting (CTC AE), version 5.0. The CTC AE provides descriptive terminology and a grading scale for each adverse event listed. A copy of the CTC AE can be downloaded at http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html . Step 2 : Grade the e vent using the NCI CTCAE version 5.0. Step 3 : Determine if the adverse event meets the criteria of being \"serious\". Step 4 : Determine the relationship of study intervention to the event The investigator will assess the causal relationship between the investigational product and the regimen as a whole and the adverse event. The investigator will use his/her clinical expertise and judgment to select the attribution category below that best fits the circumstances of the AE. Unrelated: The event is clear ly related to other factors such as the participant's clinical state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs administered to the participant. Unlikely: The event is doubtfully related to the study intervention . The event was most likely rela ted to other factors such as the participant's clinical state, other therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs. Possible: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of the diet or exercise intervention , but could have been produc ed by other factors such as the participant's clinical state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs. Probable: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of diet or exercise intervention , and follows a known response pat tern (i.e., as specified above) . T he event cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as the participant's clinical state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs. Definite: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug administration, follows a known response pattern, cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as the participant's condition, therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs; AND occurs immediately following a component of the study intervention , improves upon stopping/changing the intervention , or reappears on re -exposure to the intervention. Step 5: Determine if the adverse event is \"unexpected\". Step 6 : Notify the TACL Operations Center by telephone or email The following information should be submitted within 24 hours of event notification by either phone (323)361 -3022 , or Email tacl@chla.usc.edu . 1. Patient TACL study ID and initials 2. Event description 3. Severity (NCI Grade) 4. Onset date 5. Reason event is considered serious 6. Dates of relevant study intervention 7. Investigator opinion of relationship to study intervention T2020 -003 Protocol version 05/28/2021 1SEP 2022 40 CONFIDENTIAL TACL Internal Distribution Only 8. Name and phone number of physician in charge of the case 9. Name and phone number of CRA or Research nurse w orking with the case Step 7 : Submit a written report to the TACL Operations Center Complete the TACL SAE Notification Form within 72 hours of learning of the event. The completed form is email to tacl@chla.usc.ed u. The form may also be faxed to (323) 361 -4505 . A follow -up SAE Notification Form must be submitted upon resolution of the event. Please confirm via email or phone that the TACL Operations Center has received this notification. 11.4 Institutional Reporting to the IRB This trial is NIH funded and uses a single IRB of record located at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles. In addition to Children's Hospital Los Angeles, It is anticipated that the following sites will participate and have the resources to support study conduct for this trial: Texas Children's Hospital - Baylor College of Medicine Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Children's Hospital and Clinics of Minnesota Ann & Robert H.

Please refer to the TACL web site ( https://tacl.chla.usc.edu ) for user manual or contact the TACL Operations Center at (323) 361 -3022 if you need assistance. The site's Registered Dietitian will facilitate report ing of 24 hour dietary recall in to the National Cancer Institute ASA - 24 database. Patients will be provided with Fitbits that will track physical activity and this data will be downloaded into a 3rd part commercial database (FitabaseTM). The following are required to be submitted to t he Operations Center for all patients entered: Paper copy of following : De-identified r oadmaps, specimen transmittal forms, weekly reporting forms that document the site's weekly safety review (see protocol section 12.2) and Bone Marrow Reports (include b oth aspirate and biopsy reports). These forms are to be e -mailed (tacl@chla.usc.edu) or faxed to the TACL Operations Office at (323) 361 -4505 at the end of each treatment phase (Induction, Consolidation) . 12.212.3 Weekly Safety Review The TACL Operations Center (TOC) conducts weekly (as needed) patient safety and review meetings with the protocol chair, protocol vice -chair, research coordinators and other administrative TACL team members to review all data submitted, non -serious adverse events and other correspondence pertaining to patients. Serious adverse events will be immediately evaluated by the study team and determination regarding notification of participating sites will be made. All serious adverse events will be sent to the C HLA IRB and DSMC if required. Any interim results that would affect patient safety would be immediately communicated to all participating TACL sites. All correspondence with sites will be done via email, with all information also being posted on a member' s only section of the TACL website. 12.312.4 Data Safety and Monitor ing Committee DSMC meetings will occur semi-annually . Every 6 months during the study conduct , a DSMC report for this study will be prepared by TACL Operations, the study statistician and the St udy Chair. Each DSMC report will provide details of study subject accrual, toxicities, deaths occurred, if any, while on the protocol therapy , current study status, responses if determined , summary of amendments to protocol/consent, lists of publications , if any from study, and plans for the study in coming year. After DSMC review, the DSMC will issue a confidential report for the study to the Study Chair and TACL Operations Center. Within 8 weeks after the DSMC meeting, a DSMC public repor t will be issued after approval of the confidential report and resolution of any issues by the Study Chair and TACL Operations Center. The public report will then be available to sites participating in the study conduct . DSMC meetings will occur every 6 months. Every 6 months, a DSMC report for each protocol will be prepared by the study statistician and study PI detailing patient accrual, toxicities, deaths on study, current study status, responses (responses will be blin ded for study arm until study completes accrual), summary of amendments to protocol/consent, lists of any publications from study, and plans for study in coming year. Any publications from the study (abstract or manuscript) will be attached to the DSMC re port. After DSMC review, the DSMC will issue a confidential report for each study to the study PI and TACL Operations Center. Not more than 8 weeks after the DSMC meeting, a DSMC public review report will also be created for each protocol after approval of the confidential report and resolution of any issues by the PI . The public report will then be made available on the TACL website https://tacl.chla.usc.edu . These reports will be filed with the IRB (and may be submitted for any international sites not participating in the single IRB as per local IRB guideline s).

This is a clinical trial, a type of research study. Your study doctor will explain the clinical trial to you. Clinical trials include only people who choose to take part. Please take your time to make your decision about taking part. You may discuss your decision with your friends and family. You can also discuss it with your health care team. If you have any questions, you can ask your study doctor for more explanation. This stu dy is being carried out by the Therapeutic Advances in Childhood Leukemia & Lymphoma (TACL) Consortium. TACL is a group of Universities and Children's Hospitals that are working together to find treatments for children with leukemia and lymphoma. Funding f or this research is provided by the National Institutes of Health National Cancer Institute. You are being asked to take part in this research study because of your diagnosis of B -cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) . Chemotherapy also makes it challenging to exercise and to eat healthy during the first month of treatment (\"induction phase\"). Being overweight during therapy for ALL may make the leukemia resistant to chemotherapy; even people starting therapy at a health y weight often gain significant weight during the first treatment phase and other physiologic changes found in those overweight. Therefore, both overweight and healthy weight people may be at risk for chemotherapy resistance. This study is being done to f ind out if reducing the amount of calories and adding exercise through a personalized nutritional menu and exercise plan can make your ALL more sensitive to chemotherapy and also reduce the amount of body fat gained during treatment. It is important for you to know why this study is being done before you decide to take part in this research study. This consent will tell you about the study. This consent will also tell you about risks and side effects that might happen to you if you take part in this study. You also need to know you do not have to take part in this study. You can talk to your doctor about other alternatives . Taking part in this study is voluntary. Why is this study being done? Local IRB changes to this document are allowed. Changes within the document should not substantially alter the meaning or intent of the consent document. If the institution or IRB insists on mak ing deletions or more substantive modifications to the consent, especially in the risks sections, they should be reviewed and approved by the TACL Operations Center and the single IRB. T2020 -003 Protocol version 05/28/2021 1SEP 2022 47 CONFIDENTIAL TACL Internal Distribution Only The goals of this study are to make your chemotherapy be more effective in treating your leu kemia and also to reduce the amount of body fat chemotherapy causes you to gain in the first month. How many people will take part in this study? It is expected that approximately 230 children and young adults will take part in this study. What will happen if I take part in this research study? You will receive the routine chemotherapy to treat your ALL as prescribed by your doctor. At the beginning of your chemotherapy, if you participate in the study, you will receive an education session regarding diet and exercise during cancer therapy. For half of those who participate, this education session will then be followed by an intensiv e program designed to help you reduce the amount of calories you eat day to day, help you exercise, and increase your overall level of activity. A dietitian and physical therapist will guide you through the program for the entire first month of your thera py. The name of this program (or intervention) is \"Improving Diet and Exercise in ALL\", or IDEAL. By agreeing to participate, you are agreeing to be randomized between the education session alone and the more intensive program with the dietitian and ph ysical therapist. Being randomized means that half the people will receive one and half of people will receive the other. This is not decided by you or your doctors, but is based on chance, like the flip of a coin. You will have an equal chance of being i n either group. Treatment will last 1 month. At the end of the month, you will have a routine evaluation by your treatment team to see how your leukemia is responding to therapy. Following this evaluation, all patients will continue for another 60 days t o see how long benefit to you from the education or IDEAL program lasts following the first month of therapy. Medical Tests During Treatment Whether you are on this study or not the following medical tests will be done to monitor for response to treatment as well as side effects related to treatment. You will have regular medical appointments throughout treatment. T he timing of the appointments will be the same regardless if you participate in the research study. These include: Physical exams with vital signs Blood tests to check your organ function including - CBC to look at your blood cells - Chemistries to look at elements and minerals in your blood - Blood tests to look at your liver and kidney function Bone Marrow Tests Lumbar Punctures Tests for R esearch Purposes: In addition to the routine tests listed above, we would like to do other tests while you are enrolled on the study. DXA scan to measure body fat and muscle Describe your dietary intake using an online form Have a physical therapist test how strong and fit you are Surveys to describe your experience during therapy Wear a Fitbit wearable tracker Collection of additional blood and marrow for research purposes Follow -up Tests After completing the treatment on this study we would like to continue to collect some medical information about how you are doing for as lon g as you are willing to let us or until the study is completely closed. We will collect T2020 -003 Protocol version 05/28/2021 1SEP 2022 48 CONFIDENTIAL TACL Internal Distribution Only information on how your ALL is doing, what kind of therapy you may be getti ng and if you have any long term side effects. What are my responsibilities? 1) Follow -up with a dietitian and physical therapist : a. During the first few days when you are in the hospital , in two weeks, at the end of the month, and again in 3 months. b. For those receiving the intensive intervention, two extra visits will occur so that you meet weekly during the first month of therapy (\"induction\") c. At these visits, your food intake and musc le fitness will be evaluated. For those in the intervention arm, additional recommendations for diet and exercise will be provided. 2) DXA Scan (Dual Energy X -ray Absorptiometry) a. At the start of the study (with in the next few days ) and repeated in about 28 days at the end of the induction phase b. This is a test that measure s how much muscle and how much fat is in your body. c. You will have to lie still for about 6 minutes for this scan. 3) Measure waist circumference a. We will measure your waist and collect your height now, in two weeks, at end of the month, and again at the end of three months 4) Have extra bone marrow aspiration drawn during a clinical bone marrow aspiration. a. Anytime you undergo a bone marrow aspiration, we will collect an additional 5ml (about 1 teaspoon) for use in research (previously collected marrow may be used if available) . If you do not have additional bone marrow available you can stay on the research study 5) Blood draws for research a. We will collect additional blood for research now, in 1 w eek, at the end of the month, and again in 3 months b. Each time, we will collect 6ml of blood (about 2 teaspoons) c. If you have a central line, we will take the blood from it, so you won't have to have an extra needle stick for research d. If you don't have a central line, we will try to take the blood at the same time you have a blood draw scheduled for your clinical care, so you might or might not have extra needle sticks for research . You can say no and refuse the blood draw and stay on the research study. 6) Wear a Fitbit\u00a9 a. For those on the intervention arm, we provide you a Fitbit device now. This is a small device you wear on your wrist that will electronically measure your steps, heart rate and sleep patterns. We will set daily goals for you to help you sta y active. This information will help you in your home activities and exercise. b. For those on the control arm, we will provide you a Fitbit at the end of the month. c. You will be allowed to keep the Fitbit at the end of the study. 7) Quality of life questionna ires a. We will ask you to complete a questionnaire about your quality of life three times (now, in about 1 month, and in about 3 months) b. Each time you do them, the questionnaires will take about 20 minutes to complete. How long will I be in the study? You will be in the study for the first phases of your routine chemotherapy (\"induction\"), which will last approximately 1 month (28 -35 days) . Following this month, there will be one additional visit at the end of the second phase ('consolidation\") which l asts approximately 56 days. Your total participation in the study will therefore be approximately 90 days. Can I stop being in the study? T2020 -003 Protocol version 05/28/2021 1SEP 2022 49 CONFIDENTIAL TACL Internal Distribution Only Yes. You can decide to stop at any time. Your clinical care will not be affected by your decision to withdraw. Tell your doctor if you are thinking about stopping or decide to stop. He or she will tell you how to stop safely. You may be asked to visit t he hospital or clinic for guidance to help any side effects you may have experienced go away. Your doctor may also stop you from taking part in this study at any time without your permission if he/she believes it is in your best interest; if you do not fo llow the study rules; if you become pregnant or begin to breast feed; or if the study is stopped. What side effects or risks can I expect from being in the study? The majority of side effects you may expect to experience are from the routine chemotherapy you will receive anyway. Additional side effects from participating in the study are as follows. Plan for Diet, Exercise, and Activity: There is always a small risk of injury when beginning any d iet or exercise plan. Your exercise will be supervised by a physical therapist, who will advise you on how to avoid injury while you exercise and will evaluate your exercise needs and abilities throughout the month. Similarly, the diet changes are designed to reduce calories and also prevent fat gain; the dietitian will carefully supervise your diet during the program and will further review healthy eating habits at the end of the month as you proceed to the remainder of your chemotherapy. DXA Scan : Each DXA examination uses a very small amount of radiation to measure your muscle and body fat . The amount of total radiation from both DXA scans is less than a single standard chest x -ray. To also give you an idea about how much radiation this is, we will ma ke a comparison with an everyday situation. Everyone receives a small amount of radiation from nature each year called \"background radiation.\" Some of this radiation comes from space and some in normally -occurring radioactive forms of water and minerals. This research all together gives your body the equivalent of about one extra day's worth of this natural radiation. Blood collection : If blood is not able to be collected from your central line and must be drawn from a vein, bruising, swelling, and pai n may occur at the site where you have blood taken. Confidential Information : There is the potential risk of accidental disclosure (release) of confidential information when you participate in research. Please see the \"Will my medical information be kep t private?\" section of this document for more details. Are there benefits to subjects taking part in the study? Participation in this study has potential to directly benefit you. Everyone participating in the study will receive education on healthy diet and exercise habits during chemotherapy. All participants will also meet with a dietitian and physical therapist during the first month of therapy which may offer additional benefi ts to answer questions surrounding diet and exercise. Together, these may help reduce chemotherapy side effects during the first few months of therapy. Participants in the intervention arm will receive an individualized plan for diet and exercise that may help further reduce chemotherapy side effects and also potentially may make the chemotherapy work better to cure the leukemia. It is hoped that the information learned from this study may also help future children and young adults with ALL by helping us understand how nutrition and activity interact with chemotherapy and ALL. What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this study? You do not have to participate in this study to receive treatment for your leukemia. Whether you participate or not, your doctor will be administering to you the standard chemotherapy for treatment your leukemia.
