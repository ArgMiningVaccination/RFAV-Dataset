Common ADHD medications for kids include stimulants, such as amphetamine and methylphenidate, and non-stimulants, such as clonidine. These medications are often most effective as part of a comprehensive treatment plan including therapy and family support. What Is Childhood ADHD? Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects people of all ages, including children. This condition is usually diagnosed first in childhood and can persist into adulthood.1 However, [childhood ADHD](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/adhd-in-children/) has long been known to affect children's ability to function in their daily life. Such children usually show developmentally inappropriate impulsivity, hyperactivity, or inattentiveness patterns. [ADHD symptoms](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/adhd-signs-symptoms/) are usually diagnosed before the age of 12. Before 12, the symptoms usually emerge with children suffering from the condition often having difficulties completing complex tasks, excessive motor activity, and uncontrolled impulsive behaviors. While the prevalence of ADHD in children and adults varies depending on the diagnostic criteria used and the population studied, it's generally accepted that childhood ADHD is more common than [adult ADHD](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/adult-adhd/). Studies have shown that the rate of children diagnosed with the condition increased by 43% between 2003 (7.8%) and 2011 (11.%), with the prevalence of adult ADHD being 4.4%.2 How Do ADHD Medications for Children Work? Several ADHD medications, including stimulants and non-stimulants, can be recommended to help manage the condition in children. [ADHD medications](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/adhd-meds/) can improve attention in children by reducing hyperactivity and impulsive behavior. These medications help regulate chemicals in the brain, such as dopamine and norepinephrine. These brain chemicals influence attention and concentration. While the medications can help with the condition, children taking the drug will likely experience common side effects. Such side effects include appetite loss and sleeping problems. The medications can also cause headaches, irritability, and a fast heart rate. These side effects can be especially bothersome when first starting the drug, and they usually continue for as long as a person continues to take the medications. Even though ADHD medication can help with the condition, it's usually used in conjunction with therapy because it can be more effective when combined than when used alone. Therapy can help people with the condition develop coping strategies and learn practical skills to manage their symptoms. Types of ADHD Medications for Kids There are several types of ADHD medications for children that a doctor might recommend. This usually depends on the medications' side effects, treatment duration, and potential interactions with other drugs. Also, consideration of these factors helps improve safety and reduces the risk of adverse medication reactions. The most commonly prescribed medications include methylphenidate, clonidine, and amphetamine. Both [stimulants and non-stimulants](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/stimulant-vs-non-stimulant-adhd-meds/) can be used. These medications work by increasing concentration and attentiveness while reducing impulsivity. However, when considering ADHD medication for your child, working with a healthcare provider who provides the right diagnosis and develops a personalized treatment plan considers your child's medical history and needs. When choosing stimulant or non-stimulant medications, your healthcare provider will consider the child's age and response to previous drugs. Stimulant ADHD Medications These medications affect the brain's neurotransmitter activity, leading to an increase in dopamine and norepinephrine effects. This helps with the body's attention regulation. Stimulant ADHD medications are categorized into short-acting and long-acting. When short-acting stimulant drugs are taken, they get released into the bloodstream immediately, and their effects begin within 30 to 45 minutes after taking them. When long-acting stimulant medications are taken, they gradually get released into the bloodstream for some time instead of all at once. These medications' effects can last up to 12 hours and are usually taken once in the morning. While both short and long-acting stimulant medications can help with ADHD, they differ in how fast each works to take effect on the body and for how long they relieve symptoms. Stimulants are more commonly prescribed to treat ADHD in children since they are considered the first line of treatment and are mostly prescribed in about 70-80% of children with the condition.3 Commonly prescribed serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which can help to improve symptoms. By being used as an SNRI, the medication prolongs the action of norepinephrine, increasing a child's ability to maintain attention. Non-stimulant ADHD medications can be beneficial, especially to children who have not benefited from or for whom the side effects of stimulant medications are intolerable. How fast or quickly non-stimulants work usually varies depending on the medication used. Clinical trials have shown that Atomoxetine, a common non-stimulant ADHD medication, may take several weeks to tale full effect when treating ADHD in children.4 Children taking these medications should expect to experience some common side effects, such as nausea and headaches. Non-stimulant ADHD medications can also cause serious side effects such as serotonin syndrome and suicidal ideation. Commonly Side Effects of ADHD Medications for Children Just like any other medication, ADHD medications for children are associated with side effects that may be mild or severe depending on several factors, including drug interactions or the condition of a child. Common side effects of ADHD medication include nausea, appetite loss, and sleeping problems. Children who take meds for ADHD will continue to have side effects for as long as they take the drug. Mild symptoms do not require immediate medical care, but you should consult a doctor if they worsen or become intolerable. Severe side effects such as serotonin syndrome and suicidal ideation are uncommon but can be potentially life-threatening. These side effects require immediate medical treatment, an inpatient stay, and a change in medication. Common side effects of the stimulant medication include: - Decreased appetite - Stomach upset - Nausea - Vomiting - Fatigue - Sleeping problems - Dizziness [Suicidal ideation](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/suicidal-ideation/)(rare) - Dry mouth - Weight loss - Potential abuse Common side effects for non-stimulant medication include: - Dry mouth - Constipation - Low energy - Abdominal pain - Headaches - Dizziness - Nausea or vomiting It's important to note that severe side effects of ADHD medications can cause possible organ failure and sudden death. For this reason, if you are experiencing severe side effects of the medications, such as fainting, call the 911 emergency number for immediate medical assistance. Potential Risks of ADHD Medications for Children ADHD medications can be effective in managing ADHD symptoms in children, but like any other medication, they have potential risks that can be dangerous if not addressed on time. Some of the potential risks posed by the drugs include cardiovascular risks (risk of increased heart rate and blood pressure), psychiatric risks (increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors), and behavioral and psychological effects (such as mood changes and sleep problems). Your doctor can evaluate the safety concerns with medications and consider an appropriate treatment. Children With Pre-Existing Health Conditions Before a child starts ADHD medication, it is first important for a prescribing doctor to understand the child's medical history. Children with other health conditions could be at risk for cardiac problems and high blood pressure if the medication is taken without following proper guidelines. Also, the medications can increase their conditions' side effects, making it hard to manage the symptoms. Children Taken Certain Medications Like other medications, ADHD medications for kids can negatively interact with other drugs. ADHD medications are contraindicated when taking certain drugs, such as fluoxetine ( [Prozac](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/prozac/)) or paroxetine ( [Paxil](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/paxil-paroxetine/)), as they can negatively interact with each other triggering individual side effects. Also, the interaction can lead to possible overdose and increase serotonin syndrome risk.

However, since ADHD is a very complex psychiatric disorder among children, skill training sessions can help children with the condition.

These skills can also positively affect a child's academic performance and overall quality of life.

Your doctor will make you understand the benefits and risks of the medication. This way, your doctor will help address safety concerns for the medications. You can ask your prescriber about the ADHD medications suitable for your child's symptoms or what you should do if you want your child to stop taking the medication.
