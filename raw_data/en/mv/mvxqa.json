Introduction Background of the Study The use ofherbaland dietarysupplements (HDS)among cancer patients undergoing treatment/chemotherapy has been a topicof concern among clinicians. With increasing use, there have been numerous reports of associated adverse events, notablyits potential to interact with conventional treatment. 1 In the local setting, a study among 100 respondents revealed that 78% have used at least one form ofKeywords herbal supplement expenditure physician disclosure treatment adherenceAbstract The use of herbal and dietary supplement in cancer patients has been increasing over the past years, while the risk of its adverse effects and undesirable reactions withconventional treatment has also been accumulating. Limited studies involving percep-tion of herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) by cancer patients have been conductedin our setting. An initial survey was conducted among adult cancer patients undergoingtreatment at the Zamboanga City Medical Ce nter (ZCMC) Cancer Institute. HDS users were recruited for focus group discussion (FGD) via purposive sampling. A total of four groups were conducted. Clinical and demographic data were presented throughdescriptive statistics while data from the FGD were subjected to coding and thematicanalysis. Among 22 respondents, more than half (65.4%) of the participants were notedto have used HDS and most (54.5%) were breast cancer patients with stage-II and -IIIdisease. Treatment of cancer, coping with chemotherapy, and relief of symptoms werethe major reasons for use. Majority (36.36%) were in fluenced by the media/internet and most (50%) did not disclose information to their physician. Eight respondents, whose income were below minimum wage, spent more than 25% of their income on HDS, with some having spent more than 50%. This may seriously limit funds and result in failure toadhere to treatment. Among cancer patients in ZCMC, HDS use is widely practiced andhalf of them do not disclose this information to their physicians. The expenditure onHDS consumes 25 to 50% of the population 's meager monthly income. The secrecy surrounding its use and attendant cost may possibly limit adherence and adverselyaffect outcomes.

A focus group study conducted among Dutch adults noted that HDSwas usedmainly for preventive health reasons, curative bene ts, and for physical and mental enhancement. 5Major reasons behind the rise in HDS use in cancer patients is the misconception ofcuring cancer and reducing effects of cancer treatment. 6-8In comparison to nonusers, other factors behind the use of CAM in cancer patients were due dissatisfaction with conventionaltreatment and it 's presumed action as an anticancer agent. 9-11 In our locality, data regarding reasons and explanation to their use are lacking with one study highlighting treatment ofcancer to be the primary reason. 4 Signi cance of the Study The use of HDS has important implications in the role of cancer treatment in this population. Understanding the behavior of these individuals is essential for health careprofessionals to better support treatment adherence and avoid unwanted pharmacological interactions. This study aims to explore the reasons and patterns of HDS use among patients in Zamboanga City Medical Center (ZCMC) Cancer Institute who are undergoing treatment. Data obtained by this paper may be used to increase awareness ofthe magnitude of the issue and encourage physicians to explore the use of HDS among their patients. Research Question What are the factors affecting herbal and dietary supplement use among patients undergoing treatment at the ZCMC Cancer Institute? Operational Terms Dietary supplement: a product taken by mouth intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains one or more dietary ingredients (DSHEA)12 Medicinal plant: plant-derived materials or products with therapeutic or health bene ts.13 Processed plant material: plant materials treated according to traditional procedures to make medicinal preparations.13 Medicinal herbal product: nished, labeled pharmaceuti- cal products in dosage forms.13 Objectives General objective: This study aimed to explore factors af- fecting HDS use among patients undergoing treatment at the ZCMC Cancer InstituteSpeci c Objectives 1. To identify clinical and demographic characteristics of the participant. 2. To identify causes and explanation leading to HDS use. 3. To describe patterns of HDS use and experience of participant. 4. To describe the impact on expenses entailed with HDS. Methodology Study Design This research utilized both quantitative and qualitative studydesign. Clinical and demographic information were inter- preted using descriptive statistics. Qualitative informationwas obtained using focus group discussion (FGD)/interview. Study Population Participants consisted of any adult patient undergoing treat- ment at the cancer center who can understand and speak Filipino and/or English language. Patients who were exclud-ed were those with altered inability to consent, cognitive impairment, and patients less than 18 years of age. Data Collection An initial survey to identify HDS users from nonusers was initially conducted. HDS users were recruited via purposivesampling and invited to participate in the interview. In observance of the protocol with the novel coronavirus dis- ease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a virtual FGD was advisedby the ethical review board but was limited by unavailability of resources. Actual face-to-face interviews were done in- stead. FGDs were conducted in concordance with thepatients 'follow-up schedule at the cancer center for their convenience. Safety protocols were followed during the interview. A total of four focus groups each with 60- to 90-minute sessions were conducted until saturation of data was achieved. Clinical and demographic data, such as age, gender, educational attainment, income, type and stage of cancer,were gathered. During the interviews, a digital voice record- er was used to record conversations. Information obtained was transcribed into electronic data and was translated intoEnglish. Data Analysis Two forms of data were produced. Descriptive statistics was used to characterize the study population and was tran- scribed onto electronic data collection forms. Data gatheredfrom the FGD were transcribed verbatim and underwent thematic analysis (coding and generation of themes). Ethical Considerations The protocol was approved by the technical and ethical review board of ZCMC. All data were assigned codes duringdata collection to preserve anonymity. All patients were given consent forms that described the signi cance, objec- tives, and the data collection process of the study. Theprincipal investigator read the contents of the forms to the patients prior to obtaining a voluntary consent. They were Asian Journal of Oncology \u00a9 2022.

There were no con flicts of interest between the research- er, participants, and ZCMC. Limitations The population may not fully represent all cancer patients in ZCMC such as patients not undergoing treatment at the ZCMC cancer center and in-hospital patients. The caseswere gathered for 3 months, from June to August 2020, reflecting conclusions only to this time and setting. Results Clinical and Demographic Characteristics of the Participant Of 55 cancer patients who were surveyed, it was revealed that 36 (65.4%) were taking or have previously taken HDS,while 19 (34.5%) have never used. Of the current/previous users, 22 of the HDS users agreed and consented to partici- pate in the FGD. More than half of the participants were aged 41 to 60 years (68.2%). Others were between 19 and 40 years of age (22.7%), and only a very few patients were more than 60 years of age(9%). The mean age of the patients was 44.6 years. The highest rate of HDS use belong to the age group of 41 to 60 years. Most were female (91%) and were living in Zam-boanga City (77.3%). Most (63.6%) of the participants were graduate/undergraduate from high school. Most (77.3%) of the participants had a household income of 10,000 PHP(Philippine peso) and below ( Table 1 ). Majority of those who participated and those who used HDS were breast cancer patients (54.5%; Table 2 ). Gyneco- logic, colorectal, and esophageal cancer consisted of the other participants. One patient had gastric cancer. Patients in our study belonged to both stage-2 (36.3%) and stage-3(45.4%) disease. Causes and Explanation Leading to Herbal and Dietary Supplements Use (See Focus Group Interview Results) Aims and Motivations Derived from the FGD, the most frequently mentioned a i m sb e h i n dH D Su s ec a nb eg r o u p e di n t o ve major categories ( Table 3 ): treatment of cancer, relief of cancer symptoms, coping with cancer treatment, treatment of other health conditions, and promotion of overall health. Many patients had several reasons. Half of the participantsmentioned to have used HDS with the goal of cancer treatment. The most frequently mentioned reason for patients taking HDS was for treatment or cure of cancer (50%). Among these expectations include softening the mass, shrinking the tu- mor, and preventing its spread to other sites. Other major aims among patients were taking HDS for coping with the effects of chemotherapy (40.9%) and for relieving symptoms related to cancer (40.9%).

Other patients took HDS to improve their overall health (31.82%). It gave the participants a better sense of health describing it as giving them a better aura, energy boost, and amore active feeling. Patients also claimed that use of HDS improved their appetite, sleep, and ambulation. A goal for a minority (18.18%) was for addressing other health condi-tions, such as comorbidities, like diabetes and hypertension. Others took it for chronic back pain, urinary tract infection, and bloody urination. Perceptions on Herbal and Dietary Supplements and Conventional Treatment A recurring theme was the perception of the role of HDS in relation to conventional cancer treatment ( Table 4 ). Most of the participants (40.9%) perceive HDS to be equallyimportant to conventional treatment with respect to cancer therapy. A number considered HDS to be an adjunct (27.27%). These patients placed more importance to chemotherapyover HDS. Other participants believe that HDS has no role (18.18%) and that conventional treatment is the sole effective therapy. This set of patients previously used HDS and even-tually discontinued its use. One participant placed less priority to treatment (4.54%).Patterns of Herbal and Dietary Supplements Use and Experience of Participant The types of HDS used by the participants were either in the form medicinal plant or medicinal herbal product ( Table 5 ). Many patients used more than one HDS and both types have been described to used concurrently or at different times (Table 6 ). The medicinal plant was used more frequently (n\u00bc24) than the medicinal herbal product ( n\u00bc17). Its preparation was described to involve production of a decoc- tion directly from its leaves, stems, or roots usually throughboiling or cooking. These were either taken together or on different times in a day. It was observed that the most frequently used HDS was guyabano (40.9%), also known as \"Soursoup \"orAnnona muricata , while the most frequently used medicinal herbal products were Sante Barley juice (27.27%) and Power Cellcapsule (22.72%). Patterns of Herbal and Dietary Supplements Use Majority of participants started using HDS after diagnosis of cancer (54.54%; Table 6 ). Most patients have used HDS for less than 1 year (54.54%). A few have been using HDS for morethan 1 year (9.09%). Almost all patients had daily intake of HDS (77.27%), twice to thrice a day when available. Other patients claimed to have intermittent intake, depending ofthe availability of resources. A number of participants (31.8%) still continue taking HDS claiming to be satis edTable 4 Themes in perceptions on HDS in relation to conventional cancer treatment ( n\u00bc22) n % Equally important 9 40.9Adjunctive 6 27.27 No role 4 18.18 Better 1 4.54No mention 2 9.09 Abbreviation: HDS, herbal and dietary supplements.Table 3 Reasons and motivations for HDS use ( n\u00bc22, most patients with multiple reasons) Aim n % Treatment of cancer 11 50 Relief of cancer symptoms 9 40.9Coping with chemotherapy (chemotherapy/operation)9 40.9 Promotion of overall health 7 31.82 Other health condition 4 18.18 Abbreviation: HDS, herbal and dietary supplements.Table 5 Herbal and dietary supplements used ( n\u00bc22, most patients using multiple types/ n\u00bcno. of speci cH D S ) Name ( n\u00bc11)Turmeric 'herbal 1 4.54 Ling xi Tea 1 4.54 Amway double X 1 4.54Sante Barley Juice 6 27.27Power cell capsule 5 22.72 Xanthone capsule 1 1 4.54Vita Plus 1 4.54 Abbreviation: HDS, and dietary supplements.

Sources of Information As i g n i cant number of participants were introduced to HDS by either their peers (40.9%), which include mostly neighbors and coworkers, and by the media (36.36%) which consistmostly of the internet (e.g., YouTube) and radio ( Table 7 ). Relatives, rst-to-second degree, have also been mentioned by some to be sources of information to HDS use (27.27%).Other in fluences include educational events, traditional healers, and even physicians. Many patients had multiple sources of information. Communication with Physician Half (50%) of the participants claimed their physician to beunaware of their HDS intake ( Table 8 ). Only a few claimedto be willing to admit. Others did not comment. Other patients 'physicians were aware of the intake. Among those who knew, there were varied responses from the physicians. Some discouraged its use, some had no comment, and onephysician encouraged its use. Impact on Expenses Entailed with Herbal and Dietary Supplements Use Majority (45.5%) claimed to have spent 501 to 2,000 PHP monthly on HDS ( Table 9 ). While most patients (68.1%) had monthly incomes less than the minimum wage,14eight of the respondents spent more than 25% of their income on HDS, with four of them having spent more than half of theirmonthly income ( Fig. 1 ). Focus Group Interview Results This section of the report presents ndings from the focus group interviews in the form of a summary of what respon-dents said in response to speci c questions. The information in this section represents the researchers 'interpretation based on the following: (1) notes made during the focusgroup meetings, (2) a review of the audio and video record- ings, and (3) a content analysis of the typed transcripts from the four meetings.

All rights reserved.Herbal and Dietary Supplement Use among Adult Patients Enriquez, Esplana Treatment of Cancer Majority claimed to have used HDS as a cure for their cancer. Among them were patients who took it to reduce the size of their cancer and to slow or prevent the spread of cancer toother sites. Illustrative quotations from the focus groups as follows: \"I was desperate to be cured, that is why I took herbal medicine \" \"because I wanted to be free from cancer, stating 'Iw a s hoping that the mass on my breasts would soften andshrink '\" \"I expected it to shrink the lump on my breast. \" \"I drank Okra and Malunggay to prevent it from spreading to other areas of my body. \" Unlike other aims for taking HDS where patient 's expect- ations were met, there was no mention that the aim of cancer cure or prevention of progression has been actualized.Illustrative quotation from the focus groups is mentioned below: \"Id i d n 't get the results I expected, I decided to stop, realized I was wasting money. \" Coping with Treatment One of the aims of patients taking HDS was coping with the effects of chemotherapy for cancer. HDS allowed patients totolerate the effects of chemotherapy. Participants claimed to have experience a place response with weakness and ex- haustion after chemotherapy being relieved by taking HDS.Other than chemotherapy, coping with another form oftreatment, particularly surgical intervention was mentioned. Illustrative quotations from the focus groups are as follows: \"I'm feeling a lot better because my body is already ghting and resisting the effects of chemotherapy. \" \"I feel active especially after chemotherapy, more energy inside my body. \" \"It boosts my strength, especially after chemotherapy. \" \"Even I just had operation, my body was strong, it 'sa si fIa m not ill. \" Relief of Cancer Symptoms There were also a few patients who took HDS for relief of symptoms. Illustrative quotations from the focus groups are as follows: \"Usually experienced anal pains, guyabano leaves offered relief. \"' 'Experienced constipation, had no bowel movement for a week, I felt relief with herbal medicine. \" Promotion of Overall Health Other patients took HDS to improve their overall health in general. It gave the participants a better sense of health describing it as giving them a better aura, energy boost, and amore active feeling. Patients also claimed that the use of HDS improved their appetite, sleep, and ambulation. Illustrative quotations from the focus groups are men- tioned below: \"To boost my immune system. \" \"It helps me eat and sleep well. \" Fig. 1 Representation of Philippine people 's monthly income.

These patientstend to have used HDS even before being diagnosed with cancer. Illustrative quotations from the focus groups are as follows: \"I was not doing it to get rid of my cancer but for my hypertension and blood sugar level. \" \"I was feeling okay when drinking guyabano. \" Perceptions on Herbal and Dietary Supplements and Conventional Treatment In our study, most patients perceive HDS and chemotherapy to have an equally important role in management of cancer. Other participants perceive HDS to be an add-on therapy to conventional treatment. Equal Role Illustrative quotations from the focus groups are as follows: \"For me, chemotherapy and herbal medicine are equally important. \" \"I think chemotherapy alone wouldn 't be enough. I think chemotherapy and herbal medicine are equally important. \" Adjunctive Role Followings are the illustrative quotations from the focus groups: \"Chemotherapy is better because it kills cancer cells, I only see food supplements as additional medication to mymaintenance (chemotherapy). \" \"I think chemotherapy is better. If there 's an herbal medicine that I can take along with chemotherapy that will help easethe pain, I would also want that. \" No Role Illustrative quotations from the focus groups are as follows: \"I believe chemotherapy and radiation is the best for me. \" \"I do not drink any herbal medicines anymore. The cancer didn 'tg oa w a y . \" \"I believe only chemotherapy can help me. \" More Important than Conventional Treatment Illustrative quotation from the focus groups is mentioned below: \"Ir e a l l yd o n 't like chemotherapy, I felt weak post chemo- therapy, she (the physician) told me to stop herbal medica-tion, I still kept taking it because I became dependent. \"Discussion The proportion of HDS users in our study is 65.4% with majority being breast cancer patients (54.5%). Studies from other countries also revealed breast cancer to have thehighest rate of HDS use (29.5 -51.6%). 6-8,15,16In multivariate analysis, however, cancer site is not a signi cant predictor of HDS use.15 Most of the patients in our study began using HDS after cancer diagnosis, consistent with previous published studies done which observed that the rate of use of herbal medicinetripled after cancer diagnosis. 8The commonly used HDS in our setting revealed to be guyabano or A. muricata which was a similar nding in a local study.4A review by Yajid et al in 2011 revealed the increasing use of this herb as an alterna- tive in the treatment of cancer, particularly for its potential in virus-related cancer and in-skin papillomagenesis.17-19To the best of our knowledge, its presumed effect as an anti- inflammatory and anticancer agent is still unestablished, as clinical trials are unavailable. Several studies have evaluated reasons and motivation for the use of HDS. In cancer patients, various studies discovered different reasons with majority noting the following: toreduce the adverse effects linked to cancer treatment to directly ght the disease and to improve physical well- being. 6-8Our investigation found that majority of patients were using HDS with the goal of cancer treatment. Additional reasons include coping with chemotherapy and relief of cancer symptoms. These ndings are very much similar to the prior study conducted at the PGH.4In relation to this, it is vital to note that a recent observational study that examined patients choosing alternative medicine in lieu of convention-al cancer treatment showed higher risk of death than those who chose the latter. 20 It is important to highlight the nding that many patients consider HDS to be equally important to conventional cancer treatment. Cancer patients 'perception to complementary medicine was explored in the Swiss study and found out thatmajority of the patients view it to be bene cial with positive effects, having little to very little negative impact on their condition. 7 Physician -patient communication is also an integral factor behind HDS use, as it can greatly in fluence patient behavior toward treatment plans and adherence. A study inthe United States noted that 14.8% of physicians were unaware of cancer patients 'HDS use, 6while as high as 76% of patients in a local study were unmonitored withtheir HDS use showing that primary health care providers give less emphasis on this subject. Most patients consider herbal medicine as harmless and thus do not give priority toopenly discussing this matter with their health care pro- viders. 16The absence of relevant physician -patient discus- sion with regard to HDS use might be the reason that family,friends, and media were major sources of information. 4As for our observation, half of the participants in our study cited peers, media, internet, and relatives as sources ofinformation.

All rights reserved.Herbal and Dietary Supplement Use among Adult Patients Enriquez, Esplana It is alarming to note that while the monthly income for most patients fall below the minimum wage, the expenditureallocated for HDS comprised a large portion of their income. The increase in expenditure to HDS use has increased dramatically in other countries. 21,22In an Italian multicenter survey, patients were noted to spend a large proportion of their income to HDS.8A local study of cancer patients revealed a mean monthly expenditure on HDS exceeding25% of the mean income. 4Despite being classi ed under poor- to low-income cluster in economic status,14,23our ndings highlight important implications with HDS use in thenancial burden in this population whose funds are already limited by costs of livelihood and conventional treatment. Conclusion HDS use is common among cancer patients undergoing treatment in ZCMC. The following factors have an impact to its use: purpose of use, patient education, and sources ofinformation. Most patients initiate HDS use with the goal of treating cancer and coping with the effects of chemotherapy, with the perception on having an equally important role asconventional cancer treatment. A signi cant number of patients are in fluenced by their peers and most do not disclose this information to their health care providers. Inaddition, it adds to the nancial burden in cancer patients and may possibly limit resources supposedly allotted for chemotherapy. Recommendation Emphasis must be placed on health education to combat misinformation. Establishment of hospital policies and reg- ulations may also be implemented to screen and restrict HDSuse among cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Larg- er future studies that investigate the impact of HDS use during treatment of cancer and studies that focus on theeffects of HDS on nancial burden should be explored.
