Essentials of Pediatric Nursing was written to direct students to an understanding of critical concepts related to pediatric nursing. The book builds upon the student's prior knowledge base. As simpler and broader concepts are mastered first, the students are then able to progress to problem solving in more complex situations. The concepts-based approach to nursing education is time-efficient for nursing educators and fosters the development of critical thinking skills in student nurses. The main objectives of the second edition of Essentials of Pediatric Nursing are to provide student nurses with the basis needed for sound nursing care of children and the ability to think critically within various health care environments. The book covers a broad scope of topics, placing emphasis on common issues and pediatric-specific content, including atraumatic care. The text presents the important differences when caring for children as compared to caring for adults. Rather than repeating medical-surgical content that the student has already mastered, the text builds upon that knowledge base. This approach is supported by many of the book's features, such as the reoccurring feature Thinking About Development. A nursing process approach provides relevant information in a concise and nonredundant manner. In Unit 4 , specific nursing process content is discussed as appropriate for a given disorder.* Organization Each chapter of Essentials of Pediatric Nursing focuses on a different aspect of pediatric nursing care. The book is divided into four units, beginning with general concepts related to pediatric nursing and followed by normal growth and development and specifics related to caring for children. The fourth unit focuses on nursing management of alterations in children's health. Unit 1 : Foundations of Pediatric Nursing Unit 1 presents the foundational material the nursing student needs to understand how nursing care of the child differs from that of the adult. The unit provides information about general concepts relating to child health. Perspectives on pediatric nursing, the nursing process, and factors influencing child health are key concepts covered in this unit. Unit 2 : Health Promotion of the Growing Child and Family Unit 2 provides information related to growth and development expectations of the well child from the newborn period through adolescence. Though not exhaustive in nature, this unit provides a broad knowledge base related to normal growth and development that the nurse can draw upon in any situation. Common concerns related to growth and development and child/family education are included in each age-specific chapter. Unit 3 : Working With Children and Families Unit 3 covers broad concepts that provide the foundation for providing nursing care to children. Rather than reiterating all aspects of nursing care, the unit focuses on specific details needed to provide nursing care for children in general. The family-centered approach, atraumatic care, communication, and teaching children and families are key concepts in this unit. Additional topics covered in this unit include anticipatory guidance and routine well-child care (including immunization and safety), health assessment, nursing care of the child in diverse settings, concerns common to special needs children, pediatric variations in nursing procedures, and pain management in children. Unit 4 : Nursing Care of the Child With a Health Disorder Unit 4 focuses on children's responses to health disorders. This unit provides comprehensive coverage of illnesses affecting children. It is arranged according to broad topics of disorders organized with a body systems approach and also includes infectious, genetic, and mental health disorders as well as pediatric emergencies. Each chapter follows a similar format to facilitate presentation of the information as well as reduce repetition. The chapter begins with a nursing process overview for the particular broad topic, presenting differences in children and how the nursing process applies. The approach provides a general framework for addressing disorders within the chapter. Individual disorders are then addressed with attention to specifics related to pathophysiology, nursing assessment, nursing management, and special considerations. Common pediatric disorders are covered in greater depth than less commondisorders. The format of the chapters allows for a strong knowledge base to be built and encourages critical thinking. Additionally, the format is nursing process driven and consistent from chapter to chapter, providing a practical and sensible presentation of the information. *Nursing Process Overview contains NANDA-I approved nursing diagnoses. Material related to nursing diagnoses is from Nursing Diagnoses\u2014Definitions and Classification 2009-2011 \u00a9 2009, 2007, 2005, 2003, 2001, 1998, 1996, 1994 NANDA International. Used by arrangement with Wiley-Blackwell Publishing, a company of John Wiley & Sons, Inc. In order to make safe and effective judgments using NANDA-I nursing diagnoses it is essential that nurses refer to the definitions and defining characteristics of the diagnoses listed in this work. Recurring Features In order to provide the student and educator with an exciting and user-friendly text, a number of recurring features have been developed. Key Terms Each chapter includes a list of key terms that are considered to be vital to understanding the content in the chapter. Each key term appears in boldface, with the definition included in the text. The key terms may also be accessed on Learning Objectives The provision of learning objectives for each chapter helps to guide the student toward prioritizing information for learning. The objectives also provide a method for the student to evaluate understanding of the presented material. Words of Wisdom Each chapter opens with inspiring Words of Wisdom (WOW), which offer helpful, timely, or interesting thoughts. These WOW statements set the stage for the chapter and give the student valuable insight into the nursing care of children and their families. Case Studies Real-life scenarios present relevant child and family information that is intended to perfect the student's care-giving skills. Questions throughout the chapter about the scenarios provide an opportunity for the student to critically evaluate the appropriate course of action.

The actions, indications, and significant nursing implications presented assist the student in providing optimum care to children and their families. Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests The Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests tables in each chapter of Unit 4 provide the student with a general understanding of how a broad range of disorders is diagnosed. Rather than reading the information repeatedly throughout the narrative, the student is then able to refer to the table as needed. Common Medical Treatments The Common Medical Treatments tables in each chapter of Unit 4 provide the student with a broad awareness of how a common group of disorders is treated either medically or surgically. The table serves as a reference point for common medical treatments.

Isabelle Romano is a 6-year-old girl with cerebral palsy. She was born at 28 weeks' gestation and is currentlyadmitted to the hospital due to difficulty breathing secondary to pneumonia. Her parents are very active in her care. Isabelle lives at home with her parents and two brothers, Sergio and Tito. Consider how your role as a nurse can affect this family. Children are the future of our society. Their overall health has improved, and rates of death and illness in some areas have decreased, but we still must focus on children's health both in the United States and globally. Habits and practices established in childhood have profound effects on health and illness throughout life. As a society, creating a population that cares about children and promotes preventative and quality health care and positive lifestyle choices is crucial. Pediatric nurses play a major role in this task. They are often \"in the trenches\" advocating on various issues, drawing attention to the importance of health care for children, encouraging a focus on education and prevention, and assisting families who lack resources or access to health care. This chapter provides an overview of child health, an introduction to pediatric nursing, and a discussion of ethical and legal issues related to caring for children.CHILD HEALTH Children are a gift to this world, and, as such, it is society's responsibility to nurture and care for them. In the past, health was defined simply as the absence of disease; health was measured by monitoring the mortality and morbidity of a group. Over the past century, however, the focus of health has shifted to disease prevention, health promotion, and wellness. The World Health Organization (2011) defines health as \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" The History of Child Health and Child Health Care In past centuries in the United States, the health of the country was poorer than it is today; mortality rates were high and life expectancy was short. When a flood of immigrants from Europe settled in the eastern American cities, infectious diseases were rampant due to crowded living conditions, inadequate and unsanitary food (e.g., contaminated milk), lack of any childhood immunizations, and harsh working conditions (including child labor). Devastating epidemics of smallpox, diphtheria, scarlet fever, and measles hit children the hardest. During this period, the prevalent view was that children were a commodity; their role was to increase the population and share in the work to be done. This view changed over the years. Public schools were established and the court system began viewing children as minors. The health of children began to receive more and more attention. As the end of the 19th century neared, doctors and scientists gained a much better understanding of the root causes of illness. This knowledge helped fuel public health efforts such as the campaign for safe milk supply, which lead to pasteurizing milk and to dispensing free milk in some cities (Richter, 2004). Compulsory vaccination programs began during this time. In the late 1800s some states mandated smallpox vaccination as a condition of school attendance. These public health efforts led to a decrease in infant and child deaths (Richter, 2004). In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, cities became healthier places to live due to urban public health improvements, such as sanitation services and treated municipal water (Richter, 2004). The threat of childhood diseases such as diphtheria, cholera, polio, and yellow fever began to take less of a toll on children (Richter, 2004). The turn of the 20th century brought new knowledge about nutrition, sanitation, bacteriology, pharmacology, medication, and psychology. Penicillin, corticosteroids, and increased numbers of vaccines, which were developed during this time, assisted with the fight against communicable diseases. Thus, by the end of the 20th century, unintentional injuries surpassed disease as the leading cause of death for children older than 1 year (Richter, 2004). By the end of the 20th century, technological advances had significantly affected all aspects of health care. These trends have led to increased survival rates in children. However, many children who survive illnesses that were previously considered fatal are left with chronic disabilities. For example, before the 1960s, extremely premature infants did not survive because of the immaturity of their lungs. Mechanical ventilation and the use of medications to foster lung development have increased survival rates in premature infants, but survivors are often faced with myriad chronic illnesses such as chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia), retinopathy of prematurity, cerebral palsy, and developmental delay. This increased survival has resulted in a significant increase in chronic illness relative to acute illness as a cause of hospitalization and mortality. In recent years there have been tremendous improvements in technology and biomedicine. This has created a trend toward earlier diagnosis and treatment of disorders and diseases. Throughout the 1990s remarkable progress was made linking genetics and pathophysiologic processes. For example, female fetuses diagnosed with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a genetic disorder resulting in a steroid enzyme deficiency that can lead to disfiguring anatomic abnormalities of sexual characteristics, are able to receive treatment before birth. This can lead to fewer anatomic abnormalities and may even allow for normal female genitalia to develop (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, 2009). In addition, many genetic defects are being identified so that counseling and treatment may occur early. In addition to improvement in technology and biomedicine, a number of national and international organizations have been formed in recent years to protect children's rights both in the United States and worldwide. These organizations focus on such issues as violence and abuse, child labor and soldiering, juvenile justice, child immigrants and orphaned children, and abandoned or homeless children\u2014all of which have a negative impact on children's health. A child whose rights are restored and upheld has an improved opportunity for growth, development, education, and health. The gains in child health have been huge, but, unfortunately, these gains are not shared equally among all children. Certain health concerns, such as poor nutrition, obesity, infections, lead poisoning, and asthma, affect poor children at higher rates and with greater severity than affluent and middle-class children (National Institute for Health Care Management, 2007). Unintentional injuries continue to be the leading cause of death in children older than 1 year, but children's health remains threatened by illnesses and other health- related conditions in the 21st century (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]/National Center for Health Statistics, 2010). Obesity, environmental toxins, allergies, drug abuse, child abuse and neglect, and mental health problems are among some of the key issues that endanger children's health today.Federal Legislation Affecting Child Health Numerous federal programs have had a major impact on child health. President Theodore Roosevelt began the crusade to assist children and their families, especially the poor. The establishment of the Children's Bureau in 1912 began a period of studying economic and social factors related to infant mortality, infant care in rural areas, and other factors related to children's health. The goal of these legislative efforts was to improve the standards of health care. These actions demonstrate the value that society has placed on the welfare of children. Table 1.1 lists several significant pieces of federal legislation and describes their impact on children's health. Measurement of Children's Health Status In 1979, the U.S. Surgeon General's Report Healthy People presented an agenda for the nation that identified the most significant preventable threats to health. With the series of updates that followed, including the present one, Healthy People 2020: The Road Ahead , the United States has a comprehensive health promotion and disease prevention agenda that is working toward improving the quantity and quality of life for all Americans (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010a). Overarching goals are to eliminate preventable disease, disability, injury, and premature death; achieve health equity, eliminate disparities, and improve the health of all groups; create physical and social environments that promote good health; and promote healthy development and behaviors across every stage of life (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010a). The principle behind this report is that setting national objectives and monitoring their progress can motivate action and change. The report incorporates input from public health and prevention experts; federal, state, and local governments; over 2,000 organizations; and the public in developing health objectives. There are specific health topic areas, including children's health topics, which serve as a method for evaluation of progress made in public health. These topic areas also serve as focal points to coordinate national health improvement efforts. For example, one objective under the physical activity topic is to increase the proportion of adolescents who meet current federal physical activity guidelines for aerobic physical activity and for muscle-strengthening activity (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010a). Healthy People 2020 monitors four foundation health measures to assess the progress toward promoting health, preventing disease and disability, eliminating disparities, and improving quality of life (see the Healthy People 2020 feature for additional information on these health measures) (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010a). HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Four Foundation Health Measures 1. General health status Measures include: Life expectancy Healthy life expectancy Years of potential life lost Physically and mentally unhealthy days Self-assessed health status Limitation of activity Chronic disease prevalence 2. Health-related quality of life and well-being Measures include: Physical, mental, and social health-related quality of life Well-being/satisfaction Participation in common activities 3. Determinants of health (a range of personal, social, economic, and environmental factors that influence health status) Include: Biology Genetics Individual behavior Access to health services The environment in which people are born, live, learn, play, work, and age 4. Disparities Measures include differences in health status based on: Race/ethnicity Gender Physical and mental ability Geography Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . From U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. (2010). HealthyPeople.gov .Retrieved December 11, 2010, from http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/about/default.aspx Measuring a child's health status is not always a simple process. For example, some children with chronic illnesses do not see themselves as \"ill\" if their disease is under control. A traditional method of measuring health is to examine mortality and morbidity data. This information is collected and analyzed to provide an objective description of the nation's health. Mortality Data Mortality is the number of individuals who have died over a specific period. This statistic is generally presented as rates per 100,000 population and is calculated from a sample of death certificates. The National Center for Health Statistics, under the Department of Health and Human Services, collects, analyzes, and disseminates these data.NEONATAL AND INFANT MORTALITY RATE Neonatal mortality is the number of infant deaths occurring in the first 28 days of life per 1,000 live births. The infant mortality rate refers to the number of deaths occurring in the first 12 months of life. It also is documented as the number of deaths in relation to 1,000 live births. The infant mortality rate is used as an index of the general health of a country. Generally, this statistic is one of the most significant measures of children's health. In 2007, the infant mortality rate in the United States was 6.8 per 1,000 live births (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, 2010). See Figure 1.1 . The infant mortality rate varies greatly from state to state as well as between ethnic groups. The United States has one of the highest gross national products in the world and is known for its technological capabilities, but its infant mortality rate is much higher, in some cases double, compared to most other developed nations (MacDorman & Mathews, 2008; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, 2010). The main causes of early infant death in the United States include problems occurring at birth or shortly thereafter, such as prematurity, low birthweight, congenital anomalies, sudden infant death syndrome, respiratory distress syndrome, unintentional injuries, and bacterial sepsis (Stanton & Behrman, 2007; Xu, Kochanek, Murphy, & Tejada-Vera, 2010). FIGURE 1.1 Infant and neonatal mortality from 1940 to 2007. (Adapted from Xu, J. Q., Kochanek, K. D., Murphy, S. L., & Tejada-Vera, B. [2010]. Deaths: Final data 2007. National Vital Statistics Reports, 58(19). Hyattsville, MD: National Center for Health Statistics. Retrieved February 16, 2011, from http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr58/nvsr58_19.pdf Take Note! Non-Hispanic African American infants have consistently had higher infant mortality rates compared to other ethnic groups (Xu et al., 2010). Preterm births and low birthweight are key risk factors for infant death; the lower the birthweight, the higher the risk of infant mortality. The percentage of infants born preterm in the United States is increasing; thus, the impact of preterm-related causes of infant death has increased. This increase may play a role in the plateau in infant mortality rates seen from 2000 to 2007 and in the higher infant mortality rates in the United States compared with other developed countries (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, 2010; Xu et al., 2010). CHILDHOOD MORTALITY RATE Childhood mortality is defined as the number of deaths per 100,000 population in children between 1 and 14 years of age. The childhood mortality rate in the United States has decreased by about 50% since 1980 (Child Trends, 2010). In 2007, the mortality rate for children between ages 1 and 4 years was 28.6 per 100,000, with the leading cause of death being unintentional injuriesfollowed by congenital malformations (CDC/National Center for Health Statistics, 2010). The mortality rate for children ages 5 to 14 years was 15.3 per 100,000, with the leading cause being unintentional injuries followed by cancer (CDC/National Center for Health Statistics, 2010). Other causes of childhood mortality include suicide, homicide, diseases of the heart, influenza, and pneumonia. Even as research continues into the preventable nature of childhood injuries, unintentional injury, such as motor vehicle accidents, fires, drowning, bicycle or pedestrian accidents, poisoning, and falls, remains a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in children. These injuries have far-reaching consequences for children, families, and society in general. Risk factors associated with childhood injuries include young age, male gender, low socioeconomic status, parents who are unmarried or single, low maternal education level, poor housing, parental drug or alcohol abuse, or low support within the family. These deaths can often be prevented through education about the value of using car seats and seat belts, the dangers of driving under the influence of alcohol and other substances, and the importance of pedestrian and bicycle safety, fire safety, water safety, and home safety. Take Note! In the United States, Native American children, followed by African American children, have the highest unintentional injury death rate (Bishai et al., 2008). Morbidity Data Morbidity is the measure of prevalence of a specific illness in a population at a particular time. It is presented in rates per 1,000 population. Morbidity is often difficult to define and record because the definitions used vary widely. For example, morbidity may be defined as visits to the physician or diagnosis for hospital admission. Also, data may be difficult to obtain. Morbidity statistics are revised less frequently because of the difficulty in defining or obtaining the information. In general, however, 57% of children in the United States enjoyed excellent health and 27% had very good health as reported in a summary of health statistics for children in 2009 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010b). Factors that may increase morbidity include homelessness, poverty, low birthweight, chronic health disorders, foreign-born adoption, attendance at day care centers, and barriers to health care. For example, 20.7% of children live in poverty and have a higher incidence of disease, limited coordination of health services, and limited access to health care, except for visits to the emergency department (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). The overall poverty rate is 14.3%, which is the highest poverty rate since 1994 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). However, the poverty rate among African Americans and Hispanics is 25.8% and 25.3%, respectively; these children are particularly at increased risk for illness (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). The most important aspect of morbidity is the degree of disability it produces, which is identified in children as the number of days missed from school or confined to bed. In 2009 about one quarter of school children, ages 5 to 17, did not miss any school due to illness or injury; however, approximately 5% missed 11 or more days of school because of injury or illness (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010b). Common health problems in children include respiratory disorders, such as asthma; gastrointestinal disturbances, which lead to malnutrition and dehydration; and injuries. Asthma is the leading chronic disease in children, affecting 10% of children in the United States (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010b). Another 11% of children have respiratory allergies, 10% suffer from hay fever, 5% from food allergies, and 12% from other allergies (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010b). In 2005 to 2006 diseases of the respiratory system were the major cause of hospitalization for children 1 to 9 years of age, while mental health disorders were the leading cause for children 10 to 14 years of age (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, 2010). In the United States during 2006, there were 4 hospital discharges for every 100 children (age 1 to 21 years) (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, 2010). The age distribution for inpatient care has changed dramatically over the past 40 years. The percent of inpatients younger than 15 years of age declined from 13% to 7% in 2006 (DeFrances, Lucas, Buie, & Golosinskiy, 2008). Figure 1.2 shows the major causes of hospitalization by age in the United States.FIGURE 1.2 Causes of hospitalization in children, 2005-2006. (From U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau. (2010). Child health USA 2010. Rockville, MD: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Retrieved March 15, 2010, from http://www.mchb.hrsa.gov/chusa10/index.html ) As more immunizations become available, common childhood communicable diseases affect fewer children. The tracking of the leading topics from Healthy People 2020 provides some positive information related to improving children's health. Improvements have occurred in child health, but morbidity and disability from some conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, attention deficit disorders, and obesity, have increased in recent decades. Also, disparities in health status among US children according to race and socioeconomic status demonstrate widening social inequalities. One trend in the United States is the increasing number of children with mental health disorders and related emotional, social, or behavioral problems. The American Academy of Pediatrics estimates that 14 million, or 1 in 5, children in the United States have mental health-related problems (American Academy of Pediatrics, n.d.). These problems may limit the child's educational success. They also increase the child's risk for significant mental health problems later in life or emotional problems and possible use of firearms, reckless driving, promiscuous sexual activity, and substance abuse during adolescence. Overall, these behavioral, social, and educational problems can interfere with children's social and academic development. Often, insurance does not reimburse for these problems, leading to additional concerns such as lack of treatment. Environmental and psychosocial factors are now an area of concern in children. They include academic difficulties, complex psychiatric disorders, self-harm and harm to others, use of firearms, hostility at school, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, and adverse effects of the media. Referring back to Isabelle Romano and her family from the beginning of the chapter, what changes in child health may have affected them?PEDIATRIC NURSING Pediatric nursing is the practice of nursing involved in the health care of children from infancy through adolescence. In the United States the number of children younger than age 18 years is approximately 74.5 million, accounting for 24% of the population (ChildStats.gov Forum on Child and Family Statistics, 2010). The definition of nursing, \"the diagnosis and treatment of human responses to actual or potential health problems,\" also applies to the practice of pediatric nursing (American Nurses Association, 2004). However, the overall goal of pediatric nursing practice is to promote and assist the child in maintaining optimal levels of health while recognizing the influence of the family on the child's well-being. This goal involves the practice of health promotion and disease prevention as well as assisting with care during disease or illness. Evolution of Pediatric Nursing In 1870, the first pediatric professorship for a physician was awarded in the United States to Abraham Jacobi, who is known as the father of pediatrics. For the first time, the medical community realized there was a need to provide specialized training and education about children to physicians. In the early 1900s, Lillian Wald established the Henry Street Settlement House in New York City; this was the start of public health nursing. This facility provided medical and other services to poor families. These services included home nurse visits to teach mothers about health care. During this time, health care personnel were trained to take care of children in hospitals, but parents of hospitalized children were discouraged from visiting to prevent the spread of infection. Restricting parents from being involved in their child's care was also thought to minimize emotional stress. Nursing in public schools began in 1902 with the appointment of Lina Rogers as a full-time public school nurse in New York. A professional course in pediatric nursing was started in the early 1900s at Teachers' College of Columbia University. In the 1960s, changes in the health care delivery system and shifts in the population's health status led to the development of the nurse practitioner role. The 1970s brought cost-control systems from the federal government because of rapid escalation of health care expenditures. In addition, the considerable changes in the US health care system in the 1980s affected pediatric nursing and child health care. The emphasis of care was on quality outcomes and cost containment. Some of these changes brought more advanced- practice nurses into the field of pediatrics. Finally, in the 1980s, the Division of Maternal-Child Health Nursing Practice of the American Nurses Association developed maternal-child health standards to provide important guidelines for delivering nursing care. Philosophy of Pediatric Nursing Children need access to care that is continuous, comprehensive, coordinated, family centered, and compassionate. This care needs to focus on their changing physical, developmental, and emotional needs. Pediatric nurses provide this care by focusing on the family, providing atraumatic therapeutic care, and using evidence-based practice. These three concepts represent an overarching philosophy of pediatric nursing care and are integrated throughout the chapters of this text. Parents or guardians play a critical role in the health and well-being of children. Providing care through a family- centered approach leads not only to better outcomes but also to better consumer satisfaction. The family is the child's primary source of support and strength. The knowledge that the family has about a child's health or illness is vital. Family-centered care involves a mutually beneficial partnership between the child, the family, and health care professionals (Harrison, 2010; O'Malley, Brown, & Krug, 2008). It applies to the planning, delivery, and evaluation of health care for children of all ages in any setting (see Chapter 8 ). Children may undergo a wide range of interventions, many of which can be traumatic, stressful, and painful. The various settings in which the child receives care can be scary and overwhelming to the child and family, and interacting with health care personnel in various settings can cause anxiety. Thus, another major component of the pediatric nursing philosophy is providing atraumatic care . This is a philosophy of providing therapeutic care through interventions that minimize physical and psychological distress for children and their families (see Chapter 8 ). Evidence-based practice involves the use of research findings in establishing a plan of care and implementing that care. It is a clinical decision-making approach involving the integration of the best scientific evidence, patient values and preferences, clinical circumstances, and clinical expertise to promote best outcomes (Salmond, 2007). It is important that nurses develop the skills and knowledge necessary to ask pertinent clinical questions, search for current best evidence, analyze the evidence, integrate the evidence into practice when appropriate, and evaluate outcomes. Evidence-based practice may lead to a decrease in variations in care while at the same time increasing quality and improving health care.Role of the Pediatric Nurse The primary role of the pediatric nurse is to provide direct nursing care to children and their families, being an advocate , educator, and manager. As a child and family advocate, the nurse safeguards and advances the interests of children and their families by knowing their needs and resources, informing them of their rights and options, and assisting them to make informed decisions. In the role of educator, the nurse instructs and counsels children and their families about all aspects of health and illness. The pediatric nurse ensures that communication with the child and family is based on the child's age and developmental level. The pediatric nurse uses and integrates research findings to establish evidence-based practice, managing the delivery of care in a cost-effective manner to promote continuity of care and an optimal outcome for the child and family. The pediatric nurse also serves as a collaborator, care coordinator, and consultant. Collaborating with the interdisciplinary health care team, the pediatric nurse integrates the child's and family's needs into a coordinated plan of care. In the role of consultant, the pediatric nurse ensures that the child's and family's needs are met through such activities as support group facilitation or working with the school nurse to plan the child's care. The dimensions of pediatric health care are changing. We live in a global community in which distances have been minimized, enabling all of us to learn, share, and exchange information. The pediatric nurse needs to be alert to the wide-ranging developmental and mental health needs of children as well as to the traits and behaviors that may lead to serious health problems. The scope of pediatric health care practice is much broader today, and pediatric nurses must include quality evidence-based interventions when developing the plan of care. In addition, pediatric nurses must incorporate new information about genetics and neurobiology and must continue to keep up with the technology explosion. Providing Culturally Focused Care The United States is no longer a \"melting pot\" of various cultures and ethnicities but a society in which each distinct individual brings a diversity and richness that as a whole enriches the country. Today, children do not fit into a set category or group. Children and families vary in terms of culture, family structure, socioeconomic status, background, and circumstances, so each child enters the health care system as a unique individual. Pediatric nurses must have greater sensitivity to the background of each child and must be able to provide care that addresses the child's uniqueness. Providing Care Across the Health-Illness Continuum As a result of improved diagnosis and treatment, the pediatric nurse now cares for children who have survived once-fatal situations, are living well beyond the usual life expectancy for a specific illness, or are functioning and attending school with chronic disabilities. While positive and exciting, these advances and trends pose new challenges for the health care community. For example, as care for premature newborns improves and survival rates have increased, so too has the incidence of long-term chronic conditions such as respiratory airway dysfunction or developmental delays. As a result, pediatric nurses care for children at all stages along the health- illness continuum, from well children, to those who are occasionally ill, to those with chronic, sometimes disabling conditions. Providing Family-Centered Care Due to the influence of managed care, the focus on prevention, better education, and technological advances, people have taken increased responsibility for their own health. Parents now want information about their child's illness, they want to participate in making decisions about treatment, and they want to accompany their children to all health care situations. As child advocates who value family-centered care, pediatric nurses can provide such empowerment and can address specific issues for children and families. Pediatric nurses must respect the family's views and concerns, address those issues and concerns, regard the parents as important participants in their child's health, and always include the child and family in the decision-making process (see Chapter 8 for more information). Providing Preventative Care Efforts to reduce costs have also led to an increased emphasis on preventive care. Anticipatory guidance is vital during each health contact with children and their families. Education of the family includes everything from keeping the home safe to preventing illness. These are major points of emphasis for pediatric nurses as they deliver care to children and their families. Providing Continuum of Care In an effort to become more cost-effective and to provide care more efficiently, the nursing care of children now encompasses acontinuum of care that extends from acute care settings such as hospitals to outpatient settings such as ambulatory care clinics, primary care offices, rehabilitative units, community care settings, long-term facilities, homes, and schools. For example, after an acute hospital stay, a child may be able to complete therapy at home, school, or another community setting and can re-enter the hospital for short periods for specific treatments or illness. This continuum of care works well for children, since current statistics indicate that among children who have a regular place for care, 75% usually receive their medical care in doctors' offices, 24% in clinics, 1% in hospital- based clinics, and 1% in hospital emergency rooms (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010b). Providing Child and Family Teaching The nurse's role in relation to morbidity and mortality in children involves educating the family and community regarding the usual causes of deaths, the types of childhood illnesses, and the symptoms that require health care. The goal is to raise awareness and provide guidance and counseling to prevent unnecessary deaths and illnesses in children. The health of children is basic to their well- being and development, and the attention given to children's health in this country has slowly increased over the years. The pediatric nurse is in an excellent position to improve the future health of children. Participating in Research Pediatric nursing involves all the essential components of contemporary nursing practice. The pediatric nurse makes use of theories and research pertaining specifically to children as well as general nursing concepts and research. Nurses must know about current trends in child health so that they can provide appropriate anticipatory guidance, counseling, and teaching for children and families and can identify high-risk groups so that interventions can be initiated early, before illness or death occurs. Implementing the Nursing Process The pediatric nurse performs all of these tasks using the framework of the nursing process . The nursing process is used to care for the child and family during health promotion, maintenance, restoration, and rehabilitation. It is a problem-solving method based on the scientific method that allows nursing care to be planned and implemented in a thorough, organized manner to ensure quality and consistency of care. The nursing process is applicable to all health care settings and consists of five steps: assessment, nursing diagnosis, outcome identification and planning, implementation, and outcome evaluation. 1. Assessment. Assessment involves collecting data about the child and family and performing physical assessment during community- based health services, at admission to an acute care setting, at periodic times during the child's hospitalization or care, and during home care visits. 2. Nursing diagnosis. The nurse analyzes the data to make judgments about the child's health and developmental status. The nursing diagnoses that result from this judgment process describe health promotion and health patterns that pediatric nurses can manage. 3. Planning and expected outcomes. The next step in the process involves developing nursing care plans that incorporate goals or expected outcomes that improve the child's dysfunctional health patterns, promote appropriate health patterns, or provide for optimal developmental outcomes. The care plan includes the specific nursing actions that assist in obtaining the outcomes. 4. Implementation. These interventions are implemented, adapted to the child's developmental level and family status, and modified if the child's response indicates the need. The care plan incorporates the family in addition to the child. 5. Evaluation. The process is continually evaluated and updated during the partnership with the child and family. Standardized care plans for specific nursing diagnoses and critical pathways for case management are often used in various pediatric settings. In general, care plans and critical pathways are becoming more evidence based, using a combination of research, group consensus, and past health care decisions to identify the most effective interventions for the child and family. The nurse is responsible for individualizing these standardized care plans based on the data collected during the assessment of the child and family and for evaluating the child's and family's response to the nursing interventions. Nursing Practice Roles in Various Health Care Settings The professional pediatric registered nurse provides care for children in a variety of settings. Acute care focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of illness and occurs in such settings as general pediatric hospital units, pediatric intensive care units, emergency departments, ambulatory clinics, surgical centers, and psychiatric centers. In the community the focus is usually on health promotion and illness prevention. Various community settings include health clinics or offices, schools, homes, day care centers, and summer camps. Care involving restorative, rehabilitative, or quality-of-life care generally takes place in rehabilitation centers or hospice programs or through service with a home health agency.There are various practice roles where the nurse's experience, competence, and educational level determine the nurse's position. For example, a clinical coordinator typically holds a baccalaureate degree and fills a leadership role in a variety of settings. The case manager, also usually a baccalaureate-prepared nurse, is responsible for integrating care from before admission to after discharge. The case manager coordinates the implementation of the interdisciplinary team in a collaborative manner to ensure continuity of care that is cost-effective, quality oriented, and outcome focused. Various changes in the health care system continue to encourage the development of the advanced practice role for pediatric nursing. The advanced practice role is an expanded nursing role that requires additional education and skills in the assessment and management of children and their families. The pediatric nurse practitioner (PNP) has a master's degree and national certification in the specialty area. The PNP is an independent and autonomous practitioner. The PNP provides health maintenance care for children (such as well-child examinations and developmental screenings) and diagnoses and treats common childhood illnesses. He or she manages children's health in primary, acute, or intensive care settings or provides long-term management of the child with a chronic illness. The family nurse practitioner (FNP) and neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP) function in a similar manner to the PNP but provide care to individuals throughout the lifespan and to newborns, respectively. The clinical nurse specialist has a master's degree and provides expertise as an educator, clinician, or researcher, meeting the needs of staff, children, and families. Take Note! The American Academy of Colleges of Nursing has recommended that nurse practitioner education be moved from the master's to the doctoral level by the year 2015 (Sperhac & Clinton, 2008). Standards of Care and Performance in Today's Environment In any role, the professional pediatric nurse is held accountable for nursing actions that adhere to the standards of care. A standard of care is a minimally accepted action expected of an individual of a certain skill or knowledge level and reflects what a reasonable and prudent person would do in a similar situation. Professional standards from regulatory agencies, state or federal laws, nurse practice acts, and other specialty groups regulate nursing practice in general. The National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners (NAPNAP), the Society of Pediatric Nurses (SPN), and the American Nurses Association (ANA) have formulated specific standards of care and professional performance for pediatric clinical nursing practice ( Table 1.2 ). These standards are tools that determine if care constitutes adequate, effective, and acceptable nursing practice. They also serve as guides and legal measures for this special area of practice. These standards promote consistency in practice, provide important guidelines for care planning, assist with the development of outcome criteria, and ensure quality nursing care. The ANA-SPN standards specify what is adequate and effective for general pediatric nursing and promote consistency in practice.ETHICAL AND LEGAL ISSUES RELATED TO CARING FOR CHILDREN Parents and guardians generally make choices about their child's health and services. As the legal custodians of minor children, they decide what is best for their child. Nurses caring for children and their families make the child's and family's needs a priority. Moral development (the ability to function in an ethical manner) and the legal requirements involved in working with children affect pediatric nurses on a daily basis. Pediatric nurses must function within ethical and legal boundaries related to their care. They must understand their state's legal requirements for routine care, consent for treatment, hospitalization, and research. Take Note! As advocates for children, nurses support policies that protect children's rights and improve children's health care. Ethical Issues Related to Working With Children and Their Families Pediatric nurses must examine their own values so that they can provide nursing care in an ethical manner. Each situation must be evaluated individually. The nurse's relationship with the child and family is of prime importance. Every day pediatric nurses encounter families from a wide variety of religious, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds, and it is critical to treat each family with respect. Family- centered care focuses on the needs of the child and family together and involves ethical treatment of the child. Advances in science and technology have led to an increased number of ethical dilemmas in health care. Many facilities have formed institutional ethics committees. These committees not only provide case-by-case review and resolution of ethical dilemmas but also review existing institutional policies and provide education to staff, physicians, children, and families on ethical issues (Nelson, 2007). Practicing ethically begins with being sensitive to the sanctity and quality of human life. An ethical nurse is accountable and uses sound reasoning to resolve ethical challenges. Ethics includes the basic principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, justice, veracity, and fidelity. The nurse must understand these principles in order to analyze and respond to ethical dilemmas. Autonomy refers to the freedom to choose and self-determination in regard to making health care decisions. Generally, parents have the autonomy to make health care decisions for their child. In certain situations, however, older children have the autonomy to give assent to care (see below), and in special situations, adolescents are granted the autonomy to consent to health care procedures without the parents' knowledge. Beneficence refers to actions that will benefit others. In pediatric care this means actions of kindness that will benefit the child rather than harming him or her. Nonmaleficence means avoiding causing harm, intentionally or unintentionally. Justice refers to acting fairly. Treatment decisions will not be based on factors such as age, gender, religion, socioeconomic status, or ethnic group. Veracity is telling the truth and fidelity is keeping promises and maintaining confidentiality and privacy. The pediatric nurse must balance these ethical components when dealing with families from a variety of cultural and religious backgrounds who are making health care decisions for their children. The process is as follows:1. Identify the problem. 2. Gather information about the problem. 3. Weigh the risks against the benefits. 4. Choose a solution. 5. Implement the solution. 6. Evaluate the outcome of the situation. Many pediatric institutions have adopted a \"bill of rights\" for children's health care. This might include the right: To be called by name To receive compassionate health care in a careful, prompt, and courteous manner To know the names of all providers caring for the child To have basic needs met and usual schedules or routines honored To make choices whenever possible To be kept without food or drink when necessary for the shortest time possible To be unrestrained if able To have parents or other important persons with the child To have an interpreter for the child and family when needed To object noisily if desired To be educated honestly about the child's health care To be respected as a person (not having people talk about the child within earshot unless the child knows what is happening) For all physicians to respect the child's confidentiality about his or her illness at all times (adapted from University of California- Irvine, n.d.) Legal Issues Related to Working With Children and Their Families Minors (children younger than 18 years of age) generally require adult guardians to act on their behalf. Parents ultimately are the decision makers for their children. Biological or adoptive parents are usually considered to be the child's legal guardian. When divorceoccurs, one or both parents may be granted custody of the child. In certain cases (such as child abuse or neglect, or during foster care), a guardian adlitem may be appointed by the courts. This person generally serves to protect the child's best interests. States generally require parental or guardian consent for minors to receive medical treatment, but some exceptions exist (refer to the section on consent below). Confidentiality of patient information should always be maintained within the context of the state law and the institution's policies. Consent Generally, only persons over the age of majority (18 years of age) can legally provide consent for health care. Since children are minors, the process of consent involves obtaining written permission from a parent or legal guardian. In cases requiring a signature for consent, usually the parent gives consent for care for children younger than 18 years of age except in certain situations (see below). Take Note! Never assume that the adult accompanying the child is the parent or legal guardian. Always clarify the relationship of the accompanying adult. INFORMED CONSENT Most care given in a health care setting is covered by the initial consent for treatment signed when the child becomes a patient at that office or clinic or by the consent to treatment signed upon admission to the hospital or other inpatient facility. Certain procedures, however, require a specific process of informed consent . Procedures that require informed consent include major and minor surgery; invasive procedures such as lumbar puncture or bone marrow aspiration; treatments placing the child at higher risk, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy; procedures or treatments involving research; application of restraints; and photography involving children. The informed consent process, which must be done before the procedure or specific care, addresses the legal and ethical requirement of informing the child and parent about the procedure. It originates from the right of the child and family to direct their care and the ethical responsibility of physicians to involve the child and family in health care decisions. Nurses should involve children and adolescents in the decision-making process to the extent possible, though the parent is still ultimately responsible for giving consent. The physician or advanced practitioner providing or performing the treatment and/or procedure is responsible for informing the child and family about the procedure and obtaining consent by providing a detailed description of the procedure or treatment, the potential risks and benefits, and alternative methods available. The nurse's responsibility related to informed consent includes the following: Determining that the parents or legal guardians understand what they are signing by asking them pertinent questions Ensuring that the consent form is completed with signatures from the parents or legal guardians Serving as a witness to the signature process Box 1.1 describes the key elements of informed consent, although laws vary from state to state. Nurses must become familiar with state laws as well as the policies and procedures of the health care agency. Treating children without obtaining proper informed consent may result in charges of assault, battery, or negligence, and the physician and/or facility may be held liable for any damages (American Medical Association [AMA], n.d.). BOX 1.1 KEY ELEMENTS OF INFORMED CONSENT The decision maker must be of legal age in that state, with full civil rights, and be competent (have the ability to make the decision). Present information that is simple, concise, and appropriate to the level of education and language of the individual responsible for making the decision. The decision must be voluntary, without coercion, force, or influence of duress. Have a witness to the process of informed consent. Have the witness sign the consent form. SPECIAL SITUATIONS TO INFORMED CONSENT There are special situations related to informed consent. If the parent is not available, then the person in charge (relative, babysitter, orteacher) may give consent for emergency treatment if that person has a signed form from the parent or legal guardian allowing him or her to do so. During an emergency situation, a verbal consent via the telephone may be obtained. Two witnesses must be listening simultaneously and will sign the consent form, indicating that consent was received via telephone. Physicians can provide emergency treatment to a child without consent if they have made reasonable attempts to contact the child's parent or legal guardian (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007c). In urgent or emergent situations, appropriate medical care never should be delayed or withheld due to an inability to obtain consent (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007c). Certain federal laws, such as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), require that every child who presents at an emergency department is given a medical examination regardless of informed consent or reimbursement ability (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007c). Table 1.3 gives further information about other special situations. EXCEPTIONS TO PARENTAL CONSENT REQUIREMENT In some states, a mature minor may give consent to certain medical treatment. The physician must determine that the adolescent (usually older than 14 years of age) is sufficiently mature and intelligent to make the decision for treatment. The provider also considers the complexity of the treatment, its risks and benefits, and whether the treatment is necessary or elective before obtaining consent from a mature minor (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007c). State laws vary in relation to the definition of an emancipated minor and the types of treatment that may be obtained by an emancipated minor (without parental consent). The nurse must be familiar with the particular state's law. Emancipation may be considered in any of the following situations, depending on the state's laws: Membership in a branch of the armed services Marriage Court-determined emancipation Financial independence and living apart from parents College attendance Pregnancy Mother younger than 18 years of age Runaway The emancipated minor is considered to have the legal capacity of an adult and may make his or her own health care decisions (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007c). Many states do not require consent or notification of parents or legal guardians when providing specific care to minors. Dependingon the state law, health care may be provided to minors for certain conditions, in a confidential manner, without including the parents. These types of care may include pregnancy counseling, prenatal care, contraception, testing for and treatment of sexually transmitted infections and communicable diseases (including HIV), substance abuse and mental illness counseling and treatment, or health care required as a result of a crime-related injury (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007c). These exceptions allow children to seek help in a confidential manner; they might otherwise avoid care if they were required to inform their parents or legal guardian. Again, laws vary by state, so the nurse must be knowledgeable about the laws in the state where he or she is licensed to practice. PARENTAL REFUSAL OF MEDICAL TREATMENT Parental autonomy (the right to decide for or against medical treatment) is a fundamental, constitutionally protected right but not an absolute one. The general assumption is that parents act in the best interest of their children. Ideally, medical care without informed consent should be given only when the child's life is in danger. In some cases parents may refuse medical treatment for their child. This refusal may arise when treatment conflicts with their religious or cultural beliefs, and the nurse should be aware of some of these common beliefs. Some religions, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, Christian Science, Pentecostal, Faith Assembly, and Evangelical Healers, prefer prayer or faith healing over allopathic medicine (Linnard-Palmer & Kools, 2004). Jehovah's Witnesses refuse blood product administration based on their religious beliefs. The Black Muslim culture advocates vegan diets and refuses pork-based medicines or treatments. Hindus may refuse beef-based foods and medicines. Persons from an Islamic background may refuse the use of any potentially addictive substances such as narcotics or medicines containing alcohol (Linnard-Palmer & Kools, 2004). Sometimes common ground may be reached between the family's religious or cultural beliefs and the health care team's recommendations; communication and education are the keys in this situation. In other cases, parents may refuse treatment if they perceive that their child's quality of life may be significantly impaired by the medical care that is offered. The health care team must appropriately educate the family and communicate with them on a level that they can understand. The child and family should be informed of what to expect with certain tests or treatments. The health care team should make a clinical assessment of the child's and family's understanding of the situation and their reasons for refusing treatment. Active listening may allow the physician to address the concerns, fears, or reservations the family may have regarding their child's care. Refusal of medical care may be considered a form of child neglect. If providing medical treatment may prevent substantial harm or suffering or save a child's life, physicians and the judicial system strive to advocate for the child. The state has an overriding interest in the health and welfare of the child and can order that medical treatment proceed without signed informed consent; this is referred to as parens patriae (the state has a right and a duty to protect children). If the parents refuse treatment and the health care team feels the treatment is reasonable and warranted, the case should be referred to the institution's ethics committee. If the issue remains unresolved or in complex cases, the judicial system may become involved (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007a). Assent Assent means agreeing to something. In pediatric health care, the term assent refers to the child's participation in the decision-making process about health care (McCullough & Stein, 2009). The age of assent depends on the child's developmental level, maturity, and psychological state. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children and adolescents be involved in the discussions about their health care and kept informed in an age-appropriate manner (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007a). Federal guidelines do not suggest a specific age when assent should be obtained, but the American Academy of Pediatrics proposes that a child with an intellectual age of 7 years or older is competent to understand participation in research and therefore provide assent (Knox & Burkhart, 2007). As a child gets older assent or dissent should be given more serious consideration. The pediatric patient needs to be empowered by physicians to the extent of their capabilities, and as children mature and develop over time they should become the primary decision maker regarding their health care (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007a). The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that if a physician asks the child's opinion about the direction of treatment or participation in research, then the child's view and desires should be seriously considered (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007a). When obtaining assent, first help the child to understand his or her health condition, depending on the child's developmental level. Next, inform the child of the treatment planned and discuss what he or she should expect. Then determine what the child understands about the situation and make sure he or she is not being unduly influenced to make a decision one way or another. Lastly, ascertain the child's willingness to participate in the treatment or research (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007a; McCullough & Stein, 2009). Assent is a process and should continue throughout the course of treatment or research protocol. The converse of assent, dissent (disagreeing with the treatment plan), when given by an adolescent 13 to 17 years of age, is considered binding in some states. If the physician is not going to honor the child's dissent, the argument can be made that he or she should not ask for the child's assent. In some cases, such as cases of significant morbidity or mortality, dissent may need to beoverridden. These cases need to be looked at on an individual basis. If the decision is made to move forward with treatment despite the child's dissent, then this decision must be explained to the child in developmentally appropriate terms. Since the late 1990s there has been an increased emphasis on including children in research studies (Society of Pediatric Nurses, 2007). In research studies investigators and investigation review boards (IRBs) are responsible for ensuring measures are taken to protect the children in the studies. The nurse caring for these children also has the responsibility to ensure protection at all stages of the research process. Nurses can become members of the IRB as well as becoming familiar with studies that have been approved in their work setting to help ensure their pediatric patients are protected. Take Note! Whenever possible assent for participation should be obtained from the child. Advance Directives The Patient Self-Determination Act of 1990 established the concept of advance directives. Advance directives determine the child's and family's wishes should life-sustaining care become necessary. Parents are generally the surrogate decision makers for children. If the child's interests are not served by prolonged survival, then the physician or advanced practitioner should educate the parents about the extent of the child's illness and potential for ongoing quality of life (Fost, 2006). After discussion with other family members, friends, and spiritual advisors, the parents may make the decision to forego life-sustaining medical treatment, either withdrawing treatment or deciding to withhold certain further treatment or opt not to resuscitate in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2004). Life-sustaining care may include antibiotics, chemotherapy, dialysis, ventilation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and artificial nutrition and hydration. Some families may choose to withdraw these treatments if they are already in place or not begin them should the need arise. \"Do not resuscitate (DNR)\" orders are in place for some children, particularly the terminally ill. Some institutions have started using the term AND (\"Allow Natural Death\"). No matter what term is used, these orders should include specific instructions regarding the child's and family's wishes (e.g., some families may desire oxygen but not chest compressions or code medications). When the child is hospitalized, the DNR order must be documented in the physician orders and updated according to the facility's policy. DNR orders may also be in place in the home, but only a few states allow emergency medical services to honor a child's DNR order in the home. Children with DNR orders may also still be attending school. In that case, the health care professionals involved should meet with the school officials (the board of education and its legal counsel) to discuss how the DNR request can be upheld in the school setting (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2000). The Baby Doe regulations, which are an amendment to the US Child Abuse Protection and Treatment Act, provide specific guidelines on how to treat extremely ill, premature, terminally ill, and/or disabled infants regardless of the parents' wishes (Kopelman, 2005). These cases encompass complex ethical issues and continue to be surrounded by legal uncertainty. Therefore, physicians must continue to work with parents of extremely sick or premature infants to ensure they are accurately informed about the condition of their child and the risks and benefits to treatment. Physicians must also be aware of federal, state, and hospital policy regarding care of very ill, premature, and/or disabled newborns. The nurse must be knowledgeable about the laws related to health care of children in the state where he or she practices as well as the policies of the health care institution. The nurse must be sensitive to the various ethical situations that he or she may become involved in and should apply knowledge of laws as well as concepts of ethics to provide appropriate care. Confidentiality Issues in Caring for Children With the establishment of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), confidentiality of health care information is now required. The primary intent of the law was to maintain health insurance coverage for workers and their families when they change or lose jobs. Another aspect of the law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to establish national standards for electronic transactions for health information on individuals. Due to the increased use of electronic medical records and electronic billing, there was an increased possibility that personal health information might be inappropriately distributed. Patient confidentiality and privacy must be maintained as it is with paper documentation. Nurses can ensure that privacy is maintained when using computerized documentation and an electronic medical record (EMR) by doing the following: Always maintain the security of your personal log-in information; never share it with other nurses or other persons. Always log off when leaving the computer. Do not leave patient information visible on a monitor screen when the computer/monitor is unattended. Use safeguards, such as encryption, when using alternative means of communication, such as e-mail.HIPAA also addresses security and privacy issues involving health information about individuals. In 2002 the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, known as the privacy rule, was finalized (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2003). The goal of this regulation was to properly protect personal health information while allowing for the flow of health information needed to provide and promote highquality care (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2003). As long as reasonable precautions have been taken to protect the child's privacy, the privacy rule allows certain disclosures that assist in patient care. For example, full names may be placed outside of a child's room in order to ensure that the correct care is given to the correct child (Anderson, 2007). Also, placing medical records in bins outside of examination rooms, as long as identifying information is turned toward the wall, is also permitted (Anderson, 2007). State privacy laws and professional practice standards also exist to protect personal health information, and care providers must follow whichever guidelines are more stringent. In the pediatric area, information is shared only with the legal parents or guardians or individuals as established in writing by the parents. This law, along with professional obligation, promotes the security and privacy of children's health information. Exceptions to Confidential Treatment in Children There are exceptions to confidential treatment in children. For example, all states require reporting of suspicion of physical or sexual child abuse and injuries caused by a weapon or criminal act. Abuse cases are reported to the child welfare authorities, criminal acts to the police. If the minor is a threat to himself or herself, information may need to be disclosed to protect the child. The physician must also follow public health laws that require reporting certain infectious diseases to the local health department (e.g., tuberculosis, hepatitis, HIV, and other sexually transmitted infections). Finally, there is a duty to warn third parties when a specific threat is made to an identifiable person. Physicians must strike a balance between confidentiality and required disclosure. Even if disclosure is required, it is recommended that the physician attempt to gain consent for the disclosure and when possible inform the minor of the limits to confidentiality and consent prior to the initiation of care (Neinstein, Gordon, Katzman, Rosen, & Woods, 2007). In the beginning of the chapter you were introduced to the Romano family. How can you empower this family to help them provide the best care to Isabelle? What ethical and legal issues may arise? KEY CONCEPTS In the past, health was defined simply as the absence of disease; health was measured by monitoring the mortality and morbidity of a group. Over the past century, however, the focus of health has shifted to disease prevention, health promotion, and wellness. The World Health Organization (2011) defines health as \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" In past centuries in the United States, the health of the country was poorer than it is today; mortality rates were high and life expectancy was short. Over the years the health of children received more and more attention, leading to a better understanding of sources of illness and improvements in sanitation, water, and nutrition. This led to, by the end of the 20th century, unintentional injuries as opposed to disease becoming the leading cause of death for children older than 1 year (Richter, 2004). In the 21st century unintentional injuries continue to be the leading cause of death in children older than 1 year, but health problems such as obesity, environmental toxins, allergies, drug abuse, child abuse and neglect, and mental health problems endanger children's health today (CDC/National Center for Health Statistics, 2010). Healthy People 2020 provides a comprehensive health promotion and disease prevention agenda that emphasizes children's health. Overarching goals are to eliminate preventable disease, disability, injury, and premature death; achieve health equity, eliminate disparities, and improve the health of all groups; create physical and social environments that promote good health; and promote healthy development and behaviors across every stage of life (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010a). One method to establish the aggregate health status of infants, children, and adolescents is by using statistics such as mortality and morbidity rates. The infant mortality rate is low in the United States, but it is still higher than in other industrialized countries. This high rate may be the result of the number of preterm and low-birthweight infants born in this country. The three general concepts that form the philosophy of pediatric nursing care are family-centered care, atraumatic care, and evidence-based care. Pediatric nurses use these three concepts to provide quality, cost-effective care that is continuous, comprehensive, and compassionate. The primary role of the pediatric nurse is to provide direct nursing care to children and their families, being an advocate , educator, and manager. The pediatric nurse also serves as a collaborator, care coordinator, and consultant. A standard of care is a minimally accepted action expected of an individual of a certain skill or knowledge level and reflects what a reasonable and prudent person would do in a similar situation. Professional standards from regulatory agencies, state or federal laws, nurse practice acts, and other specialty groups regulate nursing practice in general. The nursing process, a problem-solving method based on the scientific method, is used to care for the child and family during health promotion, maintenance, restoration, and rehabilitation. The nursing process is applicable to all health care settings and consists of five steps: assessment, nursing diagnosis, outcome identification and planning, implementation, and outcome evaluation. Ethical nursing care includes the basic principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, justice, veracity, and fidelity. Advances in science and technology have led to ethical dilemmas in health care; when parents refuse treatment or the child's desires conflict with the parents' decision, an ethical dilemma results. Children are entitled to a health care bill of rights just as adults are. Minor children (younger than age 18 years) must have their parents or legal guardians provide consent for health care in most cases. Nurses must be knowledgeable about the laws related to health care of children in the state where they practice as well as the policies of their health care institution. Informed consent is required for major and minor surgery; invasive procedures such as lumbar puncture or bone marrow aspiration; treatments placing the child at higher risk, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy; procedures or treatments involving research; application of restraints; and photography involving children. The nurse's responsibility related to informed consent includes determining that the parents or legal guardians understand what they are signing by asking them pertinent questions, ensuring that the consent form is completed with signatures from the parents or legal guardians, and serving as a witness to the signature process. In certain states, mature minors and emancipated minors may consent to their own health care. Depending on state law, certain health care may be provided to adolescents without parental notification, including pregnancy counseling, prenatal care, contraception, testing for and treatment of sexually transmitted infections and communicable diseases (including HIV), substance abuse and mental illness counseling and treatment, or health care required as a result of a crime-related injury.

Miguel Delgado is a 10-month-old boy who is admitted to the pediatric unit for treatment of pneumonia. He is accompanied by his parents and 3-year-old sister, Luisa. Miguel's parents speak Spanish and very little English. The family is Roman Catholic. As the nurse admitting Miguel, how will you facilitate communication? What steps can you take to help ensure ongoing communication with this family despite the language barrier? When they come into the world, children are members of a family and have already been influenced by myriad factors such as genetics and the environment. As members of a family, they are also members of a specific population, culture, community, and society. Children live, learn, and grow in an environment affected by ever-changing cultural, spiritual, community, and social factors. For example, changes in population demographics in the United States have led to shifts in minority population groups. It is projected that over the next four decades the United States will experience a dramatic increase in racial and ethnic diversity (Ortman & Guarneri, 2009). The Hispanic population is expected to double, the Asian population is expected to increase by 79%, and all other racial groups will see an increase with the exception of non-Hispanic whites, who are expected to decline (Ortman & Guarneri, 2009). Globalization has led to an international focus on the health of children. In addition, access to health care, and the types of health care available for children, has changed due to modifications in health care delivery and financing. Furthermore, the United States continues to grapple with issues such as violence, immigration, poverty, and homelessness. The interplay of all of these factors creates a situation unique to each child. These factors may affect the child positively, promoting healthy growth and development, or negatively, exposing the child to health risks. Nursing care for children and their families involves astute assessment of all of the factors that may affect the health of children. Nurses play a key role in determining the impact of these factors on children and their families. Pediatric nurses need a sound knowledge base about the individual child, including genetics, race and temperament, and overall health status and lifestyle. Family, including the different structures, roles, and functions found in today's society, is also an important component to child health. Knowledge of special situations such as single-parent or adopted families is important to provide individualized care. The nurse should also assess the family's level of stress based on the demands they face and their ability to meet those demands. Do they have the coping behaviors, patterns, and strategies needed to have a positive impact on the child's health? Other assessments need to focus on culture, ethnicity, and spirituality and the child's community and society, including social roles and socioeconomic status (e.g., poverty and homelessness). Information gathered from these assessments can help the nurse refer the family to community resources that may assist them with stability and health needs. Resources such as state and federal agencies and community agencies such as the United Way or Salvation Army may be of assistance to families. Nurses work with children and their families in a variety of settings and need to be alert to subtle yet important indicators that may suggest a problem. For example, the child or family may give an inaccurate address or may give as their address a homeless shelter. Parents or children may be embarrassed or ashamed, feeling the stigma of poverty or homelessness. Other clues to problems may include a history of repeated infectious diseases, multiple health problems, or complaints that the child is always hungry. The key is to link children and their families with community resources that will assist with financial stability and with meeting the health needs of the children. Due to changing demographics, immigration, and the global nature of society, nurses must make sure that the care they provide is culturally sensitive. Nursing interventions need to incorporate the family's unique values, beliefs, and actions to ensure that their needs are met. To gain the knowledge and skills needed to plan effective care for children, pediatric nurses need to understand how all these factors affect the quality of nursing care and children's health outcomes. By doing so, nurses can create appropriate strategies andplan interventions for achieving the best possible outcomes for children and their families.GENETIC INFLUENCE ON CHILD HEALTH Genetics , the study of heredity and its variations, is a field that has applications to all stages of life and all types of diseases. Heredity is the process of transmitting genetic characteristics from parent to offspring. The child's gender and race; the child's biological traits, including some behavioral traits or aspects of temperament; and certain diseases or illnesses are directly linked to genetic inheritance. Gender A child's gender is established when the sex chromosomes join. A child's gender can influence many key aspects, such as physical characteristics and personal attributes. In addition to the development of male or female genitalia, body development, and hair distribution, some diseases or illnesses can be gender related: for example, scoliosis is more prevalent in females and color blindness is more common in males. An early influence of gender in children involves the survival rate of premature infants: premature girls have a higher survival rate than premature boys (Lee et al., 2010). In addition to the specific biological and physical traits related to gender, there are also social effects. The child develops specific gender attitudes and behaviors that are appropriate in his or her culture. Interactions with family members and peers as well as activities and societal values affect how children perceive themselves as a specific gender ( Fig. 2.1 ). If confusion develops with this process, various psychological and social difficulties can arise for the child (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2010). FIGURE 2.1 The young child learns to identify with the parent of the same sex. Race Race indicates membership in a particular group of humans who have biological traits that are transmitted by descent; they may share physical features such as skin color, bone structure, or blood type. Some of the physical variations may be normal in a particular race but may be considered an identifying characteristic of a disorder in other races. For example, epicanthal folds (the vertical folds of skin that partially or completely cover the inner canthi of the eye) are normal in Asian children but may occur with Down syndrome or renal agenesis in other races. In addition, specific malformations and diseases are found in specific races. For example, sickle cell anemia occurs more often in African Americans. Temperament Temperament is the manner in which a child interacts with the environment. The way a child experiences a particular event will be influenced by his or her temperament, and the child's temperament will influence the responses of others, including the parents, to the child. Early on, infants demonstrate differences in their behavior in response to stimuli. These responses are an integral part of the infant's developing personality and individuality. Although a child's temperament is intrinsic and relatively resistant to change, it does stabilize as the child matures (Feigelman, 2007). Knowing a child's temperament can help parents understand and accept thecharacteristics of the child without feeling responsible for having caused them. The classic temperament theory proposes nine parameters of temperament: activity level, rhythmicity, approach and withdrawal, adaptability, threshold of responsiveness, intensity of reaction, quality of mood, distractibility, and attention span and persistence (Feigelman, 2007). This theory seeks to identify behavioral characteristics that lead the child to respond to the world in specific ways. Using the nine parameters, children's temperaments may be categorized into three major groups: easy, difficult, and slow to warm up; various temperaments exist that are a combination of these groups (Feigelman, 2007). Easy children are even-tempered and have regular biological functions, predictable behavior, and a positive attitude toward new experiences. Difficult children are irritable, highly active, and intense; they react to new experiences by withdrawing and are frustrated easily. Children in the slow-to-warm-up category are moody and less active and have more irregular reactions; they react to new experiences with mild but passive resistance and need extra time to adjust to new situations. A child's temperament may cause problems in the family if it conflicts with that of the parents (e.g., a difficult 2-year-old with slow- to-warm-up parents). If parents want and expect their child to be predictable but that is not the child's style, parents may perceive the child to have problems; this conflict may then affect the child's health. The key is not to label the child but to recognize the strengths and limitations of each group. Knowing a child's temperament can help parents understand a child's characteristics and behaviors and allow parents to adjust their parenting style. Genetically Linked Diseases New technologies in molecular biology and biochemistry have led to better understanding of the mechanisms involved in hereditary transmission, including those associated with genetic disorders. These advances are now leading to better diagnostic tests and management options. Two major areas of study in genetics that are important to pediatrics are cytogenetics and the Human Genome Project. Cytogenetics is the study of genetics at the chromosome level. Chromosomal anomalies occur in 0.4% of all live births and are the most prevalent cause of cognitive impairment and congenital anomalies or birth defects (Elias, Tsai, & Manchester, 2007); anomalies are even more common among spontaneous abortions and stillbirths. The Human Genome Project is an international research effort involving the localization, isolation, and characterization of human genes and investigation of the function of the gene products and their interaction with one another. This research project will provide information about genetic diseases to aid in developing new ways to identify, treat, cure, or even prevent them. Chapter 29 offers a more detailed discussion of genetics.HEALTH STATUS AND LIFESTYLE Obviously, the general health status of a child and specific lifestyles can influence a child's health. Health status may be a factor soon after birth. For example, the incidence of multiple births has been increasing in this country due to the increased use of in vitro fertilization and other assisted reproductive technologies along with women delaying childbearing until they are older (Ben-Joseph, 2007). Potential complications of multiple births include prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation, which may lead to chronic health problems in the child. Children with chronic health conditions may also have developmental delays, especially in acquiring skills related to cognition, communication, adaptation, social functioning, and motor functioning. Thus, the beginning health status of a child may affect his or her long-term health and development. Development and Disease Distribution The way a child develops is the result of genetics and the environment within the context of a variety of biopsychosocial forces. The biological influences include genetics, in utero exposure to teratogens, postpartum illnesses, exposure to hazardous substances, and maturation. Chapters 3 through 7 discuss the forces affecting growth and development for each age group. Developmental level has a major impact on the health status of children. In general, the distribution of diseases varies with age. For example, certain communicable diseases are more commonly associated with certain age groups. Roseola, which is a viral illness resulting in high fevers and rash, is most often seen in infants 6 to 15 months old, whereas scarlet fever, which is an infection from group A streptococci, is a disease that primarily affects children from 4 to 8 years old. The physiologic immaturity of an infant's body systems increases the risk for infection. Ingestion of toxic substances and risk of poisoning are major health concerns for toddlers as they become more mobile and inquisitive. Because preschool- and school-age children are, generally, very active, they are more prone to injury and accidents. Adolescents are establishing their identity, which may lead them to separate from the family values and traditions for a period of time and attempt to conform to their peers. This journey may lead to risk-taking behaviors, resulting in injuries or other situations that may impair their health. Nutrition Adequate nutrition can provide a rich environment for the developing child; conversely, nutritional deprivation can seriously interfere with brain development and other functions. Nutritional requirements change over the child's life and have a great influence on the child's physical growth and intellectual development. Nutrition provides the essentials required to maintain health and prevent illness ( Fig. 2.2 ). Chapters 3 through 7 discuss the specific nutritional requirements and the impact of deficiencies for each developmental stage.FIGURE 2.2 The dietary habits established early in life can have a long-lasting impact on the health of the child and the quality of life. Nutritional deficiencies, such as iron deficiency anemia, or excesses, such as the increasing incidence of childhood obesity, are still common problems in the United States. Some factors contributing to poor nutrition include inadequate food intake, nutritionally unsound social and cultural food practices, the easy accessibility of processed and nutritionally inadequate foods, lack of nutrition education in homes and schools, and the presence of illness that interferes with ingestion, digestion, and absorption of food. In a growing child, inadequate nutrition is associated with lower cognitive ability, poor emotional and mental health, increased susceptibility to childhood illnesses, increased risk for mortality, and stunted physical growth (Heird, 2007). \"Fast food\" or \"junk food\" diets are one cause of childhood obesity and are linked to the recent increases in the number of cases of childhood type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle Choices Lifestyle choices that can affect a child's health include patterns of eating; exercise; use of tobacco, drugs, or alcohol; and methods of coping with stress. For children, the lifestyle of the parents basically is the lifestyle of the child. Inactive parents who eat poorly commonly have children with the same habits, which can result in diabetes, obesity, and early heart disease. These typically adult problems are being diagnosed more frequently in children and adolescents today. Parents should first self-evaluate their own dietary and activity habits, make changes where necessary, and then strive to encourage healthy eating habits and an appropriate level of physical activity in the child's life through sports, hobbies such as dancing, or family activities. Environmental Exposure Environmental exposures can have a detrimental impact on the child. In utero, the child can be affected by poor maternal nutrition or by exposure to the mother's use of alcohol, tobacco, or drugs or infections. It is important for pregnant women to be aware of the risks associated with certain drugs, chemicals, and dietary agents as well as maternal illnesses that may lead to problems for the child. These agents, known as teratogens, may be linked to birth defects in children. Not all drugs or agents are associated with fetal effects, however, and research is ongoing to identify the correlations between teratogens and other variables. The environment continues to affect a child's health after birth. Exposure to air pollution, tobacco, and water or food contaminantscan impair a child's health status. Safety hazards in the home or community can contribute to falls, burns, drowning, or other accidents. Exposure to secondhand smoke and other pollutants, such as from radiation or chemicals, is a health hazard for children. Because children are smaller and still developing, environmental exposures can cause more health problems for them. For example, lead exposure is a common preventable poisoning in children, especially children younger than 6 years of age. Due to young children's rapidly developing nervous systems, they are more sensitive to the effects of lead. Sources include lead paint, lead-contaminated dust, and lead contained in soil and water. Lead exposure can result in developmental and behavioral problems ranging from inattentiveness and hyperactivity to permanent brain damage and death, depending on level of exposure. Take Note! A recent study found that residual tobacco smoke and carcinogens remain after a cigarette is extinguished (referred to as third-hand smoke). These toxins cling to the smoker's hair and clothes and can be present on any surface in the house, such as carpet and cushions. Children are particularly susceptible to third-hand smoke since they breathe near, crawl, touch, and mouth contaminated surfaces (Winickoff et al., 2009). Stress and Coping Children are exposed to various situations and events that can produce stress. These events can be associated with the normal problems associated with growth and development, such as entering a new classroom, learning a new skill, or being teased by a classmate. However, they can also be associated with problems such as poverty, divorce, violence, illness, or trauma. Some children can adapt and respond to the stress, while others cannot. The term resilience refers to the qualities that enable an individual to cope with significant adverse events or stresses and still function competently (Lietz, 2007). Various internal and external protective factors promote resiliency. Internal factors include the person's ability to take control and be proactive, to be responsible for his or her own decisions, to understand and accept his or her own limits and abilities, and to be goal directed, knowing when to continue or when to stop. External factors include caring relationships with a family member; a positive, safe learning environment at school (including clubs and social organizations); and positive influences in the community (see the discussion later in this chapter about protective factors and violence). Promoting the development of resiliency in children aids in the achievement of positive developmental outcomes (Yates & Masten, 2004). Access to Health Care The health care system, including the delivery and financing of this system, continues to change and evolve. In the United States, changes in the health care system result from pressures from many directions. These changes reflect shifts in the social and economic realities and results of biomedical and technological progress over the past several decades. The effects are felt by everyone who seeks health care in any form. The method of providing medical care in a high-tech environment has changed to providing health care within a limited-resource environment. Allocating the limited health care resources continues to be the theme. Access to health care is affected negatively by lack of health insurance. Parents with uninsured children often delay care for their children, are less likely to take their children to a doctor or dentist in the last 2 years, and are five times less likely to have a usual place of care for their children (Kaiser Commission on Key Facts, 2007). The percentage of children without health insurance dropped slightly from 11.7% in 2006 to 11% in 2007 (Sherman, Greenstein, & Parrott, 2008). This decrease is attributed to states' ability to improve enrollment in Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (Sherman et al., 2008). Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that provides health insurance to low-income children and their parents. It is state administered and each state has its own set of guidelines. In 1997 the US Congress passed legislation that led to the creation of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) (now known as the Children's Health Insurance Program [CHIP]). The purpose of this program is to help insure low-income children who are ineligible for Medicaid but cannot afford private health insurance. This program is also funded jointly by the federal and state governments, but administered by the individual states. With the development of such public health insurance programs for children, the number of uninsured children declined by one third between 1997 and 2005 (Kaiser Commission on Key Facts, 2007). In 2007, 60.7% of children were insured by private or employer-based health insurance and 28.2% with Medicaid or SCHIP. Of the 11% of uninsured children, 44.8% were eligible for Medicaid, 23.6% were eligible for SCHIP, and 31.6% were not eligible for either primarily due to family income exceeding the programs' eligibility levels (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2008). In recent years Medicaid and SCHIP have focused on increasing enrollment by increasing outreach, simplifying enrollment procedures, and retaining eligible enrollees (Kaiser Commission on Key Facts, 2007). Despite these efforts, three quarters of children uninsured are eligible for these public programs (Kaiser Commission on Key Facts, 2007). Lack of awareness, difficulty accessing the programs, uncertainty of how to apply for the programs, discomfort relatedto receiving governmental assistance, and fear of jeopardizing the family's immigration status continue to be factors in failure to enroll children in these programs. Research has shown that enrollment of the children is facilitated when the entire family can obtain coverage (Kaiser Commission on Key Facts, 2007). Unfortunately, in most states, family enrollment is hampered because eligibility levels for parents are much lower than for children (Kaiser Commission on Key Facts, 2007). Also, as of 2006, many states, predominantly in the SCHIP program, began charging premiums, copayments, or enrollment fees, making coverage less affordable for eligible children (Kaiser Commission on Key Facts, 2007). Recent fiscal concerns due to the economic downturn have led many states to limit enrollment in these programs. These programs rely on adequate state and federal funding. Therefore, the continued success of these programs depends on future legislation. Tough economic times along with decreases in employer-based health insurance will continue to challenge the nation to ensure adequate health care for all children. Barriers to Health Care Even with the federal and state programs available to assist children and families, barriers to appropriate, cost-effective, coordinated, and timely health care remain. Barriers can be financial, sociocultural, or ethnic, or part of the health care system itself. Financial Barriers After a decade of decline, the percentage of children living in low-income families has been on the rise since 2000. In 2009, 42% of children were living in low-income families and 21% were living in poor families (Chau, Thumpi, & Wright, 2010). Many children and families do not have insurance, do not have enough insurance to cover services obtained, or cannot pay for services. Nurses need to assess for financial barriers to health care and be aware of resources available to help these families overcome these barriers. Ethnic and Sociocultural Barriers Ethnic and sociocultural factors also pose barriers. For example, white, non-Hispanic children overall are more likely than African American and Hispanic children to be in very good or excellent health (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010). The proportion of children who are overweight is increasing, but the largest increase is occurring in African American and Mexican American children (ChildStats.gov Forum on Child and Family Statistics, 2010). This is just one example of the problems that different ethnic groups face in relation to health. Lack of transportation and the need for both parents to work also pose barriers to seeking health care. Knowledge barriers (e.g., lack of understanding of the importance of prenatal care or preventive health care), language barriers (e.g., speaking a different language than the physician), and spiritual barriers (e.g., religious beliefs discouraging some forms of treatment) also exist. Health Care Delivery System Barriers The health care delivery system itself can create barriers, such as the cost containment movement. The majority of employed families with insurance are covered by some type of managed health care plan such as a health maintenance organization (HMO), a preferred provider organization (PPO), or a point-of-service (POS) plan. This prospective payment system, based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), limits the amounts of health care the family may receive. This also includes Medicaid reimbursement. As a result, the trend is to discharge children as soon as possible and deliver care in the home or through community-based services. The overall plan may improve access to preventive services but may limit the access to specialty care, which has a major impact on children with chronic or long-term illnesses.FAMILY THEORY The family is considered the basic social unit. The U.S. Census Bureau (2010) defines a family as a group of two or more persons related by birth, marriage, or adoption and living together. Traditional definitions of family emphasize the legal ties or genetic relationships of people living in the same household with specific roles. Given the diversity of families in today's society, however, some believe that family should be defined as whatever the child says it is (Patterson, 1995) ( Fig. 2.3 ). FIGURE 2.3 Nurses must recognize family dynamics when providing health care to children. There are many different family structures, and they influence child needs. A . The traditional nuclear family is composed of two parents and their biological or adopted children. B . The extended family includes the nuclear family plus other family members, such as grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. C . Gay and lesbian families are composed of two people of the same sex sharing a committed relationship, with or without children. The family into which a child is born greatly influences his or her development and health. Children learn health care activities, health beliefs, and health values from their family. The family's structure, the roles assumed by members, and societal changes that affect the family's life can affect the child and his or her health. Children and families are unique: each has different views and requires different methods for support. Various theories and models have been generated to define a family, to understand its structure and function, and to assess a family's coping and adaptation ( Table 2.1 ). Family Structure Family structure is the way that the family is organized and the way that the family members interact with one another on a regular, recurring basis in socially sanctioned ways. Family members can be gained or lost through divorce, marriage, birth, death, abandonment, and incarceration. With these events, the family structure changes and roles are redefined or redistributed. The traditional nuclear family is no longer considered the dominant family structure. From 1970 to 2008, the percentage of children who were living with their own married parents decreased steadily from 68.7% to 61% (up slightly from 60.5% in 2000) (Institute for American Values and National Center on African American Marriage and Parenting, 2009). Table 2.2 lists some of the family structures found in today's society. Nurses working with children need to understand the child's family structure and any changes that are occurring in it so they can help the family to cope. Special Family SituationsFamilies face complex challenges as they try to nurture, develop, and socialize their children. When the family structure changes, the effects on children can be lifelong. These special situations require astute assessment and proactive intervention to minimize the risk to the child and family. Divorced Family Divorce is a common reason why the family structure changes. Today, 40% of marriages end in divorce and many of these marriages include children (Serwint, 2007). Divorce can have a great impact on the child, with chronic and devastating results. Typically, divorce is not a single event: changes have most likely been occurring in the family for years, and children may have been exposed to turmoil, violence, or changes in structure before the actual divorce. Children feel scared and confused by the threat divorce poses on their security. The initial response of children to divorce depends on their age; problems are most apparent the year after the divorce and diminish over the next couple of years (Serwint, 2007). However, about one third of children are still troubled and distressed 5 years after the divorce of their parents; after 10 years, 41% may have social, emotional, and/or academic problems (Serwint, 2007). Parents need to understand the impact that divorce can have on their children so that they can place the children's interest in the forefront. The loss of a parent through divorce can leave children vulnerable to physical and mental illnesses (American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 2008b). However, by appropriately utilizing family strengths and providing care and attention, children can be helped to deal constructively with divorce (American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 2008b). Parents can use the rules in Box 2.1 to help reduce tension and conflict, thereby minimizing the impact of separation and divorce on their children. Physicians can offer support, guidance, and resources to help make the strain of divorce easier on the entire family. Single-Parent Families Single-parent families can result from divorce or separation, death of a spouse, an unmarried woman raising her own child, or adoption by an unmarried man or woman. The U.S. Census Bureau (2007) found that approximately 26% of children younger than age 18 live with one parent, with 23% living with the mother only and 3% living with the father only (Kreider, 2008). Single-parent families have several concerns that can affect the health of the children. Life in a single- parent household can bestressful for both the adult and for the children. The single parent may feel overwhelmed with no one to share the day-to-day responsibilities of juggling the care of the children, maintaining a job, and keeping up with the home and finances. These issues may be compounded by other pressures, such as custody problems, decreased time available to spend with children, continuing conflicts between parents who are separated or divorced, or changes in relationships with extended family members. BOX 2.1 10 RULES FOR DIVORCING PARENTS 1. Tell your children about the divorce and the reasons for the divorce in terms that they can understand. Be sure that you and your spouse are present together when telling the children; tell all the children at the same time. 2. Reassure your children that the divorce is not their fault. Repeat this as often as possible and as necessary. 3. Inform the children well in advance of anyone moving out of the house (except when abuse is present or there are concerns for immediate safety). 4. Clearly inform the children about the family structure after the divorce, such as who will live with whom and where; also discuss visitation clearly and honestly. 5. Do not make your children be or act like adults. 6. Do not discuss money or finances with your children. 7. Minimize unpredictable schedules and maintain routines, rules, and discipline, and be consistent in this area. 8. Never force or allow your children to take sides. 9. Avoid belittling your former spouse when the children can hear. However, do not lie to cover up for irresponsible behavior by the other parent. 10. Never put your children in the middle between you and your ex-spouse. Adapted from Bryner, C. L. (2001). Children of divorce. Journal of the American Board of Family Practice, 14 (3), 176-183.

Retrieved February 28, 2011, from http://kidshealth.org/parent/positive/talk/help_child_divorce.html Communication and support are essential to the optimal functioning of the single-parent family. The parent and children need to be able to express their feelings and work through the problems together. Single parents must provide greater support for their children. Even though single parents may feel alone, they need to ensure they treat their children as children and not a substitute for a partner. Support and comfort need to come from outside resources. Community resources can be helpful. Parents Without Partners, for instance, is an international organization that has over 200 chapters in the United States and Canada. It provides \"single parents and their children with an opportunity for enhancing personal growth, self-confidence and sensitivity towards others by offering an environment for support, friendship, and the exchange of parenting techniques\" (Parents Without Partners, n.d.). Blended Families Before the age of 18, one third of children in the United States are anticipated to live in a stepfamily (Jaffe, Segal, Hutman, & Barston, 2008). Creating a blended family (parents and their stepchildren), even though considered a form of \"normal\" these days, can be stressful for the parents and children alike. Although it creates a structure and stability and reduces some of the financial stresses of single parenthood, making the transition to a blended family takes time. Children may feel jealous of the stepparent or feel disloyal toward the previous biological parent. There may be competition or rivalry among the stepchildren. The child may fear that the stepparent is interfering with the child's relationship with the parent or taking away his or her source of love, affection, and attention. Mutual respect and open, honest communication among all individuals involved are key, and this should include the previous biological parent when possible. Responsibilities for parenting must be shared, including decisions about expectations, limits, and discipline. The continued role of the previous biological parent and the role of the stepparent in the child's life are important to address. Adopted Families Adoption can occur domestically (through an agency or intermediary such as an attorney in the family's own area or country), or the family may choose to adopt a child from another country. The child may be of a different culture, race, or ethnicity ( Fig. 2.4 ). Most children in need of adoption in the United States and overseas are not infants. In recent years there has been an increasing number of children adopted from the US child welfare systems and internationally (Simms & Freundlich, 2007a; Singer & Krebs, 2008). Also,there has been an increase in adoption by nontraditional families (single-parent families, blended families, families with gay or lesbian partners, and families with older parents) (Borchers et al., 2003). FIGURE 2.4 An adoptive family with children from a different culture. The amount of contact between the child and the birth mother can vary greatly. In a closed adoption there is no contact between the adoptive parents, the adopted child, and the birth mother. In an open adoption there is as much contact among the individuals as desired. Regardless of the method used to adopt a child, adoptive families may be faced with unique issues. Some adopted children have complex medical, developmental, behavioral, educational, and psychological issues (Borchers et al., 2003). They may have been exposed to poverty, neglect, infectious diseases, and lack of adequate food, clothing, shelter, and nurturing, placing them at risk for medical problems, physical growth and development delays or abnormalities, and behavioral, cognitive, and emotional problems. The adoptive parents may know about these problems, but in other situations little if any history may be available. Differences in culture, ethnicity, or race can further influence the adopted child's sense of identity (Borchers et al., 2003). Children may be subjected to racism or bigotry. Extended family members may not accept the child as part of the family. Parents need to emphasize that the adopted child is their child and is as much a part of the family as any other member. Adopted adolescents and adults may feel a need to identify their biological parents. Children adopted from other countries may travel to the country of their birth, and children adopted domestically may search for biological relatives. Although this search is an indicator of healthy emotional growth, it can upset the adoptive parents, who may feel rejected. As the adopted child grows older, he or she may feel the loss of a birth family or may question what he or she did that led to the birth parents' decision to proceed with adoption. Attachment to the adoptive family is important. In order to attach in future relationships, children must appropriately grieve past losses. This can be particularly complex and difficult for older children and children previously living in foster care or orphanages. Take Note! Adolescents face vast challenges adjusting to adoption at this age because of the added complexity of identity issues facing this age group (Singer & Krebs, 2008). Clear, open, honest communication and discussion are essential to promote a healthy, strong relationship. Support, guidance, and open communication are key for all parties involved. Open acknowledgement of the adoptive relationship helps to nurture a child's self-esteem as he or she learns to understand what it means to be part of a family through adoption (Borchers et al., 2003). The pediatric nurse needs to be sensitive, understanding, and supportive when interacting with adopted children and their families. \"Positive\" adoption language should be used. This includes saying \"birth parent\" when referring to biological parents instead of \"natural\" or \"real parent\" and just \"parents\" when talking about adoptive parents (Singer & Krebs, 2008). Also, do not refer to the child as their \"adopted child\" or other children as \"natural children\" (Singer & Krebs, 2008). When discussing adoption, using termssuch as \"make an adoption plan\" instead of \"give away\" or \"give up for adoption\" are preferred (Borchers et al., 2003). The nurse also needs to provide reassurance and understanding regarding missing health information and provide appropriate resources and referrals to resources that are knowledgeable about adoption and sensitive to the issues that may arise. Sources of information and support available are the Center for Adoption Support and Education at http://www.adoptionsupport.org/ and the North American Council on Adoptable Children at http://www.nacac.org/ . Foster Care Family Foster care is a situation in which a child is cared for in an alternative living situation apart from his or her parents or legal guardians. The child may be placed in this living situation because of difficulties in the family situation, such as abuse, neglect, abandonment, or the parents' inability to meet the child's needs due to illness, substance abuse, or death. The child may be sent to live with relatives (kinship care) or foster parents, who are strangers providing protection and shelter in a state-approved foster home. There are about 423,773 children in the United States currently living in some form of foster care (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children & Families, 2010). Through the 1990s use of foster care steadily rose but since then there has been a decline (Children's Defense Fund, 2010). The goal of foster care is to provide temporary services until the child can return home to his or her family or be adopted. Unfortunately, children may remain in foster care for several years or longer and may be moved from one foster family to another. Many children who are placed in foster care have been the victims of abuse or neglect. Children in foster care are more likely to exhibit a wide range of medical, emotional, behavioral, or developmental problems (Simms & Freundlich, 2007b). However, children are very resilient and most children in foster care are determined to live their lives, but they may struggle with certain issues, including: Unmet health care needs Significant mental health problems, such as depression, social problems, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder Behavioral problems such as substance use, problems with the law, and self-destructive behaviors Interruptions in developmental stages Educational obstacles due to frequent moves Self-blame and feelings of guilt Feelings of being unwanted Feelings of helplessness and powerlessness Insecurity about the future Ambivalent feelings related to foster parents; feelings of being disloyal to birth parents (American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 2005; American Academy of Pediatrics, 2000). Individual attention to the child in foster care is essential. A multidisciplinary approach to care that includes the birth parents, foster parents, child, health care professionals, and support services is important to meet the child's needs for growth and development. Nurses play a key role in advocating for the child. Family Roles and Functions The role of the family in caring for the child includes not only providing physical and emotional care but also imparting the rules and expected behaviors of society through teaching and discipline techniques. These expected behaviors depend on the culture, values, and beliefs of the family and the child's developmental stage and physical and cognitive abilities. Roles and functions are further defined by each family's own traditions and values and the family's set of standards for interaction within and outside the family. For instance, some families may value privacy more than others. These family members may tend to be more self-protective and secretive. Caregiver-Child Interaction The caregiver-child interaction is critical to the survival and healthy development of a young child (World Health Organization [WHO], 2004). Typically, the primary care-givers are the parents. Ideally, parents nurture their children and provide them with an environment in which they can become competent, productive, self-directed members of society. For young children in particular, growth, health, and their very personhood itself depend on the ability of the adults in their life to understand and respond to them (WHO, 2004). Parental Roles Typical parental roles and their functions include: Nurturer: the primary caregiver Provider: the person who is primarily responsible for generating the family's income Decision maker: the person who is responsible for making choices, especially related to lifestyle and leisure time Financial manager: the person who handles the money, such as paying bills and saving Problem solver: the person to whom other members go for help in solving problems Health manager: the person responsible for ensuring that family members maintain their health, such as scheduling doctor visits and ensuring that immunizations are current Gatekeeper: the person who manages information inflow and outflow (Pillitteri, 2007) CHANGES IN PARENTAL ROLES OVER TIME Parental roles evolve due to societal and economic changes as well as individual family changes. Traditionally, the role of provider was assigned to the father. However, with increased numbers of women in the workplace and more households with two parents working, today both parents are often the providers as well as the nurturers to the children. Technological innovations have provided parents with opportunities to work at home, allowing some parents to maintain the provider role while simultaneously fulfilling the nurturer and health manager roles. Fathers are taking on greater responsibilities related to household management and child care. Also, the number of children being raised by their grandparents is increasing (American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 2008a). Moreover, as baby boomers age, parents may find themselves caring for both their children and their aging parents. PARENTING STYLES Research in the 1960s by Baumrind, a psychologist, and further research in the 1980s by Maccoby and Martin led to the development of four major parenting styles seen in our society: authoritarian; authoritative; permissive; or uninvolved, rejecting, or neglecting (as cited in Cherry, n.d.; Ginsburg et al., 2009). The styles are defined by the amount of support and control exerted over the child during parenting. Many parents may use more than one parenting style and may fall somewhere in between styles instead of adhering strictly to one style. Also, some parents may change parenting styles as the child ages and matures. Whatever the style, sensitive and responsive caregiving is needed to promote appropriate physical, neurophysiologic, and psychological development (WHO, 2004). Nurses need to recognize different parenting styles and provide support to parents by discussing the effects of different parenting models and teaching parenting skills. Authoritarian. The authoritarian parent expects obedience from the child and discourages the child from questioning the family's rules. The parent provides low support and high control over the child (Cherry, n.d.). The rules and standards set forth by the parents are strictly enforced and firm. The parents expect the child to accept the family's beliefs and values and demand respect for these beliefs. The parents are the ultimate authority and allow little, if any, participation by the child in making decisions. Behavior that does not adhere to the family's rules and standards is punished. This parenting style is associated with negative effects on self-esteem, happiness, and social skills and increased aggression and defiance (Barakat & Clark, 2007; Cherry, n.d.). Authoritative. The authoritative or democratic parent shows some respect for the child's opinions. Although parents still have the ultimate authority and expect the child to adhere to the rules, authoritative parents allow children to be different and believe that each child is an individual. They exhibit warmth and consistently, fairly, and firmly enforce the family's rules and standards without emphasizing punishment. This type of parenting is associated with increased independence, happiness, and self-confidence and socially responsible individuals (Barakat & Clark, 2007; Cherry, n.d.). Permissive. Permissive or laissez-faire parents have little control over the behavior of their children. Rules or standards may be inconsistent, unclear, or nonexistent. Permissive parents allow their children to determine their own standards and rules for behavior. Discipline can be lax, inconsistent, or absent. Parents can be warm, cool, or uninvolved. There are more negative than positive effects associated with this style of parenting. Negative effects include children being impulsive, low happiness, poor school performance, problems with authority, and lacking responsibility and independence (Barakat & Clark, 2007; Cherry, n.d.). Uninvolved, Rejecting, or Neglecting. Uninvolved parents are indifferent. They do not provide rules or standards. The child's basic needs are often met but the parent is disconnected from the child's life. In some cases the parents may neglect or reject the child. They can be cold and uninterested in meeting the child's needs. They minimize their interactions and time with the children. This type of parenting is associated with negative effects such as the child lacking interest in school, lacking interest in the future, and lacking emotional and self-control (Cherry, n.d.). This type of parenting may also lead to lack of trust, low self-esteem, and anger toward others (Barakat & Clark, 2007; Cherry, n.d.).Discipline Much of parenting involves increasing desirable behavior and decreasing or eliminating undesirable behavior, a process generally known as discipline . There are various opinions in our society about the best or most effective method of discipline. Each child and family is unique. Discipline that works with one child or within one family may not work for another family. Discipline should focus on the development of the child while ensuring that their self-esteem and dignity are preserved. It should be based on age-appropriate expectations with clear, consistent guidelines while offering meaningful choices when possible. Discipline involves teaching and is ongoing, not something that is done just when the child misbehaves. The American Academy of Pediatrics (2004) suggests three strategies for effective discipline (see also Teaching Guidelines 2.1 ): Maintaining a positive, supportive, nurturing care-giver-child relationship Using positive reinforcement to increase desirable behaviors Removing positive reinforcements or using punishment to reduce or eliminate undesirable behaviors Teaching Guidelines 2.1 TEACHING TO PROMOTE EFFECTIVE DISCIPLINE Set clear, consistent, and developmentally appropriate expected behaviors; offer choices whenever possible. Maintain consistency in responding to behaviors; provide encouragement and affection. Role-model appropriate behaviors. Provide an age-appropriate explanation of the consequence that will occur if the child demonstrates unacceptable behavior. Always administer the consequence soon after the unacceptable behavior. Keep the consequence appropriate to the age of the child and the situation. Stay calm but firm without showing anger when administering the consequence. Always praise the child for displaying appropriate behavior. Set the environment to assist the child in accomplishing the appropriate behavior; remove temptations that may lead to inappropriate behavior. Reinforce that the child's behavior was bad, not that the child was bad. POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT Attention from parents is a very powerful form of positive reinforcement and can help increase desirable behaviors. The key is to focus on the child's appropriate behaviors rather than emphasizing the inappropriate ones. Immediate, consistent, and frequent feedback is crucial. This feedback can be in the form of smiles, praise, special attention, or rewards such as extra privileges or a special token or activity. Providing the feedback immediately is important so that the child learns to associate the feedback with the appropriate behavior, thereby reinforcing the behavior. EXTINCTION Another form of discipline is extinction, which focuses on reducing or eliminating the positive reinforcement for inappropriate behavior. Examples are ignoring the temper tantrums of a toddler, withholding or removing privileges, and requiring a \"time-out.\" Withholding or removing privileges such as TV, music, or computer or phone use is most effective for older children and adolescents. The adolescent may be grounded for a short time or not allowed to drive the car. To be effective, the privilege being withheld or removed must be something that the child values.FIGURE 2.5 Although he might not like it, quiet solitude helps the child develop inner control. Time-out is an extinction discipline method that is most effective with toddlers, preschoolers, and early school-aged children. It involves removing the child from the problem area and placing him or her in a neutral, nonthreatening, safe area where no interaction occurs between the child and parents or others for a specifically determined period ( Fig. 2.5 ). Take Note! The amount of time that a child spends in time-out is typically 1 minute per year of age; for example, a 3-year-old would spend 3 minutes in time-out (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2011). PUNISHMENT Discipline is often confused with punishment , but punishment involves a negative or unpleasant experience or consequence for doing or not doing something. Although punishment is sometimes a necessary element of discipline, to be an effective tool it must be coupled with rewards for good behavior (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2004). Punishment may be verbal or corporal. Verbal punishment commonly takes the form of reprimands or scolding (the use of disapproving statements). The statements are intended to change or eliminate the inappropriate behavior. Verbal reprimands can be effective in the short term if they are used sparingly and are focused on the child's specific behavior. If verbal reprimands are used frequently and indiscriminately, they lose their effectiveness, can provoke anxiety in the child, and encourage the child to ignore the parent. Frequent use also may reinforce the behavior by providing the child with attention (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2004). Corporal punishment involves the use of physical pain as a means to decrease inappropriate behavior. The most common form of corporal punishment is spanking (the use of an open hand to the buttocks or an extremity with the intention of modifying behavior without causing injury) (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2004). Research shows that many parents have spanked their children at some point. Spanking occurs most frequently in younger children, with 90% of parents of toddlers having spanked their child at least once (Grogan-Kaylor & Otis, 2007). Spanking decreases as children age, but is still used as a discipline strategy in adolescents. Over the past two decades a growing body of research has suggested that corporal punishment can cause an increase in behavior problems and have lasting effects into adulthood (Grogan-Kaylor & Otis, 2007).Initially, spanking may be effective because of its sudden and shocking nature. However, over time it loses its effectiveness because its shock value declines. Spanking may stop the negative behavior, but it also increases the chance for physical injury, especially for infants and young children, and may lead to altered caregiver-child relationships (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2004). Because the effects of spanking diminish, the intensity of the spanking must be increased to achieve the same effects. Thus, it is important for parents to understand the consequences of its use. Spanking is a controversial issue. Some argue that it provides children with a model of aggressive behavior as a solution for conflict, that it has been associated with increased aggression in children, and that it can lead to an altered parent-child relationship. Various studies have linked spanking in childhood with physical aggression and violence in childhood and persistent anger in adulthood (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2004, 2011). Because of the negative consequences of spanking and because it has been shown to be no more effective than other methods for managing inappropriate behavior, the American Academy of Pediatrics (2004) recommends that parents use methods other than spanking to respond to inappropriate behavior. Take Note! Other forms of discipline, if used incorrectly, can also cause problems for the child and interfere with the caregiver-child relationship. For example, disapproval using tone of voice, facial expression, or gestures can be effective in stopping inappropriate behavior, but if the disapproval comes in the form of verbal statements that attack the child rather than the behavior, negative consequences may occur (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2004).CULTURE Culture (the view of the world and implementation of a set of traditions that are used by a specific social group in order to pass these traditions along to the next generation) plays a critical role in shaping a child, including his or her health and health practices. Culture is a complex phenomenon involving the integration of many components such as beliefs, values, language, time, and personal space that shape a person's actions and behavior. Children learn these patterns of cultural behaviors from their family and community through a process called enculturation , which involves acquiring knowledge and internalizing values (Degazon, 1996). Culture influences every aspect of development and is reflected in childrearing beliefs and practices designed to promote healthy adaptation. Typically, a child begins to understand his or her culture at approximately 5 years of age (Andrews & Boyle, 2008). The child's cultural background affects the way that he or she socializes, learns values, and experiences the world. The child's developing beliefs, customs, mode of communication, dress, and actions may all be shaped by his or her culture. With today's changing demographic patterns, nurses must be able to incorporate cultural knowledge into their interventions so that they can care effectively for culturally diverse children. They must be aware of the wide range of cultural traditions, values, and ethics that exist in the United States today. All nurses must establish cultural competence , the ability to apply knowledge about a child's culture so that health care interventions can be adapted to meet the needs of the child ( Table 2.3 ). The nurse should know about various culture-based health practices and how they may affect children, as well as the demographics of the local population. The goal is for the nurse to view culture as a point of congruence rather than a potential source of conflict. Cultural Groups A cultural group is a self-defined group of people who share a commonality such as religion, language, nationality, ethnicity, race, or physical trait. In a society there are typically dominant and minority groups. The dominant group, often the largest group, has the greatest authority to control the values and sanctions of the society (Taylor, Lillis, & LeMone, 2005). As a result, the dominant culture may have the largest impact on the child's health, while minority cultural groups may still maintain some of their own traditions and values. The relationship of culture to health care can become obscured by the use of broad group titles. In reality, there are many distinct cultural groups, and within a group there may be many subcultures. Geographic differences also can occur. For example, the Latin Americans living in New York may be quite different from the Latin Americans living in Florida. Nurses must be aware of these distinct cultural groups so they can provide culturally competent care. Nurses should also be aware of the traditional health care values and practices that are passed along from one generation to the next. For example, some cultures believe in consulting folk healers, and this belief may have a major influence on children's health ( Table 2.4 ). The nurse must remember that diversity exists within cultures and this is as important as the diversity between cultures. Every child is a unique individual with his or her own beliefs, values, and history. Nurses need to avoid stereotyping, which can lead to misconceptions. EthnicityEthnicity, a term sometimes used synonymously with culture, involves group membership by virtue of common ancestry. The basic groups are differentiated by their customs, characteristics, language, or similar distinguishing factors. Ethnic groups have their own family structures, languages, food preferences, moral codes, and health care practices. Children learn the accepted mode of behavior by observing and imitating those around them. The influences of culture and ethnicity on children and families are highly variable and dynamic. Probably the most important characteristic of ethnicity is the sense of shared identity felt by members (Davidhizar, Havens, & Bechtel, 1999). Children who come from a minority group may experience conflict because their native customs are different from those of the dominant culture. Many Americans in the dominant culture do not view themselves as belonging to a specific ethnic group, but many minority groups still identify closely with their ethnicity and emphasize their cultural or racial differences (Davidhizar et al., 1999). Stereotyping or labeling can result from ethnocentrism, a belief that one's own ethnic group is superior to other ethnic groups. This attitude can lead to a slanted view of the world, and it may hinder the nurse's ability to provide culturally competent care. Cultural Health Practices Health practices are often the result of health beliefs derived from a person's culture. For example, do the child and family view health and illness as the result of natural forces, supernatural forces, or the imbalance of forces? Most cultures have remedies that people may use or consider before they seek professional health care. People from some cultures may go to folk healers who they believe can cure certain illnesses. For example, the curandero (male) or the curandera (female) of the Mexican American community is believed to have healing powers as a gift from God. Asian Americans may consult a practitioner who specializes in traditional Asian therapies such as acupuncture, acupressure, and moxibustion. These folk healers are often very powerful in their community, speak the language, and are very familiar with the culture's spiritual or religious aspects. If the folk remedies or practices of the folk healers are compatible with the health regimen and support appropriate health practices, these practices and beliefs do no harm; in fact, they may even benefit the child and family. However, use of a folk healer can lead to a delay in beneficial treatment or create other problems. Some traditional health practices may be misinterpreted as being harmful, and some actually are harmful. For example, the Vietnamese practice of coining, which involves rubbing the edge of a coin on an oiled symptomatic body area to rid the body of disease, may be misinterpreted as a sign of physical abuse (Allender, Rector, & Warner, 2010). This practice also can lead to burns, bruising, or weltlike lesions on the child's skin if it is done frequently. Azarcon and greta, powders containing high amounts of lead, are used as a folk remedy in Mexico to treat empacho, digestive problems such as diarrhea and indigestion, and can result in lead toxicity (Allender et al., 2010). Take Note! Pediatric nurses can help to shape an individual's lifelong perceptions of health and health services. An understanding of how the child's and family's culture affects their health practices gives the nurse an opportunity to incorporate appropriate and beneficial health practices into the family's cultural milieu, providing sources of strength rather than areas of conflict. Recall Miguel, the infant described at the beginning of the chapter. Propose appropriate nursing interventions that would assist in providing culturally competent care. How can you best determine the child's and family's cultural preferences? Changing Cultural Demographics Although the proportion of children is decreasing in relationship to the adult population, the racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity among children is significantly increasing in the United States (ChildStats.gov Forum on Child and Family Statistics, 2010). Thus, the number of culturally diverse children entering the health care system in the United States is increasing. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 66% of the population is White, 13.4% is Black or African American, 15.1% is Hispanic, and 5% is Asian (U.S. Census Bureau News, 2008b). The U.S. Census Bureau reports that the Hispanic population increased by 3.3% from July 1, 2006, to July 1, 2007; this is the fastest-growing population group, with the Asian population accounting for the second fastest (U.S. Census Bureau News, 2008b). At the same time, the non-Hispanic white population grew by 0.3% during the same time frame (U.S. Census Bureau News, 2008b). In addition, the increasing number of marriages between individuals from different ethnic origins is producing an increasing number of children who have a heritage that represents more than one cultural group. Immigration Employment and economic opportunities, expanded human rights, educational opportunities, and other types of freedoms and opportunities encourage many foreigners to move to the United States. There are a growing number of immigrants with approximately 15.7 million or one in five children in the United States being immigrants or members of an immigrant family (Kids Count Data Center, 2007). This includes both children born outside the United States and those with at least one foreign-born parent. Some communities welcome the new members, but others do not. Partly due to fears of terrorism, the United States is evaluating, enforcing, and changing many of its immigration laws. Immigration can affect the health, educational, and social services provided in the United States. It also presents issues related to access to care and the types of care that need to be offered. Immigration imposes unique stresses on children and families, including: Depression, grief, or anxiety associated with migration and acculturation Separation from support systems Inadequate language skills in a society that is not tolerant of linguistic differences Disparities in social, professional, and economic status between the country of origin and the United States Traumatic events such as war or persecution that may have occurred in their native country (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2005) Inability to speak English can hinder an immigrant's educational attainment, economic opportunities, and ability to join the mainstream of society. Nineteen percent of children born in immigrant families have difficulty speaking English, with 27% of children in immigrant families living in a linguistically isolated home (i.e., no person 14 years or older speaks English very well) (Kids Count Data Center, 2007). Immigrant parents who do not speak English may have trouble accessing health care and health insurance, enrolling their children in school or becoming involved in school activities, and accessing work or better-paying jobs. Immigrant children also may arrive in the United States with significant health problems. They may present with diseases that aremore common in their country of origin and rarely seen in the United States, such as malaria. The health status of immigrant children may be compromised due to the lack of at-birth and early childhood screenings, which may manifest with problems such as inborn errors of metabolism, lack of preventive care, no immunizations, and no dental care. Due to financial, language, cultural, and other types of barriers that immigrant families sometimes face, the children may not receive the necessary preventive care or receive care for minor conditions until the conditions become more serious. Stresses experienced by immigrant children and their families, such as those associated with relocation, separation, and traumatic events, also can have a negative impact on their psychological health.SPIRITUALITY AND RELIGION Spirituality is a basic human quality involving the belief in something greater than one's self and a faith that affirms life positively. It is a major influence in many people's lives, providing a meaning or purpose to life and a foundation for and a source of love, relationships, and service. Spirituality is considered a universal human phenomenon with an assumption of the wholeness of individuals and their connectedness to a higher being. During life-changing events and crises, such as the birth of a child with a congenital defect or a serious or terminal illness, families often turn to spirituality for hope, comfort, and relief. The word \"religion\" is often used interchangeably with spirituality in our society. However, spirituality is a more private and individual belief, whereas religion is an organized way of sharing beliefs and practicing worship. Between 85% and 90% of Americans believe in God (Baylor Institute for Studies of Religion, 2006); therefore, spirituality and religion are an important focus when working with children and their families. A person's reaction to health and illness may be affected by these beliefs. In some religions, illness is seen as a punishment for sin or wrongdoing. Other religions view illness as a test of strength (Allender et al., 2010). Children view spirituality and religion differently at different developmental stages. Typically, children imitate their parents' rituals when they are toddlers and then develop an increasingly sophisticated understanding of their parents' views during the years up to adolescence. Refer to Chapters 3 through 7 for a discussion on how children of different ages and developmental levels view spirituality and religion. Families appreciate the recognition of, and respect for, their beliefs. Therefore, identifying the child's and family's religious beliefs and customs is important. Families may adhere to special dietary restrictions, rituals such as baptism or communion, use of amulets or icons, or practices related to dying that can be incorporated into the child's plan of care. Using open-ended questions and observing for the use of religious articles during assessment can provide clues to the family's beliefs and practices. Visits from spiritual leaders may also be noted. Table 2.5 identifies some of the ways in which tenets of some major religious beliefs may affect children's health. Recall the Delgado family described at the beginning of the chapter. What, if any, influence might the family's culture and religious beliefs have on Miguel's care? Take Note! Never make assumptions about a family's religious or spiritual affiliation. Although they may belong to a particular religion, they may not adhere to all of the beliefs or participate in all aspects of the religion.COMMUNITY Community encompasses a broad range of concepts, from a person's particular neighborhood or group to an individual's nation of residence. The community surrounding a child affects many aspects of his or her health, development, and general welfare. The child's community consists of the family, school, neighborhood, youth organizations, and other peer groups. The quality of life within the community, positive or negative, has a great influence on a child's ability to achieve developmental tasks and become a functional member of society. The child's school, which is a community by itself, and peer groups are important influences. School programs and community centers can also affect the child's overall health and well-being. Children need to feel supported by, cared for, and valued by their community. They need to be surrounded by supportive, loving parents; safe schools and neighborhoods; adult mentors and role models; and caring teachers. They need to know what is expected of them and what behaviors are outside the boundaries of the community. Schools and Other Community Centers Children today start school at an earlier age, spend more time in child care settings, and are involved in various community centers and activities. By age 3 or 4, many children are in a preschool setting for several hours a day. Some children spend more awake time in school and child care settings than in their family home. Thus, schools and child care settings have become major influences on children. School also provides a means of socialization. School rules about attendance and authority relationships and the system of sanctions and rewards based on achievement help to teach children behavioral expectations that they will need for future employment and relationships in the adult world. Although the primary role of schools has always been academic education, today schools are performing more health-related functions. Schools play an important role in promoting healthy behaviors and educating children about proper exercise, nutrition, safety, sex, drugs, and mental health. Academic success is linked to healthy behaviors. Academic success is a good indicator of child well-being and is a predictor of adult health outcomes (Center for Disease Control, Healthy Youth, 2008). Academic failure is linked to health risk behaviors such as substance use, violence, and physical inactivity (Center for Disease Control, Healthy Youth, 2008). School health programs have positive impacts on health outcomes and health risk behaviors along with educational outcomes (Center for Disease Control, Healthy Youth, 2008). Because in many families both parents need to work, many children are enrolled in child care and afterschool programs. Thus, the socialization process begins earlier and involves a larger percentage of the child's waking hours ( Fig. 2.6 ). After-school hours are a critical time during which children may participate in risky health behaviors if they are not provided with supervised, structured activity where they can learn and grow. Community centers and after-school programs can provide an opportunity for children to learn new skills, have new experiences, and develop relationships with caring adults in a safe and supportive environment.FIGURE 2.6 Day care centers can provide socialization and support for young children. Peer Groups A child's friends can have a major influence, positive or negative, on his or her growth and development. Peer group relationshipsoften begin early and are a large part of the child's world, particularly with school-age children and adolescents. This influence starts in play-groups in preschool or elementary school. The child is confronted with a variety of values and belief systems from interactions with his or her friends. To be accepted, the child must conform to the specific values and beliefs of the group. When these values and beliefs differ from those of the adults in the child's world, conflicts can occur, possibly separating children from the adults and strengthening their sense of belonging to the peer group. When the child's friends are successful in school or other activities, the growth and development of the child continues in a healthy and positive way. When these groups demonstrate healthy behaviors, the influence is very positive, but peer groups can also exert negative influences on the child. Thus, it is vital to identify the important peer groups in a child's life and the positive or negative behaviors connected with these groups. Connectedness in Neighborhoods and Communities Social capital refers to the bonds between individuals that assist communities to achieve a variety of goals, including goals directed at improving children's health. It requires norms of reciprocity, mutual assistance, and trust (Putnam & Feldstein, 2003). It is a mechanism by which the resources of a community can be mobilized by and from the people, not for them (Looman & Lindeke, 2005). Common interests and relationships propel neighborhoods and communities toward engagement. One example is the Neighborhood Watch Program, in which a community invests in the safety of the whole neighborhood by bonding together and sending a message to potential intruders that community members look out for one another (Looman & Lindeke, 2005). Evidence suggests that the degree of connectedness in neighborhoods and communities is associated with positive health outcomes (Baum, 1999). In connected communities, people find it easy to engage in health-promoting behaviors. Looman and Lindeke (2005) believe that a simple question such as, \"How is your relationship with your neighbors?\" can help the nurse to understand the child's social milieu. They suggest three areas to include in nursing interventions and strategies: Bringing families together in communities to set the stage for networking Disseminating knowledge about what helps create healthy, supported communities Thinking of relationships as investments, with social interactions as the processes by which resources for health are exchanged (Looman & Lindeke, 2005) Violence in the Community Youth violence affects the community as well as the child and family. Studies have shown that youth violence is associated with a disruption in social services, an increase in health care costs, and a decline in property values (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2010a). Although the new century has shown an overall decline in violence by and against children, youth violence is still an important public health problem (Finkelhor, Turner, Ormrod, & Hamby, 2010). Violent Crimes Violent crimes include murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Statistics from the CDC (2010b) show that for people ages 10 to 24 years: Approximately 5,764 individuals were murdered in 2007; of those deaths, firearms accounted for 84%. More than 656,000 individuals were treated in emergency departments for injuries due to violence in 2008. Homicide remained the leading cause of death for African Americans, the second-leading cause of death for Hispanics, and the third-leading cause of death for American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Asian/Pacific Islanders. Suicide Suicide is a serious public health problem affecting young people today. Suicide is the third-leading cause of death in people ages 10 to 24 years, with 46% due to firearms, 39% due to suffocations, and 8% due to poisoning (CDC, 2008, 2009). Of these reported suicides, boys (83%) were much more likely than girls (17%) to die from suicide (CDC, 2008). In 2007, a nationwide survey of students in grades 9 to 12 in public and private schools found that 15% reported seriously considering suicide in the previous 12 months (CDC, 2009). Take Note! Cultural variations in youth suicide rates are present; Native American/Alaskan Natives and Hispanic youths have the highest rate of suicide (CDC, 2009).School Violence In recent years, due to several high-profile cases of school shootings, much attention has been directed at school violence and concern for student safety has increased. However, statistically, over the past decade there has been a decline in school violence and schools in the United States have become even safer. Students are much less likely to be victims of crime at school than away, but some schools continue to have serious crime and violence problems (CDC, 2011) The CDC conducted a nationwide survey of high school students about risk behavior and found that in 2007, approximately 3.8% of the students reported that they had been involved in a physical altercation at least once in the previous year, while 1% reported a physical fight on school property (CDC, 2010a). The percentage of youths who reported carrying a weapon (gun, knife, or club) for at least one of the days in the month prior to the survey was 5.6%, while 7.7% reported being injured or threatened by a weapon on school grounds (CDC, 2010a). Much of school violence involves bullying, which is repeated negative actions that are clearly malicious and unwarranted by one or more persons directed at a victim. It has been estimated that 20% of students between 9th and 10th grade in the United States are a target of bullying (CDC, 2010b). Many cases of bullying go unreported, but bullying can have long-lasting traumatic effects, such as depression, low self-esteem, and anxiety (McGuinness, 2007). School nurses need to be aware of bullying and offer support and guidance, and intervention when necessary, to the students and staff. Safe schools are essential for proper learning, growth and development, development of healthy relationships, and overall health of children. Violence in schools has a negative effect not only on students but also on the school and the entire community. The continued coordination among schools, law enforcement, social services, and mental health systems and the development of effective programs will help to reduce these risk behaviors. Violence in the Home Violence that occurs in the home, known as domestic violence, affects the lives of many people in America, including children. Domestic violence includes intimate partner violence, which are crimes committed by current or former spouses, boyfriends, or girlfriends, including in same-sex relationships, as well as violence between family members. The rate of domestic violence has declined over the past decade but still accounts for 9% of all violent crime (National Center for Victims of Crime, 2008). Women are more likely than men to be victims of these types of crimes. This violence is also known as intimate partner abuse, family violence, wife beating, battering, marital abuse, and partner abuse. Children often witness family violence, and they may be physically, sexually, or emotionally abused themselves (Holt, Buckley, & Whelan, 2008). The Federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) defines child abuse and neglect as any recent act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker that results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, or sexual abuse or exploitation, or an act or failure to act that presents an imminent risk of serious harm to a child (Child Welfare Information Gateway, 2007). In 2008, approximately 772,000 cases of child maltreatment occurred in the United States (CDC, 2010c). Of the number of children identified as being maltreated, 71% were victims of neglect, 16% were victims of physical abuse, 9% were victims of sexual abuse, and 7% were victims of emotional or psychological abuse (CDC, 2010c). Approximately 1,740 children died from abuse and neglect in 2008; 80% of those children were younger than 4 years of age (CDC, 2010c). Take Note! African American, American Indian, or Alaska Native children have higher rates of abuse and neglect (CDC, 2010c). Children who are exposed to stressors such as domestic violence or who are victims of childhood abuse or neglect are at high risk for short- and long-term problems. These problems manifest differently based on the child's age and developmental ability; the younger the child and the longer the exposure, the more serious the problems seen. Short-term problems include sleep disturbances, headaches, stomachaches, depression, asthma, enuresis, aggressive behaviors such as increased peer aggression and bullying, decreased social competencies, withdrawal, avoidant attachment, developmental regression, fears, anxiety, and learning problems. Long-term problems may include poor school performance, truancy, absenteeism, and difficulty with adult relationships and tasks. There is a strong correlation between the number of exposures to adverse events and negative behaviors such as early initiation of smoking, sexual activity, and illicit drug use; adolescent pregnancies; and suicide attempts (CDC, 2010c). Take Note! Witnessing and being exposed to violence in childhood results in a higher tolerance, and greater use, of violence as an adult (Children's Defense Fund-Ohio, 2009). Due to the potential impact of violence on children and families, it is important to perform a thorough assessment to identifyviolence in the family ( Box 2.2 ). Providing referrals to shelters and child advocacy centers and intervening to assist children in dealing with this issue are key. Not all children exposed to violence suffer negative consequences. Children have resilience, and preliminary studies have identified protective factors that can help BOX 2.2 ASSESSING FOR VIOLENCE Questions for the Parent Do you ever feel afraid in your home? What happens when you and ___ (partner's name) argue? Do arguments ever become physical (hitting, kicking, pushing, throwing, or punching/breaking objects)? Have you ever been threatened with a weapon (gun, knife, other)? Have you ever felt trapped or like a prisoner in your own home? Does your partner ever lock you in/out of the house or take your car keys? Have your children ever seen or heard violence in the home? Have the police ever been involved due to violence in your home? Is the violence ever directed at the children? Does __ (partner's name) ever hit, kick, push, or yell at your child when he/she is angry? How do you and __ (partner's name) discipline the children? Questions for the Child What happens when Mommy and Daddy (or appropriate partner names) argue/fight? Is there any hitting, pushing, etc.? How do you feel when Mommy and Daddy (or appropriate partner names) fight? What happens to you when you get in trouble? If hitting or other physical forms of discipline occur, ask the following: What are you hit with? Where on your body? Does it ever leave a mark/bruise? Who hits/kicks you? How often does it happen? buffer children from the effects of violence and reduce the risk that the child will develop violent behaviors (Holt et al., 2008). Examples of protective factors include: Feelings of connectedness or a secure attachment to a nonviolent parent or caregiver Strong commitment to school and academic performance Involvement in social activities Social and community support Positive sibling and peer relationships Ability to discuss problems with parents or a supportive adult Consistent presence of a parent at least once during the day, such as in the morning on awakening, when getting home from school, at dinnertime, or when going to bed Thus, interventions need to focus on reducing children's exposure to violence and fostering protective factors.SOCIETY Society has a major impact on the health of a child. Major components of a society that influence children and their health include social roles, socioeconomic status, the media, and the expanding global nature of society. Each of these areas may influence children's self-concept, the communities they live in, their choice of lifestyle, and their health. Pediatric nurses need to assess these areas and their influence on the child and family so that individualized strategies can be designed and implemented to enhance the positive effects and minimize the negative effects on the child's and family's health. Social Roles Society often dictates that specific people behave in specific ways: certain behaviors are permitted and others are prohibited. These patterns are identified as social roles and can be an important factor in the development of self-concept, and a person's self-concept can have a very positive or a very negative influence on his or her health. For children, social roles influence their ideas about themselves. Box 2.3 lists some typical roles children have in our society. These social roles are generally carried out in groups, such as the family, school, peers, or church or community organizations. At times there may be a conflict in how the different groups expect a child to behave. There also may be conflict for parents related to childrearing practices. For example, the child's family may believe in creationism, while the school the child attends is teaching evolution. Thus, the child may feel confused as he or she tries to practice the behaviors expected by the different groups. BOX 2.3 EXAMPLES OF SOCIAL ROLES FOR CHILDREN Daughter or son Brother or sister Granddaughter or grandson School or day care roles, such as first-grader, honor student Ethnic community member Church roles, such as acolyte, altar server Specialized roles such as developing musician, artist, or athlete Socioeconomic Status An even more important influence on children is the family's socioeconomic status (relative position in society), which takes into account the family's economic, occupational, and educational levels. Children are raised differently by parents of different educational levels, occupations, and incomes. Despite advances and improvements in quality and access to health care, discrepancies in health status between socioeconomic classes have continued (National Institute for Health Care Management [NIHCM], 2007). Income inequality is an important factor in explaining this variation. Lowerclass parents may need to work long hours to provide basic necessities and have little time or money to enrich the child's life or make healthy lifestyle choices. However, lower-class families may have stronger family relationships if they need to rely on a family network to meet some of their physical and emotional needs. Lifestyle characteristics, such as cultural norms for health behaviors, may help buffer some lower-class children from health problems (Chen, Martin, & Matthews, 2006). Low socioeconomic status can have an adverse influence on children's health. Some families may not be able to afford health insurance or health care. Meals may be unbalanced or irregular. The family's house or apartment may be overcrowded and may have poor sanitation or lead paint. These families may not understand the importance of preventive care or may not be able to afford it, and as a result the children may be inadequately immunized against communicable diseases. Studies have documented that children who come from low socioeconomic status are more likely to suffer from acute and chronic conditions and experience more limitations from these, as well as injuries and mental health conditions (Currie & Lin, 2007). Poverty Basic financial stability enhances the general health and well-being of children, and thus an important negative influence on children's health is poverty. Children living in poverty are more likely to have poor health, be retained in a grade or drop out of school, become teen parents, experience violent crimes, and become poor adults (Stanton & Behrman, 2007). They have greater rates of death andillness from almost all causes, except suicide and motor vehicle accidents (Stanton & Behrman, 2007). The poverty threshold is based on the family's size and income and is used to determine whether a family is living in poverty ( Table 2.6 ). According to the U.S. Census Bureau in 2007, approximately 12.5% of individuals and 9.8% of families were living below the poverty level (Denavas-Walt, Proctor, & Smith, 2008). Overall, 18% of children younger than age 18 years were living in poverty (Denavas-Walt et al., 2008). Over the past decade the number and rate of children living in poverty have risen. According to the Children's Defense Fund (2008), 1 in 6, or 13.3 million, American children lives in poverty, with 1 in 13, or 5.8 million, living in extreme poverty. The rate of poverty is closely tied to the overall health of the economy; therefore, in times of recession, a rise is usually seen. Family structure is an important factor associated with poverty rates for children. The poverty rate for married-couple families is much less than that for families headed by a single parent. Of the families living below poverty level, 28.3% were single-mother families with no husband present, 13% were single-father families with no wife present, and only 4.9% were married couples (Denavas-Walt et al., 2008). Educational level is another important factor: as education increases, unemployment declines and annual income rises. However, a chronic physical or emotional problem in any wage earner may lead to unemployment, and this can cause the family to spiral downward into poverty. The effects of poverty on children's health can be wide-ranging. The family may be able to afford only substandard housing or a house or an apartment in a dangerous neighborhood (e.g., unsanitary conditions, toxins, violence). Poverty may also lead to homelessness. Homelessness According to the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, approximately 1.35 million children are likely to experience homelessness in a given year (National Coalition for the Homeless, 2008a). Families with children represent 23% of the homeless population, with half of these being children younger than 5 years of age (National Coalition for the Homeless, 2008b). It is impossible to measure homelessness with 100% accuracy. Therefore, looking at trends is important to demonstrate whether or not progress is being made. Recent research suggests that homelessness among families is increasing (National Coalition for the Homeless, 2008b). The typical homeless family is headed by a single mother in her late 20s with two children, one or both younger than age 6, and ethnic minorities are at the greatest risk (Rog & Buckner, 2007). Homelessness occurs not only in large urban areas but also in midsize cities as well as suburban and rural areas. The principal causes of homelessness in families are poverty and lack of affordable housing. Other causes include cutbacks in public welfare programs, mental health issues, and traumatic events such as unemployment, illness, or accidents and personal crises such as divorce, domestic violence, or substance abuse. Children may be forced out of their houses or choose to run away and become homeless because they have been abused or neglected, lived in foster homes, or were placed in residential treatment or juvenile detention centers. In homeless children, the basic need for a stable shelter goes unmet. Homelessness is not conducive to appropriate growth and development in children. Homeless children are more likely to suffer behavioral and emotional problems, be diagnosed with a mental illness, be victims of physical and sexual abuse, and suffer educational disabilities. They also have a higher incidence of acute and chronic health problems, such as an increased rate of asthma, ear infections, gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea, and speechproblems, and increased mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, and withdrawal. They may be exposed to environmental hazards in homeless shelters or overcrowded housing, or, if they live on the street, there may be exposure to the elements, lack of sanitary facilities, and an increased risk of injuries. An unbalanced diet may place homeless children at risk for nutritional deficits, which can lead to delayed growth and development. Homeless teens often engage in risky behaviors such as drug use or unprotected sex with multiple partners, so they are more likely to need emergency care, be depressed, and become pregnant (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2005). They may also become teen parents, continuing the cycle of financial instability and homelessness. Homeless children may have limited access to health care services, especially preventive care such as immunizations, dental care, and well-child services. Lack of immunizations can lead to delayed enrollment in school, and education is vital for these children to help break the cycle of homelessness. When the families do have money, often they need it for food and shelter instead of health care. If they do seek health care, it is usually in an emergency department or a free clinic and such sporadic care is not conducive to the ongoing health needs of a growing child. The family may not follow through with care because they cannot afford it, lack health insurance, or do not have transportation to the clinic or pharmacy. Some of these children do not go to school or go to various schools because the family moves from place to place. The stress experienced by the family provides an environment that is not conducive to learning. As a result, children present with learning problems, socialization issues, or other behavioral issues. Media Today's children are inundated with various forms of media, such as television, video and computer games, iPods, the Internet, movies, magazines, books, and newspapers ( Fig. 2.7 ). Media has both positive and negative effects on the development of children and much depends on the content to which they are exposed (Wilson, 2008). Some of the images and information are not always in the best interests of children. Children may identify with, and mimic, characters who engage in risk-taking behaviors or lifestyles. Health risk behaviors, such as excessive caloric intake, physical inactivity, smoking, underage drinking, and violent behavior, have been linked to media exposure (Escobar-Chaves & Anderson, 2008). Research has established a very strong link between media violence and violent, aggressive behavior (Escobar-Chaves & Anderson, 2008). If an image or type of behavior is portrayed as the norm, children may view this as acceptable behavior without examining the potential health risks or other long-term consequences. For example, thinness is portrayed as the body type that is identified with beauty, leading some children to develop unhealthy dieting or other behaviors to develop that body type. For the child who has a body type that does not fit the ideal, depression or self-esteem issues may develop. FIGURE 2.7 Computer games can be fun and educational, but the child should be monitored while using the computer or other forms of media to minimize negative effects. Overall, the images children view every day will affect their behavior and possibly their health, and pediatric nurses should take this into account when working with children and their families.The media's influence relates not only to the content but also to the total viewing time. For example, excessive TV viewing has been linked to obesity, poor cognitive skills, and irregular sleep patterns. Overuse of computer or video games may lead to poor school performance. The media can be a positive influence, such as when it offers educational programming or public service messages on the negative effects of substance abuse, smoking, or gang involvement. Also, public broadcasting networks offer valuable programming. Take Note! The American Academy of Pediatrics discourages any screen media before the age of 2 (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2001). Widespread access to the Internet has fostered a connection to other areas of the world that would not have been possible in previous years. Children are no longer limited to their immediate surroundings, and they have access to a wealth of information. The Internet can be a valuable resource for parents and children to access information, learn new things, and communicate with friends and family. However, online threats exist that can affect the child's health and safety, such as sexual predators, pornography, violence, and racism. Parents need to be alert to these hazards and set up safety guidelines (see Teaching Guidelines 2.2 ). Teaching Guidelines 2.2 TEACHING TO PROMOTE SAFE INTERNET USE Determine a time limit that your child can spend online each day or week and maintain consistency in enforcing this time limit. Ensure that use of the Internet does not replace or interfere with homework, friends, or household or school activities. Tell your child NEVER to share personal information with anyone online unless you are sure of the person and the child has your permission to do so. Urge your child NEVER to share his or her password with anyone, even friends. Review Internet sites with your child, and explain which sites are appropriate. Use the safety and parental controls offered by your Internet service provider. Avoid placing the computer in the child's room. Rather, place the computer in a public area of your home, such as the den or kitchen, so that you can monitor your child's use. Discuss with your child the need for safety while using the Internet. Explain potential hazards in terms the child can understand. Advise your child to immediately close any sites or stop any communication that makes him or her confused or uncomfortable. Tell your child NEVER to arrange any face-to-face meetings with persons met online. Urge your child to tell you if he or she encounters such a situation. Teach the child NEVER to open e-mail from any unknown senders. Be aware of computer use policies in your child's school. Global Society The world is connected in many ways today: people travel from one nation to another easily, new products and immigrants arrive each day, and the Internet makes worldwide communication simple. The United Nations Children's Fund and the WHO lead the world in dealing with the issues for the children of the world. Every year 10 million children die around the world, over 26,500 every day (Shah, 2008). Hundreds of thousands of children born in developing countries are moving to more developed nations such as the United States as refugees, immigrants, or international adoptees. These children become part of this nation. Pediatric nurses need to be aware of the impact of worldwide events on children. The population explosion and health problems in developing nations and natural and man-made disasters around the world affect the United States and the world in terms of productivity, economics, and politics (WHO, 2004). Children can be displaced by events such as hurricanes or wars, placing them at increased risk for problems such as infectious diseases, malnutrition, and psychological trauma. According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF, 2008), young children bear the brunt of the global burden of disease. These organizations have identified major problems affecting child growth and development and survival: Malnutrition, including micronutrient deficiency HIV/AIDS Acute respiratory infections, such as pneumonia Diarrhea related to lack of clean water and sanitation Vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles Malaria Poor health care of pregnant and nursing mothers (UNICEF, 2008) These organizations work to propose ways to eradicate these conditions by improving the case management skills of providers with adapted guidelines; improving the health systems with good district health planning and management as well as appropriate supplies, medications, information systems, and referral systems; and improving the family and community practices (WHO, 2011). Today, society as a whole, families, and children have concerns over world threats and safety. Disasters such as the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and the killings at Columbine High School, and devastating weather events such as Hurricane Katrina can have a significant impact on the well-being of children. The increase in stressors such as war, terrorism, school violence, and natural disasters puts children at risk for experiencing mental health difficulties. Children who have experienced these events are at risk for issues such as posttraumatic stress disorder, behavioral problems, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, physiologic responses such as gastrointestinal symptoms, changes in academic performance, and safety and security concerns (American Psychological Association Online Public Policy Office, 2008). Children's coping abilities may be reduced and alterations in growth and development may be seen. Children's reactions depend on age and developmental level and are highly influenced by the emotional state of their caregivers. Pediatric nurses must be aware of the effects of world threats on children so that they can assess for alterations and intervene to promote security and stability. KEY CONCEPTS The child's gender and race; the child's biological traits, including some behavioral traits or aspects of temperament; and certain diseases or illnesses are directly linked to genetic inheritance. The way a child experiences a particular event will be influenced by his or her temperament, and the child's temperament will influence the responses of others, including the parents, to the child. Developmental level has a major impact on the health status of children. Generally, the distribution of diseases varies with age. Adequate nutrition can provide a rich environment for the developing child; conversely, nutritional deprivation can seriously interfere with brain development and other functions. Lifestyle choices that can affect a child's health include patterns of eating; exercise; use of tobacco, drugs, or alcohol; and methods of coping with stress. With advances in medicine, most chronic health problems today arise due to a person's lifestyle. In the case of children, the lifestyle of the parents basically is the lifestyle of the child. Environmental exposures can have a detrimental impact on the child. The term resilience refers to the qualities that enable an individual to cope with significant adverse events or stresses and still function competently (Lietz, 2007). Internal factors that promote resiliency include the person's ability to take control and be proactive, to be responsible for his or her own decisions, to understand and accept his or her own limits and abilities, and to be goal directed, knowing when to continue or when to stop. External factors that promote resiliency include caring relationships with a family member; a positive, safe learning environment at school (including clubs and social organizations); and positive influences in the community. Access to health care is affected negatively by lack of health insurance. Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) are both public programs available to provide health insurance to low-income children and their parents. Even with the public programs available to assist children and families, barriers to appropriate, cost-effective, coordinated, and timely health care remain. Barriers can be financial, sociocultural, or ethnic, or part of the health care system itself. The family is considered the basic social unit. The family into which a child is born will greatly influence his or her development and health. Children learn health care activities, health beliefs, and health values from their family. Typical family roles include nurturer, provider, decision maker, financial manager, problem solver, health manager, and gatekeeper. Four major parenting styles are seen: authoritarian; authoritative; permissive; and uninvolved, rejecting, or neglecting. Each represents the amount of support and control exerted over the child by the parent. Discipline is a process that has as its goal increasing desirable behavior and decreasing or eliminating undesirable behavior. Punishment involves a negative or unpleasant experience or consequence for doing or not doing something. Culture plays a critical role in shaping a child, including his or her health and health practices. With today's changing demographic patterns, nurses must be able to incorporate cultural knowledge into their interventions so that they can care effectively for culturally diverse children. Ethnicity involves group membership by virtue of common ancestry. The basic groups are differentiated by their customs, characteristics, language, or similar distinguishing factors. Ethnic groups have their own family structures, languages, food preferences, moral codes, and health care practices. Spirituality, a major influence for many individuals, provides a meaning and purpose to life and is a foundation for and a source of love, relationships, and service. Spiritual and religious beliefs and views can provide strength and support to children and families during times of stress and illness. Religion also can determine the way in which a family interprets and responds to illness; for example, some religions view illness as a punishment for wrongdoing or as a test of strength. The community surrounding a child affects many aspects of his or her health, development, and general welfare. The child's community consists of the family, school, neighborhood, youth organizations, and other peer groups. Some children spend more awake time in school and child care settings than in their family home. A child's friends can have a major influence, positive or negative, on his or her growth and development. Suicide is a serious public health problem affecting young people today. Youth violence affects both the family and the community in terms of disrupted social services, increased health care costs, and decreased property values. Children may witness violent acts in the school, home, or community. They also may be victims of violence. However, not all children exposed to violence suffer negative consequences. In addition to resiliency, certain protective factors can help buffer them from the effects of violence, helping to reduce the risk that they too will develop violent behaviors. Basic financial stability enhances the general health and well-being of children, and thus an important negative influence on children's health is poverty. Children living in poverty are more likely to have poor health, be retained in a grade or drop out of school, become teen parents, experience violent crimes, and become poor adults. Children who are homeless are exposed to an environment that is not conducive to growth and development. Children who are homeless commonly have physical health problems such as upper respiratory, ear, and skin infections; gastrointestinal disorders; and infestations.

Allison Johnson is a 6-month-old girl brought to the clinic by her mother and father for her 6-month check-up. As new parents, they have a list of questions and concerns. On assessment you find that Allison's weight is 16 pounds, length 25 3/4 inches, and head circumference 17 inches. As the nurse caring for her, assess Allison's growth and development, and then teach the parents what changes to expect in Allison over the next few months. The newborn or neonatal period of infancy is defined as the period from birth until 28 days of age. Infancy is defined as the period from birth to 12 months of age. Growth and development are interrelated, ongoing processes in infancy and childhood. Growth refers to an increase in physical size. Development is the sequential process by which infants and children gain various skills and functions. Heredity influences growth and development by determining the child's potential, while environment contributes to the degree of achievement. Maturation refers to an increase in functionality of various body systems or developmental skills. GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OVERVIEW Growth and developmental changes in the first year of life are numerous and dramatic. Physical growth, maturation of body systems, and gross and fine motor skills progress in an orderly and sequential fashion. Though timing may vary from infant to infant, the order in which developmental skills are acquired is consistent. Infants also exhibit vast amounts of learning in the psychosocial and cognitive, language and communication, and social/emotional domains. Adequate growth and development are indicative of health in the infant or young child. Nurses must be familiar with normal developmental milestones so that they can accurately assess the infant's development as well as provide age-appropriate anticipatory guidance to the parents. Achievement of developmental milestones may be assessed in a variety of ways. While obtaining the health history, the nurse may ask the parent or caregiver if the skill is present and when it was attained. The infant may also demonstrate the skill during the interview or examination, or the nurse may elicit the skill from the infant. A number of screening tools are also used to assess development, such as the Denver II Developmental Screening Test (see Appendix B ), Prescreening Developmental Questionnaire (PDQ II), Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ), Infant Toddler Checklist for Language and Communication, and Infant Development Inventory. Ill or premature infants may exhibit delayed acquisition of physical growth and developmental skills. When assessing the growth and development of a premature infant, use the infant's adjusted age to determine expected outcomes. To determine adjusted age, subtract the number of weeks that the infant was premature from the infant's chronological age. Plot growth parameters and assess developmental milestones based on adjusted age. For example, a 6-month-old boy who was born at 28 weeks' gestation was born 12 weeks early (3 months), so subtract 3 months from his chronological age of 6 months to obtain an adjusted age of 3 months. This infant would demonstrate healthy growth if he were the size of a 3-month-old, and he should be expected to achieve the developmental milestones of a 3-month-old rather than a 6-month-old. Physical Growth Ongoing assessments of growth are important so that too-rapid or inadequate growth can be identified early. With early identification, the cause can be diagnosed and the potential for further appropriate growth maximized. Infants grow very rapidly over the first 12 months of life. Weight, length, and head and chest circumference are all indicators of physical growth in the newborn and infant ( Table 3.1 ). Weight The average newborn weighs 7 lb 8 oz (3,400 g) at birth. Newborns lose up to 10% of their body weight over the first 5 days of life. The average newborn then gains about 20 to 30 g per day and regains his or her birthweight by 10 to 14 days of age. Most infants double their birthweight by 4 to 6 months of age and triple their birthweight by the time they are 1 year old (Hagan, Shaw, & Duncan, 2008). Height The average newborn is 19 to 21 inches (48 to 53 cm) long at birth. During the first 6 months, length increases by 1 inch (2.5 cm) per month, then by about a half-inch per month in the second 6 months (Hagan et al., 2008). Head and Chest Circumference Average head circumference of the full-term newborn is 13 to 14 inches (33 to 35 cm). The head circumference is about 1 inch (2 to3 cm) greater than the chest circumference, which averages 12 to 13 inches (30.5 to 33 cm). The head circumference increases rapidly during the first 6 months: the average increase is about 0.6 inch (1.5 cm) per month. From 6 to 12 months of age, the head circumference increases an average of 0.2 inch (0.5 cm) monthly. The chest circumference is not routinely measured after the newborn period but does increase in size as the child grows (Hagan et al., 2008). Organ System Maturation The newborn and infant's organ systems undergo significant changes as the infant grows. Systems that undergo significant change include the neurologic system, the cardiovascular system, the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal (digestive) system, the renal system, the hematopoietic system, the immunologic system, and the integumentary system. Neurologic System The infant experiences tremendous changes in the neurologic system over the first year of life. Critical brain growth and continued myelinization of the spinal cord are occurring. Involuntary movement progresses to voluntary control, and immature vocalizations and crying progress to the ability to speak as a result of maturational changes of the neurologic system. States of Consciousness The normal term newborn's ability to move sequentially through states of consciousness reassures parents and physicians that the neurologic system, though immature, is intact. A normal newborn will ordinarily move through six states of consciousness: 1. Deep sleep: The infant lies quietly without movement. 2. Light sleep: The infant may move a little while sleeping and may startle to noises. 3. Drowsiness: Eyes may close; the infant may be dozing. 4. Quiet alert state: The infant's eyes are open wide and the body is calm. 5. Active alert state: The infant's face and body move actively. 6. Crying: The infant cries or screams and the body moves in a disorganized fashion (Brazelton & Nugent, 1995, p. 15 ). Newborns usually progress through these states slowly, rather than going from deep sleep immediately into outright crying. Brain Growth The nervous system continues to mature throughout infancy, and the increase in head circumference is indicative of brain growth. The brain undergoes tremendous growth during the first 2 years of life. By 6 months of age the infant's brain weighs half that of the adult brain. At age 12 months, the brain has grown considerably, weighing 2\u00bd times what it did at birth. Usually, the anterior fontanel remains open until 12 to 18 months of age to accommodate this rapid brain growth. However, the fontanel may close as early as 9 months of age, and this is not of concern in the infant with age-appropriate growth and development. In general, the neurologic system matures a significant amount over the first year of life. Myelination of the spinal cord and nerves continues over the first 2 years. Maturation of the nervous system and continued myelination are necessary for the tremendous developmental skills that are achieved in the first 12 months. During the first few months of life, reflexive behavior is replaced with purposeful action. Reflexes Primitive reflexes are subcortical and involve a whole-body response. Selected primitive reflexes present at birth include Moro, root, suck, asymmetric tonic neck, plantar and palmar grasp, step, and Babinski. Except for the Babinski, which disappears around 1 year of age, these primitive reflexes diminish over the first few months of life, giving way to protective reflexes. Protective reflexes (also termed postural responses or reflexes) are gross motor responses related to maintenance of equilibrium. These responses are prerequisites for appropriate motor development and remain throughout life once they are established. The protective reflexes include the righting and parachute reactions. Appropriate presence and disappearance of primitive reflexes, as well as development of protective reflexes, are indicative of a healthy neurologic system. Persistence of primitive reflexes beyond the usual age of disappearance may indicate an abnormality of the neurologic system and should be investigated. Table 3.2 gives descriptions and illustrations of several primitive and protective reflexes, as well as the timing of appearance and disappearance of these reflexes.Respiratory System The respiratory system continues to mature over the first year of life. The respiratory rate slows from an average of 30 to 60 breaths in the newborn to about 20 to 30 in the 12-month-old. The newborn breathes irregularly, with periodic pauses. As the infant matures, the respiratory pattern becomes more regular and rhythmic. In comparison with the adult, in the infant: The nasal passages are narrower. The trachea and chest wall are more compliant. The bronchi and bronchioles are shorter and narrower. The larynx is more funnel shaped. The tongue is larger. There are significantly fewer alveoli. These anatomic differences place the infant at higher risk for respiratory compromise. The respiratory system does not reach adult levels of maturity until about 7 years of age. The lack of immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the mucosal lining of the upper respiratory tract also contributes to the frequent infections that occur in infancy. Cardiovascular System The heart doubles in size over the first year of life. As the cardiovascular system matures, the average pulse rate decreases from 120 to 140 in the newborn to about 100 in the 1-year-old. Blood pressure steadily increases over the first 12 months of life, from an average of 60/40 in the newborn to 100/50 in the 12-month-old. The peripheral capillaries are closer to the surface of the skin, thus making the newborn and young infant more susceptible to heat loss. Over the first year of life, thermoregulation (the body's ability to stabilize body temperature) becomes more effective: the peripheral capillaries constrict in response to a cold environment and dilate in response to heat. Gastrointestinal System Teeth Occasionally, an infant is born with one or more teeth (termed natal teeth) or develops teeth in the first 28 days of life (termed neonatal teeth). The presence of natal or neonatal teeth may be associated with other birth anomalies. The vast majority of newborns do not have teeth at birth, nor do they develop them in the first month of life. On average, the first primary teeth begin to erupt between the ages of 6 and 8 months. The primary teeth (also termed deciduous teeth) are lost later in childhood and will be replaced by the permanent teeth. The gums around the emerging tooth often swell. The lower central incisors are usually the first to appear, followed by the upper central incisors ( Fig. 3.1 ). The average 12-month-old has four to eight teeth. Digestion The newborn's digestive system is not developed fully. Small amounts of saliva are present for the first 3 months of life and ptyalin is present only in small amounts in the saliva. Gastric digestion occurs as a result of the presence of hydrochloric acid and rennin. The small intestine is about 270 cm long and grows to the adult length over the first few years of life (Wyllie, 2007). The stomach capacity is relatively small at birth, holding about one-half to 1 ounce. However, by 1 year of age the stomach can accommodate three full meals and several snacks per day. In the duodenum, three enzymes in particular are important for digestion. Trypsin is available in sufficient quantities for protein digestion after birth. Amylase (needed for complex carbohydrate digestion) and lipase (essential for appropriate fat digestion) are both deficient in the infant and do not reach adult levels until about 5 months of age.FIGURE 3.1 Sequence and average age of tooth eruption. The liver is also immature at birth. The ability to conjugate bilirubin and secrete bile is present after about 2 weeks of age. Conjugation of medications may remain immature over the first year of life. Other functions of the liver, including gluconeogenesis, vitamin storage, and protein metabolism, remain immature during the first year of life. Stools The consistency and frequency of stools change over the first year of life. The newborn's first stools (meconium) are the result of digestion of amniotic fluid swallowed in utero. They are dark green to black and sticky ( Fig. 3.2 ). In the first few days of life the stools become yellowish or tan. Generally the formula-fed infant has stools the consistency of peanut butter. Breastfed infants' stools are usually looser in texture and appear seedy. Newborns may have as many as 8 to 10 stools per day or as few as one stool every day or two. After the newborn period, the number of stools may decrease, and some infants do not have a bowel movement for several days. Infrequent stooling is considered normal if the bowel movement remains soft. Due to the immaturity of the gastrointestinal system, newborns and young infants often grunt, strain, or cry while attempting to have a bowel movement. This is not of concern unless the stool is hard and dry. Stool color and texture may change depending on the foods that the infant is ingesting. Iron supplements may cause the stool to appear black or very dark green (National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners [NAPNAP], 2011b). Take Note! Parents should call the primary care provider if the infant's stools are red, white, or black; mucuslike; frequent and watery; frothy or foul-smelling; or hard, dry, formed, or pelletlike; or if the baby is vomiting.FIGURE 3.2 A . Meconium stool. B . Typical stool after the first few days. Note the yellowish, seedy stool of a breastfed infant. Genitourinary System In the infant, extracellular fluid (lymph, interstitial fluid, and blood plasma) accounts for about 35% of body weight and intracellular fluid accounts for 40%, compared with the adult quantities of 20% and 40%, respectively (Greenbaum, 2007). Thus, the infant is more susceptible to dehydration. Infants urinate frequently and the urine has a relatively low specific gravity. The renal structures are immature and the glomerular filtration rate, tubular secretion, and reabsorption as well as renal perfusion are all reduced compared with the adult. The glomeruli reach full maturity by 2 years of age. Integumentary System In utero the infant is covered with vernix caseosa, which protects the developing infant's skin. At birth, the infant may be covered with vernix (earlier gestational age) or vernix may be found in the folds of the skin, axilla, and groin areas (later gestational age). Production of vernix ceases at birth. Fine downy hair (lanugo) covers the body of many newborns. Often this hair is lost over time and is not replaced. Darker-skinned races tend to have more lanugo present at birth than those with light skin. Acrocyanosis (blueness of the hands and feet) is normal in the newborn; it decreases over the first few days of life ( Fig. 3.3 ). Newborns often experience mottling of the skin (a pink-and-white marbled appearance) because of their immature circulatory system. Mottling decreases over the first few months of life. The newborn and young infant's skin is relatively thinner than that of the adult, with the peripheral capillaries being closer to the surface. This may cause increased absorption of topical medications. Hematopoietic System Significant changes in the hematopoietic system occur over the first year of life. At birth, fetal hemoglobin (HgbF) is present in large amounts. After birth the production of fetal hemoglobin nearly ceases, and adult hemoglobin (HgbA) is produced in steadily increasing amounts throughout the first 6 months. Since HgbF has a shorter lifespan than HgbA, infants may experience physiologic anemia at age 2 to 3 months (Glader, 2007). During the last 3 months of gestation, maternal iron stores are transferred to the fetus. The newborn typically has 0.3 to 0.5 g of iron stores available. As the high hemoglobin concentration of the newborn decreases over the first 2 to 3 months, iron is reclaimed and stored. These stores may be sufficient for the first 6 to 9 months of life but will become depleted if iron supplementation does not occur. Ongoing iron intake is required throughout the first 15 years of life in order to reachadult levels (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2010e). Take Note! Maternal iron stores are transferred to the fetus throughout the last trimester of pregnancy. Infants born prematurely miss all or at least a portion of this iron store transfer, placing them at increased risk for iron deficiency anemia compared with term infants. FIGURE 3.3 A . Acrocyanosis. Note blueness of the hands. B . Mottling of the skin in a young infant. Immunologic System Newborns receive large amounts of IgG through the placenta from their mothers. This confers immunity during the first 3 to 6 months of life for antigens to which the mother was previously exposed. Infants then synthesize their own IgG, reaching approximately 60% of adult levels at age 12 months (Feigin, Cherry, Kaplan, & Demmler-Harrison, 2009). IgM is produced in significant amounts after birth, reaching adult levels by 9 months of age. IgA, IgD, and IgE production increases very gradually, maturing in early childhood (Feigin et al., 2009). Psychosocial Development Erik Erikson (1963) identifies the psychosocial crisis of infancy as Trust versus Mistrust. Development of a sense of trust is crucial in the first year, as it serves as the foundation for later psychosocial tasks. The parent or primary caregiver can have a significant impact on the infant's development of a sense of trust. When the infant's needs are consistently met, the infant develops this sense of trust. But if the parent or caregiver is inconsistent in meeting the infant's needs in a timely manner, then the infant develops a sense ofmistrust. Table 3.3 lists activities that promote a sense of trust in infancy. Cognitive Development The first stage of Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development is referred to as the sensorimotor stage (birth to 2 years) (Piaget, 1969). Infants learn about themselves and the world through their developing sensory and motor capacities. Infants' development from birth to 1 year of age can be divided into four substages within the sensorimotor stage: reflexes, primary circular reaction, secondary circular reaction, and coordination of secondary schemes. Cause and effect guides most of the cognitive development seen in infancy (see Table 3.3 ). The concept of object per manence begins to develop between 4 and 7 months of age and is solidified by about 8 months of age (Piaget, 1969). If an object is hidden from the infant's sight, he or she will search for it in the last place it was seen, knowing it still exists. This development of object permanence is essential for the development of self-image. By age 12 months the infant knows he or she is separate from the parent or caregiver. Self-image is also promoted through the use of mirrors. By 12 months of age, infants can recognize themselves in the mirror. The 12-month-old will explore objects in different ways, such as throwing, banging, dropping, and shaking. He or she may imitate gestures and knows how to use certain objects correctly (e.g., puts phone to ear, turns up cup to drink, attempts to comb hair) (Piaget, 1969). Motor Skill Development Infants exhibit phenomenal increases in their gross and fine motor skills over the first 12 months of life. Gross Motor Skills The term \"gross motor skills\" refers to those that use the large muscles (e.g., head control, rolling, sitting, and walking). Gross motor skills develop in a cephalocaudal fashion (from the head to the tail) ( Fig. 3.4 ). In other words, the baby learns to lift the head before learning to roll over and sit (Goldson & Reynolds, 2011). At birth, babies have poor head control and need to have their necks supported when being held. They can lift their heads only slightly while in a prone position. Over the next several months the infant's motor skills progress at a dramatic rate. First the infant achieves head control, then the ability to roll over, sit, crawl, pull to stand, and, usually around 1 year of age, walk independently. Table 3.4 gives details on when the infant develops each specific gross motor skill. Progression of gross motor skills is illustrated in Figures 3.5 through 3.7 . FIGURE 3.4 Gross motor skills develop in a cephalocaudal direction, fine motor skills in a proximodistal fashion. Take Note! Warning signs that may indicate problems with motor development include the following: arms and legs are stiff or floppy; child cannot support head at 3 to 4 months of age; child reaches with one hand only; child cannot sit with assistance at 6 months of age; child does not crawl by 12 months of age; child cannot stand supported by 12 months of age. Fine Motor Skills Fine motor development includes the maturation of hand and finger use. Fine motor skills develop in a proximodistal fashion (from the center to the periphery) (see Fig. 3.4 ). In other words, the infant first bats with the whole hand, eventually progressing to gross grasping, before being capable of fine fingertip grasping (Goldson & Reynolds, 2011) ( Fig. 3.8 ). The newborn's hand movements are involuntary in nature, whereas the 12-month-old is capable of feeding himself or herself with a cup and spoon. By 12 months of age the infant should be able to eat with his or her fingers and assist with dressing (e.g., pushing an arm through the sleeve). Table 3.5 gives details on when the infant develops each specific fine motor skill.Sensory Development Though hearing should be fully developed at birth, the other senses continue to develop as the infant matures. Though they mature at different rates, sight, smell, taste, and touch all continue to develop after birth. Sight The newborn is nearsighted, preferring to view objects at a distance of 8 to 15 inches. Newborns prefer the human face to other objects and may even imitate the facial expressions made by those caring for them. In addition to human faces, newborns show a preference for certain objects, particularly those with contrasts such as black-and-white stripes. The newborn's eyes wander and occasionally cross. At 1 month of age the infant can recognize by sight the people he or she knows best. The infant will study objects within his or her visual range closely. The ability to fuse two ocular images into one cerebral picture ( binocularity ) begins to develop at 6 weeks of age and is well established by 4 months of age. Full color vision develops by 7 months of age, as do distance vision and the ability to track objects. Hearing The newborn's hearing is intact at birth and as acute as that of an adult. Newborns prefer the sound of human voices to nonhuman sounds. By 1 month of age the infant can recognize the sounds of those he or she knows best.FIGURE 3.5 When pulled to sit, an infant shows ( A ) significant head lag (newborn; 2 or 3 weeks old), ( B ) improving head control (2 months old), and ( C ) no head lag (4 months old). Smell and Taste The sense of smell develops rapidly: the 7-day-old infant can differentiate the smell of his or her mother's breast milk from that of another woman and will preferentially turn toward the mother's smell. Newborns prefer sweet tastes to all others. This persists for several months, and eventually the infant will accept nonsweet flavors. Touch The sense of touch is perhaps the most important of all the senses for newborn communication. Even the most immature infant responds to soothing stroking. The infant prefers soft sensations to coarse sensations. The infant dislikes rough handling and may cry. Holding, stroking, rocking, or cuddling calms infants when they are upset and makes them more alert when they are drowsy. Infants learn to understand their caregiver's moods by the way they touch them. Take Note! Warning signs that may indicate problems with sensory development include the following: young infant does not respond to loud noises; child does not focus on a near object; infant does not start to make sounds or babble by 4 months of age; infant does not turn to locate sound at age 4 months; infant crosses eyes most of the time at age 6 months. Communication and Language Development For several months, crying is the only means of communication for the newborn and infant. The basic reason for crying is unmet needs. The 1- to 3-month-old baby coos, makes other vocalizations, and demonstrates differentiated crying. At 4 to 5 months of age, the infant makes simple vowel sounds, laughs aloud, performs \"raspberries,\" and vocalizes in response to voices. The infant also responds to his or her own name and begins to respond to \"no.\" Between 4 and 7 months the infant begins to distinguish emotions based on tone of voice. Squealing and yelling begin around 6 months of age; these may be used to express joy or displeasure. At age 7 to 10 months, babbling begins and progresses to strings (e.g., mamama, dadada) without meaning. The infant at this age is also able to respond to simple commands. At 9 to 12 months of age the infant begins to attach meaning to \"mama\" and \"dada\" and starts to imitate other speech sounds. The average 12-month-old uses two or three recognizable words with meaning, recognizes objects by name, and starts to imitate animal sounds. At this age, the infant pays increasing attention to speech and tries to imitate words; he orshe may also say \"uh-oh.\" The 12-month-old also babbles with inflection (this babbling has the rhythm and timing of spoken language, but few of the \"words\" make sense) (Feigelman, 2007; Goldson & Reynolds, 2011). FIGURE 3.6 Development of sitting. A . At 4 months, the infant requires significant support. B . The 6-month-old infant sits in tripod fashion. C . The 8-month-old sits alone. It is very important for the parent or caregiver to talk to the infant in order for the infant to learn communication skills. Sometimes regression in language development occurs briefly when the child is focusing energy on other skills, such as crawling or walking. As long as the infant's hearing is normal, language acquisition should continue to progress. Infants in bilingual families may \"language mix\" (uses some words from each language). This is considered to be a normal progression in language development for these children, but it makes it more difficult for the physician or nurse practitioner to determine delays in communication skills (Abell & Ey, 2007).FIGURE 3.7 Development of locomotion. A . At 4 months the infant pushes up from a prone position. B . At 8 months, the infant crawls with the abdomen off the floor. C . The infant pulls to stand by 10 months of age. D . The infant cruises along furniture or ( E ) takes steps with assistance at 10 to 11 months of age. F . The infant independently stands from a crouched position and walks around 12 months of age (plus or minus 3 months). FIGURE 3.8 Development of the pincer grasp. Note the gross (whole-hand) approach to grasping a small object ( A ), compared with the fine (thumb-to-finger) ability ( B ). Take Note! Warning signs that may indicate problems in language development are as follows: infant does not make sounds at 4 months of age; infant does not laugh or squeal by 6 months of age; infant does not babble by 8 months of age; infant does not use single words with meaning at 12 months of age (mama, dada).Social and Emotional Development The newborn spends much of the time sleeping, but by 2 months of age the infant is ready to start socializing. The infant exhibits a first real smile at age 2 months. He or she spends a great deal of time while awake watching and observing what is going on around him or her. By about 3 months of age the infant will start an interaction with a caregiver by smiling widely and possibly gurgling. This prompts the caregiver to smile back and talk to the infant. The infant responds with more smiling, cooing, and gurgles as well as moving the arms and legs. The 3- to 4-month-old will also mimic the parent's facial movements, such as widening the eyes and sticking out the tongue. The baby may hesitate at first, but once the other person responds pleasantly to the infant, the infant engages and gets into the interaction. The infant may cry when the pleasant interaction stops. At 6 to 8 months of age the infant may enjoy socially interactive games such as patty-cake and peek-a-boo (Feigelman, 2007; Goldson & Reynolds, 2011). Stranger Anxiety Around the age of 8 months the infant may develop stranger anxiety . The previously happy and very friendly infant may become clingy and whiny when approached by strangers or people not well known. Stranger anxiety is an indicator that the infant is recognizing himself or herself as separate from others. As the infant becomes more aware of new people and new places, he or she may view an interaction with a stranger as threatening and may start crying, even if the parent is right there. Family members whom the child sees infrequently, as well as others the child does not spend a lot of time with, should approach the infant calmly and slowly, with the parent in sight. Sometimes this will prevent a sudden crying spell (Feigelman, 2007; Goldson & Reynolds, 2011). Separation Anxiety Separation anxiety may also start in the last few months of infancy. The infant becomes quite distressed when the parent leaves. The infant will eventually calm down and become engaged with the current caregiver. It is not until the infant is older that cognition and memory are sufficient for him or her to understand that the parent will come back (Feigelman, 2007; Goldson & Reynolds, 2011). Take Note! Warning signs of possible problems with social/emotional development include the following: child does not smile at people at 3 months of age; child refuses to cuddle;child does not seem to enjoy people; child shows no interest in peek-a-boo at 8 months of age. Temperament Temperament is an individual's nature; it is referred to as the \"how\" of behavior (Child Development Institute, 2010). Temperament ranges from low or moderately active, regular, and predictable to highly active, more intense, and less adaptable. These are all considered normal along a continuum. An infant's innate temperament affects the way he or she responds to the environment. As parents take note of their infant's usual activity level, how intensely he or she reacts with others and the environment, and how stimulated he or she becomes with interactions, they start to learn about their infant's temperament. The parent should note how adaptable and flexible the infant is as well as how predictable and persistent the baby is. When parents are familiar with how the baby approaches life on a routine basis, they will be better able to recognize when the baby is not acting like himself or herself. Nurses can help parents interpret observations about their infant's temperament and recommend ways to support the infant's individual behavior. Some infants are slower to warm up than others; those infants should be approached slowly and calmly. Some infants exhibit increased levels of activity compared to quieter, more passive babies; those infants generally require more direct play with the parent or caregiver and will be the type of older infant who is in constant motion. Some infants are loud and some are not. The quiet infant may become overwhelmed with excessive stimulation, whereas the very active baby may need additional stimulation to be satisfied (Child Development Institute, 2010). Becoming familiar with the infant's temperament also helps the parents describe the best approach to the infant by others (e.g., child care workers or health care professionals). Cultural Influences on Growth and Development Many cultural differences have an impact on growth and development. For instance, certain ethnic groups tend to be shorter than others because of their genetic makeup (Ferry, 2010). These children will not grow to be as tall as those of another ethnic background. Cultural feeding practices in some cultures may lead to overweight in some children. Some cultures and certain religions advocate vegetarianism; those children need nutritional assessment to ensure they are getting enough protein intake for adequate growth. Parenting styles and health promotion behaviors can also be significantly influenced by culture. Parents and extended family are the most significant influences in an infant's life in most cultures. Certain cultures place a high value on independence and may encourage their infants to develop quickly, while other cultures \"baby\" their infants for longer periods. In most cultures the mother takes primary responsibility for caring for the child, but in some cultures, major health-related decisions may be deferred to the father or grandparents. Health beliefs are often strongly influenced by an individual's religious or spiritual background. Sometimes this creates conflict in the health care setting when the health providers have a different value system than that of the infant's family. In some cultures infants and children share a bed with their parents. When an infant or child is hospitalized and is accustomed to sleeping with the parents, it may be difficult and distressing for him or her to try to sleep alone. The nurse should explore the family's cultural practices related to growth and development. Usually these practices are not harmful and can be supported by the health care team, but safety must always be considered. The nurse should not make assumptions about a family's cultural practices based on their skin color, accent, or name; rather, the nurse should perform an adequate assessment (Leininger & MacFarland, 2006). Take Hotel Many communities now include people from a variety of cultures, so it is important for nurses to practice transcultural nursing (nursing care that is directed by cultural aspects and that respects the individual's differences). Many nurse researchers are exploring the cultural aspects of health care and the impact that cultural diversity has upon health. Refer back to Allison Johnson, who was introduced at the beginning of the chapter. What developmental milestones would you expect Allison to have reached by this age? How would this be different if Allison had been born 6 weeks premature?THE NURSE'S ROLE IN NEWBORN AND INFANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT Growth and development affect every aspect of the infant's life. As infants progress through various stages of development, they do so in a predictable fashion. Growth and development are sequential and orderly, though some children develop at faster rates than others. It is important for the nurse to understand growth and development. Health care visits through infancy often focus primarily on anticipatory guidance (educating parents and caregivers about what to expect in the next phase of development). The purpose of anticipatory guidance is to give parents the tools they need to support their infant's development in a safe fashion. Hospital nurses also need to use their knowledge of growth and development when caring for ill infants. Hospitalization often requires the infant to be confined to the crib or the hospital room. Nurses must support growth and development within the constraints imposed by the child's illness. NURSING PROCESS OVERVIEW After the infant's current growth and development status has been assessed, problems related to growth and development may be identified. The nurse may then identify one or more nursing diagnoses, including: Ineffective breastfeeding Risk for disproportionate growth Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements Risk for impaired parent/infant attachment Delayed growth and development Risk for caregiver role strain Nursing care planning for the infant with growth and development issues should be individualized based on the infant's and family's needs. Nursing Care Plan 3.1 (p. 82) can be used as a guide in planning nursing care for the infant with a growth and development problem. The nurse may choose the appropriate nursing diagnoses from the plan and individualize them as needed. The nursing care plan is intended to serve as a guide, not as an all-inclusive growth and development care plan. Promoting Healthy Growth and Development Adding a new person to the family produces both excitement and anxiety. Newborns are completely reliant upon their parents or caregivers to fill every need. It is quite a burden and precious responsibility that new parents are taking on. Many parents read the latest books about caring for newborns, while others rely on information received from family and friends. Newborns and their mothers spend only a short time in the hospital after delivery, so it is very important that parents can care for their newborn and know when to call the primary care provider with concerns. Periodic screening for adequate growth and development is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) for all infants and children. The prevention of devastating disease is another priority for infants and children. The AAP and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) have made recommendations for immunization schedules. Immunizations are a very important part of the newborn and infant's health visits. Nurses caring for newborns and infants should be familiar with the recommended infant/child periodic screenings (check-ups) as well as the current immunization schedule (see Chapter 9 for further information on immunizations). NURSING CARE PLAN 3.1 Growth and Development Issues in the Newborn and Infant NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Breastfeeding, ineffective, related to lack of exposure, misconceptions, or knowledge deficit as evidenced by first baby, mother's verbalization, or nursing observations Outcome Identification and Evaluation Mother/infant dyad will experience successful breastfeeding: infant will latch on, suck and swallow at the breast; mother will not experience sore nipples. Interventions: Promoting Effective Breastfeeding Educate mother on recognition of and response to infant hunger cues to promote on-cue breastfeeding, which will establish milk supply. Educate mother on appropriate diet and fluid intake to ensure ability to manufacture adequate supply of breast milk. Demonstrate breastfeeding positions with infant at the breast ( appropriate positioning increases probability of successful latch) . Assess infant's latch technique, sucking motion, and audible swallowing (an appropriately latched infant will take most of the areola in the mouth, suck in spurts, and demonstrate audible swallowing) . Assess infant voiding/stool patterns: at least six voids per day and passage of stool ranging from one or more per day to one every several days is a normalpattern for breastfed infants. Assess infant weight gain: gain of 15 to 30 gper day after the second week of life indicates infant is receiving appropriate nutrition. Assess mother's nipples for redness or soreness; if infant appropriately latches on, nipples will not become sore. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for altered growth pattern (risk factors: caregiver knowledge deficit, first infant, premature infant, or maladaptive feeding behaviors) Outcome Identification and Evaluation Infant will demonstrate adequate growth and appropriate feeding behaviors: steady increases in weight, length, and head circumference; infant feeds appropriately for age. Interventions: Promoting Adequate Growth Observe mother/infant dyad breastfeeding or bottle-feeding to determine need for further education or identify infant difficulties with feeding. Educate mother about appropriate breastfeeding or bottle-feeding so that mother is aware of what to expect in normal feeding pattern. When infant is old enough, provide education about addition of solid foods, spoon and cup feeding: after 6 months of age breast milk or formula needs to be supplemented with a variety of foods. Determine need for additional caloric intake if necessary (premature infants and infants with chronic illnesses or metabolic disorders often need adjustments in caloric intake to demonstrate adequate or catch-up growth). Obtain daily weights if hospitalized (weekly if outpatient) and weekly length and head circumference to determine whether feeding pattern is sufficient to promote adequate growth. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Nutrition, altered, less than body requirements, related to possible ineffective feeding pattern or inadequate caloric intake as evidenced by failure to gain weight or by inadequate increases in weight, length, and head circumference over time Outcome Identification and Evaluation Infant will take in adequate nutrients using effective feeding pattern: infant will demonstrate adequate weight gain (15 to 30 gper day) and steady increases in length and head circumference. Interventions: Promoting Adequate Nutritional Intake Assess current feeding pattern and daily intake to determine areas of concern. Increase frequency of breastfeeding or volume of bottle-feeding if needed to meet caloric needs. Introduce solid foods on age-appropriate schedule: introducing solids at the right time improves the chances that the child will learn to take solid foods. Limit juice intake or discontinue altogether (juice has little nutritive value and displaces nutrients from breast milk or formula). Use human milk fortifier (if ordered) to increase caloric density of breast milk. Increase caloric density of formula (if ordered) by mixing to a more concentrated level or with additives (fats or carbohydrates) to provide increased calories needed to support adequate growth. If infant is taking solids already, choose higher-calorie foods to maximize nutrient intake. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Parent/infant attachment, altered, risk for (risk factors: premature infant, parental knowledge deficit about normal newborn activity and care, infant with difficult temperament or medical problems) Outcome Identification and Evaluation Parent and infant will demonstrate appropriate attachment via eye contact, parental response to infant cues, parental verbalization of caring for infant, infant response to parent's caretaking behaviors. Interventions: Encouraging Appropriate Parent-Infant Attachment Assess parent's response to infant cues to determine degree of attachment and level of parent's knowledge about infant care. Assess infant's response to parent's caretaking behaviors to determine degree of attachment. Determine infant's temperament to counsel parent effectively about responses appropriate for that type of temperament. Encourage en face positioning for holding or feeding the young infant to encourage give-and-take response between infant and parent. Encourage parent to meet infant's needs promptly and with affection to promote sense of trust in the infant. Reinforce parent's attempts at improving attachment with infant (positive reinforcement naturally encourages appropriate behaviors). NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Growth and development, altered, related to speech, motor, psychosocial, or cognitive concerns as evidenced by delay in meeting expected milestones Outcome Identification and Evaluation Development will be maximized: infant will make continued progress toward attainment of developmental milestones. Interventions: Maximizing Development Perform developmental evaluation of the infant to determine infant's current level of functioning. Offer age-appropriate play, activities, and toys to encourage further development. Carry out interventions as prescribed by developmental specialist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, or speech therapist ( repeated exposure to the activities or exercises is needed to make developmental progress) . Provide support to parents of infants with developmental concerns, as developmental progress can be slow and it is difficult for families to stay motivated and maintain hope. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Caregiver role strain, risk for (risk factors: first baby, knowledge deficit about infant care, lack of prior exposure, fatigue if premature, ill, or developmentally delayed infant) Outcome Identification and EvaluationParent will experience competence in role: will demonstrate appropriate caretaking behaviors and verbalize comfort in new role. Interventions: Preventing Caregiver Role Strain Assess parent's knowledge of newborn/infant care and the issues that arise as a part of normal development to determine parent's needs. Provide education on normal newborn/infant care so that parents have the knowledge they need to appropriately care for their new baby. Provide anticipatory guidance related to normal infant development to prepare parents for what to expect next and how to intervene. Encourage respite for parents ( even a few hours away from the demands of an infant's care can rejuvenate the parents). NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Injury, risk for (risk factors: developmental age, infant curiosity, rapidly progressing motor abilities) Outcome Identification and Evaluation Infant safety will be maintained: infant will remain free from injury. Interventions: Preventing Injury Encourage car seat safety to decrease risk of injury related to motor vehicles. Childproof home: as infant becomes more mobile, he or she will want to explore everything, increasing risk of injury. Parents should have the Poison Control Center phone number available: should an accidental ingestion occur, Poison Control can give parents the best advice for appropriate intervention. Never leave an infant unattended in the sink, bathtub, or swimming pool to prevent drowning. Teach parents first aid measures and infant CPR to minimize consequences of injury should it occur. Parents should watch the infant at all times ( no amount of childproofing can replace the watchful eye of a caring parent) . Promoting Growth and Development Through Play Experts in child development and behavior have said repeatedly that play is the work of children. Infants practice their gross and fine motor skills and language through play (Goldson & Reynolds, 2011). Play is a natural way for infants and children to learn. Play is critical to infant development, as it gives infants the opportunity to explore their environment, practice new skills, and solve problems. The newborn prefers interacting with the parent to toys. Parents can talk to and sing to their newborns while participating in the daily activities that infants need, such as feeding, bathing, and changing diapers. Newborns and young infants love to watch people's faces and often appear to mimic the expressions they see. As infants become older, toys may be geared toward the motor skills or language skills that the child is developing. Parents can promote fine motor development in infants by providing age-appropriate toys. For example, a rattle that a young infant can hold promotes reaching and attaining. The older infant builds fine motor skills by stacking cups or placing smaller toys inside of larger ones. Gross motor skills are reinforced and practiced over and over again when the infant wants to reach something he or she is interested in. When playing with toys, the infant usually engages in solitary play; he or she does not share with other infants or directly play with other infants (Feigelman, 2007; Goldson & Reynolds, 2011). A wide variety of toys are available for infants, but infants often enjoy the most basic ones, such as plastic containers of various shapes and sizes, soft balls, and wooden or plastic spoons. Books are also very important toys for infants. Reading to all ages of infants is appropriate, and the older infant develops fine motor skills by learning to turn book pages. Table 3.6 lists age-appropriate toys. Promoting Early Learning Research has shown that reading aloud and sharing books during early infancy are critical to the development of neural networks that are important in the later tasks of reading and word recognition. Reading books increases listening comprehension. Infants demonstrate their excitement about picture books by kicking and waving their arms and babbling when looking at them. At 6 to 12 months, the infant reaches for books and brings them to the mouth. Over time, reading leads to acquisition of language skills. Reading picture books and simple stories to infants starts a good habit that should be continued throughout childhood (Zuckerman, 2009). Promoting Safety Hundreds of children younger than 1 year of age die each year as a result of injury (AAP, 2010c). As infants become more mobile, they risk injury from falls down stairs and off chairs, tables, and other structures. Curiosity leads the infant to explore potentially dangerous items, such as electrical outlets, hot stove or furnace vents, mop buckets, and toilets. Since infants explore so much with their mouths, small objects or hard foods pose a choking hazard. The infant will invariably pick up any accessible object and bring it to the mouth. With increasing dexterity, poisoning from medications, household cleaning products, or other substances also becomes a problem.Safety in the Car Motor vehicle accidents are one source of injury, particularly if the infant is improperly restrained. Infants should never be transported in a motor vehicle without proper restraint. Infant car seats should face the rear of the car until the infant is 12 months of age and weighs 20 pounds (AAP, 2010a). The car seat should be secured tightly in the center of the back seat. The infant should never be placed in a front seat that is equipped with an airbag. Infants should never be left unattended in a motor vehicle. The temperature rises very quickly inside a closed vehicle, and an infant can suffocate from heat in a closed vehicle in the summer. Even during cooler weather, the heat generated within a closed vehicle can reach three to five times the exterior temperature. Kidnapping is also a concern if the baby is left unattended in a vehicle. Additional information on car safety can be found on at http://thePoint.lww.com/Kyle2e . Safety in the Home The baby's crib should have a firm mattress that fits snugly in the crib on a secure support. The distance between crib slats should be 2 3/8 inches or less to prevent injury (Safe Kids Worldwide, 2009). All crib edges should be smooth. Only well-fitting crib sheets should be used, not sheets intended for large beds. Crib side rails should always be raised when the parent is not right next to the crib. Additional information about crib and playpen safety can be found on at http://thePoint.lww.com/Kyle2e . Even before the infant can roll over, he or she wiggles and pushes with the feet. The infant can easily fall from a changing table, sofa, or crib with the side rails down, so the infant should never be left unattended on any surface. If infant seats, bouncy seats, or swings are used, the infant should always be restrained in the seat with the appropriate straps. The AAP (2010b) does not recommend the use of infant walkers, because the walker may tip over and the baby may fall out of it or the infant may fall down the stairs in it. Walkers allow infants access to things they may not otherwise be capable of reaching until they are able to walk alone, such as hot stoves and items on the edge of the countertop. As the infant becomes more mobile, learning to crawl and walk, new safety issues arise. Safety gates should be used at the tops and bottoms of stairways. Gates may also be used to block curious infants from rooms that may pose physical danger to thembecause of sharp-edged furniture or decorative objects. Electrical outlets should be covered with approved safety covers. Cabinets and drawers should be secured with child safety latches. Medications, household cleaning supplies, and other potentially hazardous substances should be stored completely out of reach of infants (AAP, 2010c). Choking is a risk because infants immediately bring small items to the mouth for exploration. To avoid choking, recommend the following to parents: Use only toys recommended for children 0 to 12 months of age. Avoid stuffed animals with eyes or buttons that can be dislodged by the persistent infant. Keep the floor free of small items (accidentally dropped coins, paper clips, straight pins). Avoid feeding popcorn, nuts, carrot slices, grapes, and hot dog pieces to infants. Suffocation is also a risk for infants. Cribs should not have pillows, comforters, stuffed animals, or other soft items in them. Keep plastic bags of any size away from infants. Avoid the risk of strangulation by keeping window blind and drapery cords out of the infant's reach (AAP, 2010b, 2010c). Though no safety measure is as effective as close supervision by a watchful parent or caregiver, the aforementioned safety measures can be critical to the infant's well-being. Safety in the Water Infants can drown in a very small amount of water. Never leave an infant unattended in the sink, a baby bathtub or standard bathtub, a swimming or wading pool, or any other body of water, even if it is quite shallow. The bathroom door should be kept closed and the toilet lid down. Water should be emptied from tubs, pails, or buckets immediately after use. If the family has a swimming pool, a locked fence or locked screen enclosure should surround it. Exterior doors should be kept locked to prevent the older infant from wandering out to the pool (AAP, 2010c). The AAP recommends that parents use caution when enrolling their infant in an aquatic or swim program. Research has not sufficiently demonstrated that water survival skills taught to infants are effective (AAP, 2010d). Completing an aquatic program does not decrease the risk of drowning; vigilant supervision is still always required. Remember Allison Johnson, the infant described in the beginning of the chapter? What anticipatory guidancerelated to safety would you provide to Allison's parents? Promoting Nutrition Adequate nutrition is essential for growth and development. Breastfeeding and bottle-feeding of infant formula are both acceptable means of nutrition in the newborn and infant. Breast milk or formula supplies all of the infant's daily nutritional requirements until 4 to 6 months of age, at which time solid foods may be introduced (Shelov & Altmann, 2009). Cultural Factors Many dietary practices are affected by culture, both in the types of food eaten and in the approach to progression of infant feeding. Some ethnic groups tend to be lactose intolerant (particularly blacks, Native Americans, and Asians); therefore, alternative sources of calcium must be offered. Explore the cultural practices of the family related to infant feeding so that you can support the family's cultural values. Nutritional Needs Newborns and infants are experiencing tremendous growth and need diets that support these rapid changes. Table 3.7 compares fluid and caloric needs in the newborn and infant.Breastfeeding The NAPNAP, the AAP, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the American Dietetic Association, and the U.S. Breastfeeding Committee of the Department of Health and Human Services all recommend breast-feeding as the natural and preferred method of newborn and infant feeding (NAPNAP, 2007). In their position statement on breastfeeding (2007), NAPNAP identifies \"human milk as superior to all substitute feeding methods.\" Breast milk provides complete infant nutrition. Breastfeeding or feeding of expressed human milk is recommended for all infants, including sick or premature newborns (with rare exceptions). The exceptions include infants with galactosemia, maternal use of illicit drugs and a few prescription medications, maternal untreated active tuberculosis, and maternal HIV infection in developed countries. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Breastfeeding Report Card - United States, 2010 indicate that in 2010 75% of US women breastfed in the early postpartum period, 43% of infants were breast-feeding at 6 months of age, and only 22.4% were still breastfeeding at 1 year of age (CDC, 2010). Even partial breastfeeding is helpful and offers some of the health benefits of breastfeeding. Pediatric nurses in the community and the hospital are in an excellent position to promote and support breastfeeding, thereby contributing to the Healthy People 2020 goal of increasing the proportion of mothers who breastfeed their babies. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . BREAST MILK COMPOSITION Breast milk includes lactose, lipids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and amino acids. The ratio of whey to casein protein in breast milkmakes it readily digestible. The high concentration of fats and the balance of amino acids are believed to contribute to proper myelination of the nervous system. The concentration of iron in breast milk is less than that of formula, but the iron has increased bioavailability and is sufficient to meet the infant's requirements for the first 4 to 6 months of life. In addition to complete nutrition, immunologic protection is transferred from mother to infant via breast milk and maternal-infant bonding is promoted. The benefits of breastfeeding are listed in Box 3.1. BREAST MILK SUPPLY AND DEMAND Frequent, on-demand breastfeeding of the newborn is necessary to establish an adequate milk supply. After delivery of the placenta, levels of progesterone drop dramatically, which stimulates the anterior pituitary to produce prolactin. Prolactin stimulates the production of milk in the acinar or alveolar cells of the breast. When the infant sucks at the breast, nervous impulses stimulate further production of breast milk. BOX 3.1 BENEFITS OF BREASTFEEDING Infant Increased bonding with mother Immunologic protection Breast milk has anti-infective properties Decreased incidence and severity of diarrhea Decreased incidence of asthma, otitis media, bacterial meningitis, botulism, urinary tract infection Possible enhancement of cognitive development Decreased incidence of obesity in later childhood Maternal Increased bonding with infant Lessens maternal blood loss in the postpartum period Decreased risk of ovarian and premenopausal breast cancer Reduced incidence of pregnancy-induced, long-term obesity Possible delay of return of ovulation in some women Always ready; no mixing! Economic advantage Adapted from Heird, W. C. (2007). The feeding of infants and young children. In R. M. Kliegman, R. E. Behrman, H. B. Jenson, & B. Stanton (Eds.), Nelson textbook of pediatrics (18th ed.). Philadelphia: Saunders. The first \"milk\" to be produced by the breasts is termed colostrum . It is produced for the first 2 to 4 days after birth. Colostrum is a thin, watery, yellowish fluid that is easy to digest, as it is high in protein and low in sugar and fat. Colostrum is complete nutrition and all that is needed by the newborn for the first 2 to 4 days of life (Shelov & Altmann, 2009). Transitional breast milk replaces colostrum on days 2 to 4 after birth. By day 10 after birth, mature breast milk is produced. Mature breast milk has a slightly bluish color and appears thin. The breastfeeding mother produces milk continually. Called for emilk , it collects in the lactiferous sinuses, which are small tubules serving as reservoirs for milk located behind the nipples. The let-down re f ex is responsible for the release of milk from these reservoirs. When the baby sucks at the breast, oxytocin is released from the posterior pituitary, causing the lactiferous sinuses to contract. This allows milk to \"let down\" into the nipples, and the infant then sucks the milk. The let-down reflex is triggered not only by suckling at the breast but also by thinking of the baby or by the sound of a baby crying. After the foremilk is let down, new, fattier milk is formed. This hind milk helps the breastfed infant to grow quickly (Shelov & Altmann, 2009). Mothers should be informed that the production of oxytocin during suckling may also cause uterine contractions and may cause afterpains during breastfeeding. BREASTFEEDING TECHNIQUE Breastfeeding mothers may not have established adequate breastfeeding prior to leaving the hospital after birth of the newborn. The pediatric nurse may encounter an infant-mother dyad experiencing difficulty with breastfeeding for a variety of reasons. Thus, thepediatric nurse must be competent in counseling the breastfeeding mother. Before each breastfeeding session, mothers should wash their hands. It is not necessary to wash the breast in most cases. The mother should be positioned comfortably. A number of positions are possible, and they should be varied throughout the day ( Fig. 3.9 ). The mother may hold the breast in a \"C\" position if that is helpful to her. Stroke the nipple against the baby's cheek ( Fig. 3.10 ). This should stimulate the infant to open the mouth widely. Bring the baby's wide-open mouth to the breast to form a seal around all of the nipple and areola ( Fig. 3.11 ). When the infant is finished feeding, the mother can break the suction by inserting her finger into the baby's mouth, thus releasing the mouth from the nipple ( Fig. 3.12 ). This technique may prevent the infant from pulling on the nipple, which can lead to soreness and cracking. FIGURE 3.9 Various positions may be used during breastfeeding: ( A ) cradle hold, ( B ) side-lying, C ) football hold. FIGURE 3.10 Stroking the infant's cheek with the nipple will elicit the rooting reflex. FIGURE 3.11 Bringing the infant's open mouth to the breast, rather than bringing the breast to the infant, helps the infant correctly latch on. The infant's mouth forms a seal around all of the nipple and areola. Note the \"C\" position for holding the breast during latching on. FIGURE 3.12 Inserting the little finger between the areola and the infant's mouth helps to break the suction. Watching and listening to the infant feed may assess the adequacy of the baby's latch technique. The infant who is properly latched on to the breast will suck rhythmically, taking most or all of the areola into the mouth. Audible swallowing should be heard as milk isdelivered into the infant's mouth. Assess the mother for pain related to breastfeeding. She should not be in pain if the baby is latched on properly. Establishment of breastfeeding is best achieved if the infant is allowed to feed on demand, whenever he or she is hungry. This may be as often as every 1\u00bd to 3 hours in the neonate. Infants may feed for 10 to 20 minutes on each breast at each feeding, or longer on just one breast, alternating the breast at each feeding. Both methods are acceptable. The breastfeeding infant does not need supplementation with water or formula even in the first few days of life as long as the newborn continues to wet six to eight diapers per day. After several days of age, the mother's milk supply should be well established. Adequate urine output and bowel movements, as well as continued weight gain in the infant, indicate the adequacy of breastfeeding. Working mothers in particular may need additional support from the nurse in order to continue breastfeeding if they desire to do so. Common problems occurring with breastfeeding are addressed in Teaching Guidelines 3.1. Additional reliable resources for mothers who desire to breastfeed may be found on the websites listed on the Point. Teaching Guidelines 3.1 PROMOTING BREASTFEEDING Problem Solutions Sore nipples Prevention: encourage appropriate latch-on from the beginning. Expose nipples to air between feedings. Allow breast milk to dry on nipples. Aloe vera or vitamin E may help to heal sore nipples. Medical-grade lanolin or preservative-free lanolin (Lansinoh) may be helpful. Engorgement Apply warm compresses or encourage the mother to take a warm shower prior to having the baby latch on. Warmth encourages some of the milk to be released, allowing the breast to soften and making it easier for the infant to latch on. Poor sucking Feed on cue, not on a schedule. Encourage the sleepy infant by stroking the feet, undressing, and rubbing the head. Inadequate milk supply Decrease maternal stress. Encourage adequate maternal diet and fluid intake. Mothers who return to work must pump in order to keep up milk supply when away from infant. Father feels left out Encourage father to participate in other aspects of care. Mother worries about adequacy of breast milk If infant is voiding six times per day and gaining weight, then he or she is receiving enough milk and appropriate nutrition. Bottle Feeding For the mother who does not desire to, or cannot, breast-feed, commercially prepared formulas are available for bottle-feeding. These formulas are designed to imitate human milk. Standard infant formulas based on cow's milk provide 20 kcal/ounce and use lactose as a source for carbohydrates (Shelov & Altmann, 2009). Vegetable oil is used as the source of fat; whey or casein provides protein. Newer cow's milk-based formulas contain long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids that are thought to improve brain development. Ordinary cow's milk is not recommended for the first year of life. Take Note! Cow's milk does not provide an adequate balance of nutrients for the growing infant, especially iron. It may also overload the infant's renal system with inappropriate amounts of protein, sodium, and minerals. Only formulas that are fortified with iron should be used. Iron stores that the infant received prenatally are depleted by 4 to 6 months of age. To prevent iron deficiency anemia, poor growth patterns, and impaired development, iron-fortified formulas must be used. The AAP recommends that commercial formulas provide 10 to 12 mg of iron per liter (Baker, Greer, & Committee on Nutrition, 2010). Commercial formulas also provide an adequate blend of essential vitamins and minerals.FEEDING PATTERNS Infant feeding is an opportune time to establish good eating behaviors. The infant should always be held while being bottle-fed. Cradling in a semiupright position allows for additional bonding time, as the infant can see the caregiver's face while feeding ( Fig. 3.13 ). Talking or singing during feeding time also increases bonding. As with breastfed infants, the bottle-fed infant should be fed on cue. Overfeeding with the bottle increases the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux, so families need to learn their baby's cues to hunger and satiety (NAPNAP, 2011a). It is important to feed the baby when he or she displays signs of hunger. Crying is a late sign of hunger; earlier signs include making sucking motions, sucking on hands, or putting the fist to the chin. The infant should be burped two or three times per feeding, when he or she slows feeding or stops sucking. Newborns may only take a half-ounce to 1 ounce per feeding initially, working up to 2 to 3 ounces in the first few days. They need to feed about 6 to 10 times per day. The infant will gradually be able to ingest more formula per feeding. By 3 to 4 months of age, babies feed four or five times per day and take 6 to 7 ounces per feeding. Most infants will not require specific amounts per feeding; the infant should be fed until full. To prevent overfeeding, healthy bottle-fed infants should be allowed to self-regulate the amount of formula ingested per feeding. When the baby is satiated, he or she might fall asleep, spit out the nipple or formula, play with the nipple, or lie quietly, only sucking once in a while (Shelov & Altmann, 2009). FIGURE 3.13 Technique for bottle-feeding the infant. TYPES OF FORMULAS AND BOTTLES Parents may choose to use commercial formulas that are ready to feed or available as a concentrate or as a powder. Parents should follow the instructions for mixing the concentrate or powder to avoid dehydration or fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Ready-to-feed formula should be used as is and never diluted (NAPNAP, 2011a). A wide variety of baby bottle and nipple types are available for formula feeding, and the choice is purely individual. Few infants require special nipples or bottles. Box 3.2 gives guidelines on preparation and storage of formula and care of bottles. SPECIAL FORMULAS Special formulas may be needed for the infant who is allergic to a particular component of standard formula or has a renal, hepatic, metabolic, or intestinal disorder. For example, lactose-free cow's milk formulas are available for the lactose-intolerant child. Formulasusing soy as the base ingredient instead of whey or casein are also available. Soy formulas are necessary for infants with a milk allergy, and they may be appealing to the vegetarian family. BOX 3.2 PREPARATION AND STORAGE OF BOTTLES AND FORMULA Wash nipples and bottles in hot soapy water and rinse well OR Run nipples and bottles through the dishwasher. Store tightly covered ready-to-feed formula can after opening in refrigerator for up to 48 hours. After mixing concentrate or powdered formula, store tightly covered in refrigerator for up to 48 hours. Do not reheat and reuse partially used bottles. Throw away the unused portion after each feeding. Do not add cereal to the formula in the bottle. Do not sweeten formula with honey. Warm formula by placing bottle in a container of hot water. Do not microwave formula. Adapted from Shelov, S. P., & Altmann, T. R. (Eds.). (2009). Caring for your baby and young child: Birth to age 5 (5th ed.). New York, NY: Bantam Books These special formulas are designed to meet the nutritional needs of infants, depending on the disorder. Infants who fail to gain weight may be placed on standard infant formula prepared to deliver a higher caloric density per ounce. Preterm infants (those born at less than 36 weeks' gestation) need adequate nutrition to exhibit catch-up growth. Good catch-up growth (quadrupling or even quintupling the birth weight) in the first year or so of life is critical for adequate head growth and avoidance of neurodevelopmental consequences. Premature infant follow-up formulas are designed to provide additional calories, protein, and a particular calcium-to- phosphorus ratio as well as the vitamins and minerals needed for adequate catch-up growth. Progressing to Solid Foods After 6 months of age, infants usually require the nutrients available in solid foods in addition to their breast milk or formula. Progressing to feeding solid foods can be exciting and trying. Before solid foods are attempted, the infant should be assessed for readiness to progress. Parents need instruction in choosing appropriate solid foods and support in the progression process. ASSESSING INFANT READINESS Several factors contribute to the appropriate timing of solid food introduction. The tongue extrusion reflex is necessary for sucking to be an automatic reaction\u2014that is, when a nipple or other item is placed in the mouth, the tongue extrudes and sucking begins. This reflex disappears at about 4 to 6 months of age (Shelov & Altmann, 2009). Introducing solid food with a spoon prior to 4 to 6 months of age will result in extrusion of the tongue. The parent may think that the infant does not want the food and is spitting it out intentionally, but this is not the case; the infant simply must be mature enough to eat with a spoon (absence of extrusion reflex). The ability to swallow solid food does not become completely functional until 4 to 6 months of age. Enzymes to appropriately digest food other than breast milk and formula are also not present in sufficient quantities until the age of 4 to 6 months. Before the introduction of solid foods and the cup, the infant should be able to sit supported in a high chair. Solids should be fed with a spoon, with the infant in an upright position. CHOOSING APPROPRIATE SOLID FOODS Iron-fortified rice cereal mixed with a small amount of breast milk or formula is a good choice for the first solid food. The cereal is easily digested and its taste is generally well accepted. The cereal should be quite thin at first; it can be mixed to a thicker consistency as the infant gets older. Once the feeding of cereal with a spoon is successful, other single foods may be introduced. The foods should be pureed to a smooth consistency, whether prepackaged \"baby food\" or pureed at home. BOX 3.3 FOODS TO AVOID IN INFANCY Honey Egg yolks and meats (until 10 months of age) Excessive amounts of fruit juice Foods likely to cause choking Peanuts Popcorn Other small hard foods (e.g., raw carrot chunks) Grapes and hot dog slices (must be cut in smaller pieces) Foods likely to result in allergic reaction Citrus Strawberries Wheat Cow's milk Egg whites Peanut butter Adapted from Brown, J. (2011). Nutrition now (6th ed.). Florence, KY: Wadsworth Publishing. The introduction of one new food every 4 to 7 days is recommended (Hagan et al., 2008; Shelov & Altmann, 2009). This allows for identification of food allergies ( Box 3.3 ). No salt, sugar, or other seasoning should be added to these first foods. Generally, by 8 months of age the infant is ready for more texture in his or her foods. Soft, smashed table food without large chunks is appropriate. Finger foods such as Cheerios, soft green bean pieces, or soft peas may also be offered. Avoid hard foods that the infant may choke on. Strained, pureed, or mashed meats may be introduced at 10 to 12 months of age. The cup should be introduced at 6 to 8 months of age. One ounce of breast milk or formula should be placed in the cup while the infant is learning. This will decrease the amount of mess should the cup be spilled. Old-fashioned sippy cups are generally acceptable for use, though older infants quickly learn to drink from an ordinary cup with assistance when they are thirsty. Newer \"no-spill\" sippy cups are not recommended for general home use. They require sucking much like a bottle and do not really encourage the child to learn cup drinking. They should be reserved for use on long trips in the car or other instances in which spills should be avoided (Rychnovsky, 2000). Fruit juice is unnecessary and should not be introduced until 6 months of age. If juice is given, it should be limited to 2 to 4 ounces per day. Fruit itself is much more nutritious than fruit juice. If infants are allowed to consume larger quantities of juice, it can displace important nutrients from breast milk or formula (AAP, 2007). PROMOTING HEALTHY EATING HABITS Infants and children learn about food within a social context, so the family plays an important role in creating healthy eating habits. Families \"model\" eating behaviors; infants and children learn about eating through watching others. Lifelong eating patterns are often established in childhood, so it is important to emphasize healthy eating practices beginning in infancy. Parents should not let infants eat whatever they want (permissive feeding style); this will lead to fights over eating in the future. Infants may require as many as 20 exposures to a new food before it is accepted. On the other hand, infants should not be coerced into eating all that is provided (authoritarian feeding style). Forcing an infant to eat when he or she is full sets the child up for overeating in the future and may lead to more power struggles (Shelov & Altmann, 2009). Parents need to find a balance between the permissive and authoritarian feeding styles to establish lifelong healthy eating patterns in their children. By providing education about appropriate diet and feeding behaviors, the nurse can help the family to accomplish this goal. Think back to Allison Johnson. What questions should you ask Allison's parents related to her nutritional intake? What anticipatory guidance related to nutrition would be appropriate? Promoting Healthy Sleep and Rest Newborns sleep about 20 hours a day, waking frequently to feed and quickly returning to sleep. By 3 months of age, most infants sleep 7 to 8 hours per night without waking. They will continue to take about three naps a day. By 4 months of age the infant is more active and alert and may have more trouble going to sleep in the evening. Night waking may occur, but the infant should be capable of sleeping through the night and does not require a night feeding. By 12 months of age infants sleep 8 to 12 hours per night and take two naps per day (Feigelman, 2007). Discuss safe sleeping practices with parents of newborns and infants; the baby should sleep on a firm mattress without pillows orcomforters. The baby's bed should be placed away from air conditioner vents, open windows, and open heaters. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has been associated with prone positioning of newborns and infants, so the infant should be placed to sleep on the back (Shelov & Altmann, 2009). See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Take Note! The AAP has determined that side sleeping is not as safe as supine sleeping. In the newborn period, the primary caregiver should try to sleep when the baby is sleeping. Since newborns need to be fed every 1\u00bd to 3 hours around the clock, parents may become exhausted quickly and are often eager for the infant to sleep through the night. Adding rice cereal to the evening bottle has not been proven to discourage night waking and is not recommended (Hagan et al., 2008). Provide support to parents of newborns and educate them on infant sleeping patterns. It is important to establish a bedtime routine around 4 months of age due to the infant's increased alertness and activity level. The baby who is 4 months or older needs a time of calming and relaxation before going to sleep. A consistent bedtime routine should be established, perhaps a bath followed by rocking, singing, or reading. The infant should fall asleep in his or her own crib rather than being rocked to sleep or held until sleeping and then put in the crib. After 4 months of age, infants must learn to soothe themselves back to sleep following night waking. Older infants may exhibit head banging as a form of self-soothing and use it to fall asleep at night. Night feedings are unnecessary at this age and will create a routine of further night waking that will be difficult to break (Hagan et al., 2008). Parents should minimize attention and stimulation provided during a night waking. Briefly checking on the infant to ascertain his or her safety, followed by placing the infant back in a lying position and telling him or her good night, is all that is needed. This may have to be repeated several times before the infant falls back to sleep. It is important to keep interactions brief during the night waking so that the infant learns to fall back to sleep on his or her own. Continued issues with night waking should be discussed with the infant's primary care provider. What anticipatory guidance should you provide to Allison's parents in r elation to sleep? Promoting Healthy Teeth and Gums Healthy teeth and gums require proper oral hygiene and appropriate fluoride supplementation. Children older than 6 months of age who are at risk for developing dental caries and whose drinking water source contains less than 0.3 parts per million may require fluoride supplementation (Rozier, 2010). Excess fluoride ingestion can result in discoloration of the teeth (fluorosis). Early childhood dental caries can result from pooling of milk or juice around teeth and gums. Before tooth eruption, parents should clean the child's gums after feeding with a damp washcloth. After teeth have erupted, parents can continue to use a soft cloth for tooth cleaning and then eventually use a small soft-bristled toothbrush. Toothpaste is unnecessary in infancy. Infants should not be allowed to take milk or juice bottles to bed, as the high sugar content of the fluid in contact with the teeth all night leads to dental caries (see section on baby bottle mouth later in this chapter). Weaning from the bottle at age 12 to 15 months may help prevent dental caries. No-spill sippy cups have also been implicated in the development of dental caries and should be avoided. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends that infants receive their first dental visit by the age of 1 year.Promoting Appropriate Discipline Parenting requires ever-changing adaptations to the developing infant's needs. Unconditional love, patience, and compassion must be balanced with the parents' needs. Discipline refers to the molding of a child's behavior through instruction, practice, and consistency. Discipline helps build self-esteem in children as well as sets standards for social interactions. The primary goal of discipline is to teach an infant limits. Discipline should be used to help the infant solve problems. The infant's activities are based on the basic needs of food, security, warmth, love, and comfort. Misbehavior is the result of an unmet need, and the parents should respond accordingly. As the infant is undergoing rapid changes in motor skills, safety needs increase. Nurses should encourage the parents to \"childproof\" their home so that the infant can develop physical skills without being at risk. In a childproof home, fewer restrictions need to be placed on the infant's behavior, and he or she can explore. Physical punishment or spanking should never be used in infancy. Infants are at increased risk for physical injury from spanking and cannot make the connection between the spanking and the undesirable behavior. Providing a safe environment, redirection away from undesirable behaviors, and saying \"no\" in appropriate instances are far more effective. For example, when the infant is in potential danger (e.g., inserting a key into an electrical outlet, attempting to ingest a poisonous substance, or reaching into the toilet), the parent must use a firm but calm and brisk approach. If the infant knows the parent is serious, he or she will usually comply more quickly (AAP, 2004). Remaining calm, firm, and consistent is necessary. Immediacy is also an important component of appropriate discipline. The infant cannot make the connection between a subsequent punishment or discussion of behavior with the earlier event itself. Positive reinforcement should be used to support good behavior (Anderson, 2008). Addressing Child Care Needs Many mothers work outside the home, there are many single-parent families, and many families live a distance away from relatives. In all of these circumstances, infants may need to be cared for outside the home, often in child care settings or home day care centers. Parents contemplating child care must consider a number of factors. Do they want a sitter to come to their home? Will they use a traditional day care center or a home care situation with fewer children? How much can they afford? If families choose to use a freestanding day care center or a home-based day care center, they should make sure that the provider is appropriately licensed. Parents should feel comfortable with the caregiver-to-child ratio. Are the caregivers trained in infant CPR and first aid? Families may need to visit or interview several facilities before finding one that meets their requirements. When an older infant is attending a child care situation for the first time, it may be helpful to visit the center once or twice beforehand so that the infant can get used to the caregivers from the comfort and security of the parent's lap. Warn parents that separation anxiety in late infancy can cause a disturbing crying episode when the parent leaves. Reassure parents that the infant will not suffer harm due to the separation. Addressing Common Developmental Concerns Parents commonly have multiple concerns during normal infant growth and development. Although most of these issues are not actual disease states or behavior problems, nurses must be aware of these issues to recognize them and to intervene appropriately. Colic Healthy 6-week-old infants cry for a total of about 3 hours every day. Crying and fussing are more prevalent in the evenings. By age 12 weeks, the total amount of crying is about 1 hour per day, and infants are better able to soothe themselves by this age. Colic is defined as inconsolable crying that lasts 3 hours or longer per day and for which there is no physical cause. It typically resolves by 3 months of age, coinciding with the age at which infants are better able to soothe themselves (e.g., by finger sucking). The cause of colic is thought to be problems in the gastrointestinal or neurologic system (probably system immaturity), temperament, or parenting style of the mother or father. Some parents are overly anxious or overly attentive or, at the other extreme, may not give the infant the attention he or she needs. Any of these may contribute to a baby's fussing and crying. Prolonged crying leads to increased stress among caregivers. Failure to stop the crying leads to frustration, and crying that prevents the parents from sleeping contributes to the exhaustion they are already experiencing. Educate parents that normal crying increases by the time the infant is 6 weeks old and diminishes by about 12 weeks. When faced with a colicky baby, parents should develop a stepwise approach to checking that all of the infant's basic needs are met. When these needs are met, attempts at soothing the infant may be used. Reducing stimulation may decrease the length of crying. Carrying the infant more may also be helpful. Some infants respond to the motion of an infant swing or a car ride. Vibration, white noise, or swaddlingmay also help to decrease fussing in some infants. Pacifiers can be soothing to babies who need additional nonnutritive sucking. Parents should try one intervention at a time, taking care not to stimulate the infant excessively in the process of searching for solutions. Nurses should provide ongoing support to the parents of a colicky infant and reassure them that this is a temporary condition that will resolve in time (Shelov & Altmann, 2009). Spitting Up Spitting up (regurgitating small amounts of stomach contents) occurs in all infants, and a significant number of normal infants spit up excessively. Although spitting up after feeding is normal, it can be a cause of great concern to parents. Overfed babies who feed based on a parent-designed schedule and those who burp poorly are more likely to spit up. For some infants, the amount and frequency of spitting up are significant, and it may indicate gastroesophageal reflux. Teach parents that feeding smaller amounts on a more frequent basis may help to decrease spitting-up episodes. Always burp the baby at least two or three times per feeding. Keep the baby upright for 30 minutes after feeding and do not lay the infant prone after feeding. Avoid bouncing or excess activity immediately after feeding. Positioning in an infant seat compresses the stomach and is not recommended. When placing the baby in bed, position him or her on the side with the head of the bed slightly elevated (Shelov & Altmann, 2009). EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 3.1 BENEFITS AND RISKS OF PACIFIER USE STUDY The authors review the history of pacifier use and several recent research studies that attempted to determine the risks and benefits of pacifier use. The majority of the studies were performed within the early part of the 21st century. Findings Upon analysis of the various research studies, the authors reached several conclusions. Pacifier use has been shown to lower the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) when used at the time of sleep. Additional benefits include assistance in development of neurologic maturity in pre-term infants and not shortening breastfeeding duration in preterm or term infants older than 1 month of age. Potential risks include shortening of breastfeeding duration if a pacifier is used before 1 month of age, increased incidence of otitis media when used after 1 year of age, and development of dental misalignment. Nursing Implications In light of the potential risks and benefits of pacifier use, nurses must be prepared to provide parents with accurate information related to the use of pacifiers. Educate parents to avoid introduction of the pacifier until breastfeeding is well established (4 weeks of age), to use pacifiers only during periods of sleep, and to never force a pacifier on an infant or replace a pacifier in a sleeping infant's mouth. Additionally, parents should begin to wean the infant from the pacifier in late infancy so that it is not used past 1 year of age. Adapted from Marter, A., & Agruss, J. C. (2007). Pacifiers: An update on use and misuse. Journal for Specialists in Pediatric Nursing, 12(4), 278-285. Reassure parents that if the infant is wetting at least six diapers per 24 hours and gaining weight, the spitting up is normal. If the infant vomits one third or more of most feedings, chokes when vomiting, or experiences forceful emesis, the primary care provider should be notified. Thumb Sucking, Pacifiers, and Security Items Infants demonstrate a clear need for nonnutritive sucking: even fetuses can be observed sucking their thumbs or fingers in utero. Thumb sucking is a healthy self-comforting activity. Infants who suck their thumbs or pacifiers often are better able to soothe themselves than those who do not. Studies have not shown that sucking either thumbs or pacifiers leads to the need for orthodontic braces unless the sucking continues well beyond the early school-age period. However, pacifier use has been associated with the increased incidence of otitis media, and hygiene is always a concern as pacifiers often fall on the floor (Marter & Agruss, 2007). Infants may also become attached to a doll, stuffed animal, or blanket. Just like thumb sucking, the attachment item gives the infant the security to self-soothe when he or she is uncomfortable. Families need to explore their feelings and cultural preferences about sucking habits and security items. Parents should not try to break the habit during a stressful time for the infant. When the infant is intensely trying to master a new skill such as sitting or walking,he or she may need the sucking or security item to self-soothe. Pacifiers and security items can be physically taken away at some point, but the thumb is attached. The infant who has become attached to thumb sucking should not have additional attention drawn to the issue, as that may prolong thumb sucking. Families of infants who use pacifiers may want to wean the infant from the pacifier when the child approaches 1 year of age (Marter & Agruss, 2007). This is the time when the need for additional sucking naturally decreases. Attempts to wean the child from a security blanket or toy should probably be reserved for after infancy (see Evidence-Based Practice 3.1 ). Teething Discomfort is common as the tooth breaks through the periodontal membrane. Infants may drool, bite on hard objects, or increase finger sucking. Some infants may become very irritable, refuse to eat, and not sleep well. Fever, vomiting, and diarrhea are generally not considered a sign of teething but rather of illness. Teething pain results from inflammation. Teach parents that application of cold may be soothing to the gums. The infant may chew on a cold teething ring, or parents can rub an ice cube wrapped in a washcloth on the gums. Over-the-counter topical anesthetics such as baby Orajel may also be helpful. Parents should apply the ointment correctly to the gums, avoiding the lips, as these ointments cause numbing. Occasionally, oral acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be given to relieve pain (Tinanoff, 2007). Refer back to 6-month-old Allison Johnson. List some common developmental concerns of 6-month-old infants. What anticipatory guidance related to these concerns would you provide to her parents? KEY CONCEPTS Infancy encompasses the period from birth to age 12 months. The infant exhibits tremendous growth, doubling the birthweight by 6 months of age and tripling it by 12 months of age. Most organ systems are immature at birth and develop and mature over the first year of life. Child development is orderly, sequential, and predictable, progressing in a cephalocaudal and proximodistal fashion. The infant is mastering the psychosocial task of Trust versus Mistrust. Cognitive development in infancy is sensorimotor; infants use their senses and progressing motor skills to master their environment. The 12-month-old babbles expressively and uses two or three words with meaning. Promotion of safety is of key importance throughout infancy. Breastfeeding is the natural and preferred method for infant feeding. Breastfed and bottle-fed infants should both be fed on cue rather than on a parent-designed schedule. Solid foods should be introduced at age 4 to 6 months. A spoon should be used to feed the infant, and rice cereal should be the first food. New foods should be introduced no more frequently than every 4 to 7 days. The cup may be introduced at 6 months of age. No-spill sippy cups are generally not recommended. Spitting up and colic are parts of normal development in the otherwise thriving infant and do not require medical intervention. REFERENCES Abell, S., & Ey, J. L. (2007). Ask Dr. Sue. Bilingual child.

The mother of a 3-month-old boy asks the nurse about starting solid foods. What is the most appropriate response by the nurse? a. \"It's okay to start pureed solids at this age if fed via the bottle.\" b. \"Infants don't require solid food until 12 months of age.\" c. \"Solid foods should be delayed until age 6 months, when the infant can handle a spoon on his own.\" d. \"The tongue extrusion reflex disappears at age 4 to 6 months, making it a good time to start solid foods.\" 2. The father of a 2-month-old girl is expressing concern that his infant may be getting spoiled. The nurse's best response is: a. \"She just needs love and attention. Don't worry; she's too young to spoil.\" b. \"Consistently meeting the infant's needs helps promote a sense of trust.\" c. \"Infants need to be fed and cleaned; if you're sure those needs are met, just let her cry.\" d. \"Consistency in meeting needs is important, but you're right, holding her too much will spoil her.\" 3. Parents of an 8-month-old girl express concern that she cries when left with the babysitter. How does the nurse best explain this behavior? a. Crying when left with the sitter may indicate difficulty with building trust. b. Stranger anxiety should not occur until toddler-hood; this concern should be investigated. c. Separation anxiety is normal at this age; the infant recognizes parents as separate beings. d. Perhaps the sitter doesn't meet the infant's needs; choose a different sitter. 4. The nurse is providing anticipatory guidance to the mother of a 6-month-old infant. What is the best instruction by the nurse in relation to the infant's oral health? a. \"Start brushing her teeth after all the baby teeth come in.\" b. \"Use a washcloth with toothpaste to clean her mouth.\" c. \"Clean your baby's gums, then new teeth, with a washcloth.\" d. \"Rinse your baby's mouth with water after every feeding.\" 5. A 9-month-old infant's mother is questioning why cow's milk is not recommended in the first year of life as it is much cheaper than formula. What rationale does the nurse include in her response? a. It is permissible to substitute cow's milk for formula at this age as he is so close to 1 year old. b. Cow's milk is iron poor and does not provide the proper balance of nutrients for the infant. c. As long as the mother provides whole milk, rather than skim, she can start cow's milk in infancy. d. If the mother cannot afford the infant formula, she should dilute it to make it last longer. CRITICAL THINKING EXERCISES 1. The mother of an 11-month-old boy who was born at 24 weeks' gestation is concerned about his size and motor skills. What information should the nurse provide? 2. An infant's mother thinks there may be something wrong with him because \"he spits up so much.\" What further information should the nurse obtain? 3. If you determine that the infant in the question above is experiencing normal spitting up associated with his developmental age, develop a brief teaching plan to review with the mother.STUDY ACTIVITIES 1. A mother brings her 9-month-old boy to the clinic for a well-child check-up. She has questions about feeding, speech, and walking. Develop a teaching plan of anticipatory guidance for the 9-month-old infant. 2. Develop a safety plan for the 12-month-old infant. 3. In the clinical setting, observe two infants of the same age, one who is developing appropriately for his or her age and one who is delayed. Note the similarities and differences between the two infants.4 Growth and Development of the Toddler Words of Wisdom Toddlers will take risks and make many mistakes, but remember that both are an essential part of their growth.

Jose Gonzales is a 2-year-old boy brought to the clinic by his mother and father for his 2-year-old check-up. During your assessment, you find that his weight is 30 pounds, height 33 inches, and head cir cumference 19.5 inches. As the nurse caring for him, assess Jose's growth and development, and then provide appropriate anticipatory guidance to the parents. The toddler period encompasses the second 2 years of life, from age 1 year to age 3 years. This period is a time of significant advancement in growth and development for the child. It can also be quite a challenging time for parents. The theme during the toddler years is one of holding on and letting go. Having learned that parents are predictable and reliable, the toddler is now learning that his or her behavior has a predictable, reliable effect on others. The challenge is to encourage independence and autonomy while keeping the curious toddler safe. Take Note! As more grandparents are assuming the primary caregiver role for their grandchildren, nurses should be alert to the possibility of increased stress that is placed upon the older caregiver, particularly during the active and sometimes trying years of toddlerhood (Leder, Grinstead, & Torres, 2007). GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OVERVIEW Infancy is a time of intense growth and development. Both physical growth and acquisition of new motor skills slow somewhat during the toddler years. Refinement of motor skills, continued cognitive growth, and acquisition of appropriate language skills are of prime importance during toddlerhood. The nurse uses the knowledge of normal toddler development as a roadmap for behavioral assessment of the 1- to 3-year-old child. Physical Growth The toddler's height and weight continue to increase steadily, though the increase occurs at a slower velocity compared to infancy. Toddler gains in height and weight tend to occur in spurts, rather than in a linear fashion ( Fig. 4.1 ). The average toddler weight gain is 3 to 5 pounds per year. Length/height increases by an average of 3 inches per year. Toddlers generally reach about half of their adult height by 2 years of age. Head circumference increases about 1 inch from when the child is between 1 and 2 years of age, then increases an average of a half-inch per year until age 5. The anterior fontanel should be closed by the time the child is 18 months old. Head size becomes more proportional to the rest of the body near the age of 3 years (Hagan, Shaw, & Duncan, 2008). Organ System Maturation Though not as pronounced as the changes occurring during infancy, the toddler's organ systems continue to grow and mature in their functioning. Significant functional changes occur within the neurologic, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary systems. The respiratory and cardiovascular systems undergo changes as well. FIGURE 4.1 The typical toddler appearance is that of a rounded abdomen, a slight swayback, and a wide-based stance. Neurologic System Brain growth continues through toddlerhood, and the brain reaches about 80% of its adult size by 3 years of age (Zero to Three,2011). Myelinization of the brain and spinal cord continues to progress and is complete around 24 months of age. Myelinization results in improved coordination and equilibrium as well as the ability to exercise sphincter control, which is important for bowel and bladder mastery. Integration of the primitive reflexes occurs in infancy, allowing for the emergence of the protective reflexes near the end of infancy or early in toddlerhood. The forward or downward parachute reflex is particularly helpful when the child starts to toddle. Rapid increase in language skills is evidence of continued progression of cognitive development. Respiratory System The respiratory structures continue to grow and mature throughout toddlerhood. The alveoli continue to increase in number, not reaching the adult number until about 7 years of age. The trachea and lower airways continue to grow but remain small compared with the adult. The tongue is relatively large in comparison to the size of the mouth. Tonsils and adenoids are large and the Eustachian tubes are relatively short and straight. Cardiovascular System The heart rate decreases and blood pressure increases in toddlerhood. Blood vessels are close to the skin surface and so are compressed easily when palpated. Gastrointestinal System The stomach continues to increase in size, allowing the toddler to consume three regular meals per day. Pepsin production matures by 2 years of age. The small intestine continues to grow in length, though it does not reach the maximum length of 2 to 3 meters until adulthood. Stool passage decreases in frequency to one or more per day. The color of the stool may change (yellow, orange, brown, or green) depending on the toddler's diet. Since the toddler's intestines remain somewhat immature, the toddler often passes whole pieces of difficult-to-digest food such as corn kernels. Bowel control is generally achieved by the end of the toddler period. Genitourinary System Bladder and kidney function reach adult levels by 16 to 24 months of age. The bladder capacity increases, allowing the toddler to retain urine for increased periods of times. Urine output should be about 1 mL/kg/hour. The urethra remains short in both the male and female toddler, making them more susceptible to urinary tract infections compared to adults. Musculoskeletal System During toddlerhood, the bones increase in length and the muscles mature and become stronger. The abdominal musculature is weak in early toddlerhood, resulting in a pot-bellied appearance. The toddler appears to have a swayback along with the potbelly. Around 3 years of age, the musculature strengthens and the abdomen is flatter in appearance. Psychosocial Development Erikson defines the toddler period as a time of autonomy versus shame and doubt. It is a time of exerting independence. Since the toddler developed a sense of trust in infancy, he or she is ready to give up dependence and to assert his or her sense of control and autonomy (Erikson, 1963). The toddler is struggling for self-mastery, to learn to do for himself or herself what others have been doing for him or her. Toddlers often experience ambivalence about the move from dependence to autonomy, and this results in emotional lability. The toddler may quickly change from happy and pleasant to crying and screaming. Exertion of independence also results in the toddler's favorite response, \"no.\" The toddler will often answer \"no\" even when he or she really means \"yes.\" This negativism\u2014always saying \"no\"\u2014is a normal part of healthy development and is occurring as a result of the toddler's attempt to assert his or her independence. Table 4.1 gives further information related to developing a sense of autonomy. Cognitive Development According to Jean Piaget (1969), toddlers move through the last two substages of the first stage of cognitive development, the sensorimotor stage, between 12 and 24 months of age. Young toddlers engage in tertiary circular reactions and progress to mental combinations. Rather than just repeating a behavior, the toddler is able to experiment with a behavior to see what happens. By 2 years of age, toddlers are capable of using symbols to allow for imitation. With increasing cognitive abilities, toddlers may now engage in delayed imitation. For example, they may imitate a household task that they observed a parent doing several days ago.Piaget identified the second stage of cognitive development as the preoperational stage. It occurs in children between ages 2 and 7 years. During this stage toddlers begin to become more sophisticated with symbolic thought. The thinking of the older toddler is far more advanced than that of the infant or young toddler, who views the world as a series of objects. During the preoperational stage, objects begin to have characteristics that make them unique from one another. Objects are considered large or small, a particular color or shape, or a unique texture. This moves beyond the connection of sensory information and physical action. Words and images allow the toddler to begin this process of developing symbolic thought by providing a label for the objects' characteristics (Piaget, 1969). Toddlers also use symbols in dramatic play. First they imitate life with appropriate toy objects, and then they are able to substitute objects in their play. A bowl may be used to pretend to eat from, but then later it can be used upside down on the head as a hat ( Fig. 4.2 ). Human feelings and characteristics may also be attributed to objects (animism ) (Papalia & Feldman, 2011). See Table 4.1 for further explanation of cognitive development in toddlerhood. Take Note! Mothers who are depressed may not be as sensitive to their children as other mothers. For this reason, maternal depression is a risk factor for poor cognitive development. Be alert to the mental status of a toddler's mother so that appropriate referrals can be made if needed (Wacha-rasin, Barnard, & Speiker, 2003). Motor Skill Development Toddlers continue to gain new motor skills as well as refine others. Walking progresses to running, climbing, and jumping. Pushing or pulling a toy, throwing a ball, and pedaling a tricycle are accomplished in tod-dlerhood. Fine motor skills progress from holding and pinching to the ability to manage utensils, hold a crayon, string a bead, and use a computer. Development of eye-hand coordination is necessary for the refinement of fine motor skills. These increased abilities of mobility and manipulation help the curious toddler explore and learn more about his or her environment ( Fig. 4.3 ). As the toddler masters a new task, he or she has confidence to conquer the next challenge. Thus, mastery in motor skill development contributes to the toddler's growing sense of self-esteem. The toddler who is eager to face challenges will likely develop more quickly than one who is reluctant. The senses of sight, hearing, and touch are useful in helping to coordinate gross and fine motor movement.Gross Motor Skills As gross motor skills are mastered and then used repeatedly, the large muscle groups in the toddler are strengthened. The \"toddler gait\" is characteristic of new walkers. The toddler does not walk smoothly and maturely. Instead, the legs are planted widely apart, toes are pointed forward, and the toddler seems to sway from side to side while moving forward ( Fig. 4.4 ). Often the toddler seems to speed along, pitching forward, appearing ready to topple over at any moment. The toddler may fall often, but will use outstretched arms to catch himself or herself (parachute reflex). After about 6 months of practice walking, the toddler's gait is smoother and the feet are closer together. By 3 years of age, the toddler walks in a heel-to-toe fashion similar to that of adults. Toddlers often use physical actions such as running, jumping, and hitting to express their emotions because they are only just learning to express their thoughts and feelings verbally. Table 4.2 lists motor skill expectations in relation to age. FIGURE 4.2 The toddler will (A) pretend with items in the way they are intended to be used as well as (B) find other creative uses for them. FIGURE 4.3 The toddler's curiosity about the world increases, as does her ability to explore it. Fine Motor SkillsFine motor skills in the toddler period are improved and perfected. Holding utensils requires some control and agility, but even more is needed for buttoning and zipping. Adequate vision is necessary for the refinement of fine motor skills because eye-hand coordination is crucial for directing the fingers, hand, and wrist to accomplish small muscle tasks such as fitting a puzzle piece or stringing a bead. See Table 4.2 for age expectations for various motor skills. FIGURE 4.4 The young toddler (early walker) walks with a wide-based stance, feet pointing forward and arms akimbo.Sensory Development Toddlers use all of their senses to explore the world around them. Toddlers examine new items by feeling them, looking at them, shaking them to hear what sound they make, smelling them, and placing them in their mouths. Toddler vision continues to progress and should be 20/50 to 20/40 in both eyes. Depth perception also continues to mature. Hearing should be at the adult level, as infants are ordinarily born with hearing intact. The sense of smell continues to mature, and toddlers may comment if they do not care for the scent of something. Though taste discrimination is not completely developed, toddlers may exhibit preferences for certain flavors of foods. The toddler is more likely to try a new food if its appearance or smell is familiar. Lack of complete taste discrimination places the toddler at risk of accidental ingestion. Communication and Language Development Language development occurs rapidly during the toddler years. The acquisition of language is a dynamic and complex process. The child's age and social interactions and the types of language to which he or she has been exposed influence language development. Receptive language development (the ability to understand what is being said or asked) is typically far more advanced than expressive language development (the ability to communicate one's desires and feelings) (Feigelman, 2007b; Goldson & Reynolds, 2011). In other words, the toddler understands language and is able to follow commands far sooner than he or she can actually use the words himself or herself. Language is a very important part of the toddler's ability to organize his or her world and actually make sense of it. Thoughtfully planned use of language can provide behavior guidance and contribute to the avoidance of power struggles. In regard to expressive language development, the young toddler begins to use short sentences and will progress to a vocabulary of 50 words by 2 years of age (Feigelman, 2007b; Goldson & Reynolds, 2011). Echolalia (repetition of words and phrases without understanding) normally occurs in toddlers younger than 30 months of age. \"Why\" and \"what\" questions dominate the older toddler's language. Telegraphic speech is common in the 3-year-old. Telegraphic speech refers to speech that contains only the essential words to get the point across, much like a telegram. Rather than \"I want a cookie and milk,\" the toddler might say, \"Want cookie milk.\" In telegraphic speech the nouns and verbs are present and are verbalized in the appropriate order (Feigelman, 2007b). Table 4.3 gives an overview of receptive and expressive language development in the toddler. Take Note! Stuttering usually has its onset between 2 and 4 years of age. It occurs more often in boys than in girls. About 75% of all cases of stuttering resolve within 1 to 2 years after they start (Prasse & Kikano, 2008). Early identification and referral of children with potential speech delays is critical. If a delay is identified, early intervention may increase the child's potential to acquire age-appropriate receptive and expressive language skills. Take Note! Children with preexisting conditions such as genetic syndromes that are known to have an effect on language development should be referred to a speech-language pathologist as soon as the condition is recognized rather than waiting until the child exhibits a delay. Of special concern in the toddler years is the development of speech and language in potentially bilingual children. At the age of 1 to 2 years, the potentially bilingual child may blend two languages\u2014that is, parts of the word in both languages are blended into one word. At age 2 to 3 years, the potentially bilingual toddler may mix languages within a sentence. Thus, the assessment of adequate language development is more complicated in bilingual children. There are websites that may be helpful to parents of potentially bilingual children, where they can find support and resources. A list of websites is included on at http://thePoint.lww.com/Kyle2e . Take Note! Bilingual children often mix languages, and thus speech delay may be more difficult to assess in this population. The bilingual child should have command of 20 words (between both languages) by 20 months of age and should be making word combinations. If this is not the case, further investigation may be warranted (Abell & Ey,2007). Emotional and Social Development Emotional development in the toddler years is focused on separation and individuation (Papalia & Feldman, 2011). Seeing oneself as separate from the parent or primary caregiver is accompanied by forming a sense of self and learning to exert control over one's environment. As this need to feel in control of his or her world emerges, the toddler displays egocentrism (focus on self). This need for control results in emotional lability: very happy and pleasant one moment, then overreacting to limit setting with a temper tantrum in the next moment (Brazelton & Sparrow, 2006). As toddlers identify the boundaries between themselves and the parent or primary caregiver, they learn to negotiate a balance between attachment and independence. Toddlers initially rely on the parents' communication and signals in order to initiate appropriate behavior or inhibit undesirable behavior. They have a difficult time choosing between sets of behaviors as they occur in different situations. Power struggles often occur in this age group, and it is important for parents and caregivers to thoughtfully and intentionally develop the rituals and routines that will provide stability and security for the toddler (Feigelman, 2007). Many toddlers rely on a security item (blanket, doll, or bear) to comfort themselves in stressful situations ( Fig. 4.5 ). This ability to self-soothe is a function of autonomy and is viewed as a sign of a nurturing environment, rather than, as one might suspect, one of neglect. FIGURE 4.5 The toddler may be able to self-soothe and produce a sense of comfort during this stage of establishing autonomy by relying upon a security item such as a doll, bear, or blanket. Children also begin to learn about gender differences in the toddler years. They observe the differences between male and female body parts if they are exposed to them. Toddlers may question parents about these differences and may begin to explore their own genitals. Toddlers also begin to understand and mimic social gender differences. They make observations about gender-specific behavior dependent upon what they are exposed to. Aggressive behaviors are typically displayed during the toddler years. Toddlers may hit, bite, or push other children and grab toys. Adults can assist the toddler in building empathy by pointing out when someone is hurt and explaining what happened. Toddlers should not be blamed for their impulsive behavior; rather, they should be guided toward socially acceptable actions in order to foster development of appropriate social judgment. It is particularly important for the parent or caregiver to serve as a role model forappropriate behavior, rather than losing his or her own temper, in order for the toddler to be able to learn how to acceptably handle frustrations. Offering limited choices is one way of allowing toddlers some control over their environment and helping them to establish a sense of mastery. Since toddlers naturally have a short attention span, they tend to dawdle. As the toddlers become more self- aware, they start to develop emotions of self-consciousness such as embarrassment and shame. Though toddlers are becoming more self-aware, they still do not have clear body boundaries. They do not clearly understand the body's functions, though they are beginning to make appropriate connections. Feces may be viewed as a part of the child, and the toddler may become upset at seeing it disappear in the toilet. The toddler will protect his or her body by resisting intrusive procedures such as temperature or blood pressure measurement (Hagan et al., 2008). Separation Anxiety As toddlers become increasingly skilled at mobility, they realize that if they have the capability of leaving, then so does the parent. As self-awareness develops and conflicts over closeness versus exploration occur, separation anxiety may reemerge in the 18- to 24- month period (Brazelton & Sparrow, 2006). Power struggles may escalate and distress at separating from the parent may increase. Again, a predictable routine with appropriate limit setting may help toddlers to feel safer and more secure during this period. From the age of 24 to 36 months, separation anxiety again eases. The older toddler begins to have a concept of object constancy: he or she has an internal representation of the parent or caregiver and is better able to tolerate separation, knowing that a reunion will occur. Temperament Temperament is the biological basis for personality. It is our emotional and motivational core, around which the personality develops over time (Child Development Institute, 2010). Temperament affects how the toddler interacts with the environment. The easygoing toddler may adapt more easily and not mind changes in routine as much as other toddlers. The easygoing toddler usually sleeps and eats well and has more predictable and regular behaviors. However, the toddler may still express frustration by having a temper tantrum. The \"difficult\" toddler is more likely to have intense reactions, negative or positive, with temper tantrums being more likely, more frequent, and more intense than in other toddlers. The structure and routine that toddlers need to feel secure are essential for the difficult toddler; otherwise, the child feels insecure and as a result is more likely to behave inappropriately. The difficult toddler is also the most active of the three temperament types. The slow-to-warm-up toddler is more of a loner and may be very shy. He or she may experience more difficulty with separation anxiety. The behavior of the slow-to-warm-up toddler is more passive; the toddler may be very watchful and withdrawn and may take longer to mature. Changes in routine usually do not result in as much upset, since the toddler's natural reaction is one of passivity (Feigelman, 2007). Based on the toddler's temperament, make suggestions to the parents for interacting with the toddler in various situations. For example, to avoid temper tantrums in the difficult toddler, suggest that the parent should be especially diligent about maintaining structure and routine as well as avoiding tantrum triggers such as fatigue and hunger. Explain to parents that they may need to exercise additional patience with new activities to which the slow-to-warm-up toddler may need extra time becoming accustomed. Fears Common fears of toddlers include loss of parents (which contributes to separation anxiety) and fear of strangers. Some toddlers may be very slow to warm up to people they do not know. The nurse caring for a toddler in the outpatient or hospital setting should take the time to establish a relationship with the toddler in order to allay the toddler's fears. Toddlers may be afraid of loud noises and large or unfamiliar animals. Going to sleep may be a scary time for toddlers as they may be afraid of the dark. A nightlight in the toddler's room may be very helpful. Moral and Spiritual Development During the toddler years, children may feel comfort from the routine of praying, but they do not understand religious beliefs because of their limited cognitive abilities. Reading simple Bible stories can lay a foundation for later religious teachings. Kohlberg's (1984) description of moral development places the older toddler in the preconventional level. The toddler is only just beginning to learn right from wrong and does not understand the larger concept of morality. The toddler will base his or her actions on the avoidance of punishment and the attainment of pleasure. Older toddlers begin to feel empathy for others. Cultural Influences on Growth and Development Homelessness or poverty may directly influence the toddler's ability to grow adequately, as resources for the purchase andpreparation of appropriate food may be lacking. Appropriate toys (safe ones) may also not be available in those situations. Food customs continue to have an impact on the child's diet and ability to ingest appropriate nutrients. Individual families' value systems have an impact on the toddler's development as well. Some parents desire to keep their child a \"baby\" for a longer period, thus delaying weaning or continuing to feed the child baby food or pureed food for a longer period. Other families may highly value independence and encourage the toddler to walk everywhere on his or her own rather than carrying the child. Culture may also affect emotional development. Some families start at a very young age to discourage crying in boys, encouraging them to \"act like a big boy\" or \"be a man.\" Ridicule for crying at this age may hurt the toddler's self-concept. Educating families about normal growth and development while continuing to value and support cultural practices is important (Papalia & Feldman, 2011). Remember Jose Gonzales, whom you met at the beginning of the chapter? What developmental milestones would you expect him to have reached at his age?THE NURSE'S ROLE IN TODDLER GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT The toddler's growth and development affects his or her everyday life as well as the family's. Though some toddlers may grow more quickly or reach developmental milestones sooner than others, growth and development remains orderly and sequential. Health care visits throughout toddlerhood continue to focus on growth and development. The nurse must have a good understanding of the changes that occur during the toddler years in order to provide appropriate anticipatory guidance and support to the family. FIGURE 4.6 The hospitalized toddler continues to enjoy developmental tasks appropriate for his or her age, such as playing with manipulative toys. When the toddler is hospitalized, growth and development may be altered. The toddler's primary task is establishing autonomy, and the toddler's focus is mobility and language development. Hospitalization removes most opportunities for the toddler to learn through exploration of the environment. Isolation for contagious illness further constrains the toddler's ability to find some control over the environment. The nurse caring for the hospitalized toddler must use knowledge of normal growth and development to be successful in interactions with the toddler, promote continued development, and recognize delays (see Chapter 11 ) ( Fig. 4.6 ). NURSING PROCESS OVERVIEW Upon completion of assessment of the toddler's current growth and development status, problems or issues related to growth and development may be identified. The nurse may then identify one or more nursing diagnoses, including but not limited to: Delayed growth and development Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements Interrupted family processes Readiness for enhanced parenting Risk for caregiver role strain Risk for delayed development Risk for disproportionate growth Risk for injury Nursing care planning for the toddler with growth and development issues should be individualized based on the toddler's and family's needs. The nursing care plan may be used as a guide in planning nursing care for the toddler with a growth or developmental concern. The nurse may choose the appropriate nursing diagnoses from the Nursing Care Plan (p. 110) and individualize them as needed. The nursing care plan is intended to serve as a guide only and is not intended to bean inclusive growth and development plan. Promoting Healthy Growth and Development Parents who give their toddler love and respect regardless of the child's gender, behavior, or capabilities are helping to lay the foundation for self-esteem. Self-esteem is also built through familiarity with the daily routine. Routine and ritual help toddlers develop a conscience. Making expectations known through everyday routines helps to avoid confrontations. If the toddler knows the routine, he or she knows what to expect and how he or she is expected to act. When routine and limits are absent, the toddler develops feelings of uncertainty and anxiety. Limit setting (and remaining consistent with those limits) helps toddlers master their behavior, develop self- esteem, and become successful participants in the family. Children then are able to learn about cooperation throughout the predictable flow of daily life. Nurses need to be aware of normal developmental expectations in order to determine whether the toddler is progressing appropriately. Table 4.4 lists potential signs of developmental delay. Any toddler with one or more of these concerns should be referred for further developmental evaluation. NURSING CARE PLAN 4.1 Growth and Development Issues in the Toddler NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for injury related to curiosity, increased mobility, and developmental immaturity Outcome Identification and Evaluation Toddler safety will be maintained: Toddler will remain free from injury. Interventions: Preventing Injury Teach and encourage appropriate use of rear-facing car seat until 2 years of age and forward-facing car seat after 2 years of age to decrease risk of toddler injury related to motor vehicles. Teach toddlers to stay away from the street and provide constant supervision to prevent pedestrian injury. Require bicycle helmet use while riding any wheeled toy to prevent head injury and form habit of helmet use. Childproof the home to provide a developmentally safe environment for the curious and increasingly mobile toddler. Post poison control center phone number in case of accidental ingestion. Never leave a toddler unattended in a tub or pool or near any body of water to prevent drowning. Teach parents first-aid measures and child CPR to minimize consequences of injury should it occur. Provide close observation and keep side rails up on crib/bed in hospital because toddlers are at particularly high risk for falling or becoming entangled in tubing as they attempt mobility. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to inappropriate nutritional intake to sustain growth needs (excess juice or milk intake, inadequate food variety intake) as evidenced by failure to attain adequate increases in height and weight over time Outcome Identification and Evaluation Toddler will consume adequate nutrients while using an appropriate feeding pattern: Toddler will demonstrate weight gain and increases in height. Interventions: Promoting Appropriate Nutrition Assess current feeding schedule and usual intake, as well as methods used to feed, to determine areas of adequacy versus inadequacy. Determine toddler's ability to drink from cup, finger feed, swallow, and consume textures to determine if additional exposure is needed or if further interventions such as speech or occupational therapy are required. Weigh toddler daily on same scale if hospitalized, weekly on same scale if at home, and plot growth patterns weekly or monthly as appropriate on standardized growth charts to determine if growth is improving. Wean from bottle by 15 months of age to discourage excess milk or juice intake in toddler who can carry bottle around. Limit juice to 4 to 6 ounces per day and milk to 16 to 24 ounces per day to discourage sense of fullness achieved with excess milk or juice intake, thereby increasing appetite for solid foods. Provide three nutrient-dense meals and at least two healthy snacks per day to encourage adequate nutrient consumption. Feed toddler on a similar schedule daily, without distractions and with the family: toddlers respond well to routine and structure and may eat better in the social context of meals, and they become distracted easily (TV should be off). NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Delayed growth and development related to motor, cognitive, language, or psychosocial concerns as evidenced by delay in meeting expected milestones Outcome Identification and Evaluation Development will be enhanced: Toddler will make continued progress toward realization of expected developmental milestones. Interventions: Enhancing Growth and Development Screen for developmental capabilities to determine toddler's current level of functioning. Offer age-appropriate toys, play, and activities (including gross motor) to encourage further development. Perform interventions as prescribed by physical, occupational, or speech therapist: participation in those activities helps to promote function and accomplish acquisition of developmental skills. Provide support to families of toddlers with developmental delay (progress in achieving developmental milestones can be slow and ongoing motivation is needed). Reinforce positive attributes in the toddler to maintain motivation. Model age-appropriate communication skills to illustrate suitable means for parenting the toddler. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for disproportionate growth related to excess milk or juice intake, late bottle weaning, and consumption of inappropriate foods or in excess amounts Outcome Identification and Evaluation Toddler will grow appropriately and not become overweight or obese: Toddler will achieve weight and height within the 5th to 95th percentiles on standardized growth charts. Interventions: Promoting Proportionate Growth Wean from bottle and discourage use of no-spill sippy cups by 15 months of age (will keep mobile toddler from carrying around and continually drinking from cup or bottle). Provide juice (4-6 ounces per day) and milk (16-24 ounces per day) from a cup at meal and snack time to encourage appropriate cup drinking and limit intake of nutrient-poor, high-calorie fluids. Provide only nutrient-rich foods without high sugar content for meals and snacks; even if the toddler won't eat, it is inappropriate to provide high-calorie junk food just so the toddler eats something. Ensure adequate physical activity to stimulate development of motor skills and provide appropriate caloric expenditure. This also sets the stage for forming life- long habit of appropriate physical activity. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Interrupted family processes related to issues with toddler development, hospitalization, or situational crisis as evidenced by decreased parental visitation in hospital, parental verbalization of difficulty with current situation, possible crisis related to health of family member other than the toddler Outcome Identification and Evaluation Family will demonstrate adequate functioning: Family will display coping and psychosocial adjustment. Interventions: Enhancing Family Functioning Assess the family's level of stress and ability to cope to determine family's ability to cope with multiple stressors. Engage in family-centered care to provide a holistic approach to care of the toddler and family. Encourage the family to verbalize feelings (verbalization is one method of decreasing anxiety levels), and acknowledge feelings and emotions. Encourage family visitation and provide for sleeping arrangements for a parent or caregiver to stay in the hospital with the toddler (contributes to family's sense of control of situation). Involve family members in toddler's care, giving them a feeling of control and connectedness. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Readiness for enhanced parenting related to parental desire for increased skills and success with toddler as evidenced by current healthy relationships and verbalization of desire for improved skills Outcome Identification and Evaluation Parent will provide safe and nurturing environment for the toddler. Interventions: Increasing Parenting Skill Set Use family-centered care to provide holistic approach. Educate parent about normal toddler development to provide basis for understanding the parenting skills needed in this time period. Acknowledge and encourage parent's verbalization of feelings related to chronic illness of child or difficulty with normal toddler behavior to validate the normalcy of the parent's feelings. Encourage positive parenting with respect to toddlers and their normal development (helps parents develop approaches to toddlers that can be used in place of anger and frustration). Acknowledge and admire positive parenting skills already present to contribute to parents' confidence in their abilities to parent. Role model appropriate parenting behaviors related to communicating with and disciplining the toddler (role modeling actually shows rather than just telling the parent what to do).Promoting Growth and Development Through Play Play is the major socializing medium for toddlers. Parents should limit television viewing and encourage creative and physical play instead. Toddlers typically play alongside another child (parallel play ) rather than cooperatively ( Fig. 4.7 ). The short attention span of the toddler will make him or her often change toys and types of play. It is important to provide a variety of safe toys to allow the toddler many different opportunities for exploring the environment. Toddlers do not need expensive toys; in fact, regular household items sometimes make the most enjoyable toys. Toddlers are egocentric, a normal part of their development (Piaget, 1969). This makes it difficult for them to share. As they are developing a sense of self (who they are as a person), they may see their toys as an extension of themselves. Learning to share occurs in later toddlerhood. Toddlers also like dramatic play and play that recreates familiar activities in the home. Toddlers like to listen to music of all kinds and will often dance to whatever they hear on the radio. Toddlers enjoy drums, xylophones, cymbals, and toy pianos. Musical instruments made at home are also enjoyed. A few pebbles or coins inside an empty water bottle with the top tightly secured is a great music maker; an empty butter tub with a lid and a pair of wooden spoons makes a nice drum.FIGURE 4.7 Parallel play. The toddler usually plays alongside another child rather than cooperatively. FIGURE 4.8 Toddlers love outdoor physical play, such as climbing on playground equipment. An adult should always supervise toddlers when they are playing outdoors. Adequate physical activity is necessary for the development and refinement of movement skills. Toddlers need at least 30 minutes of structured physical activity and anywhere from 1 to several hours of unstructured physical activity per day (National Association for Sport & Physical Education, 2011). Indoor and outdoor play areas should encourage play activities that use the large muscle groups. The activity must occur within a safe environment. Outdoor play structures should be positioned over surfaces that are soft enough to absorb a fall, such as sand, wood chips, or sawdust ( Fig. 4.8 ). Box 4.1 lists recommended age-appropriate toys. Promoting Early Learning The parent-child relationship and the interactions between parent and child form the context for the toddler's early learning.Promoting Language Development Talking and singing to the toddler during routine activities such as feeding and dressing provides an environment that encourages conversation. Frequent, repetitive naming helps the toddler learn appropriate words for objects. The parent or caregiver should be attentive to what the toddler is saying as well as to his or her moods. Using clarification validates the toddler's emotions and ideas. Parents should listen to and answer the toddler's questions. They should sit down quietly with the toddler and gently repeat what the toddler is saying. Encouragement and elaboration convey confidence and interest to the toddler. The toddler needs time to complete his or her thoughts without being interrupted or rushed because he or she is just starting to be able to make the connections necessary to transfer thoughts and feelings into language. BOX 4.1 APPROPRIATE TOYS FOR TODDLERS Familiar household items such as plastic bowls and cups of various sizes, large plastic serving utensils, pots and pans, wooden spoons, cardboard boxes and tubes (from paper towel rolls), old magazines, baskets, purses, hats Child-size household item toys (kitchen, broom, vacuum cleaner, lawnmower, telephone, and so on) Blocks, cars and trucks, plastic animals, trains, plastic figures (family, community helpers), simple dolls, stuffed animals, balls, doll beds and carriages Manipulative toys with knobs, wind-ups, and buttons that make things happen; putting large pegs or shapes into matching holes; stringing large beads on shoelaces; blocks and containers that stack; jigsaw puzzles with large pieces; toys that can be taken apart and put back together again Gross motor toys: play gym, push and pull toys, wagons, tricycle or other ride-on toys, tunnels Tape or CD players for music, various musical instruments Chalk, large crayons, finger paint, Play-Doh, washable markers Bucket, plastic shovel, and other containers for sand and water play Squeaking, floating, and squirting toys for the bath Adapted from Schuman, A. T. (2007). The ABCs of toy safety: More than just child's play. Contemporary Pediatrics, 24(7), 49-57, 64; and Shelov, S. P., & Altmann, T. R. (Eds.). (2009). Caring for your baby and young child: Birth to age 5 (5th ed.). New York: Bantam Books. Parents should not overreact to the child's use of the word \"no.\" They can give the toddler opportunities to use the word \"no\" appropriately by asking silly questions such as, \"Can a cat drive a car?\" or \"Is a banana purple?\" When promoting language development, the parent or primary caregiver should teach the toddler appropriate words for body parts and objects and should help the toddler choose appropriate words to label feelings and emotions. Toddlers' receptive language and interpretation of body language and subtle signs far surpass their expressive language, especially at a younger age (Feigelman, 2007b; Goldson & Reynolds, 2011). Parents should avoid discussing scary or serious topics in the presence of the toddler, since the toddler is very adept at reading emotions. If the parents speak a foreign language in addition to English, both languages should be used in the home.FIGURE 4.9 Reading to a toddler daily is one of the best ways to promote language development and school readiness. Encouraging Reading Reading to the toddler every day is one of the best ways to promote language and cognitive development ( Fig. 4.9 ). Toddlers particularly enjoy homemade or purchased books about feelings, family, friends, everyday life, animals and nature, and fun and fantasy. Board books have thick pages that are easier for young toddlers to turn; older toddlers can turn paper pages one at a time. The toddler may also enjoy \"reading\" the story to the parent. Reach Out and Read, a program designed to promote early literacy, offers tips for reading with young children (see Teaching Guidelines 4.1 ). Teaching Guidelines 4.1 TIPS FOR READING WITH YOUNG CHILDREN Make reading part of every day: Read at bedtime or on the bus. Have fun: Children who love books learn to read. Books can be part of special time with your child. A few minutes is OK: Young children can sit for only a few minutes for a story, but as they grow they will sit longer. Talk about the pictures: You do not have to read the book to tell a story. Let your child turn the pages: Babies need board books and help to turn pages, but your 3-year-old can do it alone. Show your child the cover page: Explain what the story is about. Show your child the words: Run your finger along the words as you read them. Make the story come alive: Create voices for the story characters and use your body to tell the story. Ask questions about the story: What do you think will happen next? What is this? Let your child ask questions about the story: Use the story as an opportunity to engage in conversation and to talk about familiar activities and objects. Let your child tell the story: Children as young as 3 years old can memorize a story, and many children love an opportunity to express their creativity. Used with permission from Reach Out and Read. (2011). Reading tips. Retrieved March 7, 2011, from http://www.reachoutandread.org/FileRepository/ReadingTips.pdfChoosing a Preschool The older toddler may benefit from the structure and socialization provided by attending preschool. Attending preschool will help the toddler become more mature and independent and give the toddler a different source for a sense of accomplishment. At this age, toddlers need supervised play with some direction that fosters their cognitive development. A strict curriculum is not necessary in this age group. When choosing a preschool, the parent or caregiver should look for an environment that has the following qualities: Goals and an overall philosophy with which the parents agree (promotion of independence and self-confidence through structured and free play) Teachers and assistants trained in early childhood development as well as child cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) Small class sizes and an adult-to-child ratio with which the parent feels comfortable Disciplinary procedures consistent with the parents' values Parents can visit at any time School is childproofed inside and out Appropriate hygiene procedures, including prohibiting sick children from attending Teach the parents how to ease the toddler's transition to attending preschool. Encourage parents to talk about going to preschool and visit the school a couple of times. On the first day, parents should calmly and in a matter-of-fact tone tell the toddler that they will return to pick him or her up. If the toddler expresses separation anxiety, the parent should remain calm and follow through with the plan for school attendance. After a few days of attendance, the toddler will be accustomed to the new routine and crying when parting from the parent should be minimal. Promoting Safety Safety is of prime concern throughout the toddler period. Curiosity, mobility, and lack of impulse control all contribute to the incidence of unintentional injury in toddlerhood. Even the most watchful and caring parents have toddlers who run into the street, otherwise disappear from parents, and fall down the stairs. Toddlers require direct observation and cannot be trusted to be left alone. A childproof environment provides a safe place for the toddler to explore and learn. Motor vehicle accidents, drowning, choking, burns, falls, and poisoning are the most common injuries suffered by toddlers. Safety and injury prevention focuses on these categories. Safety in the Car The safest place for the toddler to ride is in the back seat of the car. Parents should use the appropriate size and style of car seat for the child's weight and age as required by the state. At a minimum, toddlers should be in a rear-facing car seat with harness straps and a clip until 2 years of age (American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP], 2011a). After age 2 years, a forward-facing seat may be used. A toddler riding in a pickup truck should never ride in the cargo area or truck bed. A full rear seat in the truck is the preferred placement for the toddler car seat. If an appropriate rear seat is unavailable, the air bag should be disarmed and the forward-facing car seat should be secured appropriately in the truck seat. The lower anchor and top tether are additionally required for all forward-facing car seats manufactured since 2002 and are accommodated by motor vehicles manufactured since that time ( Fig. 4.10 ). In older vehicles or car seats, seat belts are utilized for installation. Drivers should avoid using the cell phone or attempting to intervene with the children while they are driving. Excellent resources about car seat safety appropriate for both parents and professionals can be found on Safety in the Home Key areas of concern for keeping toddlers safe in the home include avoiding exposure to tobacco smoke, preventing injury, and preventing poisoning. AVOIDING EXPOSURE TO TOBACCO SMOKE Environmental exposure to tobacco smoke has been associated with increased risk of respiratory disease and infection, decreased lung function, and increased incidence of middle ear effusion and recurrent otitis media. It may also hinder neurodevelopment and may be associated with behavior problems (World Health Organization, 2011). Parents should avoid cigarette smoking entirely to best protect their children. Even smoking outside of the home is suboptimal because smoke lingers on parents' clothing and children who are often carried (such as younger toddlers) face more exposure. Counsel parents to stop smoking (optimal), but if they continue smoking never to smoke inside the home or car with children present. PREVENTING INJURYThe toddler is able to open drawers and doors, unlock deadbolts, and climb anywhere he or she wants to go. Toddlers have a limited concept of body boundaries and essentially no fear of danger. Toddlers may fall from any height to which they can climb (e.g., play structures, tables, counters). They may also fall from wheeled toys such as tricycles. As toddlers gain additional height and hand dexterity they are able to reach potentially dangerous items on the counter or stove, leading to an accidental ingestion, burn, or cut. To prevent injury in the home, stress the following to parents: Never leave a toddler unsupervised out of doors. Lock doors to dangerous rooms. FIGURE 4.10 A lower anchor and top tether secure the forward-facing car seat. (Adapted from U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2008.) Install safety gates at the top and bottom of staircases. Ensure that window locks are operable; if windows are left opened, then secure all window screens. Keep pot handles on the stove turned inward, out of an inquisitive toddler's reach. Teach the toddler to avoid the oven, stove, and iron. Keep electrical equipment, cords, and matches out of reach. Remove firearms from the home, or keep them in a locked cabinet out of the toddler's reach. Always require the child to wear a helmet approved by the Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC) when riding a wheeled toy. This starts the habit of helmet wearing early, so it can be more easily carried over to the bicycle-riding years of the future. Begin teaching the toddler about watching for cars when crossing the street, but always carry or hold the hand of the toddler when crossing the street. Teach the toddler to avoid unknown animals (AAP, 2010b, 2010c). Take Note! \"Bernie Burn',\" by Sarah Cruz, RN, is a book designed to educate parents and their toddlers about burn prevention while entertaining them. It is endorsed by the American Journal of Nursing, a link to which can be found on PREVENTING POISONING As toddlers become more mobile, they are increasingly able to explore their environment and more easily and efficiently gain access to materials that may be unsafe for them to handle. Their natural curiosity leads them into situations that may place them in danger. Poor taste discrimination in this age group allows for ingestion of chemicals or other materials that older children would find too unpleasant to swallow. Box 4.2 lists most potentially dangerous ingested poisons. Discuss poison prevention in the home at each well-child visit (see Healthy People 2020). The American Academy of Pediatrics (2010c) recommends that potentially poisonous substances (e.g., medications, cleaners, hair care products, car care products) be stored out of the toddler's teach, out of the toddler's sight, and in a childproof, locked cabinet. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov .

(2011). Poisoning prevention FAQ. Retrieved March 7, 2011, from http://www.aapcc.org/dnn/PoisoningPrevention/FAQ.aspx Encourage all families to take the following safety measures: Store all substances in original containers only. Never store any liquid other than soda in a soda pop bottle. Do not allow toddlers access to baby powder, lotion, cream, or other toddler hygiene products. Ensure all medications have child-safety caps. Do not leave within the toddler's reach medications such as lozenges or samples that are not packaged in safety bottles. Be very careful with medications that are provided in transdermal patch form. Do not refer to medicines as candy, as the toddler may mistake pills for candy and ingest them. Do not expose toddlers to hazardous vapors such as paints, cleaners, tobacco smoke, and especially street drugs such as crack and marijuana. Keep \"button\" batteries secured and away from a toddler's reach. Keep house plants off the floor, remove them from the home, or hang them or place them on a high shelf (American Association of Poison Control Centers, 2011; Hagan et al., 2008). Take Note! The American Academy of Pediatrics (2003) recommends that all families post the Poison Control Center number in a readily accessible place in the home: (800) 222- 1222. The AAP discourages the use of syrup of ipecac in the home to induce vomiting after an accidental ingestion. Safety in the Water Drowning is the leading cause of unintentional injury and death in US children, with the highest rate of drowning occurring in 1- to 2- year-olds (AAP, 2010a). Drowning may occur in very small volumes of water such as a toilet, bucket, or bathtub, as well as the obvious sites such as swimming pools and other bodies of water. Toddlers' large heads in relation to their body size place them at risk for toppling over into a body of water that they are inquisitive about. Toddlers should be supervised at all times when in or around the water. In general, most children do not have the physical and cognitive capabilities necessary to truly learn how to swim until 4 years of age (AAP, 2010a). Parents who want to enroll a toddler in a swimming class should be aware that a water safety skills class would be most appropriate. However, even toddlers who have completed a swimming program still need constant supervision in the water (AAP, 2010a). Box 4.3 gives recommendations for the prevention of drowning. BOX 4.3PREVENTING DROWNING Pools should be fenced with locked gates or screened with locked doors. Interior doors should be kept locked. Young children should never be left unattended in or near water. Water wings or \"floaties\" are not a substitute for adult supervision or for personal flotation devices. U.S. Coast Guard-approved life preservers or personal flotation devices should be available when a young child is in or near a body of water. Parents and caregivers should be trained in child cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Adapted from American Academy of Pediatrics, Committee on Injury, Violence, and Poison Prevention. (2010). Prevention of drowning. Pediatrics, 126, 178-185. Remember Jose Gonzales, the 2-year-old introduced at the beginning of the chapter? What anticipatory guidance related to safety should you provide to his parents? Promoting Nutrition The toddler's ability to chew and swallow is improving, and he or she learns to use utensils effectively to feed himself or herself. The early years lay a foundation for the future, and a great deal of parental and societal interest is focused on nutrition and eating. Forming healthy eating habits has its foundation early in life, and diet has significant influence upon the child's future health status. By establishing healthier food choice patterns early in life, the child is better able to continue these healthy choices later in life. The child younger than 2 years of age should not have his or her fat intake restricted, but this does not mean that unhealthy foods such as sweets should be eaten liberally. A diet high in nutrient-rich foods and low in nutrient-poor high-calorie foods such as sweets is appropriate for children of all ages. See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Weaning The timing of weaning from breastfeeding is influenced by a number of factors such as cultural beliefs, local and regional ethnic beliefs, the mother's work schedule, desired child spacing, or societal feelings about the nature of the mother-infant relationship. The extent and duration of breastfeeding are inversely related to the development of obesity later in life: children who breastfeed longer are less likely to become obese than those who breastfeed for shorter periods of time (AAP, 2007b). Thus, extending breastfeeding into toddlerhood is believed to be beneficial to the child. Extended breastfeeding provides nutritional, immunologic, and emotional benefits to the child. Contrary to popular belief, it is biologically possible to become pregnant while breastfeeding. Breastfeeding a newborn appropriately can occur while continuing to nurse the older sibling. Weaning from breastfeeding tends to occur earlier in the United States than in countries around the world, despite recommendations on length of breastfeeding by a number of organizations. Most professional organizations recommend breastfeeding for at least 1 year (National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners [NAPNAP], 2007). Weaning is a highly individualized decision. Educate the mother about the benefits of extended breastfeeding and support her in her decision to wean at a given time. Weaning from the bottle should occur by 12 to 15 months of age. Prolonged bottle-feeding is associated with the development of dental caries. No-spill \"sippy cups\" contain a valve that requires sucking by the toddler in order to obtain fluid, thus functioning similar to a baby bottle. Hence, no-spill sippy cups can also be associated with dental caries and are not recommended (Rychnovsky, 2000). Cups with spouts that do not contain valves are acceptable. The 12- to 15-month-old is developmentally capable of consumingadequate fluid amounts using a cup. Teaching About Nutritional Needs Adequate calcium intake and appropriate exercise lay the foundation for proper bone mineralization. The toddler requires an average intake of 500 mg calcium per day (Heird, 2007a). Dairy products are considered the primary sources of dietary calcium. One cup of low-fat or whole milk, 8 ounces of low-fat yogurt, and 1% ounces of cheddar cheese each provide 300 mg of calcium. Broccoli, oranges, sweet potatoes, tofu, and dried beans or legumes are also good sources of calcium (35 to 120 mg calcium per serving). Take Note! Though a half-cup of cooked spinach contains 120 mg of calcium, it is essentially nonbioavailable, making spinach a poor source of calcium. Iron-deficiency anemia in the first 2 years of life may be associated with developmental and psychomotor delays (Baker, Greer, & the Committee on Nutrition, 2010). Although it is important for toddlers to consume adequate amounts of iron, they tend to have the lowest daily iron intake of any age group. When breastfeeding or formula feeding ends (most often at 1 year of age), it is often replaced with iron-poor cow's milk. Limiting milk intake to 16 ounces per day, as well as limiting juice intake, can be helpful. Encourage the parents to provide iron-fortified cereals and other foods rich in iron and vitamin C. Take Note! Toddlers who consume a strictly vegan diet (no food from animal sources) are at risk for deficiencies in vitamin D, vitamin B 12 , and iron. Supplementation with these nutrients should occur to promote adequate nutrition and growth (Heird, 2007b). Fat or cholesterol intake should not be restricted in children younger than age 2 years. The first 2 years of life require high energy intake because they are a time of very rapid growth and development. To promote healthy cholesterol levels, children older than age 2 years should consume a diet with a total fat content between 20% and 30% of total calories. Saturated fats should account for less than 10% of total calories (Heird, 2007b). Due to daily variations and the pickiness of the toddler, fat intake should be evaluated over a period of several days. The daily recommended intake of fiber for a 1- to 3-year-old is 19 grams. Generally, toddler serving sizes should be about two-thirds that of an older child. Box 4.4 lists common sources of several nutrients. BOX 4.4 KEY NUTRIENTS PROVIDED BY FRUITS AND VEGETABLES Dietary fiber: applesauce, carrots, corn, green beans, mangos, pears Folate: avocados, broccoli, green peas, oranges, spinach and dark greens, strawberries Vitamin A: apricots, cantaloupe, carrots, mangos, spinach and dark greens, sweet potatoes Vitamin C: broccoli, cantaloupe, green peas, oranges, potatoes, strawberries, tomatoes Adapted from Brown, J. (2011). Nutrition now (6th ed.). Florence, KY: Wadsworth Publishing. Parents should encourage toddlers to drink water. Juice intake should be limited to 4 to 6 ounces per day. Milk intake should be limited to 16 to 24 ounces per day. Juice and milk should be served along with meals or snacks. Water should be offered for between-meal drinking. Toddlers should drink from a cup. Advancing Solid Foods Parents should offer three full meals and two snacks daily. Portion sizes for toddlers are about one-quarter the size of adult portions. Large portions of a new or different food on the toddler's plate may intimidate the toddler. Normal toddler behaviors of mouthing, handling, tasting, extruding the food from the mouth, and then resampling the food often occur. These behaviors are distasteful to some parents but are a normal part of toddler development. Parents need to understand and tolerate these behaviors rather than scolding the toddler for them (Brazelton & Sparrow, 2006). Toddlers are often afraid to try new things anyway, so the parent or care-giver should be flexible with the toddler's acceptance or rejection of new foods. If the toddler refuses healthy food choices at meal or snack time, parents should not substitute high-fat, high-sugar, processed food \"just to make sure he's eating something\" (Weaver, More, & Harris, 2008). This sets the stage for future power struggles. The parent decides which foods will be served oroffered. The toddler decides how much will be eaten. The toddler self-regulates the amount of food needed to sustain and allow further growth and development. The toddler may not eat well every day but generally, over the course of several days, will consume the foods he or she needs (Heird, 2007b). Foods should be served near room temperature. Some of the food on the plate should be soft and moist. Food should always be cut into bite-size pieces. Teaching Guidelines 4.2 gives recommendations on ways to prevent choking. Teaching Guidelines 4.2 AVOIDING CHOKING Slowly add foods that are more difficult to chew as the toddler becomes more adept at chewing. Cut all foods into bite-sized pieces. Avoid foods that are hard to chew and may become lodged in the airway, such as: Nuts Gumdrops or other chewy candies Raw carrots Peanut butter (by itself) Popcorn Cut hotdogs and grapes into quarters. Cook carrots until soft; if serving raw, then grate them. Always supervise the toddler while he or she is eating. Adapted from Brown, J. (2011). Nutrition now (6th ed.). Florence, KY: Wadsworth Publishing. Promoting Self-Feeding Toddlers most often eat with their fingers, but they do need to learn to use utensils properly. The following are suggestions for parents: Use a child-sized spoon and fork with dull tines. Seat the toddler in a high chair or at a comfortable height in a secure chair. The toddler should have his or her feet supported rather than dangling ( Fig. 4.11 ). Never leave the toddler unattended while eating. Minimize distractions during mealtime. Turn off the television and serve food to the toddler along with the other members of the family (NAPNAP, 2011). Promoting Healthy Eating Habits Since the toddler's rate of growth has slowed somewhat compared to that in infancy, the toddler requires less caloric intake for his or her size compared to the infant. This results in physiologic anorexia: toddlers simply do not require as much food intake for their size as they did in infancy. The toddler will also exhibit food jags . During a food jag, the toddler may prefer only one particular food for several days, then not want it for weeks. Again, it is important for the parent to continue to offer healthy food choices during a food jag and not give in by allowing the toddler to eat junk food (NAPNAP, 2011). The normal developmental issue of testing limits will also occur for the toddler at mealtime. Since toddlers still have limited ability to express their emotions with words, they use nonverbal behaviors to do so. While eating, the toddler may dislike the taste of a particular food or experience a feeling of fullness but will communicate that feeling by screaming or throwing food. When the child exhibits these behaviors, the parent must remain calm and remove the toddler from the situation. Meals should be eaten in a calm and pleasant environment. Parents should serve as role models for appropriate eating habits, but toddlers may also be willing to try more foods if they are exposed to other children who eat those foods. Praise the child for trying a new food, and never punish the toddler for refusing to try something new. A new food may need to be offered many times in a row before the toddler chooses to try it. Parents should be sure to include foods the child is familiar with and likes to eat at the same meal that the new food is being introduced (Cathey & Gaylord, 2004). Teaching Guidelines 4.3 lists alternative foods that meet nutritional needs and a list of books for parents of the picky eater.FIGURE 4.11 The toddler should be appropriately and safely seated in the high chair. The safety strap is secure, the toddler's feet are supported, and the tray table is locked in place. Teaching Guidelines 4.3 MEETING NUTRITIONAL NEEDS OF THE PICKY EATER Alternative Food Choices for the Picky Eater Won't drink milk? Obtain calcium through yogurt (frozen or regular), cheese, pudding, and hot cocoa. Poor meat intake? Obtain iron through unsweetened iron-fortified cereals or breakfast bars, or raisins; cook with an iron skillet. Loves processed white bread? Encourage fiber intake with fresh fruits and vegetables, bran muffins, beans, or peas (can be in soup). Refuses vegetables? Encourage vitamin A intake with apricots, sweet potatoes, and vegetable juices. Books for parents of the Picky Eater Coping with a Picky Eater: A Guide for the Perplexed Parent by W. Wilkoff.

Preventing Overweight and Obesity In the child younger than 3 years of age, the greatest risk factor for the development of overweight or obesity is having an obese parent (AAP, 2007b). The nurse can screen for overweight in the child older than 2 years of age by calculating the body mass index (BMI) and plotting the BMI on the standardized age- and gender-appropriate growth charts (see Appendix A for growth charts, andrefer to Chapter 10 for BMI calculation instructions). Trends over time may be predictive of the development of overweight or obesity. Another factor in development of obesity in young children is juice intake (AAP, 2007a). Since most young children like the sweet taste of juice, they may drink excessive amounts of it. Toddlers who drink excess fruit juice and eat well may develop overweight or obesity because of the high sugar content in the juice. On the other end of the spectrum, some children may actually feel full from juice consumption and decrease their intake of solid foods. These children are at risk for malnutrition. Fruit juice intake should be limited to 4 to 6 ounces per day. Take Note! Young children should consume only pasteurized juice, as unpasteurized juice consumption places the toddler at increased risk of Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Cryptosporidium infection. Refer back to Jose Gonzales. What questions should you ask his parents related to his nutritional intake? What anticipatory guidance related to nutrition would be appropriate? Promoting Healthy Sleep and Rest The 18-month-old requires 13.5 hours of sleep per day, the 24-month-old 13 hours, and the 3-year-old 12 hours (Feigelman, 2007a, 2007b). A typical toddler should sleep through the night and take one daytime nap. Most children discontinue daytime napping at around 3 years of age. The toddler who slept in a crib as an infant will need to move to a youth or toddler bed or even a full-size bed usually sometime in the toddler period. When the crib becomes unsafe (i.e., when the toddler becomes physically capable of climbing over the rails), then he or she must make the transition to a bed. Consistent bedtime rituals help the toddler prepare for sleep. Choose a bedtime and stick to it as much as possible. The nightly routine might include a bath followed by reading a story. The routine should be a calm period with minimal outside distractions. Toddlers often require a security item to help them get to sleep. Older toddlers may be afraid of the dark, so a nightlight is often helpful. Night waking is a problem for some toddlers. This may occur as a result of change in routine or as a desire for nighttime attention. Attention during night waking should be minimized so that the toddler receives no reward for being awake at night. The book Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems, by Dr. Richard Ferber (2006, New York: Fireside Publishing), is an excellent resource for the family with a toddler who resists bedtime or is a persistent night waker. For some toddlers, night waking is caused by nightmares. As the imagination and capacity for make-believe grow, the toddler may not be able to distinguish between reality and pretend. The parent should hold and comfort the toddler after a nightmare. Limiting television viewing (especially shortly before bedtime) may be helpful in limiting nightmares. Some families practice \"co-sleeping\" (when children sleep in the parents' bed). Although some professionals believe that co- sleeping may interfere with the toddler's struggle for independence, this theory has not been proven. The nurse should support the family's choice for sleep arrangements unless the co-sleeping is unsafe either physically or psychologically ( SafeBedSharing.org , 2011). Refer to http://www.safebedsharing.org for bed-sharing safety guidelines. Provide anticipatory guidance to Jose Gonzales' parents in r elation to his sleep. Promoting Healthy Teeth and Gums By 30 months of age, the toddler should have a full set of primary (\"baby\") teeth. Parents may not be aware of the importance of preventing cavities in primary teeth since they will eventually be replaced by the permanent teeth. Poor oral hygiene, prolonged use of a bottle or no-spill sippy cup, lack of fluoride intake, and delayed or absent professional dental care may all contribute to the development of dental caries (Wagner & Oskouian, 2008). Cleaning of the toddler's teeth should progress from brushing with simply water to using a very small amount (pea-sized) of fluoridated toothpaste with brushing beginning at 2 years of age ( Fig. 4.12 ). Weaning from the bottle no later than 15 months of age and severely restricting use of a no-spill sippy cup (the kind that requires sucking for fluid delivery) is recommended.FIGURE 4.12 The parent should brush the toddler's teeth to ensure proper cleaning of the teeth, gums, and tongue. Use only water for brushing before 2 years of age and a pea-sized amount of fluoride-containing toothpaste after age 2 years. At age 1 year, the toddler should have his or her first dentist visit to establish current health of the teeth and gums. Eating should be limited to meal and snack times, as \"grazing\" throughout the day exposes the teeth to food throughout the day. Carbohydrate- containing foods combined with oral bacteria create a decreased oral pH level that is optimal for the development of dental caries (cavities). See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Public water fluoridation is a public health initiative that ensures that most children receive adequate fluoride intake to prevent dental caries. Table 4.5 gives recommendations regarding fluoride supplementation. If the water supply contains adequate fluoride, no other supplementation is necessary other than brushing with a small amount of fluoride-containing toothpaste after age 2 years. Excess fluoride ingestion should be avoided, as it contributes to the development of fluorosis (mottling of the enamel). Fluorosis occurs most often in the toddler years (AAP, 2011b). Risk factors for fluorosis development include: High fluoride levels in the local water supply Use of fluoride-containing toothpaste prior to age 2 years Excessive ingestion of fluoride either in toothpaste or foods Fluoride-containing foods: tea, ready-to-eat infant foods containing chicken, white or purple grape juice, and beverages, processed foods, and cereals that were manufactured with fluoride-containing water Promoting Appropriate Discipline Discipline is a common concern during toddlerhood. The toddler's intense personality and extreme emotional reactions can be difficult for parents to understand and cope with. The toddler needs firm, gentle guidance to learn what the expectations are and how to meet them. The parent's love and respect for the toddler teach the toddler to care about himself or herself and for others. Affection is as important as the guidance aspect of discipline. Having realistic expectations of what the toddler is capable of learning and understanding can help the parent in the disciplinary process. The toddler's intense push for autonomy can often test a parent's limits. The easygoing infant usually becomes more challenging in toddlerhood. The toddler's continual quest for new experiences often places the toddler at risk, and his or her negativism very often taxes the parent's patience. In an effort to prevent the toddler from experiencing harm and in response to his or her continual testing of limits, parents often resort to spanking. Though commonly accepted, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners recommend against corporal or physical punishment (AAP, 2004; NAPNAP, 2006). Recent research points out the dangers inherent in the use of corporal punishment as well as the possibilities for negative effects on the child's future behavior ( Box 4.5 ). Spanking or other forms of corporal punishment lead to a proviolence attitude, create resentment and anger in some children, and contribute to the cycle of violence (NAPNAP, 2006). See Evidence-Based Practice 4.1. Take Note! Toddlers younger than 18 months of age should NEVER be spanked, as there is an increased possibility of physical injury in this age group. Also, the infant/young toddler is not capable of linking the spanking with the undesired behavior (AAP, 2004). Normal toddler development includes natural curiosity, and this curiosity often results in dangerous or problematic activities for the toddler (Anderson, 2008). Toddlers have a difficult time learning the rules and in general do not behave badly intentionally. Providing a childproof environment will allow the toddler to participate in safe exploration, which will meet his or her developmental needs and decrease the frequency of intervention needed on the part of the parents. Discipline should focus on limit setting, negotiation, and techniques to assist the toddler to learn problem solving. Parents should provide consistency and commit to the limits that are set. Offering realistic choices helps give the toddler a sense of mastery. Rules should be simple and limited in number. Maintaining the toddler's schedule of meals and rest/sleep will help to prevent conflicts that occur as a result of hunger or fatigue. Toddlers should not be made to share, as this is a concept they do not understand. Parents should encourage simple activities enjoyed by the children involved and avoid confrontation over toys. Parents should offer toddlers appropriate choices to help them develop autonomy, but should not offer a choice when none exists. BOX 4.5NEGATIVE IMPACT OF PHYSICAL PUNISHMENT Spanking is less effective than time-out or other discipline measures to reduce undesired behavior in children. The toddler younger than 18 months of age: Is not capable of making the appropriate connections between spanking and the undesired behavior Is at increased risk for physical injury from spanking than older children Physical punishment: May lead to a proviolence attitude May create resentment in the toddler Is a poor model for learning effective problem solving May be correlated with antisocial and criminal behavior later in life Leads to increased aggression in preschoolers, school-age children, and adults When used frequently, may weaken the parent-child relationship Childhood corporal punishment increases the probability of depression and substance abuse in adulthood. Spanking may lead to more severe forms of punishment and to actual child abuse and maltreatment. The more frequently children are hit or spanked, the more likely they are to hit their own children and to be involved in spouse abuse as adults. Adapted from American Academy of Pediatrics. (2004). Guidance for effective discipline.

NAPNAP position statement on corporal punishment. Journal of Pediatric Health Care, 20(6), A43-A44. Positive reinforcement should be used as much as possible. \"Catching\" a child being good helps to reinforce appropriate or desirable behaviors. When the toddler is displaying appropriate behavior, the parent should reward the child consistently with praise and physical affection. \"Time-out\" can be used effectively at around 2.5 to 3 years of age (refer to Chapter 5 for details). \"Extinction\" is a particularly useful technique with 2- and 3-year-olds. Extinction involves systematic ignoring of the undesired behavior. Parents sometimes unknowingly contribute to the occurrence of an unwanted behavior simply by the attention they give the toddler (even if it is negative in nature, it is still attention). Parents who want to extinguish an annoying (nondangerous) behavior should resolve to ignore it every time it occurs. When the child withholds the behavior or performs the opposite (appropriate) behavior, they should use compliments and praise. It may be difficult to ignore a difficult behavior, but the results are well worth the effort. Teaching Guidelines 4.4 provides tips on avoiding power struggles and offering appropriate guidance to toddlers. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 4.1 CORPORAL PUNISHMENT AND BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS IN EARLY CHILDHOOD STUDY A large volume of research indicates that there are few, if any, positive developmental outcomes associated with the use of corporal punishment (spanking). In order to determine if negative consequences resulted, the authors used data from a large longitudinal ongoing multicenter study, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. They reviewed the data from over 100 children, performing analyses that specifically controlled for contextual and parenting variables as well as for partial child effects. The Home Observation for the Measurement of the Environment (HOME) was administered when the children were 15, 36, and 54 months of age. The HOME measurement determined the use of corporal punishment. To determine the presence of behavior problems, the Child Behavior Checklist was administered at 36 months of age and again when the child was in the first grade. Findings Multiple regression analysis was performed on the data sets, controlling for variables such as the child's gender, ethnicity, and temperament as well as maternal sensitivity and depression. The results established a causal link between the use of corporal punishment and child adjustment, particularly an increase in behavior problems during toddlerhood. Nursing Implications Targeted interventions may have a positive impact on decreasing the use of corporal punishment in young children. Advise parents about the risks associated with corporal punishment. Provide them with education about appropriate alternative methodsof discipline, including limit setting with consistent follow-through, extinction, and time-out. Support parents' efforts to use alternative methods of discipline. Adapted from Mulvaney, M. K., & Mebert, C. J. (2007). Parental corporal punishment predicts behavior problems in early childhood. Journal of Family Psychology, 21(3), 389-397. Teaching Guidelines 4.4 PROVIDING TODDLERS WITH GUIDANCE When giving the toddler instructions, tell the child what to do, NOT what not to do. This allows for a positive focus. If you must say \"no,\" \"don't,\" or \"stop,\" then follow with a direction of what to do instead. Offer limited choices, when a choice is truly available. Say, \"Do you want to wear your blue hat or your red hat?\" NOT \"Do you want to put on your hat?\" This gives the toddler some, but not all, control. Role model appropriate communication, but don't feel like you have to speak nicely all the time. If the situation warrants, use a firm and even tone to get the point across. Avoid yelling. Pay attention to the inflection in your voice. A statement or direction should not end in a questioning tone or with \"Okay?\" Be clear. Statements should sound like statements, and only questions should end in a questioning tone. When a toddler behaves aggressively, label the child's feelings calmly, but be firm and consistent with the expectation. For example, \"I know you're mad at your friend, but it is not okay to hit.\" Adapted from American Academy of Pediatrics. (2004). Guidance for effective discipline. Retrieved March 11, 2011, http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;101/4/723 ; and Anderson, J. (2008). Discipline techniques: The 12-month-old. Contemporary Pediatrics, 25(9), 84-87. Addressing Common Developmental Concerns Common developmental concerns of the toddler period are toilet teaching, temper tantrums, thumb sucking or pacifier use, sibling rivalry, and regression. An understanding of the normalcy of negativism, temper tantrums, and sibling rivalry will help the family cope with these issues. Prepare parents for these developmental events by giving appropriate anticipatory guidance. Toilet Teaching When myelinization of the spinal cord is achieved around age 2 years, the toddler is capable of exercising voluntary control over the sphincters. Girls may be ready for toilet teaching earlier than boys. Toddlers are ready for toilet teaching when: Bowel movements occur on a fairly regular schedule. The toddler expresses knowledge of the need to defecate or urinate. This may be through verbalization, change in activity, or gestures such as: Looks into or grabs diaper Squats Crosses legs Grimaces and/or grunts Hides behind a door or the couch when defecating The diaper is not always wet (this indicates the ability to hold the urine for a period of time). The toddler is willing to follow instructions. The toddler walks well alone and is able to pull down his or her pants. The toddler follows caregivers to the bathroom. The toddler climbs onto the potty chair or toilet (AAP, 2011c). Parents should approach toilet teaching with a calm, positive, and nonthreatening manner. Initially it may be helpful to allow the toddler to observe a same-sex family member using the toilet. Start with the toddler fully clothed on the potty chair or toilet while the parent or caregiver talks about what the toilet is used for and when. The toddler will feel most comfortable with a toddler potty chair that sits on the floor ( Fig. 4.13 ). If a potty chair is unavailable, facing toward the toilet tank may make the toddler feel more secure, as the buttocks remain on the front of the seat rather than sinking through the toilet seat opening. After a week or longer, remove a dirtydiaper and place the contents in the toilet. Next try having the toddler sit on the potty chair or toilet without pants or diaper on. The toddler may benefit from watching a caregiver or friend use the toilet. It may also be beneficial to demonstrate using the potty chair with a baby doll that wets. FIGURE 4.13 The toddler will feel most comfortable with a potty chair that sits on the floor. Parents should always use gentle praise and no reproaches. Usually the best time to achieve success with defecation on the toilet is following a meal. When the toddler has achieved success with bowel control, bladder control will come next. It may be many months before nighttime bladder control is achieved, and the toddler may still require a diaper at night. Parents should use appropriate words for body parts, urination, and defecation, then use those words consistently so the toddler understands what to say and do (AAP, 2011c). After a couple of weeks of successful toileting, the toddler may start wearing training pants. When toddlers have an accident and don't make it to the toilet, gently remind them about toileting and let them help clean up. Toddlers should never be punished for bowel or bladder \"accidents.\" With so much attention focused on the genitalia during toilet teaching and the frequency of being without a diaper, it is natural for toddlers to become more focused on their own genitalia. Boys and girls both will explore their genitalia and discover the resulting pleasurable sensation. Masturbation in the toddler often causes a great deal of discomfort in the parent. The parent should not draw attention to the activity, as that may increase its frequency. The parent should calmly explain to the toddler that this is an activity that may only be done in private (Feigelman, 2007b). If the toddler is masturbating excessively or refuses to stop when in public, then there may be additional stressors in the toddler's life that should be explored. Negativism Negativism is common in the toddler period (Brazelton & Sparrow, 2006). As the toddler separates from the parent, recognizes his or her own individuality, and exerts autonomy, negativism abounds. Parents should understand that this negativism is a normal developmental occurrence and not necessarily deliberate defiance (though that also occurs). Avoid asking yes-or-no questions, as the toddler's usual response will be \"no,\" whether he or she means it or not. Offering the child simple choices will give the toddler a sense of control. The parent should not ask the toddler if he or she \"wants\" to do something, if there is actually no choice. \"Do you want to use the red cup or the blue cup?\" is more appropriate than \"Do you want your milk now?\" When it is time to go outside, don't ask, \"Do you want to put your shoes on?\" Instead, state in a matter-of-fact tone that shoes must be worn outside, and give the toddler a choice of type of shoe or color of socks. If the child continues with negative answers, then the parent should remain calm and makethe decision for the child. FIGURE 4.14 Tantrums are a normal component of toddler development. Temper Tantrums Even children who displayed an easygoing personality as infants may lose their temper frequently during the toddler years ( Fig. 4.14 ). A toddler who was more intense as an infant may have more temper tantrums. Temper tantrums are a natural result of the frustration that toddlers experience. Toddlers are eager to explore new things, but their efforts are often thwarted (usually for safety reasons). Toddlers do not behave badly on purpose. They need time and maturity to learn the rules and regulations. Some of their frustration may come from lack of language skills to express themselves. Toddlers are just starting to learn how to verbalize feelings and to use alternative actions rather than just \"pitching a fit.\" The temper tantrum may be manifested as a screaming and crying fit or a full-blown episode in which the toddler throws himself or herself on the floor kicking, screaming, and pounding, perhaps even holding the breath. Fatigue or hunger may limit the toddler's coping abilities and promote negative behavior and temper tantrums (Lyness, 2008). Although tantrums are annoying to parents and caregivers, they are a normal part of the toddler's quest for independence. As toddlers mature, they become better able to express themselves and to understand their environment. Parents need to learn their toddler's behavioral cues in order to limit activity that is frustrating. When the parent notes the beginnings of frustration, a friendly warning might be given. Intervening early with an activity change might prevent a tantrum. Use distraction, refocusing, or removal from the situation. When a temper tantrum does occur, the best course of action is to ignore the behavior and ensure that the child is safe during the tantrum. Physical punishment will probably just prolong the tantrum and in fact produce more intense negative behavior. If the tantrum occurs in public, it may be necessary for the parent to immobilize the child with a big bear hug and use a calm voice to soothe the toddler. It is very important for parents to model self-control. Since toddlers' tantrums most often result from frustration, the role- modeled behavior of self-control helps to teach toddlers to control their temper when they can't get what they want (Lyness, 2008). Thumb Sucking and Pacifiers Infants bring their hands to their mouths and begin thumb sucking as a form of self-soothing (Brazelton & Sparrow, 2006). This habit may continue into the toddler years and beyond. The pacifier is used for the same reason. Toddlers may calm themselves in a stressfulsituation by thumb sucking or sucking on a pacifier. Opinions about thumb and finger sucking and pacifier use are significantly affected by family history and culture. For most children there is no need to worry about a sucking habit until it is time for the permanent teeth to erupt. Prolonged and frequent sucking in the withdrawn child is more likely to yield changes to the tooth and jaw structure than sucking that is primarily used for self-soothing. Parents must sort through their own feelings about thumb sucking and pacifier use and then decide how they want to handle the habit. To ensure safety with pacifier use: Use only one-piece pacifiers. Replace worn pacifiers with new ones. Never tie a pacifier around a toddler's neck. Parents may want to limit thumb sucking and pacifier use to bedtime, in the car, and in stressful situations. The parent should calmly discuss these limits with the toddler and then remain consistent about enforcing them (Marter & Agruss, 2007). Sibling Rivalry Many families have subsequent children when their first child is a toddler. The toddler has been accustomed to being the baby and receiving a great deal of attention, both at home and with the extended family. Since toddlers are normally egocentric, bringing a new baby into the home may be quite disruptive. To minimize issues with sibling rivalry , parents should attempt to keep the toddler's routine as close to normal as possible. Spend individual time with the toddler on a daily basis. Involve the toddler in the care of the baby. The toddler is capable of fetching a diaper or T-shirt, entertaining the baby with a toy, or helping sing a song to calm the baby (Brazelton & Sparrow, 2006). \"Helping\" the parent care for the baby gives the toddler a sense of importance ( Fig. 4.15 ). The toddler will need significant support while holding the baby. FIGURE 4.15 The toddler may be more likely to accept the new baby in a positive manner if she feels that this is \"our baby,\" not just \"mommy's baby.\" This toddler is meeting her new brother for the first time. RegressionSome toddlers experience regression during a stressful event (e.g., the birth of a sibling, hospitalization). Stress in a toddler's life affects his or her ability to master new developmental tasks. During regression, the toddler may want to go back to an earlier stage. He or she may desire a bottle or pacifier long ago forgotten. The toddler may stop displaying previously achieved language or motor skills. A significant stress in the toddler's life may also disrupt the toilet teaching process (toilet teaching may not be achieved near the time a sibling is born). When regression occurs, parents should ignore the regressive behavior and offer praise for age-appropriate behavior or attainment of skills (Brazelton & Sparrow, 2006). Refer to Jose Gonzales, the 2-year-old in the case study. List common developmental concerns of the toddler. What anticipatory guidance related to these concerns would the nurse provide to Jose's parents? KEY CONCEPTS The toddler's organ systems are continuing to mature, and growth slows during this period as compared with infancy. The psychosocial task of the toddler years is to attain a sense of autonomy and to experience separation and individuation. Cognitive development in toddlerhood progresses from sensorimotor in nature to preoperational. The toddler refines gross motor skills after learning to walk and builds fine motor skills through the use of utensils and various manipulative toys. The toddler progresses from limited expressive language capabilities to a vocabulary of 900 words by age 3 years. Toddlers use all of their senses to explore and learn about their environment. Visual acuity progresses to at least 20/50 in the toddler period. Negativism abounds in toddlers as they attempt to exert their independence. Very ritualistic, toddlers feel safer and more secure when clear limits are enforced and a structured routine is followed. The toddler is starting to learn right from wrong and bases actions on punishment avoidance. Toddler development may be promoted through active gross motor play, books, music, and block building. Safety is a primary concern in the toddler years as the child is more mobile, very curious, and experimenting with autonomy. Poisoning in the toddler period may be prevented through proper storage of medications and other potentially poisonous substances and appropriate supervision. Consistent bedtime rituals help ease the toddler's transition to sleep. All primary teeth are erupted by 30 months of age and may be kept healthy with appropriate tooth brushing and fluoride supplementation. The toddler may experience a decrease in appetite as growth slows, yet he or she still needs appropriate nutritional intake for continued development. Toilet teaching can be achieved after myelinization of the spinal cord is complete, usually around 2 years of age. Thumb sucking, pacifier use, security items, and temper tantrums are expected issues in the toddler years. Toddler discipline should focus on clear limits and consistency. It should not involve spanking. It should be balanced with a caring and nurturing environment along with frequent praise for appropriate behavior. Parental role modeling of appropriate behavior, especially related to dealing with frustration, is beneficial to toddlers. Parents play an important role in toddler development, not only by providing a loving environment but also by role modeling appropriate behavior in most areas of daily life.

The nurse is caring for a hospitalized 30-month-old who is resistant to care, is angry, and yells \"no\" all the time. The nurse identifies this toddler's behavior as a. Problematic, as it interferes with needed nursing care. b. Normal for this stage of growth and development. c. Normal because the child is hospitalized and out of his routine. 2. The mother of a 15-month-old is concerned about a speech delay. She describes her toddler as being able to understand what she says, sometimes following commands, but using only one or two words with any consistency. What is the nurse's best response to this information? a. The toddler should have a developmental evaluation as soon as possible. b. If the mother would read to the child, then speech would develop faster. c. Receptive language normally develops earlier than expressive language. d. The mother should ask her child's physician for a speech therapy evaluation. 3. A 2-year-old is having a temper tantrum. What advice should the nurse give the mother? a. For safety reasons, the toddler should be restrained during the tantrum. b. Punishment should be initiated, as tantrums should be controlled. c. The mother should promise the toddler a reward if the tantrum stops. d. The tantrum should be ignored as long as the toddler is safe. 4. What is the best advice about nutrition for the toddler? a. Encourage cup drinking and give water between meals and snacks. b. Encourage unlimited milk intake, because toddlers need the protein for growth. c. Avoid sugar-sweetened fruit drinks and allow as much natural fruit juice as desired. d. Allow the toddler unlimited access to the sippy cup to ensure adequate hydration.5. To gain cooperation from a toddler, what is the best approach by the nurse? a. Immediately pick the toddler up from the mother's lap. b. Kneel in front of the toddler while he or she is on the mother's lap. c. Do the nursing tasks quickly so the toddler can play. d. Ask the toddler if it is okay if you begin the needed task. CRITICAL THINKING EXERCISES 1. Develop a teaching plan about safety to present to a toddler-age preschool class. 2. Construct a 3-day menu for a 2-year-old, one that is realistic and will provide the nutrients needed. 3. Develop a plan for educating the parent of a 34-month-old who has been resistant to toilet teaching. Include assessments the nurse will make as well as the plan for teaching. STUDY ACTIVITIES 1. Visit a preschool that provides care for special-needs toddlers as well as typical toddlers. Perform a developmental assessment on a typical toddler and one with special needs (both the same age). Compare and contrast your findings. 2. Care for two average 2-year-olds in the clinical setting. Describe each toddler's behavior, response to the parent, and response to the nurse and list strategies used to gain compliance and minimize stress to the toddler. 3. Observe in the toddler classroom of a typical preschool. Choose two toddlers the same age with different temperaments. Record the toddlers' differences and similarities in response to structure and authority, interactions with classmates, attention levels, and language and activity levels.5 Growth and Development of the Preschooler Words of Wisdom Quality parenting is achieved only by example. KEY TERMS animism empathy imaginary friend magical thinking preoperational thought school readiness telegraphic speech transduction Learning Objectives Upon completion of the chapter, you will be able to: 1. Identify normal physiologic, cognitive, and psychosocial changes occurring in the preschool-age child. 2. Express an understanding of language development in the preschool years. 3. Implement a nursing care plan that addresses common concerns or delays in the preschooler's development. 4. Integrate knowledge of preschool growth and development with nursing care and health promotion of the preschool-age child. 5. Develop a nutrition plan for the preschool-age child. 6. Identify common issues related to growth and development during the preschool years. 7. Demonstrate knowledge of appropriate anticipatory guidance for common developmental issues that arise in the preschool period. Nila Patel is a 4-year-old girl brought to the clinic by her mother and father for her school check-up. During your assessment you measure her weight to be 44 pounds and her height 40 inches. As the nurse caring for her, assess Nila's growth and development, and then provide appropriate anticipatory guidance to her parents.The preschool period is the period between 3 and 6 years of age. This is a time of continued growth and development. Physical growth continues much more slowly compared to earlier years. Gains in cognitive, language, and psychosocial development are substantial throughout the preschool period. Many tasks that began during the toddler years are mastered and perfected during the preschool years. The child has learned to tolerate separation from parents, has a longer attention span, and continues to learn skills that will lead to later success in the school-age period. Preparation for success in school continues during the preschool period because most children enter elementary school by the end of the preschool period. GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OVERVIEW The healthy preschooler is slender and agile, with an upright posture. The formerly clumsy toddler becomes more graceful, demonstrating the ability to run more smoothly. Athletic abilities may begin to develop. Major development occurs in the area of fine motor coordination. Psychosocial development is focused on the accomplishment of initiative. Preconceptual thought and intuitiveness dominate cognitive development. The preschooler is an inquisitive learner and absorbs new concepts like a sponge absorbs water. Physical Growth The average preschool-age child will grow 2.5 to 3 inches (6.5 to 7.8 cm) per year. The average 3-year-old is 37 inches tall (96.2 cm), the average 4-year-old is 40.5 inches tall (103.7 cm), and the average 5-year-old is 43 inches tall (118.5 cm). Average weight gain during this time period is about 4 to 5 pounds (2.3 kg) per year (Feigelman, 2007). The average weight of a 3-year-old is 32 pounds (14.5 kg), increasing to an average weight of 41 pounds (18.6 kg) by age 5. The loss of baby fat and the growth of muscle during the preschool years give the child a stronger and more mature appearance ( Fig. 5.1 ). The length of the skull also increases slightly, with the lower jaw becoming more pronounced. The upper jaw widens through the preschool years in preparation for the emergence of permanent teeth, usually starting around age 6. Organ System Maturation Most of the body systems have matured by the preschool years. Myelination of the spinal cord allows for bowel and bladder control to be complete in most children by age 3 years. The respiratory structures are continuing to grow in size, and the number of alveoli continues to increase, reaching the adult number at about 7 years of age. The Eustachian tubes remain relatively short and straight. Heart rate decreases and blood pressure increases slightly during the preschool years. An innocent heart murmur may be heard upon auscultation, and splitting of the second heart sound may become evident. The preschooler should have 20 deciduous teeth present. FIGURE 5.1 The preschool child has a more slender appearance and erect posture than the toddler.The small intestine is continuing to grow in length. Stool passage usually occurs once or twice per day in the average preschooler. The 4-year-old generally has adequate bowel control. The urethra remains short in both boys and girls, making them more susceptible to urinary tract infections than adults. Bladder control is usually present in the 4- and 5-year-old child, but an occasional accident may occur, particularly in stressful situations or when the child is absorbed in an interesting activity. The bones continue to increase in length and the muscles continue to strengthen and mature. However, the musculoskeletal system is still not fully mature, making the preschooler susceptible to injury, particularly with overexertion or excess activity. Psychosocial Development According to Erik Erikson, the psychosocial task of the preschool years is establishing a sense of initiative versus guilt (Erikson, 1963). The preschooler is an inquisitive learner, very enthusiastic about learning new things. Preschoolers feel a sense of accomplishment when succeeding in activities ( Fig. 5.2 ), and feeling pride in one's accomplishment helps the child to use initiative. However, when the child extends himself or herself further than current capabilities allow, he or she may feel a sense of guilt. The superego or conscience development is completed during the preschool period, and this is the basis for moral development (understanding right and wrong). Table 5.1 gives examples illustrating the stage of initiative versus guilt. FIGURE 5.2 Allowing the preschooler to assist with simple household tasks such as preparing a sandwich encourages the development of initiative. Cognitive Development According to Jean Piaget's theory (1969), the preschool-age child continues in the preoperational stage. Preoperational thought dominates during this stage and is based on a self-centered understanding of the world. In the preconceptual phase of preoperational thought, the child remains egocentric and is able to approach a problem from a single point of view only. The young preschooler may understand the concept of counting and begins to engage in fantasy play (Papalia & Felman, 2011). Magical thinking is a normal part of preschool development. The preschooler believes that his or her thoughts are all-powerful. The fantasy experienced through magical thinking allows the preschooler to make room in his or her world for the actual or the real. Through make-believe and magical thinking, preschool children satisfy their curiosity about differences in the world around them (Papalia & Felman, 2011). The preschooler often has an imaginary friend as well. This friend serves as a creative way for the preschooler to sample different activities and behaviors and practice conversational skills (Brazelton & Sparrow, 2002). Despite this imagination, the preschooler is able to switch easily between fantasy and reality throughout the day. The child in the intuitive phase can count 10 or more objects, correctly name at least four colors, and better understand the concept of time, and he or she knows about things that are used in everyday life, such as appliances, money, and food. The preschooler uses transduction when reasoning: he or she extrapolates from a particular situation to another, even though the events may be unrelated. The preschooler also attributes lifelike qualities to inanimate objects (animism ) (Papalia & Felman, 2011). Table5.1 gives further examples illustrating this developmental stage. The acquisition of language skills in the toddler period is enhanced in the preschool period. The expansion of vocabulary enables the preschooler to progress further with symbolic thought. At this age, children do not completely understand the concept of death or its permanence: they may ask when their grandparent or pet who died is returning. Moral and Spiritual Development The preschool child can understand the concepts of right and wrong and is developing a conscience. That inner voice that warns or threatens is developing in the preschool years. Kohlberg identified this stage (between 2 and 7 years) as the preconventional stage, which is characterized by a punishment-and-obedience orientation (Kohlberg, 1984). Preschool children see morality as external to themselves; they defer to power (that of the adult). The child's moral standards are those of their parents or other adults who influence them, not necessarily their own. Preschoolers adhere to those standards to gain rewards or avoid punishment. Since the preschool child is facing the psychosocial task of initiative versus guilt, it is natural for the child to experience guilt when something goes wrong. The child may have a strong belief that if someone is ill or dying, then he or she may be at fault and the illness or death is punishment (Ford, 2007). As the child's moral development progresses, he or she learns how to deal with angry feelings. Sometimes the way the child chooses to deal with those feelings may be inappropriate, such as fighting and biting. Preschoolers are so involved in imagination and fantasy that lying begins to occur at this age (Brazelton & Sparrow, 2002). Preschoolers also use their limited life experiences to make sense of and help them cope with crises. They need to learn the socially acceptable limits of behavior and are also learning the rewards of manners. The preschool child begins to help out in the family and begins to understand the concept of give-and-take in relationships. During the preoperational phase of cognitive development, the preschooler's concept of faith is intuitive and projective in nature (Ford, 2007). The preschool child's imagination allows for anything to be possible, so he or she does not have a logical view of the world (as adults do). Preschool children have limited life experiences, so they may project a feeling onto a new person or situation. They may use this projection to help them understand what is going on around them. Preschoolers may project their parents' or caregiver's feelings or characteristics onto \"God\": if mommy gets angry, then God is probably also angry.FIGURE 5.3 The preschool child may participate in religious rituals without having full understanding of their meaning. The family's religious beliefs may affect the child's diet, the mode of discipline that parents use, and even how the parents view their children. Knowing about a family's practices of prayer or meditation is helpful to the pediatric nurse, who can help continue the ritual when the child is ill or hospitalized (Ford, 2007) ( Fig. 5.3 ). Motor Skill Development As the preschooler's musculoskeletal system continues to mature, existing motor skills become refined and new ones develop. The preschooler has more voluntary control over his or her movements and is less clumsy than the toddler. Significant refinement in fine motor skills occurs during the preschool period ( Table 5.2 ). Gross Motor Skills The preschooler is agile while standing, walking, running, and jumping ( Fig. 5.4 ). He or she can go up and down stairs and walk forward and backward easily. Standing on tiptoes or on one foot still requires extra concentration. The preschooler seems to be in constant motion. He or she also uses the body to understand new concepts (such as using the arms in a \"chug-chug\" motion when describing how the train wheels work).FIGURE 5.4 The preschooler runs well, navigate stairs, and can balance on one foot. Fine Motor Skills The 3-year-old can move each finger independently and is capable of grasping utensils and crayons in adult fashion, with the thumb on one side and the fingers on the other. He or she can also scribble freely, copy a circle, trace a square, and feed himself or herself without spilling much. These skills become refined over the next 2 years, and by 5 years of age the child can write letters, cut withscissors more accurately, and tie shoelaces ( Fig. 5.5 ). Sensory Development Hearing is intact at birth and should remain so throughout the preschool years. The senses of smell and touch continue to develop throughout the preschool years. The young preschooler may have a less discriminating sense of taste than the older child, putting him or her at increased risk for accidental ingestion. Visual acuity continues to progress and should be equal bilaterally. The typical 5- year-old has visual acuity of 20/40 or 20/30. Color vision is intact at this age. FIGURE 5.5 The 5-year-old has the fine motor dexterity to cut well with scissors. Communication and Language Development The acquisition of language allows the preschool child to express thoughts and creativity. The preschool years are a time of refinement of language skills. The 3-year-old exhibits telegraphic speech , using short sentences that contain only the essential information. Vocabulary at 3 years is composed of about 900 words. The preschool child may acquire as many as 10 to 20 new words per day and at age 5 usually has a vocabulary of 2,100 words (Taylor, 2008). By the end of the preschool period, the child is using sentences that are adultlike in structure ( Table 5.3 ). The 3- to 6-year-old is starting to develop fluency (the ability to smoothly link sounds, syllables, and words when speaking). Initially, the child may exhibit dysfluency or stuttering. Speech may sound choppy, or the child may say repeated consonants or \"um.\" Stuttering usually has its onset between 2 and 4 years of age, and about 75% of children will recover from it without therapy (Prasse & Kikano, 2008). Parents should slow down their speech and should give the child time to speak without rushing or interrupting. Some sounds remain difficult for the preschooler to enunciate properly: \"f,\" \"v,\" \"s,\" and \"z\" sounds are usually mastered by age 5 years, but some children do not master the sounds of \"sh,\" \"l,\" \"th,\" and \"r\" until age 6 or later. Communication in preschool children is concrete in nature, as they are not yet capable of abstract thought. Despite its concrete nature, the preschooler's communication can be quite elaborate and involved; he or she may talk about dreams and fantasies. In addition to acquiring vocabulary and learning the correct use of grammar, the preschool child's receptive language skills are also becoming refined.The preschooler is very much in tune with the parent's moods and easily picks up on negative emotions in conversations. If the preschooler hears parents discussing things that are frightening to the child, the preschooler's imagination may fuel the development of fears and lead to misinterpretation of what the child has heard. In the potentially bilingual child, by 4 years of age the child will cease the language mixing exhibited during the toddler years and should be able to use each language as a separate system (Abell & Ey, 2007). Emotional and Social Development By the time a child enters kindergarten, he or she should have developed a useful set of social skills that will help him or her have successful experiences in the school setting as well as in life in general. These skills include cooperation, sharing (of things and feelings), kindness, generosity, affection display, conversation, expression of feelings, helping others, and making friends. Preschoolers tend to have strong emotions. They can be very excited, happy, and giddy in one moment, then extremely disappointed in the next. The preschool child has a vivid imagination, and fears are very real to preschoolers. Most children this age have learned to control their behaviors. They should be able to name the feelings they are having rather than acting on them. Strong feelings may be expressed through outlets such as clay or Play-Doh, water play, drawing or painting, or dramatic play such as with puppets. Preschoolers are developing a sense of identity. They recognize that they are boys or girls. They know that they belong to a particular family, community, or culture. They take pride in using self-control rather than giving in to their impulses. The preschool child is capable of helping others and being involved in routines and transitions. Parents can encourage and assist preschool children with developing the social and emotional skills that will be needed when the child enters school. Preschool children thrive on one-to-one communication with a parent. During interactive communication, children learn to express their feelings and ideas. Interactive communication fosters not only emotional and moral development but also self- esteem and cognitive development. Asking the preschool child questions requires the child to think out his or her own intention or motivation and encourages vocabulary development. Parents may use individual communication as a time to explore right and wrong, thus further contributing to moral development. Being listened to while answering parents' questions gives preschoolers a sense that they are valued, that what they think and have to say matters. Establishing a few simple rules and enforcing them consistently gives preschoolers the structure and security they need while promoting moral development. Parents or caregivers can help the child give a name to the emotion that is being experienced. Fears are very real to preschoolers because of their active imaginations and may result in a variety of emotions. Parents should validate the feeling or emotion, then discuss with the child alternatives for dealing with the emotion. Preschoolers are developing their sense of identity, and parents should encourage preschoolers to do simple things for themselves, like dressing and washing their hands and face ( Fig. 5.6 ). Parents should give the child the time he or she needs to complete the task. This helps to establish a sense of accomplishment. At this age, the child may begin to show an interest in basic sexuality (Papalia & Felman, 2011). The preschooler may want to know why boys' and girls' bodies are different, how the reproductive organs function, and where babies come from. The parentshould answer the child honestly and directly, using the correct anatomic terms. Long explanations are not necessary, just simple answers. This curiosity is a normal function of the preschool years, and the curiosity may also involve playing with the genitals (see the section on masturbation later in this chapter). FIGURE 5.6 Encouraging the preschooler to complete simple tasks by himself or herself helps to build self-esteem.FIGURE 5.7 The preschool child begins to develop friendships. Friendships Preschoolers need interactions with friends as well. Learning how to make and keep a friend is an important part of social development. Friends may be other children in the neighborhood or those at preschool or day care. A special friend is someone the preschooler can care about, talk to, and play with ( Fig. 5.7 ). The preschooler is more likely to agree to rules and wants to please friends and be like them. The preschooler loves to sing, dance, and act and will enjoy these activities with friends. Disagreements may occur, but the parent can encourage the children to express their views, discuss and resolve conflicts, and continue being friends. Temperament By the time children are 3 years old, they recognize that what they do actually matters. It is helpful for the parent to view the child as an active participant in the parent-child relationship. The child's temperament has become a reliable indicator of how a parent might expect the child to react in a certain situation. When the parent is in tune with the preschooler's temperament, it is easier to find ways to ease transitions and changes for that child. In the area of task orientation, temperament may range from the highly attentive and persistent to the more distractible and active (Child Development Institute, 2010). A child's social flexibility is also evident by this age. A child who is quite adaptable will handle stimuli from the outside world in an approaching rather than a withdrawing manner. Temperament also determines the extent of reactivity (the child's sensory threshold of responsiveness, high versus low). This determines the quality of the child's mood and the intensity of reactions to stimuli, change, or situations. When the parents are familiar with the child's task orientation, social flexibility, and reactivity, they can better structure activities and situations for the child. The 4-year-old is better at learning self-control and can use setbacks in appropriate behavior as opportunities for growth. Temper tantrums should ease off by this age, as the child's language skills are more capable of keeping up with complex ideas. The 4-year-old is able to see the rewards of growing up. This awareness of self-power may, however, lead to additional fears. The 5-year-old who has a more vulnerable type of temperament, as opposed to a confident temperament, may be more apt to experience fears.Fears With their vivid imaginations, preschoolers experience a variety of fears. Preschoolers may be scared of loud noises such as fire engine sirens or barking dogs. Imaginary monsters may scare the child. Preschoolers are often afraid of people they do not know as well as strange people (Santa Claus or people who look or dress very differently from what they are accustomed to). Many preschoolers are afraid of the dark. Preschoolers may also fear insects as well as animals they are not familiar with. The preschooler's memory is long enough that he or she may fear returning to the doctor's office when a painful procedure occurred during the prior visit. Parents should acknowledge fears rather than minimizing them. They can then collaborate with the child on strategies for dealing with the fear. Cultural Influences on Growth and Development Children may learn prejudice or bias at home before entering school or day care. The ways that families view other races or cultures may be subtly or overtly demonstrated in routine daily activities. The preschool child is developing a conscience, so attitudes of tolerance or bias may influence the child's values. As in the toddler period, the value that the family places on independence will affect the child's development of a healthy self-concept. Some cultures value reading and education more than others. If reading is not valued in the home, the preschool child's first experience with books may not occur until he or she is in school. Food served in the home is often very specific to the family's ethnic background. As the preschool child is exposed to persons of other cultures in school, he or she may or may not like the food that is served. Exploring customs or cultural practices that the family participates in is important so that these practices may be safely incorporated into the child's plan of care. Refer back to Nila, who was introduced in the beginning of the chapter. What developmental milestones would you expect Nila to have reached at this age? Nila's mother expresses concerns about her child's imaginary friend, Sasha. How would you respond?THE NURSE'S ROLE IN PRESCHOOL GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT Growth and development in the preschool child remains orderly and sequential. Some preschoolers grow faster than others or reach various developmental milestones sooner than others. Nurses must be aware of the usual growth and development patterns for this age group so that they can assess preschool children appropriately and provide guidance to their families. The changes that the preschool child is experiencing affect not only the child but also the family. Health care visits throughout the preschool period continue to focus on expected growth and development and anticipatory guidance. An additional concern is the preparation for school entry (school readiness ). If the preschooler is hospitalized, growth and development may be altered. Hospitalization hinders the preschool child's ability to explore the environment and engage in make-believe play and thus presents a challenge for the curious and inquisitive child. If the child must be isolated for a contagious illness, the opportunities for exploration and experimentation are further restricted. In addition, a sick preschooler may feel a sense of guilt, worrying that maybe he or she caused the illness by negative thoughts or behaviors. When caring for the hospitalized preschooler, the nurse must use knowledge of normal growth and development to recognize potential delays, promote continued appropriate growth and development, and interact successfully with the preschooler. NURSING PROCESS OVERVIEW Upon completion of assessment of the preschool child's growth and development status, problems or issues related to growth and development may be identified. The nurse may then identify one or more nursing diagnoses, including but not limited to: Delayed growth and development Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements Interrupted family processes Readiness for enhanced parenting Risk for caregiver role strain Risk for delayed development Risk for disproportionate growth Risk for injury Planning nursing care for the preschool child with growth and development issues should take into account the preschooler's and family's individual needs. The nursing care plan may be used as a guide in planning nursing care for the preschooler with a growth or developmental concern. The nurse may choose the appropriate nursing diagnoses from the Nursing Care Plan 5.1 and individualize them as needed. The nursing care plan is intended to serve as a guide only and is not intended to be an inclusive growth and development plan. Promoting Healthy Growth and Development The building of self-esteem continues throughout the preschool period. It is of particular importance during these years, as the preschooler's developmental task is focused on the development of initiative rather than guilt. A sense of guilt will contribute to low self-esteem, whereas a child who is rewarded for his or her initiative will have increased self-confidence. The parent who provides a loving and nurturing environment for the preschooler builds upon the earlier foundation. Routine and ritual continue to be important throughout the preschool years, as they help the child to develop a sense of time as well as provide the structure for the child to feel safe and secure. Daily routine continues to assist with the development of conscience in the preschooler. As in toddlerhood, making expectations known through everyday routines helps to avoid confrontations. The preschooler is developing the maturity to know how to behave in various situations and is capable of learning manners. Setting limits (and remaining consistent with those limits) continues to be important in the preschool period. Consistent limits provide the preschooler with expectation and guidance. As the preschooler increasingly participates in fantasy and imagination, the limits of routine and structure help guide his or her behavior and ability to distinguish reality.Nurses caring for preschoolers should have knowledge of normal developmental expectations so they can determine whether the preschool child is progressing appropriately. Table 5.4 lists potential signs of developmental delay. A preschool child with one or more of these concerns should be referred for further developmental evaluation. NURSING CARE PLAN 5.1 Growth and Development Issues in the Preschool Child NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for injury related to developmental age, enviroment, and motor vehicle travel Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child's safety will be maintained: Child will remain free from injury. Interventions: Preventing Injury Teach and encourage appropriate use of forward-facing car seat or booster seat to decrease risk of injury related to motor vehicles. Teach preschoolers to stay away from street and to cross the street only when holding the hand of an adult to prevent pedestrian injury. Require bicycle helmet use while riding any wheeled toy to prevent head injury and form habit of helmet use. Teach the preschooler appropriate safety rules in the home (avoiding electric outlets, etc.): the preschooler is able to follow simple directions and carry out directives. Limits help him or her to organize the environment. Post Poison Control Center phone number (in case of accidental ingestion; the preschool child is very curious). Never leave a preschool child unattended in a tub or pool or near any body of water to prevent drowning. Provide swimming lessons for children age 4 or 5 to encourage water safety, but not as a replacement for adult supervision. Teach parents first-aid measures and child CPR to minimize consequences of injury should it occur. Provide close observation and keep side rails up on bed in hospital because the preschool child continues to be at risk for falling or injuring self on equipment ortubing (because of curiosity). NURSINGDIAGNOSIS : Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to inappropriate nutritional intake to sustain growth needs (excess juice or milk intake, inadequate food variety intake) as evidenced by failure to attain adequate increases in height and weight over time Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will consume adequate nutrients: Child will demonstrate weight gain and increases in height. Interventions: Promoting Appropriate Nutrition Assess current feeding schedule and usual intake, as well as methods used to feed, to determine areas of adequacy versus inadequacy. Determine if the preschooler is unable to drink from a cup or does not finger feed or use utensils properly, or if the child has difficulty swallowing or tolerating certain textures of foods to determine if further interventions such as speech or occupational therapy are required. Weigh child daily on same scale if hospitalized, weekly on same scale if at home, and plot growth patterns weekly or monthly as appropriate on standardized growth charts to determine if growth is improving. Limit juice to 4 to 6 ounces per day, milk to 16 to 24 ounces per day, to discourage sense of fullness achieved with excess milk or juice intake, thereby increasing appetite for appropriate solid foods. Provide three nutrient-dense meals and at least two healthy snacks per day to encourage adequate nutrient consumption. Feed child on a similar schedule daily, without distractions and with the family: preschool children continue to respond well to routine and structure. They are more interested in the social context of meals and are still apt to become distracted easily, so the TV should be off at mealtimes. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS : Delayed growth and development related to motor, cognitive, language, or psychosocial concerns as evidenced by delay in meeting expected milestones Outcome Identification and Evaluation Development will be enhanced: Child will make continued progress toward realization of expected developmental milestones. Interventions: Enhancing Growth and Development Screen for developmental capabilities to determine child's current level of functioning. Offer age-appropriate toys, play, and activities (including gross motor) to encourage further development. Perform interventions as prescribed by physical, occupational, or speech therapist: participation in those activities helps to promote function and accomplish acquisition of developmental skills. Provide support to families of preschoolers with developmental delay (progress in achieving developmental milestones can be slow and ongoing motivation is needed). Reinforce positive attributes in the child to maintain motivation. Model age-appropriate communication skills to illustrate suitable means for parenting the preschooler. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS : Risk for disproportionate growth related to excess milk or juice intake, consumption of inappropriate foods or in excess amounts Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will grow appropriately and not become overweight or obese: Child will achieve weight and height within the 5th to 85th percentiles on standardized growth charts. Interventions: Promoting Appropriate Growth Discourage use of no-spill sippy cups (they contribute to dental caries and allow unlimited access to fluids, possibly decreasing appetite for appropriate solid foods). Provide juice (4-6 ounces per day) and milk (16-24 ounces per day) from a cup at meal and snack time and water in between to avoid having the child drink excessive juice or milk. Provide only nutrient-rich foods without high sugar content for meals and snacks; even if the preschooler is a picky eater, it is inappropriate to provide high- calorie junk food just so the child eats something. Teach parents to role model appropriate eating (nutrient-rich, varied diet) to encourage child to try/accept new foods, as well as become familiar with a variety of food. Severely limit the intake of fast foods and foods with high sugar and fat content to decrease intake of nutrient-poor, high-calorie foods. Ensure adequate physical activity to stimulate development of motor skills and provide appropriate caloric expenditure. This also sets the stage for forming lifelong habit of appropriate physical activity. Teach parents to limit television viewing to 1 to 2 hours per day to encourage participation in physical activities. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Interrupted family processes related to issues with preschool child's development, hospitalization, or situational crisis as evidenced by decreased parental visitation in hospital, parental verbalization of difficulty with current situation, possible crisis related to health of family member other than the preschool child Outcome Identification and Evaluation Family will demonstrate adequate functioning: Family will display coping and psychosocial adjustment. Interventions: Enhancing Family Functioning Assess the family's level of stress and ability to cope to determine family's ability to cope with multiple stressors. Engage in family-centered care to provide a holistic approach to care of the preschooler and family. Encourage the family to verbalize feelings (verbalization is one method of decreasing anxiety levels) and acknowledge feelings and emotions. Use puppets or dramatic play with the child to elicit the preschooler's feelings about the current situation. Encourage family visitation and provide for sleeping arrangements for a parent or caregiver to stay in the hospital with the preschooler; this contributes to family'ssense of control in situation. Involve family members in preschooler's care, giving them a feeling of control and connectedness. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Readiness for enhanced parenting related to parental desire for increased skill level and success with preschool child as evidenced by current healthy relationships and verbalization of desire for improved skills Outcome Identification and Evaluation Parent will provide safe and nurturing environment for the preschool child: Parents will verbalize new skills they will employ in the family. Interventions: Increasing Parenting Skill Set Use family-centered care to provide holistic approach. Educate parent about normal preschool development to provide basis of understanding for parenting skills needed in this time period. Acknowledge and encourage parents' verbalization of feelings related to chronic illness of child or difficulty with normal preschool behavior; this validates the normalcy of parents' feelings. Encourage positive parenting and respect for preschooler and his or her normal development (helps parents develop approaches to preschoolers that can be used in place of anger and frustration). Acknowledge and admire positive parenting skills already present to contribute to parents' confidence in their abilities to parent. Role model appropriate parenting behaviors related to communicating with and disciplining the child (role modeling actually demonstrates rather than just verbalizes what the parent should strive for). Promoting Growth and Development Through Play Providing sincere encouragement for the preschool child's efforts and accomplishments helps him or her develop a sense of initiative. Giving children opportunities to decide how and with whom they want to play also helps them develop initiative. Preschool children like to write, color, draw, paint with a brush or their fingers, and trace or copy patterns ( Fig. 5.8 ). They may start small collections that may be sorted. They like using toys for their intended purpose as well as for whatever invented purpose they can imagine. Preschoolers begin to play cooperatively with one another. Play may be focused around a distinct theme. They define roles, make up rules, and assign jobs. They are able to work together toward a common goal such as building a house or fort with discarded boxes. Cooperative play encourages the preschool child to learn to share, take turns and compromise, listen to others' opinions, consider the feelings of others, and use self-control and overcome fears.FIGURE 5.8 The preschool child loves to create things, so coloring and molding clay are ideal activities for children this age.FIGURE 5.9 Preschool children enjoy imitative play. Preschoolers have incredible imaginations and love to play \"make-believe\" ( Fig. 5.9 ). Encouraging pretend play and providing props for dress-up stimulates curiosity and creativity. Fantasy play is usually cooperative in nature. It encourages the preschooler to develop social skills such as taking turns, communication, paying attention, and responding to one another's words and actions. Fantasy play also allows preschoolers to explore complex social ideas such as power, compassion, and cruelty. Through role playing, children begin to develop their sexual identity as well. Since preschool children have vivid imaginations, it is important to be careful about what television they watch. The preschooler should be limited to 1 to 2 hours per day of quality television (Christakis & Zimmerman, 2007). The violence in some television programs may scare the preschool child or inspire him or her to act out violent behavior. Most preschoolers also engage in dramatic play, fueled by their innate curiosity and vivid imaginations. Three-year-olds may not realize that they are pretending. They run from scary creatures, make plans, and pack their backpacks (never intending to actually leave). Four-year-olds are more sophisticated with dramatic or pretend play: they know they are pretending, and they use dress-up clothes and props to act out more complex roles and scenarios ( Fig. 5.10 ). Five-year-olds are capable of quite complex scenarios. They pretend they are real or fantasy characters. They often use dramatic play to express anxiety, try out negative feelings, or conquer their fears. For example, a child who is afraid of getting a shot at the doctor's office may work through that feeling with pretend play.FIGURE 5.10 Preschool children love to dress up and pretend. Parents should encourage physical activity in the preschool child. Regular physical activity improves gross motor skills, may enhance the child's self-confidence, and allows the child to expend excess energy. Establishing the habit of daily physical activity in the early years is important in the long-term goal of avoiding obesity. The main goal of organized sports at this age should be fun and enjoyment, although of course safety must remain a priority. Expensive toys that claim to teach the young child are not necessary. Toys that require interactive rather than passive play, and that may include the involvement of the parent, are recommended (Schuman, 2007; Shelov & Altmann, 2009). Box 5.1 lists appropriate playthings for the preschool child. Promoting Early Learning The family is the foundation for the child's early growth and development. Parents serve as role models for behavior related to education and learning, as well as instilling values in their children. School readiness is a topic that has received a significant amount of national attention in recent years (High, 2008). To succeed in school, children need a safe, responsive home environment that allows them to learn and explore, as well as structure and limits that allow them to learn the socially acceptable behaviors that they will need in school. Language development is critical to the ability to succeed in school and can be encouraged through books and reading. Each of these components is important in readying the child for education in a more formal setting. Promoting language development, choosing a preschool, and making the transition to kindergarten are discussed in more detail below. BOX 5.1 APPROPRIATE TOYS FOR PRESCHOOLERS Blocks, simple jigsaw puzzles (four to six large pieces), pegboards, wooden bead with string Supplies for creativity: chalk, large crayons, finger paint, Play-Doh or clay, washable markers, paper, paint and paintbrush, scissors, paste, or glue Puppets, dress-up clothes and props for dramatic play Bucket, plastic shovel, and other containers for sand and water play Play kitchen with accessories and pretend food (empty food boxes can be recycled for kitchen play) Squeaking, floating, squirting toys for the bath Sandbox with shovel and various toys for building Dolls that can be dressed and undressed (large buttons, zippers, and snaps), doll care accessories (diapers, bottles, carriage, crib) Gross motor toys: tricycle or big wheel (with helmet), jungle gym or swing set (with supervision), hula hoop, tunnel, wagon Blocks, Legos, cars and trucks, plastic animals, trains, plastic figures (family, community helpers), stuffed animals, balls, sewingcards Tape or CD players for music, various musical instruments Simple card and board games (older preschooler) Dollhouse with furniture and accessories, people, and animals Adapted from Schuman, A. T. (2007). The ABCs of toy safety: More than just child's play. Contemporary Pediatrics, 24(7), 49-57, 64; and Shelov, S. P., & Altmann, T. R. (Eds.). (2009). Caring for your baby and young child: Birth to age 5 (5th ed.). New York, NY: Bantam Books. Promoting Language Development The parent serves as the child's first teacher. The interactions between parent and child in relation to books and other play activities model the types of interactions that the child will later have in school. Asking open-ended questions stimulates the development of thinking as well as language in the preschool child. The preschooler is a great imitator, so the parent should serve as a role model for appropriate language. Parents should avoid swearing, as the child is sure to repeat \"bad words\" even if he or she does not understand what they mean. Allowing children to pursue interests at their own pace will help them to develop the literacy and numeric skills that will enable them to later focus on academic skills. Preschoolers enjoy books with pictures that tell stories ( Fig. 5.11 ). Stories with repeated phrases help to keep the child's attention. Children like stories that describe experiences similar to their own. The preschool child demonstrates early literacy skills by reciting stories or portions of books. He or she also may retell the story from the book, pretend to read books, and ask questions about the story. The preschool child has enough focus and expanded attention to notice when a page is skipped during reading and will call it to the parent's attention. FIGURE 5.11 Preschool children enjoy being read to and looking at the pictures that go along with the story. Take Note! Risk factors for lack of social and emotional readiness for school include insecure attachment in the early years, maternal depression, parental substance abuse, and low socioeconomic status. Nurses should screen for these factors and make referrals if appropriate.Choosing a Preschool/Starting Kindergarten Many parents choose to enroll their child in preschool. Preschool should be used primarily as an opportunity to foster the child's social skills and accustom him or her to the group environment. When selecting a preschool, the parent may want to consider the accreditation of the school, the teachers' qualifications, and recommendations of other parents. The focus of the school environment is also important: What is the daily schedule of activities? Is the school very structured, or does it have a looser environment? The parents must decide how focused on curriculum they want the school to be. The parent should observe the classroom, evaluating the environment, noise level, and sanitary practices as well as how the children interact with each other and how the teachers interact with the children. The type of discipline used in the school is also an important factor. Parents should not choose a preschool that uses corporal punishment. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) discourages the use of corporal punishment in the school setting (AAP, 2006). Corporal punishment may hurt a child's self-esteem as well as his or her ability to achieve in school (Mulvaney & Mebert, 2007). It may also lead to disruptive and violent behavior in the classroom. As preschool is the foundation for later education, the child should have the opportunity to build self-esteem and the skills needed for the more formal setting of elementary school. Whether or not the child attended preschool, kindergarten will be the next big step. Kindergarten hours may be longer than preschool hours, and kindergarten is usually held 5 days per week. This may be a significant change for some children. For most children, the setting and personnel in kindergarten will be new to the child. Rules and expectations are often very different as well. When discussing starting kindergarten with the preschool child, parents should do so in an enthusiastic fashion, keeping the conversation light and positive. Parents should meet with the child's teacher prior to the start of school, if possible, to discuss particular needs or concerns. Parents may want to schedule a tour of the school for the preschooler or attend the school's open house with the child to ease the transition. Practicing the new daily routine prior to the start of school will also be helpful. Most states require up-to-date immunizations and a health screening of the child before he or she enters kindergarten, so advise parents to plan ahead and schedule these in a timely fashion so that school entrance is not delayed (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010). Promoting Safety In the United States, accidental injury remains the leading cause of death for children between the ages of 1 and 14 years (National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 2006). Preschoolers are at an ideal age to be taught about safety and safe behaviors. They are cognitively able to absorb concrete information and they desire to master the situations they are in, but they continue to display poor judgment related to safety issues. Their engagement in fantasy is so strong that it makes it difficult for them to master complicated cause-and-effect relationships. The preschool child is capable of learning safe behaviors but may not always be able to transfer those behaviors to a different situation. Parents must continue to closely supervise preschool children to avoid accidental injury during this period. FIGURE 5.12 The older preschool child should be appropriately secured in an approved booster seat.Safety in the Car The preschooler up until 4 years of age whose height meets the car seat size requirement should use a forward-facing car seat with harness and top tether. All preschoolers after reaching the car seat height restriction should ride in a booster seat that uses both the lap and shoulder belts ( Fig. 5.12 ). It is recommended that the booster seat continue to be used until a height of 4 feet 9 inches and age of 8 to 12 years are reached (AAP, 2011a). The back seat of the car is always the safest place for a child to ride. If a child younger than 12 years of age must sit in the front seat because there are not enough rear seats available, then the front passenger seat air bag should be deactivated. Children should never ride in the cargo area of a pickup truck (AAP, 2007). See Healthy People 2020 and Evidence-Based Practice 5.1. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 5.1 INTERVENTIONS DIRECTED TOWARD ACQUIRING AND I USING BOOSTER SEATS FOR CHILDREN 4 TO 8 YEARS OLD STUDY Children outgrow toddler car seats around the age of 4 years or when they weigh 40 pounds. Regular seat belts do not fit children properly. The purpose of booster seats for the 4- to 8-year-old child is to raise him or her higher on the seat of the car, in order for the adult seat belt to secure the child properly. Booster seats provide increased comfort and safety for this age group. Booster seat use in this age group has been shown to decrease injury and death via motor vehicle accident by nearly 60%. The authors reviewed five studies involving 3,070 subjects and performed a meta-analysis of the study results. Each of the randomized controlled trials reviewed assessed the efficacy of interventions directed toward increasing booster seat use. Findings The authors' meta-analysis of the studies revealed that interventions directed toward improving booster seat use can make a difference. Enforcement of booster seat law was the weakest intervention. More successful interventions all included education of parents about the importance and appropriate use of booster seats. Providing a free booster seat upon completion of the training or an incentive coupon to receive a discount upon purchase were the most helpful interventions. Nursing Implications Parents want to protect their children from injury when riding in motor vehicles, but many may lack the knowledge or financial resources to do so. Nurses are in a unique position to provide ongoing, repeated education about the importance of booster seat use for the preschooler to families wherever they encounter them. Nurses can also seek out resources in their individual communities to provide financial incentives to assist families with obtaining a booster seat. Nurses should always praise preschoolers for complying with booster seat use while riding in vehicles. Adapted from Ehiri, J. E., Ejere, H. O. D., Magnussen, L., Emusu, D., King, W., & Osberg, J. S. (2007). Interventions for promoting booster seat use in four to eight year olds traveling in motor vehicles. The Cochrane Library 2007, 4. Take Note! Although motor vehicle accidents remain a major cause of injury and death in the preschool age group, many families do not use appropriate car seat/seat belt safety with their children. Child passenger safety technicians are available to provide proper installation of car seats. To find one in your area, visit http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/childps/contacts or http://www.seatcheck.org . The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Auto Safety Hot Line may be reached at (888) 327-4236.Safety in the Home Handguns, matches, bodies of water, bicycle riding, and poisons continue to be sources of potential injury during the preschool years. Falls account for the highest percentage of nonfatal injuries among preschoolers. In this age group, motor vehicle accidents are responsible for the most fatal injuries, followed by drowning. A significant number of injuries also occur in or around the home, including burns and poisoning (National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 2006). PREVENTING EXPOSURE TO TOBACCO SMOKE Parents should protect their preschoolers from secondhand tobacco smoke. Exposure to tobacco smoke is associated with an increased incidence of otitis media and respiratory infections, as well as increased symptoms and medication use in children with asthma. Other effects include decreased lung function and behavioral difficulties (World Health Organization, 2011). The preschool child should never be in an enclosed space (such as a car) where tobacco smoke is present. PREVENTING INJURY The preschool child who runs out into the street is at risk for being struck by a car. Teach preschoolers to stop at the curb and never go into the street without a grown-up. The preschooler may learn to ride a bicycle (with or without training wheels). The child must wear an approved bicycle helmet any time he or she rides the bicycle, even if it is just in the driveway. Requiring helmet use in the early years may lead to the habit of helmet use as the child gets older. Allowing the preschooler to choose his or her own helmet may encourage the child to use the helmet. Bicycles should be safe for this age group. The size must be correct; the balls of the feet should reach both pedals while the child is sitting on the seat and has both hands on the handlebars. Children younger than 5 years of age have difficulty learning to use hand- operated brakes, so traditional pedal-back brakes are recommended in this age group. Preschoolers are not mature enough to ride a bicycle in the street even if they are riding with adults, so they should always ride on the sidewalk (AAP, 2010c). It is important to make the inside of the home safe for the preschool child. Parents should install and maintain smoke alarms in the home. Increased physical dexterity and refinement of motor skills enable the preschooler to strike matches or use a lighter and start a fire. The preschool child is capable of washing his or her hands independently, so the water heater should be set at 120\u00b0F or below to prevent scalding (AAP, 2010b). The preschooler's active imagination and desire to play make-believe may result in a firearm injury. The average preschooler is physically capable of handling and firing a gun, particularly a handgun, which is smaller and lighter. If present in the home, firearms should be kept in a locked cabinet with the ammunition stored elsewhere (AAP, 2010b, 2010c). PREVENTING POISONING Though it is continuing to develop, preschoolers still have unrefined taste discrimination, placing them at risk for accidental ingestion. Parents should never try to coax a child to take a vitamin supplement, tablet, or pill by calling it \"candy.\" Dangerous fluids should be stored in their original containers and should be kept out of reach of preschoolers; they should not be poured into containers that look like ordinary drinking glasses or cups. Potentially dangerous cleaning or personal health and beauty products, gardening and pool chemicals, and automotive materials should be kept out of reach of preschoolers and in a locked cabinet if possible. Medications should have childproof caps and should be kept in a locked cabinet. The Poison Control Center telephone number should be posted on or near the home phone (1-800-222-1222) (American Association of Poison Control Centers, 2011). Safety in the Water Five years of age is an appropriate time for a child to learn to swim (AAP, 2010a). Children at this age are physically capable of this activity and have the cognitive maturity to accomplish the task of swimming and basic water safety. Swimming programs should focus on appropriate swim techniques as well as safety measures. Parents and caregivers should be trained in infant/child cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Homes with swimming pools should have lifesaving devices readily accessible. Preschoolers should be taught never to dive into water until an adult has verified its depth. Preschoolers are still too young to be left unattended around any body of water, even if they know how to swim. Preschoolers should never be allowed to swim in a canal or any fast-moving water. Preschoolers who are riding in boats or fishing off riverbanks should wear a personal flotation device. Parents should also be cautioned about close supervision of young children walking, skating, or riding near thin or weak ice. See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Take Note! The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all swimming pools be secured by a fence that is at least 5 feet high and has a self-latching gate to protect young children from entering a pool area unattended (AAP 2010a). Recall Nila Patel, the 4-year-old presented at the beginning of the chapter. What anticipatory guidance related to safety should you provide to her parents? Promoting Nutrition The preschool child has a full set of primary teeth, is able to chew and swallow competently, and has learned to use utensils fairly effectively to feed himself or herself ( Fig. 5.13 ). As in the toddler years, it is important for the preschool child to continue to learn and build upon healthy eating habits. These habits will last throughout the child's life. A diet high in nutrient-rich foods such as whole grains, vegetables, fruits, appropriate dairy foods, and lean meats is appropriate for the preschooler. Nutrient-poor, high-calorie foods such as sweets and typical fast foods should be offered only in limited amounts. FIGURE 5.13 The preschool child has the manual dexterity to handle utensils appropriately and feed himself or herself independently. Nutritional Needs The 3- to 5-year-old requires 500 to 800 mg calcium and 10 mg iron daily (Krebs, Primark, & Haemer, 2011). Box 5.2 lists good calcium and iron sources. Preschoolers should consume a minimum of 19 mg dietary fiber daily (Brown, 2011). The typical preschooler requires about 85 kcal/kg of body weight. Saturated fats should account for less than 10% of total calories. Preschoolchildren's diets should include a daily total fat intake of no less than 20% and not more than 35% of total calories to promote and maintain healthy cholesterol levels (Krebs et al., 2011). Take Note! Drinking excess amounts of milk may lead to iron deficiency, as the calcium in milk blocks iron absorption. Promoting Healthy Eating Habits Preschool children may be picky eaters. They may eat only a limited variety of foods or foods prepared in certain ways and may not be very willing to try new things. The 3- or 4-year-old may exhibit \"food fads,\" eating only certain foods over a several-day period. As the child gets older, pickiness lessens. By 5 years of age the child is more focused on the social context of eating: table conversation and manners. The 5-year-old is generally more willing to at least try new foods and may like to help with meal preparation and clean-up as appropriate. If the preschooler is growing well, then the pickiness is not a cause for concern. A larger concern may be the negative relationship that can develop between the parent and child relating to mealtime. The more the parent coaxes, cajoles, bribes, and threatens, the less likely the child is to try new foods or even eat the ones he or she likes that are served. The parent must maintain a positive and patient demeanor at mealtime. The child should be offered a healthy diet, with foods from all groups over the course of the day as recommended by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). \"MyPyramid for Preschoolers\" (from the USDA) may be used to plan the preschool child's daily diet ( Fig. 5.14 ). The parent should maintain a matter-of-fact approach, offer the meal or snack, and then allow the child to decide how much of the food, if any, he or she is going to eat. High-fat, nutrient-poor snacks should not be substituted for healthy foods just to coax the child to \"eat something.\" See Healthy People 2020.

HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Preventing the Development of Overweight and Obesity Worldwide, over 22 million children younger than 5 years old are obese. In the past 30 years, the number of US children and adolescents who are overweight has doubled. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 21% of all 2- to 5-year-olds are either overweight or at risk of overweight (National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners [NAPNAP], 2006a). Overweight and obese children are at risk for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and the development of insulin resistance. Obese preschoolers have a 20% chance of being obese as adults. This risk increases to 80% if they are obese as adolescents (AAP, 2007c). The risk is increased if one or both parents are overweight. Parents are in an opportune position to exert a positive influence on their preschooler's nutritional intake and activity level. The habits learned in early childhood will likely carry over into the school-age, adolescent, and adult years. Children whose parents take an authoritarian approach to mealtime may learn to overeat, as they are encouraged to finish the entire meal (\"Clean your plate!\"). If they are offered appropriate, healthy food choices and access to high-calorie, nutrient-poor food is limited, preschoolers will learn to self-regulate (eat only until full). Food should not be used as either reward or punishment. Parents should remain positive and patient at mealtime. Mealtimes should continue to be structured. Unstructured meals lead to an increase in fat and calorie consumption. Children who eat nutrient-dense and lower-fat foods are less likely to become overweight(Institute of Medicine, 2011). To limit the chance that overeating will occur, preschoolers should be offered a variety of healthy foods at each meal. This may include one each of a protein source, grain, vegetable, and fruit. The preschool child's serving size is usually one third to one half of the recommended size of an adult serving. The preschool child may imitate the other eaters at the table. Parents have a prime chance to be good role models, setting an example of eating vegetables and fruits. As with toddlers, fruit juice should be limited to 4 to 6 ounces per day, as excess consumption can lead to excess weight gain (AAP, 2007b). Preschoolers should be encouraged to drink water. Limiting television viewing and encouraging physical activity are also important strategies for the prevention of overweight and obesity. Refer back to Nila Patel, the 4-year-old introduced at the beginning of the chapter. What questions should you ask Nila's parents related to nutritional intake? What anticipatory guidance related to nutrition would be appropriate? Nila's mother expresses concerns regarding obesity. How would you address these? Promoting Healthy Sleep and Rest The preschool child needs about 11 to 12 hours of sleep each day (Feigelman, 2007). Some preschool children continue to take a nap during the day. Unless very tired, many preschool children will resist going to bed from time to time. Bedtime rituals continue to be reassuring to children, and it is important to continue them in the preschool years. Having a time of relaxation with a decrease in stimulation will allow the child to fall asleep more easily. Some children continue to need a security item at bedtime or naptime. A nightlight in the bedroom may be necessary, as many children this age are afraid of the dark. Teaching Guidelines 5.1 gives information about assisting parents to establish a bedtime routine. Teaching Guidelines 5.1 BEDTIME ROUTINES Establish a bedtime as well as morning wake-up time, and enforce them consistently. Avoid sugar or caffeine consumption in the evening. Avoid stimulating activities such as roughhousing before bedtime. Do not allow television watching in bed. Make the child's bedroom an inviting and comfortable area of the home. Provide a nightlight in the child's bedroom if he or she is afraid of the dark. Conform to a nightly routine: Television off at a certain time Bath Quiet game or story reading/telling Bedtime prayer or song Maintain quiet in the bedroom and nearby to increase the child's ability to fall asleep. Adapted from Dowshen, S. (2008). Sleep and your preschooler. Retrieved March 21, 2011, from http://kidshealth.org/parent/general/sleep/sleep_preschool.html ; and Goldson, E., & Reynolds, A. (2011). Child development and behavior. In W. W. Hay, M. J. Levin, J. M. Sondheimer, & R. R. Deterding (Eds.), Current pediatric diagnosis and treatment (20th ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill. Nightmares often occur in preschool children as a result of the child's struggle to distinguish what is real from what is not. When a child awakens from a nightmare, he or she is often crying and may be able to recount what the dream was about. Parents should validate the child's fear rather than discounting it (Goldson & Reynolds, 2011). Saying, \"Yes, I agree, monsters are scary; it's a good thing they aren't real\" is more appropriate than, \"Don't be silly: monsters aren't real.\" Sometimes children benefit from reading stories about dreams. Recommended books include: Bedtime for Frances by Russell Hoban Ben's Dream by Chris van Allsberg In the Night Kitchen by Maurice Sendak There's a Nightmare in My Closet by Mercer MayerNightmares should not be confused with night terrors. After a nightmare, the child is aroused and interactive, but night terrors are different: a short time after falling asleep, the child seems to awaken and is screaming. The child usually does not respond much to the parent's soothing, but he or she eventually stops screaming and goes back to sleep. Night terrors are often frightening for parents because the child does not seem to be responding to them. One technique that may help to decrease the incidence of night terrors is to wake the child about 30 to 45 minutes into the sleep cycle. If continued nightly for about a week, the cycle of night terrors may be broken (Hopkins & Glaze, 2008). See Comparison Chart 5.1. Think back to Nila Patel. What anticipatory guidance would you provide to her parents in r elation to sleep during the preschool years? Promoting Healthy Teeth and Gums Dental caries prevention continues to be important and can be achieved through daily brushing and flossing. Parents should use only a pea-sized amount of toothpaste to prevent excess fluoride consumption, which can contribute to fluorosis (AAP, 2011b). The preschooler may brush his or her own teeth, but the parent must continue to supervise to ensure adequate brushing. Parents must perform flossing because the preschool child cannot perform this task adequately. Cariogenic foods should be avoided. If sugary foods are consumed, the mouth should be rinsed with water if it is not possible to brush the teeth immediately (Wagner & Oskouian, 2008). The preschool child should visit the dentist every 6 months. Take Note! Dental caries prevention is important in the primary teeth, because loss of these teeth to caries may affect the proper formation of permanent teeth as well as the width of the dental arch. Promoting Appropriate Discipline Successful discipline results from a loving and nurturing environment in which the preschooler's self-esteem is fostered and where limits are well chosen and enforced consistently. Spanking (striking with the open hand) is the least effective discipline practice and is discouraged by the American Academy of Pediatrics (2004) and the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners (2006b). Belts, switches, paddles, or other items should never be used to strike a child. The use of physical punishment has been associated with a number of additional problems in adulthood, such as antisocial and criminal behaviors (AAP, 2004) (see Chapter 4 ). COMPARISON CHART 5.1 NIGHTMARES VERSUS NIGHT TERRORS If parents are consistent with discipline while encouraging the preschooler's normal growth and development of imagination and make-believe, the child will learn to accept that certain things are not allowed. The sense of initiative can be preserved and guilt avoided if the rules are clear and enforced consistently (AAP, 2004). Take Note! The more frequently children are hit in the preschool years, the more anger they report as adults (AAP, 2004).Minimize the occurrence of misbehavior by anticipating conditions likely to lead to the undesired or risky action. When the situation becomes difficult, parents should use distraction to change the preschooler's focus. When discussing the misbehavior, be certain to label the behavior and not the child. This helps to preserve the preschooler's self-esteem. When teaching preschoolers about undesired behavior, be sure they also understand the reason why it is wrong or unacceptable to do it. This helps to encourage the child to use internal controls over behavior. Parents should serve as role models for self-control, including choice of words, the tone they are delivered in, and the actions that accompany them. Children work harder to obtain praise than to receive punishment, so always reward positive behaviors. Preschool children are becoming capable of understanding the concept of right and wrong. They start to understand each other's feelings (empathy ) and are cognitively capable of remembering basic rules (AAP, 2004). Time-out or time away from the situation can be very effective in this age group. The punishment should be used only for intentional misbehavior (knowing something is forbidden but doing it anyway). It is particularly helpful with dangerous or destructive behavior. The preschooler is given a warning that time-out will occur if the behavior does not stop. The preschooler is removed from the situation and must stay in time-out for a specified period of time. A particular time-out area is helpful; a boring corner of the room without distractions available is a good location. The generally recommended period of time is to require 1 minute of time-out per year of age; thus, a 4-year-old would be in time-out for 4 minutes (Shelov & Altmann, 2009). Set the timer so the child will know when the time-out is over. If the child gets up before the prescribed time, replace the child in time-out and restart the timer. Time-out works best if used each and every time the undesirable behavior occurs. Also, praise the child when he or she follows the rules and behaves appropriately. A simple and clear explanation of the misbehavior should be given to the child; parents should also talk about acceptable alternative strategies that the child can use in the future instead of the undesired behavior. Removal of a privilege such as playing with a favorite toy can be as effective as time-out. Books and other media that are available to help educate parents about appropriate discipline and to help the child learn self- control are listed in Box 5.3 .

Verdick (Free Spirit Publishing) Addressing Common Developmental Concerns Common developmental concerns of the preschool period include lying, sex education, and masturbation (Shelov & Altmann, 2009). Parents often express difficulty in dealing with these issues with their preschool children. Offering appropriate anticipatory guidance may give the parents the support and confidence they need to deal with these issues. Lying Lying is common in preschool children. It may occur because the child fears punishment, has gotten carried away with imagination, or is imitating what he or she sees the parent do. The parent should ascertain the reason for the lie before punishing the child. If the child has broken a rule and fears punishment, then the parent must determine the truth. The child needs to learn that lying is usually far worse than the misbehavior itself. The punishment for the misbehavior should be lessened if the child admits the truth. The parent should remain calm and serve as a role model of an even temper. The next time the misbehavior occurs, the child will be more apt to simply tell the truth. If the child's lying is really just his or her imagination getting carried away, then the parent should guide the child in distinguishing between myth and reality (Brazelton & Sparrow, 2002). The preschooler's imagination is very vivid, and the child needs direction in the use of that faculty. Parents should serve as role models of appropriate behavior for their children to learn it. Children who lie because they hear their parents lying simply must not see or hear their parents do it. Sex Education Preschoolers are keen observers but are still not able to interpret all that they see correctly. The child may recognize, but not understand, sexual activity. Preschoolers are very inquisitive and want to learn about everything around them; therefore, they are very likely to ask questions about sex and where babies come from. Before attempting to answer questions, parents should try to find out first what the child is really asking and what the child already thinks about that subject. Then they should provide a simple, direct, and honest answer. The child needs only the information that he or she is requesting. Additional questions will occur in the future and should be addressed as they arise. Masturbation The normal curiosity of the preschool years often leads children to explore their own genitals (Shelov & Altmann, 2009). This behavior may be upsetting to some parents, but masturbation is a healthy and natural part of normal preschool development if it occurs in moderation. If the parent overreacts to this behavior, then it may occur more frequently. Masturbation should be treated in a matter-of-fact way by the parent. The child needs to learn certain rules about this activity: nudity and masturbation are not acceptable in public. The child should also be taught safety: no other person can touch the private parts unless it is the parent, doctor, or nurse checking to see when something is wrong. Think back to Nila Patel. What are some developmental concerns that are common during the preschool years? What anticipatory guidance related to these concerns would you provide to Nila's parents? KEY CONCEPTS The preschool child grows at a slower rate and takes on a more slender and upright appearance than the toddler. The primary psychosocial task of the preschool period is developing a sense of initiative. Cognitive development moves from an egocentric approach to the world toward a more empathetic understanding of what happens outside of the self. The preschooler gains additional motor skills and displays significant refinement of fine motor abilities. Cognitive and language skills that develop in the preschool years help prepare the child for success in school. Dysfluency or hesitancy in speech is a normal finding in the preschool period and occurs as a result of the fast pace with which the preschooler is gaining language skills and vocabulary. The vocabulary of a preschooler increases to about 2,100 words, and the child speaks in full sentences with appropriate use of tense and prepositions. Appropriate growth and development should be maintained in the ill or hospitalized child. Recognizing concerns or delays in growth and development is essential so that the appropriate referrals may be made and intervention can begin. The preschool child requires a well-balanced diet with fat content between 20% and 30% of calories consumed. Adequate physical activity and provision of a nutrient-dense diet (rather than foods high in fat and sugar) are the foundation for obesity prevention in the preschool child. Adequate dental care is important for the health of the primary teeth. Preschoolers need about 12 hours of sleep per day and benefit from a structured bedtime routine. Due to the active imagination of the preschooler, nightmares and night terrors may begin during this period. Safety and injury prevention remain a focus in the preschool years. Structure, appropriate limit setting, and consistency are the keys for effective discipline in the preschool period. Time-out is an effective disciplinary measure for preschoolers. Masturbation may occur as the preschooler discovers his or her body. If not excessive, it is considered a normal part of growth and development. REFERENCES Abell, S., & Ey, J. L. (2007). Ask Dr. Sue.

The nurse is caring for a hospitalized 4-year-old who insists on having the nurse perform every assessment and intervention on her imaginary friend first. She then agrees to have the assessment or intervention done to herself. The nurse identifies this preschooler's behavior as a. Problematic; the child is old enough to begin to have a basis in reality.b. Normal, because the child is hospitalized and out of her routine. c. Normal for this stage of growth and development. d. Problematic, as it interferes with needed nursing care. 2. The mother of a 3-year-old is concerned about her child's speech. She describes her preschooler as hesitating at the beginning of sentences and repeating consonant sounds. What is the nurse's best response? a. Hesitancy and dysfluency are normal during this period of development. b. Reading to the child will help model appropriate speech. c. Expressive language concerns warrant a developmental evaluation. d. The mother should ask her child's physician for a speech therapy evaluation. 3. The mother of a 4-year-old asks for advice on using time-out for discipline with her child. What advice should the nurse give the mother? a. If spanking is not working, then time-out is not likely to be helpful either. b. Place the child in time-out for 4 minutes. c. Use time-out only if removing privileges is unsuccessful. d. The child should stay in time-out until crying ceases. 4. A 5-year-old child is not gaining weight appropriately. Organic problems have been ruled out. What is the priority action by the nurse? a. Allow the child unlimited access to the sippy cup to ensure adequate hydration. b. Encourage sweets for the extra caloric content. c. Teach the mother about nutritional needs of the preschooler. d. Assess the child's usual intake pattern at home. CRITICAL THINKING EXERCISES 1. Teach a preschool class about bicycle and street safety. Be certain to design the content at an appropriate developmental level. 2. Construct a 3-day menu for a picky 4-year-old. Include three daily meals and two snacks. Follow the nutritional guidelines recommended by the USDA. 3. Color or draw with a preschool child. Analyze the drawings and interactions or discussions you have with the child, relating them to psychosocial and cognitive development expected at this age. STUDY ACTIVITIES 1. Care for two average 3-, 4-, or 5-year-old children in the clinical setting (make sure both are the same age). Describe each child's development level, response to hospitalization, and family dynamics. 2. Visit a preschool that provides care for special needs children as well as typically developing children. Perform a development assessment on a typical child and one with special needs (both the same age). Compare and contrast your findings. 3. Observe in a 3-, 4- or 5-year-old classroom of a typical preschool. Choose two children who are the same age with different temperaments. Record the differences and similarities in their response to structure and authority, interactions with classmates, attention levels, and language and activity levels.6 Growth and Development of the School-Age Child Words of Wisdom Always give a hundred percent, and you will never doubt your ability to succeed.

During your assessment you measure his weight at 62 pounds and his height at 54 inches. As the nurse caring for him, assess Lawrence's growth and development, and then provide appropriate anticipatory guidance to his mother.School-age children, between the ages of 6 and 12 years, are experiencing a time of slow progressive physical growth, while their social and developmental growth accelerates and increases in complexity. The focus of their world expands from family to teachers, peers, and other outside influences (e.g., coaches, media). The child at this stage becomes increasingly more independent while participating in activities outside the home. GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OVERVIEW The school-age years are a time of continued maturation of the child's physical, social, and psychological characteristics. It is during this time that children move toward abstract thinking and seek approval of peers, teachers, and parents. Their eye-hand-muscle coordination allows them to participate in organized sports in school or the community. The school-age child typically values school attendance and school activities. The nurse uses knowledge of normal growth and development of the school-age child to assist the child with coping with disruptions and changes during this time period. Physical Growth From 6 to 12 years of age, children grow an average of 2.5 inches (6 to 7 centimeters) per year, increasing their height by at least 1 foot. An increase of 7 pounds (3 to 3.5 kilograms) per year in weight is expected (Feigelman, 2007a). In the early school-age years, girls and boys are similar in height and weight and appear thinner and more graceful than in previous years. In later school-age years, most girls begin to surpass boys in both height and weight. (See Appendix A for growth charts.) Preadolescent boys and girls do not want to be different from peers of the same sex or the opposite sex, although there are differences in physical and physiologic growth during the school-age years. These differences, especially secondary sexual characteristics, are concerning and often a source of embarrassment for both sexes. The differences between girls and boys are more apparent at the end of the middle-school years and may become extreme and a source of emotional problems. These differences in height and weight relationships, and changes in growth patterns, should be explained to parents and children ( Fig. 6.1 ). Physical maturity is not necessarily associated with emotional and social maturity. An 8- year-old who is the size of an 11-year-old will think and act like an 8-year-old. Many times, the expectations placed on these children are unrealistic and can impact the self-esteem and competence of the child. This can work in reverse, to similar effect, for an 11-year- old who is the size of an 8-year-old and is therefore treated as such. Organ Systems Maturation Maturation of organs may differ with age or gender. Maturation of organs remains fairly consistent until late school age. In the late school-age years (10- to 12-year-olds), boys experience a slowed growth in height and increased weight gain, which may lead to obesity. During this time, girls may begin to have changes in the body that soften body lines. Preadolescence is a period of rapid growth, especially for girls. FIGURE 6.1 The different growth rates of school-age children are depicted by these same-age school-age children.Neurologic System The brain and skull grow very slowly during the school-age years. Brain growth is complete by the time the child is 10 years of age. The shape of the head is longer and the growth of the facial bones changes facial proportions. Respiratory System The respiratory system continues to mature with the development of the lungs and alveoli, resulting in fewer respiratory infections. Respiratory rates decrease, abdominal breathing disappears, and respirations become diaphragmatic in nature. The frontal sinuses are developed by 7 years of age. Tonsils decrease in size from the preschool years, but they remain larger than adolescents'. The adenoids and tonsils may appear large normally, even in the absence of infection. Cardiovascular System The school-age child's blood pressure increases and the pulse rate decreases. The heart grows more slowly during the middle years and is smaller in size in relation to the rest of the body than at any other development stage. Gastrointestinal System During the school-age years, all 20 primary deciduous teeth are lost, replaced by 28 of 32 permanent teeth, with the exception of the third molars (commonly known as wisdom teeth). The school-age child experiences fewer gastrointestinal upsets compared with earlier years. Stomach capacity increases, which permits retention of food for longer periods of time. In addition, the caloric needs of the school-age child are lower than in the earlier years. Genitourinary System Bladder capacity increases, but varies among individual children. Girls generally have a greater bladder capacity than boys. Urination patterns vary with the amount of fluids ingested, the time they were ingested, and the stress level of the child. The formula for bladder capacity is age in years plus 2 ounces. Therefore, the bladder capacity of the 7-year-old would be 9 ounces. The larger capacity of the bladder allows for the child to experience longer periods between voiding. Prepubescence The late school-age years are also referred to as preado-lescence (the time between middle childhood and the 13th birthday). During preadolescence, prepubescence occurs. Prepubescence typically occurs in the 2 years before the beginning of puberty and is characterized by the development of secondary sexual characteristics, a period of rapid growth for girls, and a period of continued growth for boys. There is approximately 2 years' difference in the onset of prepubescence between boys and girls. Sexual development in both boys and girls can lead to a negative perception of physical appearance and lowered self-esteem. Early development in girls can lead to embarrassment, concern over physical appearance, and low self-esteem. Delayed development in boys can lead to a negative self-concept, resulting in substance abuse or reckless use of nonautomobile vehicles. Early development may lead to risk-taking behaviors in both boys and girls. It is important for the nurse and parents to educate the late school-age child about body changes to decrease anxiety and promote comfort with these body changes. Musculoskeletal System Musculoskeletal growth leads to greater coordination and strength, yet the muscles are still immature and can be injured easily. Bones continue to ossify throughout childhood, but mineralization is not complete until maturity. Immune System Lymphatic tissues continue to grow until the child is 9 years old; immunoglobulins A and G (IgA and IgG) reach adult levels at around 10 years of age. Due to the lymphatic system becoming more competent in localizing infections and producing antibody-antigen responses, school-age children may have fewer infections. They may experience more infections during the first 1 to 2 years of school due to exposure to other children who may have infections. Psychosocial DevelopmentErikson (1963) describes the task of the school-age years to be a sense of industry versus inferiority (Feigelman, 2007a). During this time, the child is developing his or her sense of self-worth by becoming involved in multiple activities at home, at school, and in the community, which develops his or her cognitive and social skills. The child is very interested in learning how things are made and work. The school-age child's satisfaction from achieving success in developing new skills leads him or her to an increased sense of self-worth and level of competence. It is the role of the parents, teachers, coaches, and nurses of the school-age child to identify areas of competency and to build on the child's successful experiences to promote mastery, success, and self-esteem. If the expectations of adults are set too high, the child will develop a sense of inferiority and incompetence that can affect all aspects of his or her life. See Table 6.1 for a further explanation of psychosocial development in school-age children. Cognitive Development Piaget's stage of cognitive development for the 7- to 11-year-old is the period of concrete operational thoughts (Feigelman, 2007a). In developing concrete operations, the child is able to assimilate and coordinate information about his or her world from different dimensions. The child is able to see things from another person's point of view and think through an action, anticipating its consequences and the possibility of having to rethink the action. He or she is able to use stored memories of past experiences to evaluate and interpret present situations. The school-age child also develops the ability to classify or divide things into different sets and to identify their relationships to each other. The school-age child is able to classify members of four generations on a family tree vertically and horizontally, and at the same time see that one person can be a father, son, uncle, and grandson. It is at this time that the school-age child develops an interest in collecting objects. The child starts out collecting multiple objects and becomes more selective as he or she gets older. Also, during concrete operational thinking, the school-age child develops an understanding of the principle of conservation \u2014that matter does not change when its form changes. For example, if the child pours a half-cup of water into a short, wide glass and into a tall, thin glass, she still only has a half-cup of water despite the fact that it looks like the tall, thin glass has more ( Fig. 6.2 ). She learns about conserving matter in a sequence ranging from the simplest to the more complex. See Table 6.1 for further information about cognitive development of school-age children.FIGURE 6.2 School-age children understand the theory of conservation (A). If you pour an equal amount of liquid into two glasses of unequal shape (B), the amount of water you have remains the same despite the unequal appearance in the two glasses (C). Moral and Spiritual Development During the school-age years, the child's sense of morality is constantly being developed. According to Kohl-berg, the school-age child is at the conventional stage of moral development (Kohlberg, 1984). The 7- to 10-year-old usually follows rules out of a sense of being a \"good\" person. He or she wants to be a good person to parents, friends, and teachers and to himself or herself. The adult is viewed as being right. This is stage 3: interpersonal conformity (good child, bad child), according to Kohlberg. Ten- to 12-year-olds progress to stage 4: the \"law and order\" stage. At this stage, the child can determine if an action is good or bad based on the reason for the action, not just on the possible consequences of the action. The older school-age child's behavior is guided by his or her desire to cooperate and by his or her respect for others. This leads to the school-age child's ability to understand and incorporate into his or her behavior the concept of the \"golden rule\" (Feigelman, 2007a). See Table 6.1 for additional information about the moral development of school-age children. It is during school age that children may develop a desire to understand more about their religion (Ford, 2007). They are still concrete thinkers and are guided by their family's religious and cultural beliefs. They are comforted by the rituals of their religion, but are just beginning to understand the differences between natural and supernatural. Incorporating religious practices in their lives can assist school-age children in coping with different stressors. Motor Skill Development Gross and fine motor skills continue to mature throughout the school-age years. Refinement of motor skills occurs, and speed and accuracy increase. To assess the motor skills of school-age children, ask questions about participation in sports and after-school activities, band membership, constructing models, and writing skills. Gross Motor Skills During the school-age years, coordination, balance, and rhythm improve, facilitating the opportunity to ride a two-wheel bike, jump rope, dance, and participate in a variety of other sports ( Fig. 6.3 ). Older school-age children may become awkward due to their bodies growing faster than their ability to compensate. School-age children between the ages of 6 and 8 enjoy gross motor activities such as bicycling, skating, and swimming. They are enthralled with the world and are in constant motion. Sometimes fear is limited due to the strong impulses of exploration. Children between 8 and 10 years of age are less restless, but their energy level continues to be high with activities more subdued and directed. These children exhibit greater rhythm and gracefulness of muscular movements, allowing them to participate in physical activities that require longer and more concentrated attention and effort, such as baseball or soccer.FIGURE 6.3 Jumping rope is an example of the increased development of gross motor skills of the school-age child. Between the ages of 10 and 12 years (the pubescent years for girls), energy levels remain high but are more controlled and focused. Physical skills in this age group are similar to adults', with strength and endurance increasing during adolescence. All school-age children should be encouraged to engage in physical activities and learn physical skills that contribute to their health for the rest of their lives. Cardiovascular fitness, weight control, emotional tension release, and development of leadership and following skills are enhanced through physical activity and team sports. Fine Motor Skills Myelinization of the central nervous system is reflected by refinement of fine motor skills. Eye-hand coordination and balance improve with maturity and practice. Hand usage improves, becoming steadier and independent and granting an ease and precision that allows these children to write, print words, sew, or build models or other crafts. The child between 10 and 12 years of age begins to exhibit manipulative skills comparable to adults. School-age children take pride in activities that require dexterity and fine motor skills such as playing musical instruments ( Fig. 6.4 ). Talent and practice become the keys to proficiency. Sensory Development All senses are mature early in the school-age years. The typical school-age child has 20/20 visual acuity (Jarvis, 2008). In addition, ocular muscular control, peripheral vision, and color discrimination are fully developed by the time the child is 7 years of age. Good vision is essential to the physical development and educational progression of school-age children. Vision screening programs conducted by school nurses identify problems with vision and result in appropriate referrals when warranted. Some problems frequently identified include amblyopia (lazy eye), uncorrected refractive errors or other eye defects, and malalignment of the eyes (called strabismus). Amblyopia is reduced vision in an eye that has not been adequately used during early development. Inadequateuse can result from conditions such as strabismus, one eye being more nearsighted, farsighted, or astigmatic than the other eye. Amblyopia is the leading cause of visual impairment in children (National Eye Institute, 2008). If untreated by age 9 years, amblyopia can cause irreversible visual loss. This condition is correctable prior to this time with glasses or patching. Recent studies have suggested that older children (7 to 17 years) may benefit from these treatments, which are more commonly used on younger children (National Eye Institute, 2008). Proper screening and referral, as well as notification to parents of the existing condition, are essential to the education and socialization of the school-age child. FIGURE 6.4 School-age children improve their fine motor skills so they can play musical instruments well. Hearing deficits that are severe are usually diagnosed in infancy, but the less severe may not be diagnosed until the child enters school and has difficulty learning or with speech. It is important to screen children for hearing deficits to ensure proper educational and social progression. Take Note! With loud music heard over long periods of time each day, there are concerns about these environmental noises affecting hearing in the school-age and adolescent populations. The sense of smell is mature and can be tested in the school-age child by using scents that children are familiar with, such as chocolate or other familiar odors. In addition, the school-age child may be tested for the sense of touch with objects to discriminate cold from hot, soft from hard, and blunt from sharp. Communication and Language Development Language skills continue to accelerate during the school-age years and vocabulary expands. Culturally specific words are used, with bilingual children speaking English in school and a second language at home. The school-age child learns to read and reading efficiency improves language skills. Reading skills are improved with increased reading exposure. School-age children begin to use more complex grammatical forms such as plurals and pronouns. Also, they develop metalinguistic awareness\u2014an ability to think about language and comment on its properties. This enables them to enjoy jokes and riddles due to their understanding of double meanings and play on words and sounds. They are also beginning to understand metaphors such as \"a stitch in time saves nine.\" School-age children may experiment with profanity and dirty jokes if exposed. This age group tends to imitate parents, family members, or others. Therefore, role modeling is very important. Emotional and Social Development Patterns of temperamental traits identified in infancy may continue to influence behavior in the school-age child. Analyzing past situations may provide clues to the way a child may react to new or different situations. Children may react differently over time due totheir experiences and abilities. Self-esteem is the child's view of his or her individual worth. This view is impacted by feedback from family, teachers, and other authority figures. Temperament Temperament has been described as the way individuals behave. Some descriptions of temperament are that the child is easy, slow to warm, or difficult (Feigelman, 2007b). These behaviors vary from the child who is easy (even-tempered and predictable) to the child labeled as difficult (due to high activity levels, irritability, and moodiness) (Alba-Fisch, 2007). The child who is easy may adapt to school entry and other experiences smoothly and with little or no stress. The slow-to-warm child may be slow to adapt to changes. The slow-to-warm school-age child may exhibit discomfort when placed in different or new situations such as school. This child may need time to adjust to the new place or situation, and may demonstrate frustration with tears or somatic complaints. The slow-to- warm child should be allowed time to adjust to new situations and people (such as teachers) within his or her own time frame. All of these factors may impact the younger school-age child upon entering the school environment, with changes in authority and the introduction of many peers. The difficult or easily distracted child may benefit from an introduction to the new experience and people by role-playing, by visiting the site and being introduced to the teachers, and by hearing stories or participating in conversations about the upcoming school experience. These children require patience, firmness, and understanding to make the transition into a new situation or experience such as school. The Behavioral Style Questionnaire (BSQ) (McDevitt & Carey, 1978) is a temperament questionnaire for children 3 to 7 years old; the Middle Childhood Temperament Questionnaire is another tool for children 8 to 12 years of age (Hegvik, McDevitt, & Carey, 1982). These tools may be useful for determining type of temperament and guiding interventions. Self-Esteem Development Self-esteem mirrors the child's individual self-worth and consists of both positive and negative qualities. Children strive to achieve internalized goals of attainment, although they continually receive feedback from individuals they perceive as authorities (parent or teacher). By the school-age years, children have received feedback related to their performance or tasks. The direction of this feedback influences the child's opinion of self-worth, which influences self-esteem and self-evaluation. Children face the process of self-evaluation from a framework of either self-confidence or self-doubt. Children who have mastered the earlier developmental task of autonomy and initiative face the world with feelings of pride rather than shame (Erikson, 1963). If school-age children regard themselves as worthwhile, they have a positive self-concept and high self-esteem. Significant adults in school-age children's lives can manipulate the environment to facilitate success. This success impacts the self-esteem of the child. Body Image Body image is how the school-ager perceives his or her body. School-age children are knowledgeable about the human body but may have different perceptions about body parts. School-age children are very interested in peers' views and acceptances of their body, body changes, and clothing. This age group may model themselves after parents, peers, and persons in movies or on television. It is important for late school-agers to feel accepted by peers. If they feel different and are teased, there may be lifelong effects. School-Age Fears School-age children are less fearful of harm to their body than in their preschool years, but fear being kidnapped or undergoing surgery. They continue to fear the dark and worry about their past behaviors. They fear death and are fascinated by death and dying. They are less fearful of animals, such as dogs and noises. The school-age child needs reassurance that his or her fears are normal for this developmental age. Parents, teachers, and other caretakers should discuss the fears and answer questions posed by the child (Child Development Institute, 2007). Peer Relationships The school-age child's concept of self is shaped not only by his or her parents but also by relationships with others. Peer relationships influence children's independence from parents. Peers play an important role in the approval and critiquing of skills of school-age children. Previously, only adults such as parents and teachers have been authorities; now, peers influence school-age children's perceptions of themselves. Peer relationships help to support the school-age child by providing enough security to risk the parental conflict brought about when establishing independence. School-age children associate with peers of the same sex most of the time. Although games and other activities are shared by both boys and girls, the child's concept of the appropriate sex role is influenced byhis or her relationship with peers. Continuous peer relationships provide the most important social interaction for school-age children. Valuable lessons are learned from interactions with children their own age. Children learn to respect differing points of view that are represented in their groups ( Fig. 6.5 ). Peer groups establish norms and standards that signify acceptance or rejection. Children may modify behavior to gain acceptance. A characteristic of school-age children is their formation of groups with rules and values. Peer and peer-group identification are important to the socialization of the school-age child (Feigelman, 2007a). Teacher and School Influences School serves as a means to transmit values of society and to establish peer relationships. Secondary only to the family, school exerts a profound influence on the social development of the child. Often school requires changes for the child and parent. The child enters an environment that requires conforming to group activities that are structured and directed by an adult other than the parent. The parent's attitude and support influences the child's transition into the school setting. Parents that are positive and supportive promote a smooth entry into school. Parents that encourage clinging behaviors may delay a successful transition into school. FIGURE 6.5 School-age children like to join clubs. These children, in the acting club at school, are rehearsing for a play. To facilitate the transition from home to school, the teacher must have the personality and knowledge of development that will allow him or her to meet the needs of young children. Even though the teacher's responsibilities are primarily to stimulate and guide intellectual development, they must share in shaping the child's attitudes and values. The system of awards and punishment administered by teachers affects the self-concept of children and influences their response to school. Teachers and school are important in shaping the socialization, self-concept, and intellectual development of children. Family Influences The school-age years are a time for peer relationships, questioning of parents, and the potential for parental conflict but continued respect for family values. School-age years are the beginning of the time of peer-group influence, with testing of parental and family values. Although the peer group is influential, the family's values usually predominate when parental and peer-group values come into conflict. Even though the school-age child may question the parents' values, the child will usually incorporate the values from parents into his or her values. Many times in the late school-age and preadolescent period, the child may prefer to be in the company of peers and show a decreased interest in family functions. This may require an adjustment for parents. Parents' awareness of this developmental trend and their continuing support for the child are important while they continue to enforce restrictions and control of behaviors. The school- ager is beginning to strive for independence, but parental authority and controls continue to impact choices and values. Take Note!School-age children continue to need parenting. They do not need parents as pals. Cultural Influences on Growth and Development Culture influences habits, beliefs, language, and values. School-age children thrive on learning the music, language, traditions, holidays, games, values, gender roles, and other aspects of culture. Nurses must be aware of the effects on children of various groups' family structures and traditional values. The school-age child's cultural and ethnic backgrounds must be considered when assessing growth and development, including differences in growth in children of different racial and cultural backgrounds. Cultural implications must be considered for all children and families in order to provide appropriate care. Refer back to Lawrence Jones, who was introduced at the beginning of this chapter. What developmental milestones would you expect him to have reached by this age?THE NURSE'S ROLE IN SCHOOL-AGE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT Growth and development in the school-age child occurs in irregular spurts with a wide variation of sizes, shapes, and abilities seen. Nurses must be aware of the usual growth and development patterns for this age group so that they can assess school-age children appropriately and provide guidance to the child and his or her family. This is a time when children compare themselves to peers and self-esteem is a central issue. The school-age child is separating from his or her parents and seeks acceptance from peers and adults outside of his or her family. Health care visits throughout the school-age period continue to focus on expected growth and development and anticipatory guidance. Visits are more infrequent during the school-age years; therefore, the nurse needs to assess the child's functioning not only at home but also at school and within the community. If the school-age child is hospitalized, growth and development may be altered. The school-age child is able to understand the reason for hospitalization and what will happen. He or she is often worried about pain or changes that may occur to his or her body. It is important for physicians and family members to be honest and open with the school-age child. The school-age child may miss school and the interactions with his or her peers. The school-age child may regress and exhibit behaviors of a younger child, such as needing special comfort toys or demanding attention from his or her parents. Hospitalization for the school-age child can bring with it a loss of control. The school-age child is used to controlling his or her self-care and making choices about his or her meals and activities. When caring for the hospitalized school-age child, the nurse must use knowledge of normal growth and development to recognize potential delays, promote continued appropriate growth and development, and interact successfully with the school-age child. Provide opportunities for the school-age child to maintain independence, gain control, and increase self-esteem. NURSING PROCESS OVERVIEW Upon completion of assessment of the school-age child's current growth and development status, problems or issues related to growth and development may be identified. The nurse may then identify one or more nursing diagnoses, including: Risk for disproportionate growth Imbalanced nutrition: more than body requirements Delayed growth and development Risk for caregiver role strain Risk for injury Nursing care planning for the school-age child with growth and development issues should be individualized based on the school-age child's and family's needs. The nursing care plan can be used as a guide in planning nursing care for the school-age child with a growth and development concern. The nurse may choose the appropriate nursing diagnoses from Nursing Care Plan 6.1 and individualize them as needed. The nursing care plan is intended to serve as a guide, not to be an all- inclusive growth and development care plan. Promoting Healthy Growth and Development The family plays a critical role in promoting healthy growth and development of the school-age child. Respectful interchange of communication between the parent and child will foster self-esteem and self-confidence. This respect will give the child confidence in achieving personal, educational, and social goals appropriate for his or her age. The nurse should study interactions between parents and school-age children to observe for this respect or lack of respect (\"putting the child down\"). The nurse can model appropriate behaviors by listening to the child and making appropriate responses. The nurse can be a resource for parents and an advocate for the child in promoting healthy growth and development. Promoting Growth and Development Through Play Cooperative play is exhibited by the school-age child. Play for the school-age child includes both organized cooperative activities (such as team sports) and solitary activities. School-age children have the coordination and intellect to participate with other children their age in sports such as soccer, baseball, football, and tennis. The school-age child comprehends that his or her cooperation with others will lead to a unified whole for the team. Additionally, the child learns rules and the value of playing by the rules. NURSING CARE PLAN 6.1 Growth and Development Issues of the School-Age ChildNURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for disproportionate growth (risk factors: caregiver knowledge deficit, frequent illnesses) Outcome Identification and Evaluation School-age child will demonstrate adequate growth: appropriate weight gain and increases in height for age and gender Interventions: Promoting Proportionate Growth Assess parent's knowledge of nutritional needs of school-age children to determine need for further education. Plot out height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) to detect possible pattern. Determine need for additional caloric intake if necessary (if very active in sports, if have a chronic illness). Educate mother about appropriate serving sizes and foods so that mother is aware of what to expect for school-age children. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Ineffective Health Maintenance related to lack of exercise, increased caloric intake, poor food choices Outcome Identification and Evaluation School-age child will engage in health maintenance behaviors and lose weight at an appropriate rate: increase amount of exercise, make appropriate eating choices, decrease caloric intake to appropriate amount for age and gender Interventions: Promoting Appropriate Health Maintenance Behaviors Assess knowledge of parents and child about nutritional needs of school-age children to determine deficits in knowledge. Plot out height, weight, and BMI to detect weight loss or weight gain. Have child keep food and exercise diary for 1 week to determine current patterns of eating and exercise. Interview parents in relationship to their eating habits and exercise habits to determine where adjustments might need to be made. Analyze preceding data, and base recommendations for changes on these data. Discuss ways to decrease temptation to overeat and to make good meal choices (see Teaching Guideline 6.2 ). Have child assist in meal planning and grocery shopping to allow him or her some sense of control in process. Incorporate increase in daily exercise, which will stress sense of self-improvement, to increase caloric expenditure and self-esteem. Decrease TV/computer time to increase caloric expenditure. Develop reward system to increase self-esteem. Investigate joining weight-loss program for school-age children to increase self-esteem and to increase awareness that other children have the same problem. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Growth and development, delayed related to speech, motor, psychosocial, or cognitive concerns as evidenced by delay in meeting expected school performances Outcome Identification and Evaluation Development will be maximized: School-age child will make continued progress toward attainment of expected school performances. Interventions: Promoting Growth and Development Perform scheduled evaluation of the school-age child by school and physician to determine current functioning. Develop realistic multidisciplinary plan to ensure maximizing resources. Carry out interventions as prescribed by developmental specialist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, or speech therapist at home and at school to maximize benefit of interventions. Have scheduled evaluation meetings to be able to adapt interventions as soon as possible. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Caregiver role strain, risk for (risk factors: new sibling in household, knowledge deficit about school-age issues, lack of prior exposure, fatigue, ill or developmentally delayed child) Outcome Identification and Evaluation Parent will experience competence in role: will demonstrate appropriate caretaking behaviors and verbalize comfort in caring for a school-age child Interventions: Preventing Caregiver Role Strain Assess parents' knowledge of school-age children and the issues that arise as a part of normal development to determine parents' needs. Provide education on normal issues of school-age children so that parents are armed with the knowledge they need to appropriately care for their school-age child. Provide anticipatory guidance related to upcoming expected issues related to school-age development to prepare parents for what to expect next and how to intervene. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Injury, risk for (risk factors: curiosity, increasing cognitive skills and motor abilities) Outcome Identification and Evaluation School-age child's safety will be maintained: will remain free from injury Interventions: Preventing Injury Discuss safety measures needed for the following: bikes, scooters, guns, skateboards, cars, water, and playground to decrease risk of injury related to those areas. Discuss and develop a fire safety plan to decrease risk of injury related to fire. Discuss appropriate safety equipment needed for each sport to decrease risk of injury. Discuss appropriate sports to participate in depending on age, sex, and maturity of child to prevent possible injury and to promote child's self-esteem. Instruct parents to post the Poison Control Center phone number (in the event of accidental ingestion, Poison Control can give parents the best advice for appropriate intervention). Teach parents and child first-aid measures and child cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to minimize consequences of injury should it occur. Discuss influence of peers on actions of school-age children to prevent possible injury due to mimicking behavior.FIGURE 6.6 This school-age girl enjoys solitary play with her dollhouse and dolls. School-age children also enjoy solitary activities including board, card, video, and computer games, and dollhouse and other small-figure play ( Fig. 6.6 ). Many school-agers start collections of stamps, cars, or other valuable or not-so-valuable items. During the school-age years, children may also begin a scrapbook or keep a diary. They may participate in activities such as dance or karate. Girls and boys may join clubs, gangs, or special interest groups. Active play has decreased in recent years as television viewing and computer games have increased. This trend has resulted in health risks such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular problems. Promoting Learning School attendance and learning are very important to the school-age child. Parent-child, child-teacher, and child-peer relationships and activities influence the school-age child's learning. Formal Education Most children are excited about starting school and making new friends. They like the notion of getting books, having book bags, and having homework assignments. The reality of the work involved with school and homework may decrease the enthusiasm about school. Peers are very important within this age group. Both peers and teachers influence children. Attending school may be their first experience interacting with a large number of children their own age. Through this interaction, children learn cooperation, competition, and the importance of following the rules. Peer approval and influences grow as the child matures. Teachers have significant influences on children. They help to guide the child's intellectual development by rewarding successes and helping the child deal with failures. The student-teacher relationship is a key to success. Teachers play a role in fostering feelings of industry and preventing feelings of inferiority ( Fig. 6.7 ). School-age children also learn skills, rules, values, and other ways to work with peers and other authority figures.FIGURE 6.7 School is important to the school-age child. Parental support is important for school adjustment and achievement. Parents must collaborate with teachers and school personnel to ensure that the child is fulfilling the expectations and requirements for this age group in school. Parents must monitor the child's homework assignments and friends, and observe for any changes in behavior that would indicate school or behavioral problems. Reading Encouraging reading is an excellent way to promote learning in the school-age child. Trips to the library and purchasing books help to promote a love of reading. School-age children enjoy being read to as well as reading on their own. Younger school-age children (6 to 8 years) enjoy books that are simple to read with few words on a page, such as the Dr. Seuss books. They enjoy books about animals and trains and simple mysteries. Children 8 to 10 years of age have more advanced reading skills and enjoy those books from early childhood, plus more classic novels and adventures such as the Harry Potter series. Older children enjoy horror stories, mysteries, romances, and adventure stories as well as classic novels. School-age children of all ages benefit from books on topics related to things they may be experiencing, such as a visit to the hospital for a surgical procedure. See Box 6.1 for ideas for parents to promote reading in the school-age child. Promoting Safety School-age children become more independent with age. This independence leads to an increased self-confidence and decreased fears, which may contribute to accidents and injuries. School age is a time that the child may walk to school with peers who may influence his or her behavior. Increased independence may also increase exposure to dangerous situations such as the approach of strangers or unsafe streets. Promotion of safe habits during the school-age years is important for parents and nurses. See Teaching Guidelines 6.1 for additional information on safety education for nurses and parents. BOX 6.1 PROMOTION OF READING IN SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN Parents, read to and with your children. Ask teachers and librarians for advice on books appropriate for your child. Choose stories that the child can relate to if the child has difficulty reading. Choose books with movement if the child has a short attention span. Take advantage of all reading opportunities (cereal boxes, road signs). Provide choices for the child to select a book of interest. Talk about the text and ask questions to improve understanding. Keep a record of what the child is reading. Visit a library, get a library card, and check out books. Parents, demonstrate role modeling through reading books. Teaching Guidelines 6.1 SAFETY ISSUES AND INTERVENTIONS OF THE SCHOOL-AGE CHILD Safety Issue Interventions Car safety Seat belt or age- and weight-appropriate booster seat should be used at all times. Seat belts should be fastened before car is started. Children under 12 years must sit in back seat. Childproof locks should be used in back seat. Rules of conduct for car rides must be established. Pedestrian safety Child should be instructed on looking right, left, then right again before crossing the street; and crossing only at safe crossings. Older children and adults should provide supervision of younger children. Walking should only be done on sidewalks. In parking lots, children should know to watch for cars backing up and not dart out between parked cars. If children are playing outside, drivers should be aware of their presence before backing up. Bike safety: general Bikes should be well-maintained and appropriately sized. Child should be oriented to bike and demonstrate ability to ride bike safely before being allowed to ride on street. Safe areas for bike riding should be established as well as routes to and from area of activities. Riding bike barefoot, with someone else on bike, or with clothing that might get entangled in the bike should be prohibited. Child should know to wear sturdy, well-fitting shoes. Child should know to wear ANSI-approved helmets. Bike should be inspected often to ensure it is in proper working order. A basket should be used to carry heavy objects. Bike safety in traffic All traffic signs and signals must be observed. If riding at night, the bike should have lights and reflectors and the rider should wear light-colored clothes. Child should know to ride on the side of the road traveling with traffic, and keep close to the side of the road in single file. Child should learn to watch and listen for cars. Headphones should not be used while riding a bike. Never hitch a ride on any vehicles. Sports safety Sports should be matched to child's ability and desire. Sports program should have warm-up procedure. Coaches should be trained in car-diopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and first aid. Appropriate protection devices should be used for individual sport. Skateboarding and inline skating safety Child should wear helmet, and protective padding on knees, elbows, and wrists Child should know not skate in traffic or on streets or highways. Homemade ramps should be assessed for hazards before skating. All-terrain vehicle safety Child should be at least 16 years of age to operate vehicle. Helmets must be worn in addition to protective coverings. No nighttime riding. Use should be avoided on public roads. Never stand up in the vehicle or ride in a person's lap. All homes should have working smoke detectors and fire extinguishers. Change the batteries at least twice a year. Have a fire-escape plan.Fire safety Practice fire-escape plan routinely. Nobody should smoke in bed. Teach what to do in case of a fire: use fire extinguisher, call 911, and how to put out clothing fire. Use stove and other cooking facilities under adult supervision. All flammable materials and liquids should be stored safely. Fireplaces should have protective gratings. Teach children to avoid touching wires they might encounter while playing. Water safety Teach children how to swim. If swimming skill is limited, child must wear life preserver at all times. Child should know never swim alone\u2014if at all possible, swim only where there is a life guard. Understand basic CPR. Teach child to never run or fool around at edge of pool. Drains in pool should be covered with appropriate cover. Life jackets should be worn when on boat. Make sure water is deep enough to support diving. Firearm safety Teach child never to touch gun\u2014tell adult. If have guns in household, need to secure them in safe place, use gun safety locks, store bullets in separate place. Never point a gun at a person. Toxin safety Teach child the hazards of accepting illegal drugs, alcohol, or dangerous drugs. Store potential dangerous material in safe place.

(2008). Bright futures guidelines for health supervision of infants, children, and adolescents (3rd ed.). Elk Grove Village, IL: American Academy of Pediatrics. Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death in children between 1 and 21 years of age (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2009). Each year, 20 million children sustain an injury sufficiently severe to seek medical attention (Borse et al., 2008; CDC, 2008c). School-age children are very active at home, in the community, and at school. This increased mobility, activity, and time away from parents increases the risk for unintentional injuries. School-age children continue to need supervision and guidance. They need information and rules about car safety, pedestrian safety, bicycle and other sport safety, fire safety, and water safety. Car Safety Motor vehicle accidents are a common cause of injury in the school-age child. While traveling in the car, school-age children should always sit in the rear seat. The front seat is dangerous because of passenger-side airbags in most new-model cars. The school-age child should use a three-point restraint system in the rear seat of the car with the shoulder strap and lap belt fitted snugly. In addition, a school-age child over 40 pounds (generally 4 to 8 years of age) should use a belt-positioning, forward-facing booster seat using both lap and shoulder belts (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [NHTSA], 2008). School-age children who outgrow the convertible restraint can sit in a booster seat until their head is higher than the vehicle seat back (usually 4'9\" and taller) (NHTSA, 2008). Children younger than 12 years of age should not ride in the front seat of a vehicle with an airbag (NHTSA, 2008). Pedestrian Safety Twenty percent of fatal crashes in children between the ages of 5 and 9 involve pedestrian-related fatalities (Percer, 2009). Children younger than 10 years of age should not cross the street alone (Percer, 2009). Young school-age children therefore should walk to school or the bus with an older friend, sibling, or parent. Darting out into the street without looking both ways or from between cars is a common occurrence in the school-age years. Teach children safe street and pedestrian practices. Bicycle and Sport Safety Bicycling, riding scooters, skateboarding, and inline skating or rollerskating are common activities of school-age children. Laws inmost states require helmets for riding bicycles and scooters. In addition, when skating or skateboarding, school-age children should wear a helmet, kneepads, and elbow pads. Research has shown that head injuries due to bicycle accidents have been reduced by 85% by wearing a well-fitting helmet (Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute, 2009). National estimates of bicycle helmet ownership and use varies greatly among different areas and sectors of the U.S., but overall it is estimated at about 25% (Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute, 2009) (see Healthy People 2020). It is important for children to wear helmets that fit and that do not obstruct their vision or hearing. Because school-age children have completed most of their skull growth, a helmet can be worn into adolescence. It is important for the child to have a bicycle that is appropriate for his or her size and age. The child should be able to plant both feet on the ground when sitting on the seat of the bike ( Fig. 6.8 ). It is important to stress to parents the importance of appropriate size and not to get a bike for the child to \"grow into.\" If older school-agers are using the bike for transportation on busy streets, they should be taught to use bike lanes and to give appropriate hand signals for turning. Nonmotorized and motorized scooters also place children at risk for injury, so counsel families about the use of protective gear, including helmets, elbow pads, and kneepads. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov .FIGURE 6.8 Wearing the appropriate safety equipment and having an appropriately sized bicycle are important to prevent injuries in school-age children. Fire Safety School-age children are eager to help parents with cooking and ironing. They are curious about fire and are drawn to play with fire, matches, and fireworks. Serious burns can occur from any exposure to fire. Educate children about the hazards of fire. In addition, teach children proper behavior around fires at home and outdoors. Always supervise children in the use of matches. In the home setting, parents should develop a fire safety plan with their children, teach children what to do if their clothes catch on fire, and practice evacuating the house in the event of a fire. In the school setting, children should be aware of the appropriate response to fire drills and fire drills should be conducted on a regular basis. Water Safety Teach school-age children swim and water safety. An adult should always supervise children when they are swimming to prevent water-related accidents. Abuse in Children Child abuse, including physical abuse and sexual abuse, is a common crime of violence against children. An estimated 6 million reports of child abuse are made annually to child protective services in the United States (CDC, 2008a). Over 900,000 cases were substantiated in 2006, with 64% being victims of neglect, 16% victims of physical abuse, 9% victims of sexual abuse, and 7% victims of emotional or psychological abuse (CDC, 2008b). The abusers of children are family, friends, and strangers. It is important for parents to teach children the concept of \"good touch\" versus \"bad touch\" prior to school-age years. Whenever the school-age child's behavior yields suspicion of physical or sexual abuse, the nurse should report to the appropriate authorities in his or her state. These topics will be discussed in more depth in Chapter 30 .Remember Lawrence Jones, the 10-year-old presented in the case study? What anticipatory guidance related to safety should you provide to his mother? Promoting Nutrition Growth, body composition, and body shape remain constant during late school-age years. Needed calories decrease while the appetite increases. In preparation for adolescence, the body fat composition of school-age children increases. This tendency toward increased body fat occurs earlier in girls than in boys, with the amount of increase greater in girls. Boys have more lean body mass per inch of height than girls. BOX 6.2 DIETARY QUESTIONS Questions for the Child How often do you eat together as a family? What are the usual mealtimes? How often does the family eat out? Do you eat breakfast regularly? Where do you eat lunch? What do you drink/how much? What foods do you eat most often? What is your favorite food? How often do you eat fast foods? What type of exercise do you do? Questions for the Parents How would you describe your child's usual appetite? Do you have any special cultural/religious practices regarding food? Has your child gained or lost weight recently? Do you have any concerns about his or her eating behaviors? How does your child exercise? Your family? Is there a family history of cancer, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, or heart disease? Diet preferences established in the preschool years continue during the school-age period. As the child grows older, influences of family, media, and peers can impact the eating habits of this age group. Some of these influences are parents' work schedule, outside activities, and exercise level of the child. Decreased exercise levels and poor nutritional choices lead to the mounting problem of obesity seen in this age group. See Box 6.2 for appropriate questions to ask the child and parent regarding nutritional status. Healthy People 2020 provides objectives and actions to improve the nutritional health of children. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020Nutritional Needs The school-age child's calorie needs vary based on age, gender, and activity level. In general, children with higher activity levels and male gender have higher calorie needs (U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010). Boys and girls 4 to 8 years old who are moderately active will need about 1,400 to 1,600 calories a day (U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010). Boys 9 to 13 years old who are moderately active need about 1,800 to 2,000 calories a day, while girls this age who are moderately active need about 1,600 to 2,000 calories a day (U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010). Of these calories, 45% to 65% should come from carbohydrates, 10% to 30% from protein, and 25% to 35% from fat (U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010). The 4- to 8-year-old child needs 800 to 1,000 mg of calcium, while the 9- to 13-year-old needs 1,300 mg of calcium for maintenance of growth and good nutrition (Krebs, Primark, & Haemer, 2011). Calcium is needed for the development of strong bones and teeth. Milk, yogurt, and cheese provide protein, vitamins, and minerals and are an excellent source of calcium. Meats, poultry, fish, and eggs provide protein, vitamins, and minerals. Promoting Healthy Eating Habits School-age children should choose culturally appropriate foods and snacks from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's MyPyramid ( Fig. 6.9 ). MyPyramid.gov offers many tools for the child to use including development of personalized goals and menus, online dieting and physical activity assessment tools, games, activities, and tips for parents. School-age children need to limit intake of fat and processed sugars. A prudent diet limits the use of fatty meats, high-fat dairy products, eggs, and hydrogenated shortenings and promotes the consumption of fish and the substitution of polyunsaturated vegetable oils and margarines. The American Heart Association has endorsed a diet for school-age children that includes the recommendations listed in Box 6.3. Preventing the Development of Overweight and Obesity The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that more and more children are overweight. Over the past three decades the number of overweight children and adolescents more than tripled. Thirty percent of 6- to 11-year-olds are overweight or at risk for overweight (National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, 2006). Overweight is classified as a body mass index (BMI) greater than 85% and obese is classified as a BMI greater than 95% (Krebs et al., 2011; U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010) (see Healthy People 2020). BOX 6.3AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION'S DIET RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN A high-quality protein with every meal Milk with added vitamin D and other low-fat dairy products Vegetables high in vitamin A Fruits high in vitamin C Whole-grain or enriched breads or cereals Vegetable oils high in polyunsaturated fats Meats (4 servings per week of 4 ounces each) Fish (1-2 times per week) Poultry (1-2 times per week) Dark green, leafy, or deep yellow vegetables (at least 4 times per week) Eggs (4 times per week) Adapted from American Heart Association, Gidding, S. S., Dennison, B. A., Birch, L. L., Daniels, S. R., Gilman, M. W., et al. (2006). Dietary recommendations for children and adolescents: A guide for practitioners. Pediatrics, 7 77(2), 544-559. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Obesity occurs when the intake of calories and food exceeds the expenditures. Some factors linked to causing obesity include family role modeling, lack of exercise, unstructured meals, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, large portion sizes, television viewing, and video gaming as well as cultural, genetic, environmental, and socioeconomic factors. Some factors that influence lack of exercise include the decreased number of days that school systems offer physical education programs and recess. Also, some children live in unsafe neighborhoods or in a community that lacks sidewalks or parks and have no safe place to play outside; therefore, they spend time doing sedentary activities such as watching TV or playing video or computer games (U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010). Obese children are at risk for cardiovascular diseases such as high cholesterol and hypertension, type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes, respiratory complications such as obstructive sleep apnea, mental health issues such as depression, anxiety and eating disorders, and orthopedic problems (Krebs et al., 2011; U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010). When parents do not have knowledge of nutrition, do not monitor snacks or meals, and have unstructured meals, habits are established that lead to obesity.FIGURE 6.9 MyPyramid for kids. Eat foods from each color every day; choose more foods from the food groups with the wider stripes. (From U.S. Department of Agriculture [2005]. My pyramid for kids. Retrieved March 21, 2011, from http://teamnutrition.usda.gov/Resources/mpk_poster2.pdf ) Preventing obesity in childhood is important because the fat cells of childhood are carried into adulthood obesity and contribute to disease. Due to the risk of obesity, encourage parents to never use food as a reward. To prevent obesity, establish regular mealtimes and offer healthy foods and snacks. Encourage parents to praise their child's good food choices and to role model appropriate eating and exercise. Regarding Lawrence Jones, what questions should you ask Lawrence's mother related to nutritional intake? What anticipatory guidance related to nutrition would be appropriate? Promoting Healthy Sleep and Rest The number of hours of sleep required for growth and development decreases with age. Children between the ages of 6 and 8 years require about 12 hours of sleep per night, children between 8 and 10 years of age require 10 to 12 hours of sleep per night, and children between 10 and 12 years of age need 9 to 10 hours of sleep per night. Young school-age children may need an occasional brief nap for an energy boost after being in school for most of the day. Bedtime rituals and consistent schedules continue to be important throughout the school-age years. Parents must facilitate the bedtime schedule and quiet time before bed. Bedtime is a special time for parents and children to read together, listen to stories or soothing music, share events of the day, and exchange expressions of affection (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007a). Children should have bedtime expectations as well as wake-up times and methods for waking up (alarm, calling by parent, and so forth). Night terrors or sleepwalking may occur in 6- to 8-year-olds but should be resolved between the ages of 8 and 10 years. In theolder school-age child (11 to 12 years), encourage parents to allow a variation in the sleep schedule on the weekends and a regular schedule on weekdays. Provide anticipatory guidance to Lawrence Jones's mother in relation to proper sleep for her 10-year-old son. Promoting Healthy Teeth and Gums Dental caries remains a leading chronic disease in the United States (CDC, 2010a; Peterson-Sweeney & Stevens, 2010). The incidence declined from the 1970s to the early 1990s, mostly due to the introduction of fluoride (National Institutes of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, 2008). Since then there has been a small but significant increase in the incidence of dental caries. Recent statistics show that 51% of children between the ages of 6 and 11 have dental caries in their primary teeth and 21% have dental caries in their permanent teeth (National Institutes of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, 2008). Dental care with emphasis on prevention of caries is important in this age group. School-age children need to brush their teeth two to three times per day for 2 to 3 minutes each time with fluorinated toothpaste (Nield, Stenger, & Kamat, 2007) ( Fig. 6.10 ). Parents should replace the toothbrush (soft) every 3 to 4 months (Peterson-Sweeney & Stevens, 2010). Flossing the teeth at least once daily is recommended along with limiting the intake of sugar to aid in the prevention of cavities and improved oral health (Nield et al., 2007). Parents must monitor teeth brushing, observe for abnormal alignment of their child's teeth, and schedule regular dental examinations every 6 months to ensure good dental health and prevent dental problems. Children may need help with brushing teeth until they are between 7 and 10 years of age. FIGURE 6.10 Using correct technique to brush the teeth is important in the prevention of cavities. Dental sealants are recommended for all school-age children (CDC, 2010a). The sealant is a plastic coating applied to bitingsurfaces to seal out tooth decay on permanent back teeth. In addition, parents should give a fluoride supplement (as directed by the dentist) to their children if fluoride is not in the town's water supply (American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, 2008). The school- age child should have an established dental home; if not, provide appropriate resources to establish one (Hagan, Shaw, & Duncan, 2008). Sometimes dental care is not considered to be important by parents of young children because the primary teeth will be replaced by permanent teeth. This perception leads to complications of permanent teeth such as malocclusion , a condition in which the teeth are crowded, crooked, or misaligned (see Healthy People 2020). HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov. Proper alignment of teeth is important to tooth formation, speech development, and physical appearance. Many school-age children need braces or other orthodontic devices to correct malocclusion, a condition in which the teeth are crowded, crooked, or misaligned. Bruxism or teeth grinding while asleep may continue in the school-age years. Bruxism may result in grinding away of tooth enamel. Teeth grinding may be due to malalignment. A dental evaluation should be scheduled if consistent teeth grinding occurs. Children wearing braces are more prone to cavities; encourage them to brush their teeth after meals and snacks. School nurses can assist these children with brushing after lunch. In addition, the school nurse should promote dental health through education on dental care and gum problems that result from lack of proper dental care. Diet can play a part in dental health. Limiting sticky, high-sugar, and high-carbohydrate foods will decrease the possibility of cavities. Promoting Appropriate Discipline Because of the increasing ability of the school-age child to view situations from different angles, the school-age child should be able to see how his or her actions affect others. The school-age child is aware of the cause and effect of his or her behaviors and realizes that his or her behaviors have consequences. School-age children should be able to express emotions without using violence. Discipline techniques with consequences have both natural and logical consequences (Barakat & Clark, 2007). Natural consequences allow the child to learn the results of his or her actions. For example, if the child throws a toy out of the window, then he or she cannot play with the toy anymore. In logical consequences, if the child does not put away his or her bike, he or she does not get to ride the bike for the rest of the day. In disciplining children, parents should teach children the rules established by the family, values, and social rules of conduct. Rules should provide the school-age child with guidelines about behavior that is acceptable and unacceptable. School-age children look to their parents for guidance and as role models. Parents should role model appropriate expressions of feelings and emotions and allow the child to express emotions and feelings. Discuss the effects of the child's temperament on his or her behavior, as well as what constitutes age-appropriate behavior. Include how the parents' temperament can influence the child's temperament. Effective guidance and discipline focus on the development of the child. They can preserve the child's self-esteem and dignity. Discuss with parents guidelines regarding discipline. Explain to parents that they should never belittle the child. Children may view parents and caretakers negatively if they are consistently belittled or insulted. These negative actions can inhibit learning and teach the child to react unkindly to others. Instead, parents should discipline with praise. Positive acknowledgements of progress are likely toencourage healthy development and appropriate behavior (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2004). Discuss with parents how to be realistic when planning activities so as to not overwhelm the child, resulting in misbehavior. Encourage parents to say \"no\" only when they mean it, to avoid a negative atmosphere in the home, and to avoid inconsistency. When misbehaviors occur, the type and amount of discipline are based on different factors: Developmental level of both the child and the parents Severity of the misbehavior Established rules of the family Temperament of the child Response of the child to rewards Keep in mind that school-age children should participate in developing a plan of action for their misbehavior. Whatever methods of discipline are chosen, it is important that parents are consistent in providing discipline in a nurturing environment. Addressing Common Developmental Concerns The developmental task (according to Erikson) of the school-age child is industry (Erikson, 1963; Feigelman, 2007a). The school-age child is busy learning, achieving, and exploring. As the school-age child becomes more independent, forces other than the family such as television, video games, and peers influence him or her. Some of these influences are positive and others are negative. Some of the common developmental concerns for the school-age child are discussed in the following sections. Guidelines to assist the parents and nurses when encountering these concerns are included in Teaching Guidelines 6.2 . Teaching Guidelines 6.2 ADDRESSING COMMON DEVELOPMENTAL CONCERNS Television and Video Games Limit television watching and video-game playing to 2 hours per day. Monitor television programs. Prohibit television or video games with violence. Do not put television or video games in children's bedrooms. Provide a schedule of accepted television programs for viewing each week. Co-view television and video games with the child. Encourage sports, interactive play, and reading. Obesity Provide healthy meals and snacks. Schedule and encourage daily exercise. Encourage involvement in sports. Restrict TV and computer-game use. Limit the amount of fast-food intake. Provide education about healthy nutrition. Never use food as a reward. Be a good role model. School Phobia Return child to school. Investigate cause of the fear. Support child. Collaborate with teachers. Praise success in school attendance. Latchkey Kids Provide rules to follow and expectations, such as: Not answering the door or phone No friends in the house when parents are not home No playing with fire Teach child to call a trusted neighbor when help is needed and 911 in the event of emergency. Post all resource numbers (even numbers you think your child may have memorized), including after-school help lines if available, in a clearly viewable spot. Purchase caller ID for the phone system. Enroll the child in an after-school program if available. Discuss limitations of outside play. Discuss limitations of television viewing and videogame use. Make sure the child knows how to contact the parent. Set clear homework expectations. DO NOT keep guns in the home. Stealing Educate parents about possibility of stealing. Discuss ways to teach concept of ownership and property rights. Handle situation openly. Assist child in developing and enacting a plan to return what was stolen. Make sure the punishment is appropriate for the action. Lying Help parents in understanding why the child is lying. When the child lies, calmly confront the child and explain why the behavior is not acceptable. Educate parents that their behavior should reflect what they teach and expect from their child. Educate parents that too-rigid or severe punishments can decrease the child's sense of worth. Seek professional help if lying persists in the older school-age child, to rule out underlying problems. Cheating Educate parents that the child must be mature enough to understand the concept of rules. Handle cheating situations openly. Help parents to understand why their child is cheating and to modify the trigger. Develop appropriate punishment; inappropriate punishment could undermine the child. Educate parents that their behavior should reflect what they expect from their child. Seek professional help if cheating persists in the older school-age child, to rule out underlying problems. Bullying The Bullied Child Educate parents whose children are at risk for being bullied, such as: Children who appear different from the majority Children who act different from the majority Children who have low self-esteem Children with a mental or psychological problem Teach parents to role-play different scenarios the child may face at school; show the child different ways to react to being bullied. Impress upon the child that he or she did not cause the bullying. Develop ways to increase the child's self-esteem at home. Discuss the situation with the teacher and develop a plan of care. The Bullying Child Educate parents on reasons why it is important to correct the behavior. Discuss ways the child can appropriately show his or her anger and feelings. Have parents help the child to see how it feels to be bullied. Do not allow fighting at home. Reward settling of conflicts without violence. Tobacco and Alcohol Education Inquire about tobacco and alcohol use. Discuss the physical and social dangers of tobacco and alcohol use. Urge parents to be good role models. Limit reading and media materials about alcohol and tobacco use. Discuss the influences of tobacco and alcohol use by peers. Educate the child on spit tobacco. Let them know it is just as dangerous as smoking tobacco. Advocate for a smoke-free environment in the home and other places frequented. Avoid having tobacco and alcohol products readily available in the home. Television and Video Games The influence of television and video games upon the school-age child is a growing concern for parents and child specialists. Children, 8 to 18 years of age, in the United States spend about 4 hours a day either watching TV or playing video games and another 2 hours on the computer outside of school work (Gavin, 2008). During that time, a child by the age of 18 will see 200,000 violent acts (Gavin, 2008). Although a school-age child can determine what is real from what is fantasy, research has shown that this amount of time in front of the TV\u2014watching it or playing video games\u2014can lead to aggressive behavior, less physical activity, and obesity (Gavin, 2008) (see Healthy People 2020). HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov. Although some television shows and video games can have positive influences on children, teach parents guidelines on the use of TV and video games. Parents should set limits on how much TV watching the child can have. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends 2 hours or less of television viewing per day (Gavin, 2008). The parent should establish guidelines on when the child can watch TV, for example, after homework or when chores are completed (Gavin, 2008). Television watching should not be used as a reward. The parents should be aware of what the child is watching. Watch the programs together and use that opportunity to discuss the subject matter with the child. There should be no TV during dinner and no TV in the child's room. The parents need to set an example for the child. Read instead of watching TV or do a physical activity together as a family. If the TV causes fights or arguments, it should be turned off for a period of time. School Phobia School refusal (also called school phobia or school avoidance) has been defined as a refusal to attend school or difficulty remaining in school for an entire day. Behaviors include frequent absences, skipping classes, chronically late for school, severe misbehavior before school, or attending school with great fear. School phobia needs to be defined both symptomatically and operationally as the cause for the anxiety. School avoidance occurs in approximately 8.2% of children and adolescents (Kearney & Chapman, 2008). Some of the fears expressed by school-refusing children include separating from parents, riding the bus, tests, bullying, teacher reprimands, anxieties over toileting in a public bathroom, physical harm, or undressing in the locker room. Due to the emotionaldistress caused in these children when attending school, they are frequently classified as having school phobia. Young children may complain of stomachache or headache and older children may complain of palpitations or feeling faint. It is important to investigate specific causes of school refusal/school phobia and take appropriate actions. Many times school phobia is a symptom of deeper problems. Children with extensive school refusal are at risk for dropping out of school, delinquency, and social and occupational problems in adulthood (Kearney & Chapman, 2008). The physician or nurse practitioner should conduct a physical examination of the child to rule out any physical illness. After these measures are taken, the parent, teacher, school counselor, and school administrator may devise a plan to assist the student to overcome a specific fear. In uncomplicated cases, parents must return the child to school as soon as possible. There may be altered schedules (partial days or decreased hours) to help promote a successful transition back to school. Another idea to help desensitize the child may be to have him or her spend part of the day in the counselor's or school nurse's office. Latchkey Children With the increasing incidence of both parents in the workforce and many children living with just one parent, often times children return home alone without adult supervision for a number of hours. Most young children are not capable of handling stress or making decisions on their own before 11 or 12 years of age. However, some school-age children are more mature and can be left alone by 8 to 10 years of age; maturity is the key, not the age. Parents not only need to consider their child's maturity and readiness to be home alone but also must comply with legal requirements if present. Laws regarding the age at which it is legal to leave a child home alone vary by state; therefore, the nurse needs to be familiar with the state and local laws in order to assist parents in making decisions about when it is appropriate for their child to be home alone (Kroll & Nield, 2010). The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that a school-age child come home to a parent or another responsible adult (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009a). Despite the level of maturity, children who are unsupervised are more likely to participate in risky behaviors such as smoking, drinking, and doing drugs (Kroll & Nield, 2010). Children left alone have a higher incidence of injuries such as burns, falls, and poisoning than children who are supervised (Kroll & Nield, 2010). In addition, latchkey children may feel anxiety, fear, boredom, or loneliness (Kroll & Nield, 2010). If children come home to no supervision, they should know the names, addresses, and phone numbers of parents and a neighbor, as well as emergency numbers. They should be given rules about answering the door and the phone. They should tell anyone who comes to the door or who calls that mom is home but busy at this time. Directions as to the handling of the house key and fire safety should be taught and demonstrated (see Teaching Guidelines 6.2 ). Stealing, Lying, and Cheating It is during the school-age years that antisocial behaviors can emerge. Children who were previously well behaved may now exhibit behaviors such as stealing, lying, and cheating (Mannheim & Zieve, 2010). Parents are usually disturbed by this change in behavior. In turn, they have difficulty in addressing these issues and need help in providing appropriate interventions. Children between 6 and 8 years old do not fully understand the concept of ownership and property rights. These children may steal things because they like the look of the item. By the age of 9, the child should respect others' possessions and property and understand that stealing is wrong (Children's Hospital of Boston, 2010). The school-age child may steal because he or she desires the item, feels peer pressure and is trying to impress his or her peers, or has a sense of low self-esteem (Children's Hospital of Boston, 2010). Stealing becomes a concern if the child steals and does not have remorse or continuously steals, or if stealing is accompanied by other behavior problems (Children's Hospital of Boston, 2010). Lying is more common in boys and in children between 5 and 8 years old (Children's Hospital of Boston, 2010). It is acceptable for these children to tell tall tales, but they should know what truth is and what make-believe is. These younger children typically lie to avoid punishment. However, they do not like others to lie and will tell on them if they lie. Children between 8 and 12 years old typically lie because they are unable to meet expectations of family and peers, they are testing the rules and limits placed on them, or they are unable to explain bad behavior (Children's Hospital of Boston, 2010). If lying persists in older school-age children, parents should discuss the matter with a physician because the lying may be evidence of underlying problems. The concept of cheating is not well understood until the child is 7 years old. Before this age, the desire to \"win\" is most important and rigid rules are hard to understand. In children between 8 and 12 years old, the concept of cheating is fully understood and following of rules becomes more important (Children's Hospital of Boston, 2010). Cheating is usually done because of competition and strong pressure placed on the child to succeed (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2010). If cheating persists in older school-age children, parents should discuss the matter with a physician because the behavior may indicate underlying problems. In dealing with children who exhibit stealing, lying, or cheating behaviors, parents must first realize the importance of their ownbehaviors in those areas. Parents are role models to the school-age child. Therefore, when the child sees or hears that parents lie, steal, or cheat (e.g., parents bragging about cheating on their taxes), they think it is all right to mimic those behaviors. Secondly, parents must directly confront any stealing, lying, or cheating behaviors and discuss (and follow through consistently with) the consequences of such behaviors (see Teaching Guideline 6.2 ). Bullying Bullying, which is inflicting repeated verbal, emotional, or physical abuse upon others, is on the rise (Schoen & Schoen, 2010). Utilizing email, text messages, social networking, and instant messaging, often referred to as cyberbullying, is a growing concern. Bullies often look for victims who appear shy, weak, and defenseless. Children with disabilities are at an increased risk of being bullied (Schoen & Schoen, 2010). In general, about 10% of all children attending school are frightened and afraid most of the day (American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 2008). Thirty percent of children in 6th to 10th grades bully or have been bullied (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009b). Most of the bullying occurs at school (Augustyn & Zuckerman, 2007). Both boys and girls are bullied and can bully others; however, boys are twice as likely to be bullies and victims of bullying (Augustyn & Zuckerman, 2007). Boys usually bully other boys and use force more often, while girls can be bullied by both sexes using mainly verbal bullying, like social alienation and intimidation (Schoen & Schoen, 2010). Being bullied can have negative results on children throughout life. These children often have increased episodes of headaches, stomachaches, sleep problems, anxiety, loneliness, depression, and suicidal tendencies (Schoen & Schoen, 2010). After the problem of either being bullied or being the bully has been identified, parents must work with the child, the school, and the physician to solve the problem (see Teaching Guidelines 6.2 and Evidence-Based Practice 6.1 ). Tobacco and Alcohol Education School-age children are eager to grow up and be independent. Peers and acceptance are very important at this time. School-age children may be exposed to messages that are in conflict with their parents' values regarding smoking and alcohol. Peers often exert pressure for children to experiment with tobacco and alcohol (see Healthy People 2020). HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov. School-age children are ready to absorb information that deals with drugs and alcohol. Information from parents or other adults who are major influences in the child's life is essential at this time to set clear rules and model behaviors for children to embrace. Discussions with children need to be based on facts and focused on the present. Some topics for discussion include: EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 6.1 BENEFITS OF BULLY-PREVENTION EDUCATION STUDY Child conduct problems continue to pose a problem in elementary schools. In addition to the behavioral disruption that occurs as a result of bullying and victimization, prior research has demonstrated that child bullies and victims are at increased risk for mental health problems and antisocial behavior. This study was performed over a 2-year period utilizing fourth-grade classrooms at 28 public elementary schools. The group-randomized trial assigned classrooms to receive a program aimed at bullying and aggression prevention or to receive no treatment at all. Self-reported bullying and victimization were then analyzed after the 2- year trial. Findings Upon analysis of the findings, the researchers reported a mild decrease in bullying and a greater decrease in bullyingvictimization. It appears that bullying-prevention programs in elementary schools may be effective in decreasing aggression and violence in the school-age group. Nursing Implications Nurses should continue to educate parents and teachers about bullying. Encourage children to be involved in peer groups. Become actively involved in the local elementary school bullying-prevention program. When bullies are identified, refer them for education in alternative means of emotional expression such as social skills training. Adapted from Jensen, J. M., & Dieterich, W. A. (2007). Effects of a skills-based prevention program on bullying and bully victimization among elementary school children. Prevention Science, 8, 285-296. What alcohol and drugs are like and how they harm you Differences in medical use versus illegal use of drugs How to think critically to interpret messages seen in advertising, media, sports, and entertainment personalities See Teaching Guidelines 6.2. Recall Lawrence Jones, the 10-year-old presented at the beginning of the chapter. List potential developmental problems he may experience. What anticipatory guidance related to these concerns should you provide to his mother? KEY CONCEPTS Physical growth is slow and steady, with social and cognitive development progressing rapidly, during the school-age years of 6 to 12. Height increases approximately 2.5 inches (6 to 7 centimeters) per year and weight gain is 3 to 3.5 kilograms (7 pounds) per year. Boys are taller and heavier than girls during this time period (Feigelman, 2007a). With entrance into the school system, school-age children have the influences of peers and teachers. With the development of gross motor skills and involvement in sports at school and in the community, safety education and practices are required. Also, with the participation in cooperative sports, injuries occur. Visual acuity is reaching maturation and 20/20 vision is expected by 7 years of age (Jarvis, 2008). Increased independence leads to increased exposure to safety hazards. The school-age child develops the cognitive ability to classify objects and to identify relationships among objects. Dental care is very important to prevent dental caries, malocclusion, and other problems. In early school age, the first primary teeth will be lost. The onset of puberty may occur by the later school-age years. Erikson's (1963) developmental task for the age group is the development of a sense of industry. Peers are very important, especially peers of the same sex. School-age children usually have a best friend and belong to clubs. They have collections of nonvaluable items such as rocks, clips, and so forth. School-age children are capable of concrete operations, solving problems, and making decisions. They continue to need guidance, rules, and direction from parents. The school-age child develops a conscience and knows cultural and social values. He or she can understand and obey rules. The school-age child incorporates religious practices into his or her life, which may be a source of comfort during stressful times. The nurse's role includes educating parents and school-age children in promoting health and safety. Nurses should inform the school-age child about expected developmental changes in the body to promote self-esteem and self- confidence. REFERENCES Alba-Fisch, M. (2007). Temperament: Miss or match.

Adolescence spans the years of transition from childhood to adulthood, which is usually between the ages of 11 and 20 years. There is some overlap between late school age and adolescence. The adolescent experiences drastic changes in the physical, cognitive, psychosocial, and psychosexual areas. With this rapid growth during adolescence, the development of secondary sexual characteristics, and interest in the opposite sex, the adolescent needs the support and guidance of parents and nurses to facilitate healthy lifestyles and to reduce risk-taking behaviors. GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT ^OVERVIEW Adolescence is a time of rapid growth with dramatic changes in body size and proportions. The magnitude of these changes is second only to the growth in infancy. During this time sexual characteristics develop and reproductive maturity is achieved. The age of onset and the duration of the physiologic changes vary from individual to individual. Generally girls enter puberty earlier (at 9 to 10 years of age) than boys (at 10 to 11 years). Adolescents will represent varying levels of identity formation and will offer unique challenges to the nurse ( Table 7.1 ). Physiologic Changes Associated with Puberty The secretion of estrogen in girls and testosterone in boys stimulates the development of breast tissue in girls, pubic hair in both sexes, and changes in male genitalia. These biological changes that occur during adolescence are known as puberty. Puberty is the result of triggers among the environment, the central nervous system, the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, the gonads, and the adrenal glands. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), produced by the hypothalamus, travels to the anterior pituitary gland to stimulate the production and secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). The increased levels FSH and LH stimulate the gonadal response. LH stimulates ovulation in girls and acts on testicular Leydig cells in boys, prompting maturation of the testicles and testosterone production. FSH with LH stimulates sperm production. Estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone and other androgens are released from the gonads and affect biological changes and changes in various organs, including alterations in muscles, bones, skin, and hair follicles. Adolescents experience physical development, hormonal changes, and sexual maturation during puberty that correlate to Freud's genital stage of psychosexual development. The genital stage begins with the production of sex hormones and maturation of the reproductive system. Girls reach physical maturity before boys and menarche , the first menstrual period, usually begins between the ages of 9 and 15 years (average 12.8 years). Breast budding (thelarche) occurs at approximately age 9 to 11 years and is followed by the growth of pubic hair. Take Note! African-American girls on average reach menarche slightly earlier than Caucasian girls (Hirsch, 2008). The first sign of pubertal changes in boys is testicular enlargement in response to testosterone secretion, usually occurring in Tanner stage 2. As testosterone levels increase, the penis and scrotum enlarge, hair distribution increases, and scrotal skin texture changes.During late puberty, boys will typically experience their first ejaculation, which may occur while they are sleeping (nocturnal emissions). Nurses should provide anticipatory guidance to adolescent males regarding involuntary nocturnal emissions (wet dreams) to assure them that this is a normal occurrence. Tanner stages 3 to 5 usually occur during adolescence. Refer to Figures 10.28 , 10.34 , and 10.36 for an illustration of the increase in breast tissue and pubic hair distribution in girls, and scrotal and penile changes as well as hair distribution changes in boys. The nurse should provide guidance to adolescents about the normalcy of the sexual feelings and evolving body changes that occur during puberty. Physical Growth Diet, exercise, and hereditary factors influence the height, weight, and body build of the adolescent. Over the past three decades, adolescents have become taller and heavier than their ancestors and the beginning of puberty is earlier. During the early adolescent period, there is an increase in the percentage of body fat and the head, neck, and hands reach adult proportions. The rapid growth during adolescence is secondary only to that of the infant years and is a direct result of the hormonal changes of puberty. Both girls and boys experience changes in appearance and size. Height in girls increases rapidly after menarche and usually ceases 2 to 2% years after menarche. Boys' growth spurt occurs later than girls' and usually begins between the ages of 10% and 16 years and ends sometime between the ages of 13% and 17% years. Peak height velocity (PHV) occurs at approximately 12 years of age in girls or at about 6 to 12 months after menarche. Boys reach PHV at about 14 years of age. Peak weight velocity (PWV) occurs about 6 months after menarche in girls and at about 14 years of age in boys. Muscle mass increases in boys and fat deposits increase in girls ( Fig. 7.1 ). During early adolescence growth is rapid, but it decreases in middle and late adolescence. Height for adolescent boys who are between the 50th and 95th percentile ranges from 52% inches (132 centimeters) to 69% inches (176.8 centimeters). Weight of boys in these percentiles ranges from 77% pounds (35.3 kilograms) to 211 pounds (95.76 kilograms). On average, boys will gain 10 to 30 centimeters (4 to 12 inches) in height and 7 to 30 kilograms (15 to 65 pounds) in weight. FIGURE 7.1 These adolescents reflect the differences in sizes and shapes seen in adolescents of the same age. Height for girls who are between the 50th and 95th percentile ranges from 57 inches (144.8 centimeters) to 68% inches (173.6 centimeters), with weight ranging from 60 pounds (27.24 kilograms) to 181 pounds (82.47 kilograms). On average, girls will gain 5 to 20 centimeters (2 to 8 inches) in height and 7 to 25 kilograms (15 to 55 pounds) in weight during adolescence. See Appendix A for growth charts for this age group. Refer to Chapter 10 , Box 10.1 , for instructions for calculating body mass index (BMI).Organ System Maturation Adolescence is a time of metabolic slowing and of increasing size of some organs. The basal metabolic rate (BMR) reaches the adult level during late adolescence. Neurologic System During adolescence there is continued brain growth, although the size of the brain does not increase significantly. Neurons do not increase in number, but growth of the myelin sheath enables faster neural processing. Respiratory System The adolescent years see an increase in diameter and length of the lungs. Respiratory rate decreases and reaches the adult rate of 15 to 20 breaths per minute. Respiratory volume and vital capacity increase. Volume and capacity are greater in boys than girls, which may be associated with increased chest and shoulder size in boys. The growth of the laryngeal cartilage, larynx, pharynx, vocal cords, and lungs produces the voice changes experienced in adolescence. These changes in the quality of the child's voice are often preceded with some voice instability where voice cracking is heard. Deepening of both male and female voices occurs but is more pronounced in boys. Cardiovascular System There is an increase in size and strength of the heart. Systolic blood pressure increases and heart rate decreases. Blood volume reaches higher levels in boys than girls, which may be due to boys' greater muscle mass. Gastrointestinal System The adolescent has a full set of permanent teeth with the exception of the last four molars (wisdom teeth), which may erupt between the ages of 17 and 20 years. The liver, spleen, kidneys, and digestive tract enlarge during the growth spurt in early adolescence, but do not change in function. These systems are mature in early school age. Musculoskeletal System The ossification of the skeletal system is incomplete until late adolescence in boys. Ossification is more advanced in girls and occurs at an earlier age. During the growth spurt, muscle mass and strength increase. At similar stages of development, muscle development is generally greater in boys. Estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone (sex steroids) and other androgens are released from the gonads and affect changes in the muscles and bones. Low estrogen levels tend to stimulate skeletal growth, while higher levels inhibit growth. During middle adolescence, shoulder, chest, and hip breadth increase. Integumentary System During adolescence the skin becomes thick and tough. Under the influence of androgens, the sebaceous glands become more active, particularly on the face, back, and genitals. Due to the increased levels of testosterone during Tanner stages 4 and 5 in both boys and girls, both sexes may have increased sebum production, which may lead to the development of acne and oily hair. The exocrine and apocrine sweat glands function at adult levels during adolescence. The exocrine glands are all over the body and they produce sweat that helps to eliminate body heat through evaporation. The apocrine glands are found in the axillae, genital, and anal areas and around the breasts. The apocrine sweat glands produce sweat in response to hair follicles. This sweat is produced continuously and is stored and released in response to emotional stimuli. Psychosocial Development According to Erikson, it is during adolescence that teenagers achieve a sense of identity (Erikson, 1963). As the adolescent is trying out many different roles in regard to his or her relationships with peers, family, community, and society, he or she is developing his or her own individual sense of self. If the adolescent is not successful in forming his or her own sense of self, he or she develops a sense of role confusion or diffusion. The adolescent culture becomes very important to the teenager. It is through his or her involvement with teenage groups that the adolescent finds support and help with developing his or her own identity. Erikson (1963) believed that during the task of developing his or her own sense of identity, the adolescent revisits each of the previous stages of development. The sense of trust is encountered as the adolescent strives to find out whom and what ideals he orshe can have faith in. In revisiting the stage of autonomy, the adolescent is seeking out ways to express his or her individuality in an effective manner. The adolescent would avoid behaviors that would \"shame\" or ridicule him or her in front of his or her peers. The sense of initiative is revisited as the adolescent develops his or her vision for what he or she might become. And the sense of industry is again encountered as the adolescent makes his or her choice to participate in different activities at school, in the community, at church, and in the workforce. The ability of the adolescent to successfully form a sense of self is dependent upon how well the adolescent successfully completed the former stages of development. Erikson (1963) believed that if the adolescent has been successful, he or she can develop resources during adolescence to overcome any gaps in previous developmental stages. If the adolescent believes that he or she cannot express himself or herself in any manner due to societal restrictions, he or she will develop role confusion. See Table 7.2 for additional information. Cognitive Development According to Piaget, the adolescent progresses from a concrete framework of thinking to an abstract one (Piaget, 1969). It is the formal operational period. During this period, the adolescent develops the ability to think outside of the present; that is, he or she can incorporate into thinking concepts that do exist as well as concepts that might exist. The adolescent's thinking becomes logical, organized, and consistent. He or she is able to think about a problem from all points of view, ranking the possible solutions while solving the problem. Not all adolescents achieve formal operational reasoning at the same time. In the early stages of formal operational reasoning, the adolescent's thinking is egocentric. The adolescent is very idealistic, constantly challenging the way things are and wondering why things cannot change. These activities lead to the adolescent's feeling of being omnipotent. The adolescent must undergo this way of thinking, even though it can frustrate adults, in his or her quest to reach formal operational reasoning. As the teenager progresses toward middle adolescence, his or her thinking becomes very introspective. He or she assumes others are just as interested in what interests him or her, which leads him or her to feel unique, special, and exceptional. That feeling of \"being exceptional\" leads to the risk-taking behaviors of which teenagers are well known. Also, the teenager feels very committed to his or her viewpoints. He or she tries very hard to convince others of his or her viewpoints and embraces strongly those causes that support his or her opinions. This idealism can cause the adolescent to reject his or her family, culture, church, and community beliefs, which can cause conflict with his or her family, culture, church, and community. See Table 7.2 for additional information. Moral and Spiritual Development It is during the adolescent years that teenagers develop their own set of values and morals. According to Kohlberg, adolescents are experiencing the postconventional stage of moral development (Kohlberg, 1984). It is only because adolescents are developing their formal operational way of thinking that they can experience the postconventional stage of moral development. At the beginning of this stage, teenagers begin to question the status quo. The majority of their choices are based on emotions while they are questioning societal standards. As they progress to developing their own set of morals, adolescents realize that moral decisions are based on rights, values, and principles that are agreeable to a given society. They also realize that those rights, values, and principles can be in conflict with the laws of the given society, but they are able to reconcile the differences. Because adolescents undergo the process of developing their own set of morals at different rates, they might find that their friends view a situation differently. This difference can lead to conflicts and the forming of different friendships. See Table 7.2 for additional information. Adolescents also may begin to question their formal religious practices or in some cases cling to them (Ford, 2007). As they progress through adolescence, teenagers become more interested in the spiritualism of their religion than in the actual practices of their religion. Adolescents are searching for ideals and may exhibit intense emotions along with introspection (Ford, 2007). Increased spirituality and religious activities are related to increased healthy behaviors and decreased high-risk behaviors (Ford, 2007). Referring back to Cho Chung, identify the stage of psychosocial development that she should be in according to Erikson. What approaches for assessment and teaching would be most effective based on the stage you identified? Motor Skill Development During adolescence, the teenager refines and continues to develop his or her gross and fine motor skills. Because of this period of rapid growth spurts, teenagers may experience times of decreased coordination and have a diminished ability to perform previously learned skills, which can be worrisome for the teenager.Gross Motor Skills It is usually during early adolescence that teenagers begin to develop endurance. Their concentration has increased so they can follow complicated instructions. Coordination can be a problem because of the uneven growth spurts. During middle adolescence, speed and accuracy increase while coordination also improves. Teenagers become more competitive with each other ( Fig. 7.2 ). During late adolescence, the teenager usually narrows his or her areas of interest and concentrates on the needed relevant skills. FIGURE 7.2 Adolescents become involved in competitive sports, which draw upon their gross motor skills. Fine Motor Skills The use of computers has greatly increased the fine motor skills of teenagers ( Fig. 7.3 ). In the early adolescent years, the teenager increases his or her ability to manipulate objects. The adolescent's handwriting is neat and he or she increases his or her finger dexterity. The middle adolescent years see the teenager refining his or her dexterity skills. By late adolescence, the teenager has developed precise eye-hand coordination and finger dexterity. FIGURE 7.3 Using computers has increased the fine motor skills of adolescents. Communication and Language Development Language skills continue to develop and be refined during adolescence. Adolescents have improved communication skills, using correct grammar and parts of speech. Vocabulary and communication skills continue to develop during middle adolescence.However, the usage of colloquial speech (slang) increases, causing communication with people other than peers to be difficult at times. By late adolescence, language skills are comparable to those of adults. Emotional and Social Development Adolescents undergo a great deal of change in the areas of emotional and social development as they grow and mature into adults. Areas that are affected include the adolescent's relationship with parents; self-concept and body image; importance of peers; and sexuality and dating. Relationship With Parents Families and parents of adolescents experience changes and conflict that require adjustments and the understanding of adolescent development. The adolescent is striving for self-identity and increased independence. He or she spends more time with peers and less time with family and attending family functions. Parents sense that they have less influence on the adolescent as the teen questions family values and becomes more mobile. This may lead to a family crisis, and the parents may respond by setting stricter limits or asking questions about the teen's activities and friends. Other parents may drop all rules and assume that the adolescent can manage himself or herself. Both of these responses increase tension in the family. With the adolescent attempting to establish some level of independence\u2014and the family learning to let go while focusing on aging parents, their marriage, and other children\u2014a state of disequilibrium occurs. The family may experience more stress than at any other time. Some families have better outcomes with their adolescents than others. Families who listen to and continue to demonstrate affection for and acceptance of their adolescent have a more positive outcome. This does not mean that the family accepts all of the teen's ideas or actions, but they are willing to listen and attempt to negotiate some limits. For tips to improve communication with teenagers, see Box 7.1. Siblings experience changes in the relationship with the adolescent brother or sister; the older sibling may attempt to parent and the younger sibling may regress in an attempt to avoid the family conflict. Understanding the status of the adolescent-family relationship is essential for the nurse. BOX 7.1 WAYS TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATION WITH TEENS Set aside appropriate amount of time to discuss subject matter without interruptions. Talk face to face. Be aware of body language. Ask questions to see why he or she feels that way. Ask him or her to be patient as you tell your thoughts. Choose words carefully so he or she understands you. Tell him or her exactly what you mean. Give praise and approval to your teenager often. Speak to your teenage as an equal\u2014don't talk down to him or her. Be aware of your tone of voice and body language. Don't pretend you know all the answers. Admit that you do make mistakes. Set rules and limits fairly. Self-Concept and Body Image Self-concept and self-esteem are often tied to body image. Adolescents who perceive their body as being different than peers or as less than ideal may view themselves negatively. Adolescent girls often are influenced by peers and the media and want to weigh less and have smaller hips, waist, or thighs. Boys tend to view themselves as being too thin or not muscular enough. Sexual characteristics are important to the adolescent's self-concept and body image. Boys are concerned about the size of their penis and facial hair while girls are concerned about breast size and the onset of menstruation. Larger breasts are considered more feminine and menstruation is considered the right of passage into adulthood. All of these body changes are important to the adolescent's self-concept.Importance of Peers Peer groups play an essential role in the identity of the adolescent (Marcell, 2007). Adolescent peer relationships are very important in providing opportunities to learn about negotiating differences; for recreation, companionship, and someone to share problems with; for learning peer loyalty; and for creating stability during transitions or times of stress. Learning to work out differences with peers is a skill that is important throughout life. Peers serve as someone safe to discuss family issues with, as the teen emotionally moves away from the family while trying to find his or her identity. Due to changes that have taken place within family systems in society, peer groups play a significant role in the socialization of adolescents ( Fig. 7.4 ). FIGURE 7.4 Peers play an important role in shaping the adolescent's identity. Peers serve as credible sources of information, role model social behaviors, and act as sources of social reinforcement. Friends provide an opportunity for fun and excitement. Peers impact teens' appearance, dress, social behavior, and language. Peers also can have positive influences on each other, such as promoting college attendance, or negative influences, such as involvement with alcohol, drugs, or gangs. Early and middle adolescence are periods when teens are prone to join gangs. Peer role modeling and peer acceptance may lead to the formation of a gang that provides a collective identity and gives a sense of belonging. Peer pressure, companionship, and protection are the most frequent reasons given for joining gangs, particularly those associated with criminal activity. Parents must know their teen's friends and continue to be aware of potential problems while allowing the teen the independence to become his or her own person. Nurses must remind parents of the importance of peers and the impact they have on the teen's decisions and life choices. The transition to greater peer involvement requires guidance and support. Adolescents who do not have parental or adult supervision and opportunities for conversation with adults may be more susceptible to peer influences and at higher risk for poor peer selections. Sexuality and Dating Adolescence is a critical time in the development of sexuality. Sexuality includes the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to the adolescent's sexual identity. Adolescents usually begin experimentation with heterosexual and homosexual behaviors, although these behaviors may occur earlier in some cultures.FIGURE 7.5 Dating becomes an important aspect of the teenager's life. An interest in the opposite sex occurs during adolescence ( Fig. 7.5 ). Some of the reasons cited for this developing interest are physical development and body changes, peer-group pressure, and curiosity. During the past couple of decades, the percentage of 8th through 12th graders that have dated has declined. Twenty-seven percent of 12th graders have never dated, while 24% reported going on a date one or more times a week (Child Trends, 2008). Teen dating can range from group dating to single dating to serious relationships. Most early adolescents spend more time in activities with mixed-sex groups, such as dances and parties, than they do dating as a couple. Popular dating activities today include going out to dinner or the movies, \"hanging out\" at the mall, or visiting each other's home. During early adolescence, teens tend to date for fun and recreation. Also, they may see dating as a way to upgrade social standing by being seen with a popular boy or an attractive girl. Middle and late adolescents have group and single dates. Romantic relationships are central to the social life of this age group. Most teens have been involved in at least one romantic relationship by middle adolescence (O'Sullivan, Cheng, Harris, & Brooks- Gunn, 2007). Dating or spending time with a potential romantic partner is viewed as a major developmental marker for teens and is one of the most challenging adjustments. Teens that date frequently report slightly higher levels of self-esteem and increased autonomy and perceive themselves as more popular. However, they frequently have lower academic success and motivation, have higher depression rates, and experience a higher level of parental conflict. Trends in dating are changing, but dating remains a developmental milestone for the adolescent. Adolescents may experiment with homosexual behavior, though homosexual behavior as a teen does not necessarily indicate that the adolescent will maintain a homosexual orientation (Sass & Kaplan, 2011). Gay and lesbian adolescents face many challenges due to society's nonacceptance and peer insensitivity. Teens who self-declare as homosexual during high school are at increased risk for such problems as depression, suicide, victimization, school avoidance, risky sexual behaviors, and substance abuse (Friedman, 2008; Sass & Kaplan, 2011). Early romantic relationships play a critical role in the development capacity for long-term committed relationships in adulthood (Sorensen, 2007). Healthy romantic relationships in adolescence can assist the teen in developing a strong sense of self-identity and developing interpersonal skills, such as empathy. The emotional ups and downs that accompany dating can help develop emotional resilience and coping skills. Romantic relationships at this stage are a great source of emotional support. Risks of being involved in unhealthy romantic relationships include dating violence and risky sexual activity such as sexually transmitted infections (STIs) andpremature pregnancy. Adolescents do not automatically know what makes for a healthy relationship. They need to be educated on the right and wrong behaviors of dating and what behaviors make up a healthy relationship, such as open communication, honesty, and trust. They need to know the signs of an unhealthy relationship and how to seek help if needed. Cho Chung's mother states that she is concerned about the changes that have occurred in her and Cho's relationship over the past year. Cho seems much more self-centered, always wants to be with her friends, is very critical of her mother and father, and seems to be constantly in conflict with them. Based on what you know about this stage of development, what guidance, including approaches and techniques, can you discuss with Mrs. Chung to address her concerns? Cultural Influences on Growth and Development Although the adolescent's culture continues to influence him or her, the desire to be in harmony with peers becomes paramount. That desire can cause conflict with the adolescent's family and culture. Today's adolescents live in a rapidly changing, increasingly culturally diverse world. They are exposed to many different cultures and ethnic groups. In 2007, over 40% of children and adolescents in the United States were minorities (Federal Inter-agency Forum on Child and Family Statistics, 2008). Attitudes regarding adolescence vary among different cultures. Certain cultures may have more permissive attitudes toward issues facing adolescents, while others are more conservative (e.g., toward sexuality). Experiencing a rite-of-passage ceremony to signal the adolescent's movement to adult status varies among cultures. The American culture does not universally have a rite of passage for teenagers. Some religious and social groups do have ceremonies that signal a movement toward the maturity of adulthood (e.g., the Jewish bar or bat mitzvah, the Catholic confirmation, and social debuts). In many parts of the world, separate \"youth cultures\" have developed in an attempt to blend traditional and modern worlds for the adolescent. It is important for the nurse to recognize the ethnic background of each adolescent. Research has shown that certain ethnic groups are at higher risk for certain diseases. For example, adolescent African Americans are at higher risk for developing hypertension (American Heart Association, 2011). But the major barrier to the adolescent's health and successful achievement of the tasks of adolescence is socioeconomic status. Adolescents at a lower socioeconomic level are at higher risk for developing health care problems and risk-taking behaviors; this may be due to their inability to access health care and to obtain needed services (National Institute for Health Care Management [NIHCM], 2007). In caring for adolescents, recognize the influence of their culture, ethnicity, and socioeconomic level upon them.THE NURSE'S ROLE IN ADOLESCENT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT Growth and development in the adolescent is rapid. Nurses must be aware of the usual growth and development patterns for this age group so that they can assess the adolescent appropriately and provide guidance to the adolescent and his or her family. During adolescence, the teenager faces many challenges. His or her fluctuating relationships with parents and other adult figures may limit the teen from seeking assistance in dealing with the common issues of adolescence. In dealing with adolescents, be aware that they behave unpredictably, are inconsistent with their need for independence, have sensitive feelings, may interpret situations differently from what they are, think friends are extremely important, and have a strong desire to belong. During health care visits the adolescent or parent may have concerns that they are hesitant or uncomfortable talking about in front of each other. Try to provide an opportunity for them to have private time with a health care provider to discuss issues. The adolescent may greatly appreciate the opportunity for time to discuss concerns with a nonjudgmental informed adult. If the adolescent is hospitalized, growth and development may be altered. The adolescent is concerned about how the illness or injury will affect his or her body and body image. He or she fears pain and loss of privacy. The adolescent may experience anxiety about being separated from friends and loss of control. When caring for the hospitalized adolescent, the nurse must use knowledge of normal growth and development to recognize potential delays, promote continued appropriate growth and development, and interact successfully with the teen. Provide opportunities for them to maintain independence, participate in decisions, and encourage socialization with friends through phone, e- mail, and visits when possible. The following Nursing Process Overview will address promoting healthy growth and development and dealing with common developmental concerns. NURSING PROCESS OVERVIEW Upon completion of assessment of the adolescent's current growth and development status, problems or issues related to growth and development may be identified. The nurse may then identify one or more nursing diagnoses, including: Risk for disproportionate growth Imbalanced nutrition: more than body requirements Delayed growth and development Risk for caregiver role strain Risk for injury Ineffective coping Nursing care planning for the adolescent with growth and development issues should be individualized based on the adolescent's and family's needs. Nursing Care Plan 7.1 can be used as a guide in planning nursing care for the adolescent with a growth and development concern. The nurse may choose the appropriate nursing diagnoses from this plan and individualize them as needed. The nursing care plan is intended to serve as a guide, not to be an all-inclusive growth and development care plan. Promoting Healthy Growth and Development It takes multiple groups who address multiple issues to promote healthy growth and development in the adolescent. Some of these groups include sports teams in the school or the community, peers, teachers, band and choir members, and so forth. Also, the family's support and love will influence growth and development. NURSING CARE PLAN 7.1 Growth and Development of the Adolescent NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for disproportionate growth (risk factors: caregiver and adolescent knowledge deficit, low self-esteem, frequent illnesses) Outcome Identification and Evaluation Adolescent will demonstrate adequate growth: appropriate weight gain and increase in height for age and sex Intervention: Promoting Appropriate Physical Growth Assess parents' and adolescent's knowledge of nutritional needs of adolescents to determine need for further education. Educate parents and adolescent about appropriate serving sizes and foods so that they are aware of what to expect for adolescents. Determine need for additional caloric intake if necessary (if very active in sports, if have a chronic illness). Plot out height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) to detect possible pattern. Assess for risk factors for developing eating disorder to refer to if needed and plan interventions.NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Ineffective health maintenance related to lack of exercise, increased caloric intake, poor food choices, and stresses of adolescence Outcome Identification and Evaluation Adolescent will engage in health maintenance behaviors and lose weight at an appropriate rate: increase amount of exercise, make appropriate eating choices, decrease caloric intake to appropriate amount for age and sex Intervention: Promoting Appropriate Health Maintenance Behaviors Assess knowledge of parents and adolescent about nutritional needs of teenagers to determine deficits in knowledge. Have adolescent keep a detailed food and exercise diary for 1 week to determine current patterns of eating and exercise. Interview family in relationship to their eating habits and exercise habits to determine where adjustments might need to be made. Discuss changes in a positive manner\u2014talk about developing healthy eating habits instead of dieting to promote compliance. Analyze preceding data, and base recommendations for changes on these data to promote compliance and to prioritize recommendations. Discuss ways to decrease temptation to overeat, for example, eat slowly, put down the fork between bites, serve food on smaller plates, and count mouthfuls, to allow time to realize that you are full. Have adolescent create meal plans and grocery shop to allow him or her some sense of control and decision making. Incorporate increase in daily exercise, which will stress sense of self-improvement to increase caloric expenditure and self-esteem. Decrease TV/computer time to increase caloric expenditure. Encourage peer exercise activities to increase peer interactions and to help teen to realize that others are like him or her. Develop reward system to increase self-esteem. Investigate joining weight loss program for adolescents to increase self-esteem and encourage weight loss. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Growth and development, delayed, related to speech, motor, psychosocial, or cognitive concerns as evidenced by delay in meeting expected school performances Outcome Identification and Evaluation Development will be maximized: Adolescent will make attainment of expected school performance. Interventions: Promoting Growth and Development Perform scheduled evaluation of the adolescent by school and health care provider to determine current functioning. Develop realistic multidisciplinary plan to ensure maximizing resources. continued progress toward Carry out interventions as prescribed by developmental specialist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, or speech therapist at home and at school to maximize benefit of interventions. Have scheduled evaluation meetings to be able to adapt interventions as soon as possible. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Caregiver role strain, risk for (risk factors: knowledge deficit about adolescent issues, lack of prior exposure, fatigue, ill or developmentally delayed child) Outcome Identification and Evaluation Parent will experience competence in role: will demonstrate appropriate caretaking behaviors and verbalize comfort in caring for an adolescent Interventions: Preventing Caregiver Role Strain Assess parents' knowledge of adolescents and the issues that arise as a part of normal development to determine parents' needs. Provide education on normal issues of adolescence so that parents are armed with the knowledge they need to appropriately care for their adolescents. Provide anticipatory guidance related to upcoming expected issues related to adolescent development to prepare parents for what to expect next and how to intervene in an appropriate manner. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Injury, risk for (risk factors: increased motor and cognitive skills and feeling of invincibility) Outcome Identification and Evaluation Adolescent's safety will be maintained: will remain free from injury Interventions: Preventing Injury Discuss safety measures needed for the following: bikes, scooters, guns, skateboards, cars, and water to decrease risk of injury related to those areas. Discuss and develop a fire safety plan to decrease risk of injury related to fire. Discuss appropriate safety equipment needed for each sport to decrease risk of injury. Discuss appropriate sports to participate in depending on age, sex, and maturity of adolescent to prevent possible injury. Teach parents and adolescent first-aid measures and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to minimize consequences of injury should it occur. Discuss influence of peers upon actions of adolescents to prevent possible injury due to mimicking behavior. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Coping, ineffective (risk factors: low self-esteem, poor relationship with parents and peers, participating in risk-taking behaviors) Outcome Identification and Evaluation Adolescent will demonstrate adequate coping abilities as evidenced by management of stress of adolescence and no evidence of participating in risk-taking behaviors. Interventions: Promoting Effective Coping Assess adolescent's knowledge of normal stress facing teenagers to determine current knowledge. Assess adolescent's present coping skills to determine areas for improvement/support. Encourage parents to accept teenager as a unique individual to improve self-esteem. Discuss with parents and adolescent normal developmental issues facing teens to give them knowledge needed to cope. Provide different situations the teen might be faced with and encourage teen to develop different solutions. Allow for increasing independence and opportunities to solve own problems to improve coping skills. Encourage parents to provide unconditional love to improve self-esteem. Assess for any evidence of any risk-taking behaviors (drugs, smoking, suicide) to identify need for early interventions. Promoting Growth and Development Through Sports and Physical Fitness Many adolescents are involved in team sports that provide avenues for exercise. High levels of physical activity may reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors and provide disease prevention against cancer, obesity, osteoporosis, and depression (Kelly, 2010). Also, physical activity may contribute to higher academic performance and achievement (National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Adolescent and School Health, 2010). Adolescents probably spend more time and energy participating in sports than any other age group. Participation in sports contributes to the adolescent's development, educational process, and better health. Sports and games provide an opportunity to interact with peers while enjoying socially accepted stimulation and conflict. Competition in sports activities helps the teenager in processing self-appraisal and in developing self-respect and concern for others. Every sport has some potential for injury. Rapidly growing bones, muscles, joints, and tendons are more vulnerable to unusual strains and fractures (see Evidence-Based Practice 7.1 ). The American Academy of Pediatrics (2007) encourages participation in regular physical activity by young persons and encourages parents and coaches to be aware of early warning signs of fatigue, dehydration, and injury. See Chapter 23 for a discussion of sports injuries. In relation to youth sports, the role of the nurse is to educate to prevent injuries ( Fig. 7.6 ). This education should include discouraging participation when the teen is tired or has an existing injury. Additionally, adolescence is a good time to develop an exercise program. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2008) recommends that adolescents participate in 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity each day. Nurses should encourage all adolescents to be physically active daily. FIGURE 7.6 Stretching before exercise is an important part of exercise. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 7.1 INTERVENTIONS DIRECTED TOWARD PREVENTION OF ANKLE LIGAMENT INJURY OR SPRAIN STUDY Adolescents are increasingly involved in organized sports that put them at risk for injury. Soccer and basketball, in particular, result in a very high incidence of ankle injuries, and ankle sprains are very commonly treated in acute care. Inversion of theplantar-flexed foot is the most common mechanism of ankle injury resulting in damage to the lateral ligament complex. The authors analyzed 14 randomized or quasi-randomized trials that included data for a total of 8,279 participants. The intervention evaluated included use of modified footwear (high-top athletic shoes), external ankle supports, coordination training, and health education. The study evaluated the occurrence as well as the recurrence of ankle sprains. Findings Ankle coordination and strength training may be beneficial in the prevention of ankle sprains, but the results from the included studies were not powerful. However, the review provided sufficient evidence that the use of semirigid orthoses reduces the risk of ankle sprain in the young athlete and adult. Use of these devices was shown to be particularly helpful in preventing reinjury of the ankle. Nursing Implications Nurses should recommend the use of semirigid ankle orthoses to adolescent athletes participating in sports such as soccer and basketball. Although physical conditioning of the ankle was not decisively proved to decrease the risk of ankle injury, it was not proved to be harmful, so it should still be encouraged in student athletes. Exercises designed to improve coordination and proprioception should be included. At a minimum, adolescent athletes participating in high-risk sports should wear high-top athletic shoes in order to provide some protection against the occurrence of ankle injury. Adapted from Handoll, H. H. G., Rowe, B. H., Quinn, K. M., & de Bie, R. (2007). Interventions for preventing ankle ligament injuries. The Cochrane Library 2007, 4. Promoting Learning School, teachers, family, and peers influence education and learning for the adolescent. Also, activities such as athletics and club membership enhance learning through interactions with peers, coaches, club leaders, and others. School School plays an essential part in preparing adolescents for the future. Completing school prepares the adolescent for college or employment to make an adequate income. Schools in the United States may not meet the developmental needs of all adolescents. Minority students may not be at the appropriate grade level and the dropout rate may be higher than in nonminority students. Dropout rates have declined since the 1970s but still remain a concern. Dropout rates are highest among Hispanic students (Child Trends Data Bank, 2008). Those who drop out of school may lack skills needed to function in today's society. They are more likely to be unemployed and have lower income levels and occupational status than those with a high school diploma (Child Trends Data Bank, 2008) (see Healthy People 2020). Another influencing factor is a lack of parental involvement. Due to single-parent families and both parents being in the workforce, parents have less time to devote to involvement in their child's school activities. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov. There is evidence that the transition from elementary school to middle school at age 12 or 13, and then the transition to high school, both of which occur at the time of physical changes, may have a negative effect on teens. It is important to observe for transition problems into middle or high school, which may be exhibited by failing grades or behavior problems. Also, students who experience difficulties in school, resulting in negative evaluations and failing grades, may feel alienated from school. Students with failing grades and those repeating grades exhibit more emotional behavior such as violence and are more likely to engage in riskybehaviors such as tobacco and alcohol use (National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Adolescent and School Health, 2010). Schools that support peer-group relationships, promote health and fitness, encourage parental involvement, and strengthen community relationships have better student outcomes. Parents, teachers, and health care providers should provide guidance and support. FIGURE 7.7 Wearing appropriate safety equipment can prevent injuries. Other Activities Adolescents are involved in many other activities that influence learning. Some of these activities include (1) school activities such as band, choir, or clubs requiring high achievement; (2) athletic activities in the school and community and sometimes in the state or region; (3) art, sewing, and building classes; and (4) work activities when the late adolescent has a part-time job. These activities all contribute to the growth, development, and education of the adolescent. Promoting Safety Unintentional injuries are the leading causes of death in adolescents (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, 2008). Injuries kill more adolescents than all diseases combined with 46% of injury related deaths due to motor vehicle accidents (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, 2008). Unintentional injury accounts for about 48%, violence for 15.2%, and homicide and suicide for 11.8% of adolescent injury deaths (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, 2008). Males are more likely than females to die of any type of injury (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2008d). Influencing factors related to the prevalence of adolescent injuries include increased physical growth, insufficient psychomotor coordination for the task, abundance of energy, impulsivity, peer pressure, and inexperience. Impulsivity, inexperience, and peer pressure may place the teen in a vulnerable situation between knowing what is right and wanting to impress peers. On the other hand,teens have a feeling of invulnerability, which may contribute to negative outcomes. Alcohol and other drugs are contributing factors in automobile and firearm accidents among adolescents. Most of the serious or fatal injuries in adolescents are preventable ( Fig. 7.7 ). Nurses must educate parents and adolescents on car, gun, and water safety to prevent unintentional injuries. See Teaching Guidelines 7.1 for information on promoting safety. Teaching Guidelines 7.1 PROMOTING SAFETY Safety Issue Activity Motor vehicle Wear seat belt at all times. Do not drive with someone who is impaired. Take driver-education course. Establish driving rules between parent and adolescent prior to getting license. Have all passengers wear seat belts. Do not use cell phone while driving, drink and drive, or drive when tired. Maintain car in good condition. Drive with adult supervision for period of time after receiving license. Bike: General Have a well-maintained and appropriate-size bike for adolescent. Adolescent should demonstrate his or her ability to ride bike safely before being allowed to ride on street. Safe areas for bike riding should be established as well as routes to and from area of activities. Should not ride bike barefoot, with someone else on bike, or with clothing that might get entangled in the bike. Should wear sturdy, well-fitting shoes and American National Standards Institute (ANSI)-approved helmets. Bike should be inspected often to ensure it is in proper working order. A basket should be used to carry heavy objects. Bike: In traffic All traffic signs and signals must be observed. If adolescent is riding at night, the bike should have lights and reflectors and the rider should wear light- colored clothes. Should ride on the side of the road traveling with traffic and keep close to the side of the road in single file. Should watch and listen for cars and never hitch a ride on any vehicle. Should not wear headphones while riding a bike. All-terrain vehicles Should not be operated by adolescent younger than 16 years of age. Helmet and protective coverings required. No nighttime riding. Not for use on public roads or if teen has been drinking or using drugs. Do not stand up in the vehicle or ride in a person's lap. Skateboards/skates Wear helmet, and protective pad- ding on knees, elbows, and wrists. Do not skate in traffic or on streets or highways. Skating on homemade ramps could be dangerous\u2014assess ramps for any hazards before skating. Water safety Learn how to swim; if swimming skill is limited, must wear life pre- server at all times. Never swim alone\u2014should, if at all possible, swim only where there is a life guard. Learn basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Do not run or fool around at edge of pool. Drains in pool should be covered with appropriate cover. Wear life jacket when on boat. Make sure there is enough water to support diving. Do not swim if drinking alcohol or using drugs. Firearms If guns are in household, should take firearm safety class, secure guns in safe place, use gun safety locks, and store bullets in separate place. Never point a gun at a person. Fire safety All homes should have working smoke detectors and fire extinguishers. Change the batteries at least twice a year. Have fire-escape plan and practice the plan routinely. No smoking in bed. Teach what to do in case of a fire\u2014use fire extinguisher, call 911, how to put out clothing fire. All flammable materials and liquids should be stored safely. Fireplaces should have protective gratings. Avoid touching any downed power lines. Machinery Machinery Use safety devices. Receive training on how to use equipment. Do not use when alone. Sports Sports Match sport to adolescent's ability and desire. Sports program should have warm-up procedure and hydration policy. Undergo sports physical before start of activity. Coaches should be trained in CPR and first aid. Wear appropriate protection devices for individual sport. Sun Sun Use sunscreen with both ultravio- let A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) protection. Apply sunscreen prior to going out and reapply sunscreen often. Limit sun exposure, especially between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Wear hat and sunglasses while outside. Personal Personal safety Never go with a stranger. safety Do not enter a car when the driver has been drinking. Notify adult where you are when out after dark. Keep cell phone fully charged. Never give out personal information over the Internet. Say \"no\" to drugs, alcohol, or smoking, or to being touched when you do not want to be touched. Toxins Toxins Teach the hazards of accepting illegal drugs, alcohol, dangerous drugs. Store potential dangerous material in safe place. Adapted from Hagan, J. F., Shaw, J. S., & Duncan, P. (2008).

Motor Vehicle Safety The largest numbers of adolescent injuries are due to motor vehicle crashes. When the adolescent passes his or her driving test, he or she is able to drive legally. However, driving is complex and requires judgments that the teen is often incapable of making. Also, the typical adolescent is opposed to authority and is interested in showing peers and others his or her independence. Teenagers are the least likely age group to wear a seat belt, with males less likely than females and African American and Hispanic teens less likely than Caucasian teens (CDC, 2007). Crashes involving adolescents are more likely to involve speeding or driving to fast for conditions (National Highway Traffic Safety Association [NHTSA], 2008). More accidents occur when passengers, mostly other teenagers, are present in the car, during driving at night or driving under the influence of alcohol (NHTSA, 2008). It is essential to promote driver education, to teach about the importance of wearing seat belts, and to explain laws about teen driving and curfews ( Fig. 7.8 ). See Teaching Guidelines 7.1 for additional information. Take Note! Many states have enacted a Graduated Driving License (GDL) program, which allows teens to gain driving experience and limits risky circumstances (such as nighttime driving and driving with passengers) by providing a license in three stages (learners permit, provisional license, and full license) (NHTSA, 2008). Studies have shown this program to be highly effective in reducing teen driver crashes (NHTSA, 2008). Firearm Safety The risk of dying from a firearm injury among 15- to 19-year-olds has been rising. In 2005, 84% of homicides and 46% of suicides in children and adolescents were caused by a firearm (CDC, 2008a). Provide education about gun safety. Guns in the home must be kept and locked in a safe location, with ammunition kept separately. Parents must teach adolescents about the dangers of playing withfirearms. See Teaching Guidelines 7.1 for additional information on gun safety. Water Safety Drowning is a needless cause of death in adolescents. Many drownings are a result of risk-taking behaviors. With the independence of the adolescent, many times adult supervision is not prevalent and the teen takes a dare that results in drowning. Provide water safety education and proper supervision to decrease the incidence of risk taking. Teach about swimming lessons for nonswimmers. See Teaching Guidelines 7.1 for additional information. Remember Cho Chung, the 15-year-old presented at the beginning of the chapter? What anticipatory guidance related to safety should you provide to Cho and her mother? Promoting Nutrition Nutritional needs are increased during adolescence due to accelerated growth and sexual maturation. Adolescents may appear to be hungry constantly and need regular meals and snacks with adequate nutrients to meet the body's anaerobic requirements. Multiple factors influence the adolescent's diet and eating habits ( Box 7.2 ). According to CDC data, in 12- to 19-year-olds, the obesity rate has more than tripled (CDC, 2008c). Poor diet and physical inactivity have led to the mounting problem of obesity in this age group. Obesity in adolescence is associated with obesity in adulthood along with numerous adverse health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, and overall poorer health (CDC, 2008c). BOX 7.2 FACTORS INFLUENCING THE ADOLESCENT'S DIET Peer pressure Busy schedules Concern about weight control Convenience of fast food BOX 7.3 FOODS HIGH IN IRON Beef, chicken, fish Liver Peanut butter Nuts and seeds Green peas, lima beans Spinach Strawberries Tomato juice Whole-grain bread Raisins Watermelon Nutritional Needs Teenagers have a need for increased calories, zinc, calcium, and iron for growth. However, the number of calories needed for adolescence depends on the teen's age and activity level as well as growth patterns. Teenage girls who are moderately active require about 2,000 calories per day (U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010). Teenage boys who are moderately active require between 2,400 and 2,800 calories per day (U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010). Of these calories, 45% to 65% should come from carbohydrates, 10% to 30%from protein, and 25% to 35% from fat (U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010). Adolescents require about 1,300 milligrams of calcium each day (Krebs, Primark, & Haemer, 2011). Adolescents should be made aware of foods high in calcium, including milk, white beans, broccoli, cheese, and yogurt. Adolescent males require 11 milligrams of iron each day and females require 15 milligrams each day (Krebs et al., 2011). Advise adolescents about foods high in iron ( Box 7.3 ; see Healthy People 2020). Protein requirements for adolescent girls, 14 to 18 years of age, are 46 grams per day, and for adolescent boys, 14 to 18 years of age, 52 grams per day (U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010). Some foods high in protein are meats, fish, poultry, beans, and dairy products. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov. Promoting Healthy Eating Habits The nurse must understand normal growth and development of the adolescent in order to provide guidance that fits the quest for independence and the need for teens to make their own choices. Assess the eating habits and diet preferences of the adolescent. The assessment should include an evaluation of foods from the different food groups that the adolescent eats each day. Also, assess the number of times that fast foods, snacks, and other junk food are eaten per week. This assessment will help the nurse to guide the adolescent in making better food choices at home and in fast-food establishments. Many fast-food restaurants offer baked chicken sandwiches and salads with fewer calories and less fat. Adolescents may be guided in alternating hamburgers and fries with more nutritious choices. Remember that planning should always include the adolescent. The U.S. Department of Agriculture provides a personalized food pyramid called MyPyramid Plan based on an individual's age, sex, weight, height, and amount of physical activity. Refer to Figure 7.9 for an example. At http://www.mypyramid.gov , the adolescent can create his or her customized food pyramid plan. Table 7.3 outlines daily serving recommendations based on caloric requirements (lower, moderate, or higher). Nurses may use the information in Table 7.3 to help teens plan a healthy diet for themselves. Active teenage girls should eat the number of servings recommended in the \"Moderate\" column of Table 7.3 . Active teenage boys should eat the number of servings recommended in the \"Higher\" column. Adolescents who are overweight and dieting should base their daily intake on the serving recommendations in the \"Lower\" column. Preventing the Development of Overweight and Obesity Over the past 20 years, the number of overweight adolescents has more than tripled from 5% to 17.6% (CDC, 2008c). Although obesity has increased in all segments of the US population, there are differences specific to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. The prevalence of obesity is highest in Hispanic and African American teens between the ages of 12 and 19 years (Ogden & Carroll, 2010). This increase in obesity in adolescents has led to increases in hypertension, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes. Influential factors causing obesity include food choices, eating practices, and lack of exercise. One study indicated that only 75% to 78% of adolescents ages 11 to 19 years eat breakfast (National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, 2006). Also, fewer than 40% of adolescents ages 12 to 19 years meet the daily dietary requirement of vegetables and fruits while exceeding the recommendation for saturated fats (National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, 2006). Adolescents are busy and eat on the run, with many meals from fast- food facilities. In addition, many schools have decreased or discontinued physical education, which has resulted in a more sedentary lifestyle, leading to weight gain. Interest in computer games and television watching at home has decreased physical activity and exercise and further contributed to weight gain and obesity (see Healthy People 2020).FIGURE 7.9 MyPyramid Plan for a 15-year-old boy, 140 pounds, 5 feet 4 inches, 30 to 60 minutes of exercise daily. Retrieved March 21, 2011, from http://mypyramid.gov/downloads/results/results_2800_under18.pdf ) HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Nurses must make parents and adolescents aware of factors leading to obesity. Nurses should recommend: Proper nutrition and healthy food choices Good eating habits Decreased fast-food intake Exercising for 30 minutes at least four times per week Parents/adolescents exercising more at home Decreased computer use and television watching What questions should you ask Cho Chung and her mother related to nutritional intake? What anticipatory guidance related to nutrition would be appropriate? Promoting Healthy Sleep and Rest The average number of hours of sleep that teens require per night is 8.5 to 9.5 (Gavin, 2011). The adolescent often experiences a change in sleep patterns that leads to feeling more awake at night and the desire to sleep later in the morning (Gavin, 2011). Also, in this independence-seeking phase of adolescence, the teen may stay up later to do homework or to complete projects and may have difficulty awakening in the morning. Due to early school schedules and activities the teen will often try to make up for needed sleep by sleeping longer hours on the weekend. Rapid growth and increased activities may produce fatigue and the need for more rest. Parents may relate that the teen sleeps all the time and never has the time or energy to help with household chores. Explain to parents the need to discourage late hours on school nights because they may affect school performance. Encourage the teen to go to bed at the same time at night and awaken at the same time in the morning, even on weekends (Gavin, 2011). Provide advice to teens and parents about having realistic expectations; encourage them to agree on a level of normalcy and adequate rest for the teen so that he or she can still fulfill responsibilities in the home. Provide anticipatory guidance to Cho Chung and her mother in relation to sleep during the adolescent years. Promoting Healthy Teeth and Gums Most permanent teeth have erupted with the possible exception of the third molars (wisdom teeth). These molars may become impacted and require surgical removal. The rate of cavities decreases but the need for routine dental visits every 6 months and brushing two to three times per day is very important. Some of the conditions that occur during adolescence include malocclusion, gingivitis, and tooth avulsion. Malocclusion occurs in approximately 45% of adolescents, resulting from facial and mandibular bone growth (Tinanoff, 2007). It is the most common reason for referral to an orthodontist. The treatment includes braces and other dental devices. Teach the adolescent to brush the teeth more frequently if he or she has braces or other dental devices. Gingivitis is inflammation of the gums and breakdown of gingival epithelium due to diet and hormonal changes. The use of dental devices/braces makes cleaning more difficult and contributes to gingivitis. Tooth avulsion (knocked-out teeth) may occur during sports and other activities such as falls. The avulsed tooth should be reimplanted as soon as possible. The nurse may see the teen first so it is importantthat nurses know the proper procedure, which is to reinsert the tooth into its socket if possible or to store it in cool milk or normal saline for transport to the dentist. Promoting Personal Care Promotion of personal care during adolescence is an important topic to cover with the adolescent and his or her parents. Topics to discuss include general hygiene tips, caring for body piercings and tattoos, preventing suntanning, and promoting a healthy sexual identity. General Hygiene Tips Adolescents find that frequent baths and deodorant use are important due to apocrine sweat gland secretory activity. Also, to decrease oily skin due to sexual steroids and hormones, teach the adolescent to wash his or her face two to three times per day with plain unscented soap. Vigorous scrubbing should be discouraged because it could irritate the skin and lead to follicular rupture. The hair should be shampooed daily to remove excess oil from the hair and scalp. Many over-the-counter medications are available for beginning acne or acne with a few lesions. These preparations may cause drying or redness. Discourage adolescents from squeezing acne lesions to prevent further irritation and permanent scarring. If the adolescent has severe acne, encourage him or her to ask a parent to make an appointment with a dermatologist. Caring for Body Piercings and Tattoos It is not uncommon for a teen to experiment with body piercing on areas such as the tongue, lip, eyebrow, navel, and nipple ( Fig. 7.10 ). Other sites such as the genitals, chin cleft, knuckles, and even the uvula have been used. Generally, body piercing is harmless, but nurses should caution teens about performing these procedures under nonsterile conditions and should educate them about complications. Qualified personnel using sterile needles should perform the procedure. Teach the adolescent to cleanse the pierced area twice a day and more often at some sites. The complications of body piercing vary by site. Infections from body piercing usually result from unclean tools of the trade. Some of the infections that may occur as a result of unclean tools include hepatitis, tetanus, tuberculosis, and HIV. Also, keloid formation and allergies to metal may occur. The navel is an area prone to infection because it is a moist area that endures friction from clothing. After a navel infection occurs, it may take up to a year to heal. Pierced ear cartilage also heals slowly and is prone to infection. Tongue piercings heal very quickly, usually within 4 weeks, probably due to the antiseptic effects of saliva. Other concerns with tongue piercing include tooth damage from biting on the jewelry or partial paralysis if the jewelry pierces a nerve. Tattoos are continuing to grow in popularity among adolescents (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2009). Tattoos serve to define one's identity and are a form of self-expression (see Fig. 7.10 ). Because of the invasiveness of the tattooing procedure, it should be considered a health-risk situation. Like piercings, tattoos are open wounds predisposing to infection. FIGURE 7.10 Having multiple piercings and tattoos can lead to certain health risks.Nurses should educate adolescents about the risk of bloodborne infections, such as hepatitis B and C, HIV, skin infections, scarring, and allergic reactions to dyes used in the tattoo process (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2009). They need to encourage the teen to go to a licensed facility and to double check that needles are new and sterilized (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2010). Teach teens to cleanse tattoos with an antibacterial soap and water several times a day and to keep the area moist with an ointment to prevent scab formation. Refer to Box 7.4 for additional information about tattoos. Preventing Suntanning Suntanning is popular among adolescents and is influenced by the media, which promotes a link between tan skin and beauty. There is no such thing as a good tan (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2011). Most exposure to ultraviolet rays occurs during childhood and adolescence, thereby putting people at risk for the development of skin cancer. However, it is difficult to convince adolescents that tanning is harmful to their skin and puts them at risk for skin cancer later in life (see Healthy People 2020). BOX 7.4 WHAT ADOLESCENTS NEED TO KNOW ABOUT TATTOOING Infections occur as a result of nonsterile equipment used in the procedure. Tattoos are open wounds predisposing to infection; sites require proper care with antibacterial soap and water several times per day and application of ointment. For most people a tattoo is permanent; new procedures for removal are painful and expensive. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Educate teens about the benefits and effects of different sun protection products. Explain to them that sun damage and skin cancers can be prevented if sunscreens are used as directed on a regular basis. Encourage sunscreen or sunblock use for water sports, beach activities, and participation in outdoor sports. Also, make adolescents aware of allergies to some sunscreen products. See Teaching Guidelines 7.1 for additional information. Promoting a Healthy Sexual IdentityEncourage parents and teens to have discussions about sexuality. In addition, nurses should ensure that adolescents have the knowledge, skills, and opportunities that enable them to make responsible decisions regarding sexual behaviors and sexual orientation. Education for the adolescent should include a discussion about media influences and the use of sexuality to promote products. This discussion should make the adolescent aware of the motives of the media and the need to be an individual and not be influenced by television, magazines, and other forms of advertisement. Encourage parents to be aware of who their adolescents are dating and where they go on their dates. Refer to Teaching Guidelines 7.2 for information on counseling related to adolescent sexuality. Teaching Guidelines 7.2 ADOLESCENT SEXUALITY It should be your choice to engage in sexual relations. Do not be influenced by peers. When you say \"no,\" be firm and clear about your position. Pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV infection can occur with any sexual encounter without the use of barrier methods of contraception. Use appropriate contraception if sexually active. Discuss abstinence as a contraceptive method. Sexual activity in a mature relationship should be pleasurable to both parties. If your sexual partner is not interested in your pleasure, you need to reconsider the relationship. Promoting Appropriate Discipline Adolescents naturally misbehave or do not follow the rules of the house, and parents must determine how to respond. Adolescents need to know the rules and expectations. After rules are established, parents must explain to the adolescent the consequences of breaking the rules. Offer guidance to parents related to disciplining teens. The parent and the teen should collaborate on what the consequences will be if the rules are broken. Parents must acknowledge and offer reinforcement and support when the teen follows the rules. Consistency and predictability are the cornerstones of discipline, and praise is the most powerful reinforcer of learning. Addressing Common Developmental Concerns Adolescence is a time of rapid growth and development with maturation of sexuality. The adolescent period begins with a child and ends with the expectation of adulthood. There are many developmental concerns that present during this period, including violence, suicide, homicide, and substance use. The following is an overview of some of these concerns. Violence The CDC's Injury Center defines violence as threatened or actual physical force or power initiated by an individual that results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in physical or psychological injury or death (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2010b). More than 656,000 adolescents and young adults between 10 and 24 years of age were injured and treated in an emergency department as a result of violence in 2008 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2010a). The issue of youth violence is a growing concern in America's communities. The health and well-being of adolescents and society are threatened by this violence. See Box 7.5 for factors contributing to adolescent violence. Health care providers need to provide education on the effects and ways to prevent youth violence along with supporting programs developed to curb youth violence. BOX 7.5 FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO ADOLESCENT VIOLENCE Crowded conditions/housing Low socioeconomic status Limited parental supervision Single-parent families/both parents in workforce Access to guns or cars Drug or alcohol use Low self-esteem Racism Peer or gang pressure Aggression Adapted from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2011). Youth Violence: Risk and Protective Factors. Risk Factors for the Perpetration of Youth Violence. Retrieved from http://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/youthviolence/riskprotectivefactors.html . Homicide Homicide is the second leading cause of death in children between 10 and 24 years old, with the majority of victims being male and killed by firearms (CDC, 2010a). It is the leading cause of death in African Americans 10 to 24 years old (CDC, 2010a). Refer to Box 7.5 for factors that contribute to violence among adolescents. In a nationwide survey conducted in 2009, 17.5% of youth reported carrying a weapon (gun, club, or knife) on one or more days within the past 30 days (CDC, 2010a) (see Healthy People 2020). HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . BOX 7.6 RISK FACTORS FOR SUICIDE IN ADOLESCENTS Depression or other mental illness Mental health changes History of previous suicide attempt Family history of suicide Poor school performance Family disorganization Substance abuse Homosexuality Giving away valued possessions Being a loner/having no close friends Changes in behavior Incarceration Suicide Suicide is the third leading cause of death in adolescents 15 to 19 years old (CDC, 2008b). In a nationwide CDC study, 15% of adolescents surveyed reported that they had seriously considered suicide within the past 12 months, with 11% creating a plan and 7% attempting to take their own life (CDC, 2008b). Certain factors can put youth at risk for suicide, but having these risk factors does not mean suicide will occur. Refer to Box 7.6 for risk factors for suicide in adolescents (see Healthy People 2020). Most people are not comfortable discussing the topic of suicide and therefore do not communicate openly about it. It is important that health careproviders address this important health problem and work to prevent suicide. The National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) is working to create awareness of suicide as a serious public health problem and is developing strategies to reduce injuries and deaths due to suicide. Dating Violence Violent behavior that takes place in a context of dating or courtship is not a rare event. It is estimated that more than one third of teens are victims of dating violence (Betz, 2007). Females are victims of dating violence more often than males and suffer more injuries than males. Dating violence in the teen years is a risk factor for continued violence exposure in adulthood. Risk factors for dating violence include living in a broken home or rural area, inadequate parental supervision, condoning violence, substance use, prior victimization, dropping out of high school, and risky sexual practices (Mars & Valdez, 2007). Nurses need to assess for and provide interventions to those teens experiencing dating violence or those at risk for being a victim or perpetrator. Gangs Much of youth violence is a result of the behavior of adolescent gangs. Nationwide there are an estimated 27,000 gangs with 788,000 members, with more males joining gangs than females (Egley, Jr., & O'Donnell, 2009). The risk factors for gang involvement relate to the adolescent, family, school, community, and peers See Box 7.7 for risk factors for adolescent gang involvement. Gang membership occurs in cities and in suburban areas, but may differ in composition. All socioeconomic groups are represented in gang membership. Gang membership may aid in the formation of identity by providing status and a sense of belonging. However, adolescents who are gang members are more likely to commit serious and violent crimes. Nursing Interventions to Decrease Youth Violence Nurses working with adolescents should include violence prevention in anticipatory guidance. Violence is a learned behavior. It is often reinforced by the media, television, music, and personal example. Explain to parents, teachers, and peers the importance of being good role models. Parents should monitor video games, music, television, and other media to decrease exposure to violence. Parents need to know who their adolescent's friends are and monitor for negative behaviors and actions. Pediatric nurses play a key role in identifying at-risk youth and developing, planning, implementing, and evaluating interventions to prevent youth violence. Substance Use Agents commonly abused by children and adolescents include alcohol, prescribed medications such as Ritalin and OxyContin, hallucinogens, sedatives, analgesics, anxiolytics, steroids, inhalants (inhaling fumes of common household products), stimulants, opiates, and various club drugs such as ecstasy, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). The substance abused is related to its availability and cost. Two common substances that are more accessible and have the highest incidence of use are tobacco and alcohol. A national survey found that 80% of high school students and 44% of middle school students have personally witnessed on school grounds illegal drugs used or sold, or students high on drugs or drunk (National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, 2007). Drug use progresses from beer or wine to cigarettes or hard liquor and then to marijuana, followed by illicit drugs. Some of the long-term effects and consequences of drug and alcohol use include possibility of overdose and death, unintentional injuries, irrational behaviors, inability to think clearly, unsafe driving and legal consequences, problems with relationships with family and friends, sexual activity and STIs, and health problems such as liver problems (hepatitis) and cardiac problems (sudden death with cocaine). Refer to Table 7.4 for commonly abused drugs and behaviors exhibited (see Healthy People 2020). BOX 7.7 RISK FACTORS FOR GANG INVOLVEMENT Individual Few social ties Delinquency involvement Drug dealing Physical violence or aggression Mental health problems, including depression Authority conflicts, rebellion, conduct problems Illegal gun ownership Precocious sexual activity Alcohol and drug use Increased life stressors, such as failing at school, fights with friends, or death of someone close Family Poor family relationship Antisocial parents Broken home Poverty/low socioeconomic status Family with criminal history, drug or alcohol problems Young mother Poor parental supervision or involvement Low parental education Child maltreatment School Academic failure Low academic motivation Truancy and dropping out of school Frequent school transitions Negative labeling by teachers (as disturbed, disruptive) Community Poverty Poor housing conditions High availability and use of drugs in neighborhood Exposure to violence and racial prejudice High crime area Availability of guns Peer Antisocial peers Association with delinquent, aggressive peers Peer drug use Peer gang membership Adapted from Howell, J.C.

Retrieved August 25, 2011 from https://www.nqYs.gov/pdfTiles1/ojjdp/231116.pdf HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Take Note! African Americans have lower rates of most licit and illicit drug use than Caucasians (Johnston, O'Malley, Bachman, & Schulenberg, 2011) Tobacco Tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of death in the United States, causing more than 440,000 deaths each year (CDC, 2011b). Long-term consequences of youth smoking are reinforced by the fact that most young people who smoke regularly continue to smoke throughout adulthood. Each day in the United States, approximately 3,900 children less than 8-year-olds try their first cigarette, with 950 becoming regular smokers; 90% of adult smokers started smoking before age 19 (American Cancer Society, 2008; American Lung Association, 2010). Half of these smokers will die from the effects of smoking (American Lung Association, 2010). An estimated 6.4 million people will die prematurely because of smoking as adolescents (American Lung Association, 2010). Although the overall rate of smoking has declined since 1999, rates over the past several years have remained stable but still are high, with 19% of high school students reporting current cigarette use (CDC, 2010c). Approximately 8% of high school students use smokeless tobacco (American Lung Association, 2010). Teens who smoke are 3 times more likely than non-smokers to use alcohol, 8 times more likely to use marijuana, and 22 times more likely to use cocaine (Focus Adolescent Services, 2008b). Smoking is associated with other risky behaviors, including fighting and engaging in unprotected sex. The short-term health effects of smoking include damage to the respiratory system, addiction to nicotine, and the associated risk of other drug use. Smoking negatively impacts physical fitness and lung growth and increases the potential for addiction in adolescents. Smokeless tobacco may also cause many problems. It can lead to bleeding gums and sores in the mouth that never heal. Smokeless tobacco use leads to discoloration of the teeth and eventually may lead to cancer. Alcohol In the United States alcohol is one of the most abused drugs, though many do not consider it a drug at all. It is estimated that 80% of adolescents have tried alcohol by the time they reach adulthood (Dowshen, 2009). A national survey on drug use found that nearly three quarters of students have consumed alcohol by the end of high school, with 36% consuming alcohol by the end of 8th grade (Johnston et al., 2011). More than half of 12th graders and 16% of 8th graders reported having been drunk at least once (Johnston et al., 2011). The findings revealed that there were no substantial differences among various sociodemographic subgroups with respect to drinking rates, although alcohol use is lowest in African Americans and highest in Caucasians. The incidence of alcohol use increases throughout adolescence. Adolescents who begin drinking before the age of 15 are five times more likely to develop alcohol dependence than those who begin drinking at the age of 21 (Focus Adolescent Services, 2008a). Alcohol use in adolescence can lead to prevailing alcohol use in adulthood and contribute to physical health problems. It may also precede other drug abuse.Illicit Drugs Adolescents may also experiment with or abuse illicit drugs. Substance abuse remains a widespread problem among American adolescents. Although experimentation with marijuana has decreased between 1991 and 2003 among the adolescent population, it still remains the most widely used illicit drug (Martin & Milot, 2007). A national survey on drug use showed the prevalence rate for 12th graders for marijuana use to be OxyContin 5.1%, and steroids 1.5% (Johnston et al., 2011). Factors that primarily affect drug use include the psychoactive potential and benefits reported, how risky the drug is to use, how acceptable it is to peer groups, and the accessibility and availability of the drug. The more risky or less accepted a drug is by peers, the less likely the adolescent will use it. Nursing Interventions to Decrease Substance Use Among Teens Substance use in adolescence is related to poorer health outcomes; therefore, it is important that nurses are aware of interventions to decrease these behaviors. Based on reviews of programs and interventions, it has been found that certain methods work. Programs that reach children and adolescents through a variety of sources such as school, family, community, and media campaigns are more successful. Programs that address all forms of drug use (alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs) tend to work well. Programs that focus on increasing awareness of the risks and health consequences of substance use are important. Initial research suggests that peer teaching with adult facilitation is successful (Bandy & Moore, 2008). Programs that focus on antidrug attitudes and drug resistance along with enhancing self-esteem, social support, and stress-specific coping skills are beneficial. Topics that should be discussed include: Short- and long-term effects of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs on health Risk factors and implications for unintentional injuries and sexual activity Short- and long-term effects of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs on relationships and school performance and progression The how and why of chemical dependency Impact of substance abuse on society Importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle Importance of resisting peer pressure to use drugs and alcohol Importance of having confidence in one's own judgmentThink back to Cho, who was introduced at the beginning of the chapter. List common developmental concerns of the adolescent. What anticipatory guidance related to these concerns would you provide? KEY CONCEPTS Adolescence is a period of rapid and variable growth in the areas of physical, psychosocial, cognitive, and moral development. The adolescent is developing his or her own identity, becoming an abstract thinker, and developing his or her own set of morals and values. Inability to successfully develop an individual identity leads to poor preparation for the challenges of adulthood. Relationships with parents fluctuate widely during adolescence. The teenager eventually becomes emancipated from his or her parents. Peers become most important\u2014guiding mainly the early and middle adolescent in his or her decisions, while the late adolescent can usually formulate his or her own decisions. Adolescence is a critical time in the development of sexuality. Sexuality includes the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors surrounding the adolescent's sexual identity. The egocentric and invincible thought processes of the adolescent can lead to injuries. Health care providers must emphasis safety regarding cars, bikes, water, firearms, and fire. Motor vehicle accidents are the number one cause of death in adolescents (CDC, 2010d). Nutritional habits of the adolescent lead to deficiency in vitamins and minerals needed for the rapid growth during this period. Obesity in adolescents is a growing health concern. Health care providers are facing increased numbers of adolescents with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Substance abuse and experimentation is common during adolescence; it is associated with other risk-taking behaviors such as injuries and sexual activity. Health care providers must work collaboratively with the adolescent in the development of interventions to promote health. REFERENCES Advocates for Youth. (2007).

KEY TERMS atraumatic care child life specialist family-centered care health literacy nonverbal communication therapeutic hugging verbal communication Learning Objectives Upon completion of the chapter, you will be able to: 1. Describe the major principles and concepts of atraumatic care. 2. Incorporate atraumatic care to prevent and minimize physical stress for children and families. 3. Discuss the major components and concepts of family-centered care. 4. Utilize excellent therapeutic communication skills when interacting with children and their families. 5. Use culturally competent communication when working with children and their families. 6. Describe the process of health teaching as it relates to children and their families. Emma Moore, 4 years old, is admitted to the pediatric unit with a suspected head injury from a fall. She was playing at a playground with her babysitter and fell from the top of the slide. Atraumatic care is defined as therapeutic care that minimizes or eliminates the psychological and physical distress experienced by children and their families in the health care system (Hockenberry & Wilson, 2009; Wong, n.d.). This concept is based on the underlying premise of \"do no harm.\" Box 8.1 highlights the major principles of atraumatic care. Pediatric nurses must be vigilant for any situation that may cause distress and must be able to identify potential stressors. It is important to provide nursing care that decreases the child's exposure to stressful situations and prevents or minimizes pain and bodily injury; take steps to minimize separation of the child from the family; and utilize techniques of communication and provide teaching that promotes a sense of control. Atraumatic care involves guiding children and their families through the health care experience using afamily-centered approach by promoting family roles, fostering family support of the child, and providing appropriate information. Help children cope with this experience by using age-appropriate and child-specific interventions. Preparation can help children and their families to adjust to illness and hospitalization. Use appropriate techniques for therapeutic communication (goal-directed, focused, purposeful communication), therapeutic play (type of play that provides an emotional outlet or improves the child's ability to cope with the stress of illness and hospitalization), and education to help the child and family understand the reason for the hospitalization and the necessary tests and procedures. In addition, help the family and other health care personnel to obtain the resources and relationships they need for optimal care. BOX 8.1 PRINCIPLES OF ATRAUMATIC CARE Prevent or minimize physical stressors, including pain, discomfort, immobility, sleep deprivation, inability to eat or drink, and changes in elimination. Avoid or reduce intrusive and painful procedures, such as injections, multiple punctures, and urethral catheterization. Avoid or reduce other kinds of physical distress, such as noise, smells, shivering, nausea and vomiting, sleeplessness, restraints, and skin trauma. Control pain via frequent assessments and use of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. Prevent or minimize parent-child separation. Promote family-centered care, treating the family as the patient. Use core primary nursing. Consider research findings related to preferences of parents and children and whether or not to be together. Promote a sense of control. Elicit the family's knowledge about the child and his or her health condition, promoting partnerships, empowerment, and enabling. Reduce fear of the unknown through education, familiar articles, and decreasing the threat of the environment. Provide opportunities for control, such as participating in care, attempting to normalize daily schedule, and providing direct suggestions. Adapted from Wong, D. L. (n.d.). Innovative approaches for atraumatic cancer care. Retrieved May 3, 2009, from http://www.authorstream.com/presentation/Carolina-48857-op077-INNOVATIVE-APPROACHES-ATRAUMATIC-CANCER-CARE-DEFINITION- SOURCES-PATIENT-FAMILY-STRESSORS-as-Entertainment-ppt-powerpoint/ The best pediatric nursing care encompasses the concepts of atraumatic care. Minimizing physical stressors during procedures, providing family-centered care, and utilizing excellent communication skills on the part of the nurse enhance the health care experience for the child and family. Having an informed and educated family is the best way to provide optimal health care for children. Table 8.1 gives suggestions for incorporating the principles of atraumatic care into nursing care for the child and family. Look for tips on atraumatic care as it relates to specific topics throughout the text.PREVENTING/MINIMIZING PHYSICAL STRESSORS The health care facility or hospital is an unfamiliar environment for children and parents and may upset or intimidate them. They may feel anxiety, fear, helplessness, anger, or loss of control. Even health care procedures performed in the home or school may be perceived as threatening to children. To prevent and minimize the physical stress experienced by children and their families in relation to health care, pediatric nurses, child life specialists, and other health care professionals recommend the use of atraumatic care. Utilizing the Child Life Specialist The child life specialist (CLS) is a specially trained individual who provides programs that prepare children for hospitalization, surgery, and other procedures that could be painful (Child Life Council, 2010a). The CLS is a member of the multidisciplinary team and works in conjunction with the health care provider and parents to foster an atmosphere that promotes the child's well-being. Services provided by a CLS include: Nonmedical preparation for tests, surgeries, and other medical procedures Support during medical procedures Therapeutic play Activities to support normal growth and development Sibling support Advocacy for the child and family Grief and bereavement support Emergency room interventions for children and families Hospital preadmission tours and information programs Outpatient consultation with families (Child Life Council, 2010b) The goal of the CLS is to decrease the child's anxiety and fear while improving and encouraging the child's understanding and cooperation. The CLS considers the needs of siblings or other children who may be affected by the child's illness or trauma. The CLS provides engaging and uplifting events by coordinating special entertainment and activities. The CLS is an excellent resource and provides education to health care providers and families. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends child life services because they are \"an essential component of quality pediatric health care and are integral to family-centered care and best practice models of health care delivery for children\" (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2006, p. 1760). Minimizing Physical Stress During Procedures Children undergo numerous diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in a wide range of settings during their development. These procedures may be performed in the community or outpatient setting or in a care facility. Regardless of the procedure to beperformed and the setting, children, like adults, need thorough preparation before the procedure and support during and after the procedure, to promote the best outcome and to ensure atraumatic care. Using positions that are comforting to the child during painful procedures is an important aspect of atraumatic care ( Fig. 8.1 ). Therapeutic hugging (a holding position that promotes close physical contact between the child and a parent or caregiver) may be used for certain procedures or treatments where the child must remain still. For example, the parent can hold the child in his or her lap snugly to prevent the child from moving during an injection or venipuncture. When using this technique, make sure the parent understands his or her role and knows which body parts to hold still in a safe manner. Alternatively, distraction or stimulation (such as with a toy) can help to gain the child's cooperation. Refer to Box 8.2 for distraction methods. Before the Procedure Appropriate preparation for procedures helps to decrease the child's and family's anxiety level, promote the child's cooperation, support the child's and family's coping skills, improve recovery, and increase trust between the child, his or her family, and the physicians (LeRoy et al., 2003). Adequate preparation also helps to foster the child's feeling of mastery over a potentially stressful event (e.g., undergoing invasive procedures in particular is extremely distressing for children) (LeRoy et al., 2003). FIGURE 8.1 Positioning a child for comfort during a painful procedure. A. Sitting on the parent's lap while undergoing allergy testing provides this toddler with a sense of comfort. B. Position the infant cuddled over the parent's (preferable) or the nurse's shoulder when obtaining a heelstick. C. Use \"therapeutic hugging\" to maintain a child's position when the child is receiving an intramuscular injection. D. Use \"therapeutic hugging\" to position a child while the child is having an IV line inserted. BOX 8.2 DISTRACTION METHODS Have the child point toes inward and wiggle them. Ask the child to squeeze your hand. Encourage the child to count aloud. Sing a song and have the child sing along. Point out the pictures on the ceiling. Have the child blow bubbles. Play music appealing to the child. Preparation may include preparing the child psychologically (including explanation and education) as well as physically. It is very important to employ the concepts of atraumatic care when preparing children for a procedure. General guidelines for preparation include the following: Provide a description of and the reason for the procedure using age-appropriate language (\"the doctor will look at your blood to see why you are sick\"). Describe where the procedure will occur (\"the x-ray department has big machines that won't hurt you; it's a little cold there too\"). Introduce strange equipment the child may see (\"you will lie on a special bed that moves in the big machine, but you can still see out\"). Describe how long the procedure will last (\"you will be in the x-ray department until lunchtime\"). Identify unusual sensations that may occur during the procedure (\"you may smell something different\" [e.g., alcohol smell]; \"the MRI machine makes loud noises\"). Inform the child if any pain is involved. Tell the child it is okay to cry or yell. Identify any special care required after the procedure (\"you will need to lie quietly for 15 minutes afterward\"). Discuss ways that may help the child stay calm, such as using distraction methods or relaxation techniques (\"during the procedure you may want to count from 1 to 100 or sing your favorite song\") (Justus et al., 2006). Take Note! In the hospital, perform all invasive procedures in the treatment room or a room other than the child's room. The child's room should remain a safe and secure area (Leahy et al., 2008). A major aspect of preparation involves play. In general, young children respond better to play materials and older children benefit more from viewing peer modeling films (LeRoy et al., 2003). However, consider the child's temperament, coping strategies, and previous experiences as well as developmental needs and cognitive abilities. First, gain trust and provide support. Include the child's parents, because parents are usually the greatest source of comfort for the child. Be short, simple, and appropriate in explaining situations at the child's level of development. Explain what is to be done and what is expected of the child. Avoid terms that have double meanings or might be confusing. Table 8.2 lists alternative words or phrases to use for terms that may be confusing or misunderstood. During the Procedure Use a firm, positive, confident approach that provides the child with a sense of security. Encourage cooperation by involving the child in decision making and allowing the child to select from a list or group of appropriate choices. Allow the child to express feelings of anger, anxiety, fear, frustration, or any other emotions. Often this is how a child communicates and copes with the situation. Remind the child that it is okay to scream or cry, but that it is very important to hold still. Use distraction methods such as those listed in Box 8.2 . Toddlers and preschoolers often resist procedures despite preparation for them. Being held down or restrained is often more traumatizing to the young child than the procedure itself. Use alternative methods (positions that provide comfort for the child) to keep the child still during the procedure (refer back to Fig. 8.1 ). The older child can be held while using a book or story for distraction. After the Procedure After the procedure, hold and comfort the child. Cuddle and soothe infants. Encourage children to express their feelings through play, such as dramatic play or use of puppets. Gross motor activities such as pounding or throwing are also helpful for children to discharge pent-up feelings and energy. School-age children and adolescents may not outwardly demonstrate behavior indicating the need forcomforting; however, provide them with opportunities to express their feelings and be comforted. Remember to praise children for appropriate behavior during the procedure and after all interventions are completed. Take Note! Remember to utilize child life specialists when available. The physician's orders for Emma include starting intravenous (IV) fluids and obtaining blood work upon arrival to the unit. As the admitting nurse, how will you provide atraumatic care?PREVENTING OR MINIMIZING CHILD AND FAMILY SEPARATION: PROVIDING CHILD- AND FAMILY- CENTERED CARE Family-centered care involves a partnership between the child, family, and health care providers in planning, providing, and evaluating care (O'Malley, Brown, & Krug, 2008). It works well for children of any age and in all arenas of health care, from preventive care of the healthy child to long-term care of the chronically or terminally ill child. Family-centered care enhances parents' and care-givers' confidence in their own skills and also prepares children and young adults for assuming responsibility for their own health care needs. It is based on the concept that the family is the constant in the child's life and the primary source of strength and support for the child (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007a; Harrison, 2010). According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (2007a), family-centered care focuses on several core principles: Respect for the child and family Recognition of the effects of cultural, racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity on the family's health care experience Identification of and expansion of the family's strengths Support of the family's choices related to the child's health care Maintenance of flexibility Provision of honest, unbiased information in an affirming and useful approach Assistance with the emotional and other support the child and family require Collaboration with families Empowerment of families When children's health care is provided through a family-centered approach, many positive outcomes are possible, including: Anxiety is decreased. Children are calmer and pain management is enhanced. Recovery times are shortened. Families' confidence and problem-solving skills are improved. Communication between the health care team and the family is also improved, leading to greater satisfaction for both health careproviders and health care consumers (families). A decrease in health care costs is seen and health care resources are used more effectively (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007a). Ways to increase collaboration between the family and the health care team may include a family advisory board, a newsletter, conferences, or parent resource notebooks. Methods for increasing communication between the health care team and the family may include the use of mailboxes or dry-erase boards for updating the daily plan of care, including the parents' participation in rounds, or through a daily assessment of health status by the child or family. FIGURE 8.2 Providing a comfortable area for the parent to rest is an important component of family-centered care. Vigilant parents are committed to their child's care and most want to be present for all aspects of their child's care. They want to be part of the decision-making process regarding their child's care; they want to be heard and develop a rapport with the health care professionals caring for their child. They demonstrate resilience in their ability to make it through the emotional upheaval associated with an illness. It is important to be sensitive to the inconveniences that their child's illness may impose on the family. Address the family's emotional and spiritual needs, attend to their concerns, and provide the best accommodations possible (when the child is hospitalized) ( Fig. 8.2 ). Practicing true family-centered care may empower the family, strengthen family resources, and help the child and family feel more secure and supported throughout the process. Take Note! Some parents will not know how to advocate or speak up for their child; as a nurse, you must help open this door for them. How could family-centered care help the Moore family described at the beginning of the chapter?PROMOTING A SENSE OF CONTROL During times of illness, hospitalization, or health-related interventions, the child and family can experience an extreme sense of loss of control. Providing effective communication and teaching can help foster feelings of control and improve the child's and family's ability to cope. Assisting the family to obtain necessary information, resources, and relationships contributes to optimal health care for the child and family. Communication and teaching are skills that are used continuously in pediatric nursing, no matter what the setting or the child's state of health. Enhancing Communication Effective communication with children and their parents is critical to providing atraumatic quality nursing care. Child-and parent- centered communication enhances child outcomes and child and family satisfaction with nursing care. Effective communication is the foundation of the therapeutic relationship and leads to increased knowledge and health care behaviors on the part of the child and family (Levetown & The Committee on Bioethics, 2008). Nurses are in an ideal position to improve communication in the health care environment. They need to ensure inclusion of the child and family in health conversations and to clarify misconceptions following medical encounters. Children are often socialized to be passive participants in health care, doing as they are told, with or without protests. \"As pediatric nurses, we have an obligation to listen, to hear, and to feel the voices of the children in our care\" (McPherson & Thorne, 2000, p. 28 ). Children can inform nurses of their experiences in an accurate fashion, and nurses need to be able to discern this information from communication with the child. Communication patterns can vary greatly from one child to the next. Some children are very talkative, while others are quiet. Children may be more apt to communicate if they are engaged in another activity. Children often use fewer words than adults and may rely more on nonverbal communication and silence. Parents more often require neutral communication (i.e., verbal communication that is related to assessing and solving problems), whereas children more often desire affective communication (establishment of rapport and trust, giving comfort). The best communicators in pediatric nursing find a balance between neutral and affective communication (Shin & White-Traut, 2005). Communicating in the pediatric setting can be more difficult than in the adult setting. The pediatric nurse must communicate with different ages of children, as well as on a supportive level with adolescents and parents (Shin & White-Traut, 2005). Verbal Communication Communicating through the use of words, either written or spoken, is termed verbal communication. Nurses use verbal communication throughout the day when interacting with children. Good verbal communication skills are necessary when performing nursing assessments and providing child/family teaching. General guidelines for appropriate verbal communication include: Use open-ended questions that do not restrict the child's or parent's answers. Redirect the conversation to maintain focus. Use reflection to clarify the parent's feelings. Paraphrase the child's or parent's feelings to demonstrate empathy. Acknowledge emotions. Demonstrate active listening by using the child's or family's own words. Remember that most parents are laypersons, so avoid using medical jargon. The abbreviations and shortened terms that health care providers use almost without thinking may sound scary or foreign to children and parents. When medical terminology is necessary, provide a definition using developmentally appropriate language. Nonverbal Communication Nonverbal communication is also referred to as body language. It also includes attending to others and active listening. The nurse should listen to the other person's verbal communication from the beginning of the interaction. When children and parents feel they are being heard, trust and rapport are established. Guidelines for appropriate nonverbal communication include: Relax; maintain an open posture, with the arms uncrossed. Sit opposite the family and lean forward slightly. Maintain eye contact. Nod your head to demonstrate interest. Note the child's or parent's posture, eye contact, and facial expressions.Active listening is critical to the communication process. Listening may uncover fears or concerns that the nurse may not have discovered through questioning. Paying attention while children and parents talk is a powerful communication tool. By not listening, the nurse may miss critical information and the family may be reluctant to share further. When interacting with the child and family, determine whether the messages sent by the child's or parent's verbal and nonverbal communication are congruent. Developmental Techniques for Communicating With Children Effective communication with children involves a variety of age-appropriate methods. Encouraging children to participate actively gives them some control over the interaction (Shin & White-Traut, 2005). If the child is shy, talk to the parents first to give the child time to \"warm up\" to you. Use specific and clear phrases in an unhurried, quiet, yet confident manner. Communicate at the child's eye level ( Fig. 8.3 ). Spending time and incorporating play with younger children, even just a few moments, may help them feel more at ease with you. Instead of direct questioning, use dolls, puppets, or stuffed animals with younger children ( Fig. 8.4 ). The use of metaphors (e.g., referring to white blood cells as \"bad guy fighters\") and stories can help to illustrate concepts to young and school- age children. FIGURE 8.3 Sitting at the child's level and allowing the child time for self-expression are steps that improve therapeutic communication. Older children need privacy. Provide the child or adolescent with honest answers at a developmentally appropriate level. Allow children to express their thoughts and feelings. Offer the child choices when possible but only when they truly exist. Encourage children to write and draw about their experiences. This may increase their understanding and also draw attention to any misconceptions or fears. Box 8.3 lists requirements for communication with children and adolescents. Children feel empowered when health care professionals communicate directly with them. Include children in discussions and avoid talking about them in their presence. Children may also desire advice about their health care and reassurance about their health status. To be effective when communicating with children of different developmental stages, the nurse must become familiar with how children of different ages communicate and then use age-appropriate techniques for effective communication:FIGURE 8.4 Communication or teaching with dolls may be useful with younger children. BOX 8.3 BASICS FOR COMMUNICATING WITH CHILDREN Introduce yourself and explain your role. Position yourself at the child's level. Allow the child to remain near the parent if needed, so the child can remain comfortable and relaxed. Smile and make eye contact with the child if culturally appropriate. Direct your questions and explanations to the child. Listen attentively and pause to allow time for the child to formulate his or her thoughts. Use the child's or family's terms for body parts and medical care when possible. Speak in a calm, quiet, confident, and unhurried voice. Use positive rather than negative statements and directions. Encourage the child to express his or her feelings and ask questions. Observe for nonverbal cues. Ask for permission if you need to approach the child to avoid appearing threatening. Infants primarily communicate through touch, sight, and hearing. Communication with the infant can occur by cuddling, holding, rocking, and singing to the infant. Communication through play may be helpful in the older infant. Playful persuasion may help to distract the infant. When interacting with the infant, be alert for signs of overstimulation, such as yawning, turning away, decreased eye contact, and increasing irritability (Deering & Cody, 2002). When working with toddlers and preschoolers, allow them time to complete their thoughts. Though language acquisition at this age is exponential, it often takes longer for the young child to find the right words, particularly in response to a query. When possible, give this age group choices, ask specific questions, and respond to queries with simple answers. Participating in parallel play with toddlers or imaginative play with preschoolers or commenting on the child's toy or activity can open the door for communication with this age group (Deering & Cody, 2002). School-age children are very interested in learning and appreciate simple but honest and straightforward responses. When addressed first and allowed to respond, the school-age child may be eager to communicate. The school-age child may respond well to the use of a third-person conversation (such as \"some children feel anxious when entering the hospital\"). It is also important to understand how the child views a situation before explaining or discussing it with him or her (Deering & Cody, 2002). Adolescents tend to experience strong feelings and emotions and perceive situations in extreme terms. Building a trusting, respectful rapport is essential. When communicating with adolescents, remain nonjudgmental, listen attentively, and do not force them to talk in order to avoid alienating them and to keep lines of communication open (Deering & Cody, 2002).For communication tips related to the child's age, see Table 8.3 . Tips for Communicating With Parents When communicating with parents, be honest. Parents want to feel valued and should be equal partners in the health care team. Allow the parent to express concerns and ask questions. Explain equipment and procedures thoroughly. Help the parents to understand the long-term as well as short-term effects of the treatment. Teach the parents what the child will feel like and how he or she will look during a procedure. Teach and encourage the parent to perform as much of the child's care as is reasonable and permitted. Ask the parent about his or her perception of the child's progress. Allowing the parents to be involved in the care of their child gives them a sense of control and lets them know they are valued by the health care team. Provide parents with positive reinforcement, reassurance, guidance, and support. Communicating Across Cultures Understanding and respecting the child's culture helps foster good communication and improves child and family education about health care. Culture, religion, and spirituality are intertwined concepts that affect the child's and family's communication styles, health status, and health beliefs. It is important to be aware of the family's background, lifestyle, and health care practices to meet their information needs. Learning about the practices of various cultures is just the beginning; the nurse must assess each family's individual beliefs and practices rather than generalizing. The best way to assess the family's cultural practices is to ask and then listen. Determine the language spoken at home and observe the use of eye contact and other physical contact. Demonstrate a caring, nonjudgmental attitude and sensitivity to the child's and family's cultural diversity. WORKING WITH AN INTERPRETER Attempting to communicate with a family who does not speak English can be one of the most frustrating situations in which health care providers find themselves. In this situation, interpreters are an invaluable aid and an essential component of child and family education. Whether working with an interpreter in person or over the phone, it is important to coordinate efforts so that both the family and the interpreter understand the information to be communicated. Working as a team, the nurse questions or informs and the interpreter conveys the information to the child and family completely and accurately (see Healthy People 2020). Box 8.4 presents tips on working with an interpreter to maximize teaching efforts. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Several helpful resources and websites are listed on , including Language Line, which offers telephone interpreters who speak 150 languages, as well as The Center for Applied Linguistics, Northwest Translators and Interpreters Society, and others. COMMUNICATING WITH DEAF OR HEARING-IMPAIRED CHILDREN AND FAMILIES For hearing-impaired children and families, determine the method of communication they use (e.g., lip reading, American Sign Language [ASL], or another method or a combination). If the nurse is not proficient in ASL and the child or family uses it, then an ASL interpreter must be available if another adult family member is not present for translation. According to federal law (Americans With Disabilities Act), children and family members who are deaf or hard of hearing must be provided with the ability to communicate effectively with health care providers (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007b). BOX 8.4 TIPS ON WORKING WITH AN INTERPRETER Help the interpreter prepare and understand what needs to be done ahead of time. A few minutes of preparation may save a lot of time and help communication flow more smoothly in the long run. The interpreter is the \"communication bridge,\" not the \"content expert.\" The nurse's presence at teaching sessions is vital. The interpreter's timing may not match that of others involved. It often takes longer to say in some languages what has already been said in English; therefore, plan for more time than you normally would. Speak slowly and clearly. Avoid jargon. Use short sentences and be concise. Avoid interrupting the interpreter. Pause every few sentences so the interpreter can translate your information. After 30 seconds of speaking, stop and let the interpreter express the information. Talk directly to the family, not the interpreter. Give the family and the interpreter a break. Keep sessions short; sessions that last longer than 20 or 30 minutes are too long for anyone's attention span and concentration. Express the information in two or three different ways if needed. There may be cultural barriers as well as language and dialect differences that interfere with understanding. Interpreters may often know the correct communication protocols for the family. Use an interpreter to help ensure the family can read and understand translated written materials. The interpreter can also help answer questions and evaluate learning. Avoid side conversations during sessions. These can be uncomfortable for the family and jeopardize child/family-provider relationships and trust. Just because someone speaks another language doesn't mean that he or she will make a good interpreter. An interpreter who has no medical background may not understand or interpret correctly, no matter how good his or her language skills are. Children should not be used as interpreters. Doing so can affect family relationships, proper understanding, and compliance with health care issues. Adapted from Weech, W. A. (1999). Tips for using interpreters. Washington, D.C.: Foreign Service Institute of the U.S. Department of State.In the beginning of the chapter you were introduced to Emma Moore. Discuss ways to facilitate communication with Emma and her family/caregiver. Teaching Children and Families Regardless of the type of practice or health care setting, nurses are in a unique position to help families manage the health care needs of their child. Indeed, the family has a right and a responsibility to participate fully in making decisions about health care processes for their child. This is true whether the child is hospitalized with a long-term, devastating illness or needs only health maintenance activities. To accomplish this, families need to be knowledgeable about such things as their child's condition, the health care management plan, and when and how to contact health care providers. With the limited time available in all health care arenas and shortened stays in inpatient facilities, the pediatric nurse must focus on teaching goals and begin teaching at the earliest opportunity. Take Note! There is no prescription more valuable than knowledge.\u2014C. Everett Koop, MD, former Surgeon General of the United States (Dhand, 2000). Patient education occurs when nurses share information, knowledge, and skills with families, thus empowering them to take responsibility for their child's health care. Through patient education, families can overcome feelings of powerlessness and helplessness and gain the confidence and ability to step to the forefront of the health care team. Nurses spend innumerable hours teaching children and families; in fact, on some days in the hospital, more teaching than nursing care is provided. Given the importance of, and the amount of time spent on, child and family education, each nurse should become an expert at basic patient education principles. See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Coals of Child and Family Education The goals of child and family education are to: Improve the child's and family's health literacy Encourage communication with health care providers Improve health outcomes and promote healthy lifestyles Encourage involvement of the child and family in care and decision making about care Improve compliance with care and treatment plan Promote a sense of autonomy and control Overall goals for the child and family include the ability of children and families to make informed decisions, to perform basic health care skills, to recognize when the child has a problem and know how to respond to the problem, and to know how to get answers when questions arise. Take Note! To cope effectively with illness, to understand and participate in decisions about treatment plans, and to maintain and improve health after treatment, children andtheir families must have access to the specific knowledge and skills relevant to their conditions (the Joint Commission, 1996). Steps of Child and Family Education The steps of child and family education are similar to the steps of the nursing process. The nurse must assess, plan, implement, evaluate, and document education. Once the nurse reaches a level of comfort and experience with each of these steps, they all blend together into one harmonious whole that becomes an everyday part of nursing practice. Child and family education begins with the first encounter and proceeds through discharge and beyond. Reassessment after each step or change in the process is critical to success. ASSESSING TEACHING AND LEARNING NEEDS Excellent nursing care begins with a thorough assessment of the child. In the same way, child and family education begins with a learning needs assessment that includes the child's and family's learning needs, learning styles and preferences, and potential barriers to learning. Based on the results of the assessment, an individualized plan can be developed to reduce the time and effort required for teaching while maximizing learning for the child and family. Although actual nursing care in pediatrics is given to the child, the educational process is targeted at both the child, when developmentally appropriate, and the adult members of the family. Therefore, it is advisable to conduct a learning needs assessment on both the adult caregivers and the child, when appropriate. Box 8.5 describes the components of a learning needs assessment. This is also a good time to establish rapport with the family, demonstrating your interest in them and your confidence in their ability to learn. BOX 8.5 COMPONENTS OF LEARNING NEEDS ASSESSMENT Assess Learner characteristics: Find out more about the child's and family's life and how the child's illness has affected it. Learn more about the child's and family's social, cultural, and spiritual values. Learner needs and readiness: This includes what the child and family want and need to know and what they know already; their readiness and willingness to learn; their motivation to learn and emotional concerns; and their capacity to learn, such as physical or cognitive abilities including the ability to read and developmental level. Learning style: Determine how the child and family learn best, as well as preferred learning methods. Learning barriers: Identify cultural or language barriers, cognitive or physical disabilities, presence of pain, and lack of support network. Adapted from Joint Commission Resources. (2008). Patient education. In I. J. Chatman (Ed.), Issues in provision of care, treatment, and services for hospitals (2nf ed.). Oakbrook, IL: Joint Commission Resources, Inc. Share the assessment with all members of the interdisciplinary team so that the entire team can support the child's and family's learning. Although assessment generally takes place during the first or second meeting with the child and family, it should also occur with each encounter to check for any changes that may occur. Malcolm Knowles (1990) outlined basic principles to consider when teaching adults. He found that instruction for adults needs to focus more on the process than on the content. Box 8.6 lists four learner-centered principles. CULTURAL IMPACT ON ASSESSMENT OF LEARNING NEEDS. In addition to determining the language spoken in the home and use of eye and physical contact, investigate the following during the assessment: Who is the person caring for the child at home? Who is the authority figure in the family? What is the social support structure? Are there any special dietary needs and concerns? Are any traditional health practices used (e.g., healers, shamans, talismans, folk remedies and herbs)? Are any special clothes or other items used to help maintain health? What religious beliefs, ceremonies, and spiritual practices are important? Learning needs can then be negotiated with the family and met based on the assessment. Pediatric issues encountered when teaching immigrant or refugee families might include confusion regarding the use of the English versus the metric scale; preparing formulas and medicines using a \"handful\" or \"pinch\" of ingredients rather than specific measurements such as a measuring cup orsyringe; access to refrigeration for liquid antibiotics; and breastfeeding practices. BOX 8.6 SPECIFIC LEARNING PRINCIPLES RELATED TO PARENTS Adults are self-directed. Adults value independence and want to learn on their own terms. Teaching strategies that include such concepts as role playing, demonstration, and self-evaluation are most helpful. Using this model, nurses can partner with families to ensure that education is interactive and adopt the role of facilitator rather than lecturer. Adults are problem focused and task oriented. Adults learn best when they perceive there is a gap in their knowledge base and want information and skills to fill the gap. Providing a reason to learn can often motivate families that appear slow to comply with their child's care and education. Adults want an immediate need satisfied. Adults learn best at a time when learning meets an immediate need. Presenting information in an organized, sequential, and timely fashion can often help families understand the importance of learning a particular piece of information or task. Adults value past experiences and beliefs. Adults bring an accumulated wealth of experiences to each health care encounter; this provides a rich base for new learning. Education should take into account a wide range of backgrounds. Appreciating and using individual differences during teaching encounters can help improve compliance and reduce resistance to educational goals. Adapted from Knowles, M. (1990). The adult learner: A neglected species (4th ed.). Houston, TX: Gulf Publishing. LITERACY ISSUES. Adequate literacy skills are essential for child and family education, yet many people in America today have marginal reading capabilities. According to the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy, only 13% of American adults are proficiently literate, while 43% have basic or below basic literacy skills ( caliteracy.org , 2008; ProLiteracy, 2008). Even persons with adequate literacy skills may have difficulty reading, understanding, and applying information to health care situations ( Fig. 8.5 ). Health literacy is the ability to read, understand, and use health care information to make appropriate health care decisions (Glassman, 2008). It is not simply the ability to read the health care information, but also includes listening, oral, analytical, and decision-making skills, and applying these skills to health care situations. The inability to read and comprehend health care information is an enormous problem for many Americans today. Low health literacy affects people of all ages, races, and educational and income levels. The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy reports that 14% or 30 million adults have below basic health literacy and 22% or 47 million have basic health literacy (Weiss, 2007).FIGURE 8.5 Factors contributing to poor health literacy. The American Medical Association reports that poor health literacy skills are a stronger predictor of health status than age, income, employment status, education level, or racial or ethnic group (Glassman, 2008). Poor health literacy leads to poorer health status, worse health outcomes, and increased costs for the health care system (Weiss, 2007). Other health literacy studies have suggested that people with inadequate health literacy have higher rates of hospitalization and longer hospital stays, higher usage of expensive emergency services, increased medication errors, and generally a higher level of illness (Glassman, 2008; Weiss, 2007). Medical information is becoming increasingly complex, while the amount of time nurses have to spend with children is decreasing. Also, when unfamiliar information is introduced or when emotional distress is present, reading ability and understanding are further reduced. As a result, many studies have shown that persons with limited literacy skills cannot understand basic medical words and health concepts, verbal or written. For example, in one study (Weiss, 2007): Twenty-six percent did not understand when their next appointment was scheduled. Forty-two percent did not understand the instructions \"take medication on an empty stomach.\" Seventy-eight percent misunderstood warnings on medication labels. Eighty-six percent could not understand the rights and responsibilities section of a Medicaid application. RECOGNIZING POOR HEALTH LITERACY SKILLS. Poor health literacy skills are difficult to recognize: appearance, verbal ability, employment status, and educational level cannot reliably detect persons who do not read well. Also, many people who do not read well go to great lengths to hide their disability; 68% of persons with limited literacy skills have never told their spouse and 75% have never told their physician (Weiss, 2007). Poor health literacy affects all segments of the population, but certain groups such as the elderly, the poor, members of minority groups, recent immigrants to the United States who do not speak English, and those who are born in the United States but speak English as a second language are at higher risk (Weiss, 2007). Red flags that might indicate poor literacy skills include the following (Weiss, 2007): Difficulty filling out registration forms, questionnaires, and consent forms; forms are incomplete, incorrect, or inaccurate Frequently missed appointments Noncompliance and lack of follow-up with treatment regimens History of medication errors Responses such as, \"I forgot my glasses\" or \"I'll read this when I get home\" Inability to answer common questions about their treatment or medications Avoiding asking questions for fear of looking \"stupid\" PLANNING EDUCATION Once the assessment is completed, plan mutually agreed-upon, achievable learning goals and objectives. It is important that both the teacher and the learner believe the goals can be accomplished. Finding common ground and building a bridge between the child's and family's concerns and what the health care team believes they need to know is a critical part of an education plan. This also is an excellent time to consider which child education materials and resources can be used to maximize learning and retention. Planning child and family education should involve input from the entire interdisciplinary team when appropriate. Through good communication and collaboration, team members can work together to empower the child and family to become knowledgeable and skillful caregivers. Leaving behind the traditional path of teacher-centered education and providing family-centered education instead requires thought and skill. To achieve maximum success with education, nurses need to know how people learn. Edgar Dale (1969) suggested that people learn best when they are actively involved in the learning process. Figure 8.6 provides a summary of his principles, known as the \"Cone of Learning.\" The implications for child education are clear: the more senses used and the more actively involved the learner is, the better he or she will remember what was taught. PRACTICAL INTERVENTIONS TO ENHANCE LEARNING The assessed needs and planned learning objectives lead to good teaching interventions. Evaluate these interventions frequently to ensure that the child and family are learning and meeting agreed-upon goals. Table 8.4 presents six techniques that can help improve learning. FIGURE 8.6 Cone of Learning. (Adapted from Dale, E. [1969]. Audio-visual methods in teaching [3rd ed.]. Austin, TX: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston.)HELPING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WITH POOR HEALTH LITERACY SKILLS. Nurses are in an excellent position to create a \"blame-free\" environment and offer help. It is entirely appropriate to say to the child or family member, \"Many people have a problem reading and remembering the information on this teaching sheet (booklet, manual). Is this ever a problem for you?\" For children or family members with low health literacy, the nurse can adjust oral communication techniques and written materials to assist with learning, and should communicate this need to the entire interdisciplinary health care team. If literacy problems are known or suspected, the nurse can take several steps to enhance learning, such as: Draw pictures or use medical illustrations. Use videos. Color-code medications or the steps of a procedure. Record an audiotape. Repeat verbal information often and \"chunk\" it into small bites. Teach a \"back-up\" family member. TEACHING CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS. Teaching children and adolescents is a vital part of pediatric nursing practice. Children and adolescents have a great need for information about their illness as they attempt to master their anxiety and restore feelings of competency, self-confidence, and hope. As with adults, they learn best when their input is valued and they are actively involved in the learning process. The age and developmental level of the child will determine the amount, format, and timing of the information given. Before beginning to teach a child, it is important to establish rapport and lay the foundation for good communication. Refer to Developmental Techniques for Communicating With Children above and Table 8.3 for additional information related to communicating well with children and adolescents. Teaching Preschool Children. When teaching young children, the nurse or family assumes part or all of the responsibility for what is learned, how it is learned, and when it is learned. Because they have vivid imaginations, young children often attempt to invent pieces of information, or they pick up bits and pieces of misinformation that can lead to false assumptions. Skillfully delivered and timed information can promote trust, calmness, and control in an otherwise apprehensive and uncooperative preschooler. Table 8.5 presents some general guidelines for teaching young children.Teaching School-Age Children. Unless they are quite ill, school-age children usually want to participate in their care. They have a need to cooperate and achieve. When teaching, speak directly to them and include them in the education plan. Parents can often learn by observing the care being given and taught to their child ( Fig. 8.7 ). Table 8.6 provides some general guidelines to keep in mind when teaching school-age children. Teaching Adolescents. Adolescents are particularly sensitive about maintaining body image and feelings of control and autonomy. This is especially important with health care processes and decisions that affect them. Table 8.7 gives guidelines to use when teaching adolescents. EVALUATING LEARNING Teaching, even when done well, does not necessarily mean that learning has occurred. Evaluation of learning is critical to ensure that the child and family have actually learned what was taught. In a health care setting, perform an evaluation with each educational encounter and adjust goals and interventions accordingly. The nurse, along with the rest of the interdisciplinary team, is responsible for child and family learning. Help ensure understanding by asking for feedback and offering an opportunity for questions. Also, assessing for signs of confusion, such as increased anxiety, can help evaluate learning. If the child or family has not learned, the health care team ensures that teaching strategies are adjusted so that the child or family does learn.FIGURE 8.7 Teach the school-age child and parent together. The ultimate goal of education is a change in behavior on the part of the child and family; this change can occur in their level of knowledge, skill, or both. Evaluation can occur in several different ways, depending on the topic and the method of teaching. The child or family may: Demonstrate a skill. Learning can quickly and easily be identified using this method. Repeat back or teach back the information using their own words. Answer open-ended questions. Open-ended questions provide an opportunity to assess for missing or incorrect information. Open- ended questions are those that cannot be answered with a simple \"yes\" or \"no.\"Another option to evaluate learning is to provide a \"pretend\" scenario for the family, mentally placing them in their own home. Have them verbalize all the steps needed to care for their child, from routine care to handling an emergency situation. They will need to convey information accurately and completely as they walk through the steps necessary to provide care for their child independently at home. DOCUMENTING EDUCATION FOR THE CHILD AND FAMILY Documenting child care and education on the medical record is part of every nurse's professional practice and serves four main purposes. First and foremost, the child's medical record serves as a communication tool that the entire interdisciplinary team can use to keep track of what the child and family have learned already and what learning still needs to occur. Next, it serves to testify to the education the family has received if and when legal matters arise. Third, it verifies standards set by the Joint Commission, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and other accrediting bodies that hold health care providers accountable for child and family education activities. And last, it informs third-party payers of goods and services provided for reimbursement purposes. Documentation of child and family education is imperative. It is the only way to ensure that the family's educational plan and objectives have been completed and that the family is ready for discharge. ocumentation of child and family education should include such topics as: The learning needs assessment Information on the child's medical condition and plan of care Goals of child education; date goal is met Teaching method used and how received by child and family Medications, including drug-drug and drug-food interactions Modified diets and nutritional needs Safe use of medical equipment Follow-up care and community resources KEY CONCEPTS Atraumatic care focuses on minimizing stressors and separation from the family and promoting a sense of control for the child and family. Children and families need appropriate explanation and education before a procedure is performed. Preparation may include explaining the procedure as well as physically preparing the child. Appropriate preparation helps to decrease the child's and family's anxiety, promote the child's cooperation, and support the child's and family's coping skills. A major aspect of preparation involves play. Include the child's parents in preparation, because parents are usually the greatest source of comfort for the child. Be short, simple, and appropriate in explaining situations at the child's level of development. Explain what is to be done and what is expected of the child. Utilize a child life specialist when available. Family centered care involves a beneficial partnership between the patient, family and health care providers in planning, providingand evaluating care. Family-centered care is based on the concept that the family is the primary source of strength and support for the child. Family centered care includes: respect for the child and family, recognition of cultural diversity, identification of the family's strengths, assistance with emotional and other support of the family, providing honest and unbiased information, and collaborating and empowering families. Maintain open and honest lines of communication with children and their families. Therapeutic communication involves the use of open-ended questions, reflection, paraphrasing, acknowledgement of emotions, and active listening. To communicate effectively with children, provide information and support on the child's developmental level and utilize age- appropriate methods. When communicating with parents, be honest. Parents want to feel valued and should be equal partners in the health care team. It is vital for the family to have knowledge about their child's health. The nurse should assess the family's culture and language before planning teaching. An interpreter may be needed if the family does not speak English. The nurse must assess each family's individual beliefs and practices rather than generalizing. The steps of health education are assessment of learning needs and styles, collaborative establishment of the goals and plan of education, implementation, evaluation, and documentation of education. Patient education begins with the first patient encounter and proceeds through discharge and beyond. Reassessment after each step or change in the process is critical to success.

The physician has ordered IV fluids along with laboratory work including a complete blood count, electrolytes, and a urine culture. As his nurse, how will you prepare him and his family before the procedure and support them during and after the procedure, to promote the best outcome and to ensure atraumatic care? 2. A 3-year-old girl from Saudi Arabia has become seriously ill while visiting the United States. She will require a lengthy hospital stay. Describe the steps the nurse should take to communicate effectively with and provide extensive health care teaching to this child's family. STUDY ACTIVITIES 1. Develop a teaching plan for one of the families that you care for in the clinical setting. Be sure to follow the appropriate steps for providing education. 2. Interview a child life specialist about the effects that the traditional (not atraumatic) approach to restraining a child for procedures might have on a child of various ages. 3. Research the availability of language interpreters and translators in your local community, compiling a list of the available resources.9 Health Supervision Words of Wisdom It is never too late to start prevention. It begins with a genuine desire for health improvement. KEY TERMS active immunity developmental screenings developmental surveillance immunity medical home passive immunity risk assessment screening tests selective screening universal screening Learning Objectives Upon completion of the chapter, you will be able to: 1. Describe the principles of health supervision. 2. Identify challenges to health supervision for children with chronic illnesses. 3. List the three components of a health supervision visit. 4. Use instruments appropriately for developmental surveillance and screening of children. 5. Demonstrate knowledge of the principles of immunization. 6. Identify barriers to immunization. 7. Identify the key components of health promotion.8. Describe the role of anticipatory guidance in health promotion. Three-year-old Maya Randall and 9-month-old Evan Randall are brought to the clinic by their father. Maya was last seen in the clinic when she was 1 year old and Evan has never been seen. The father says that they have both been healthy so they did not need to come to the clinic before this. Maya is complaining of a sore throat, which is what prompted today's visit.PRINCIPLES OF HEALTH SUPERVISION Health supervision involves providing services proactively, with the goal of optimizing the child's level of functioning. It ensures the child is growing and developing appropriately and it promotes the best possible health of the child by teaching parents and children about preventing injury and illness (e.g., proper immunizations and anticipatory guidance). This chapter is organized around the three components of health supervision: developmental surveillance and screening; injury and disease prevention; and health promotion. Health supervision of the child begins at birth and continues through adolescence. It is vital to every child and is most effective when the child has a centralized source of health care. Any place publicly accessible by children and families can be an appropriate setting for health supervision services\u2014private physicians' offices, community health departments, sliding-scale clinics, homeless shelters, day care centers, and schools. The framework for the health supervision visit is developed from national guidelines available through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the American Medical Association (AMA), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). These organizations also provide guidelines for children with chronic health problems and services and information regarding unique situations such as the internationally adopted child. Wellness The focus of pediatric health supervision is wellness. The health supervision visit provides an opportunity to maximize health promotion for the child, family, and community. Nurses have the ability to promote optimal health during these encounters. Health supervision visits must be viewed as part of a continuum of care, not as the accomplishment of isolated tasks. Medical Home A medical home is the primary physician who has a long-term and comprehensive relationship with the family. This continuing relationship promotes trust between the provider and the family and leads to comprehensive, continuous, coordinated, and cost- effective care. The medical home is the setting that allows the highest level of health supervision. To be effective, the medical home must be accessible, family centered, culturally effective, and community based. It must be integrated into the child's world, not adjacent to it. Characteristics of a medical home are displayed in Box 9.1. Partnerships The child is the focus of the health supervision visit. However, the child's health is linked to the needs and resources of his or her family and community. For instance, if the family is in turmoil because of divorce, drug abuse, or parental health problems, the child is less likely to receive the attention and energy that he or she needs to thrive. Likewise, a community with high levels of poverty, poor infrastructure, and lack of resources will not be able to provide the support services needed to allow children to reach their full potential. To be effective, the nurse must offer commitment and develop an ongoing partnership with the child, family, and community. These partnerships allow for mutual goal setting, marshalling of resources, and development of optimal health practices. The partnership between the child and the health supervision team develops over time. In infancy the family is the surrogate for the child in the partnership. The child's participation in the partnership increases at a rate that is developmentally appropriate. The child's increasing influence in the partnership allows the nurse to tailor health supervision to the child's needs. The partnership allows the child to take increasing responsibility for his or her personal health and optimizes health promotion.

(2008). The medical home. Retrieved April 17, 2011, from http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;110/1/184#T1 Nurses must validate and enhance the role of family members as they influence and inform the child's concept of wellness. The health care community must involve the family to have a significant impact on a child's health. The family wants the best possible outcome for their child, and health care decisions are based on the knowledge they possess. The nurse can greatly facilitate trust by acknowledging that the family has unique insights to offer on their child's health. Nurses can also strengthen the partnership between the family and the health care community by recognizing the family's healthy practices, addressing their health issues, and strengthening their skills. By contributing to the partnership, both the nurse and the family enhance the chance of success for health care plans, but families are the ones who must implement any health care strategy and know what expected outcomes are reasonable. Their feedback is invaluable to formulating an effective long-term health supervision plan that optimizes their child's wellness. Take Note! Observe the parent-child interaction during the health supervision visit. The nurse can learn much about the family dynamic by observing the family for behavioral clues: Does the parent make eye contact with the infant? Does the parent anticipate and respond to the infant's needs? Are parents effective when dealing with a toddler's temper tantrum? Do the parents' comments increase the school-age child's sense of self-worth? Behavioral observations are crucial to the proper assessment of the family's needs and issues. Partnerships between the community and the health promotion team benefit the community as well as individual children. When nurses develop partnerships with community agencies such as schools, churches, and ancillary health facilities, barriers to care can be overcome. The nurse becomes aware of available resources in the community that can benefit an individual family. With input from community partners, the nurse can perform an assessment of the community's needs. The assessment then provides the foundation for the development of community-based health promotion programs. These programs expand the resources of the community, which in turn enhances the health of its members. Special Issues in Health Supervision Special issues in health supervision include cultural influences, community influences, health supervision and the chronically ill child, and health supervision and the internationally adopted child. Cultural Influences on Health Supervision A person's definition of health is influenced by his or her culture. Successful interactions result when the nurse is aware of the beliefs and interactive styles that are often present in members of a specific culture. If the goals of the health care plan are not consistent with the health belief system of the family, the plan has little chance for success. Optimal wellness for the child requires the nurse and the family to negotiate a mutually acceptable plan of care. A plan must balance the cultural beliefs and practices of the family with those of the health care establishment. The nurse must possess cultural competence and sensitivity for the partnership to be successful. Most health promotion and disease prevention strategies in the United States have a future-based orientation and view the child as an active and controlling agent in his or her own health. This reflects the dominant culture; however, the challenge to the nurse is to develop strategies that are meaningful to children from other cultures. Significant numbers of children belong to cultures with a present- based orientation. These cultures are more concerned about what is going on now. For these children, health promotion activities need shorter-term goals and outcomes to be useful. Children with a fatalistic world-view will see any actions on their part as ineffective. They may feel that a god figure or supernatural forces control their fate and that health is a gift to be appreciated, not a goal to be pursued. Certain cultures believe health is the result of being in harmony within oneself and the larger universe. From thisviewpoint, taking a medication or receiving a treatment may not be an effective way to restore health because it does not address the problem of being \"out of harmony.\" However, just because an individual belongs to a certain culture does not guarantee that he or she subscribes to all of its values. The nurse should explore each child's specific beliefs during the health interview. Community Influences on Health Supervision The child is a member of a community as well as a family and a culture. Each community has unique strengths, weaknesses, and values. A community can be a contributor to a child's health or be the cause of his or her illnesses. The child's health cannot be totally separated from the health of the surrounding community. Ideally the child's medical home is within the family's community. If home and access to medical care are close, barriers such as lack of transportation, expense of travel, and time away from the parents' workplace are reduced. Having the medical home within the community facilitates bonds between the health team and schools, churches, and support services and agencies. Community support and resources are necessary for children with significant problems. A close working relationship between the child's physician and community agencies is an enormous benefit to the child (see the earlier section on partnerships). The community assessment may reveal problems that are causing or contributing to the child's health problems. A deteriorating infrastructure can contribute to decreased access to care and increased risk of injury or illness. Poverty has been linked to low birthweight and premature birth, among other health problems (Shore & Shore, 2009). Substandard housing can be directly related to lead poisoning and asthma (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2009a). A thorough knowledge of the family's community is needed before a health surveillance program can be effective. Health Supervision and the Child With Chronic Illness Effective health supervision must be responsive to the individual child's situation. The child with a chronic illness needs to be assessed repeatedly to determine his or her health maintenance needs. These assessments determine the frequency of visits and types of interventions needed. The impact of the illness on the child's functional health patterns determines whether standard health supervision visits need to be augmented. An effective partnership among the child's medical home, family, and community is vital for a child with a chronic illness. Coordination of specialty care, community agencies, and family support networks enhances the quality of life and health of these children. Access to care and services minimizes the risk of injury from the illness. Support groups and community-based resources optimize the family's adaptation to the stressors of chronic illness. Comprehensive health supervision includes frequent psychosocial assessments. Issues to be covered include: Health insurance coverage Transportation to health care facilities Financial stressors Family coping School's response to the chronic illness These are often stressful and emotionally charged issues. The nurse with a trusting and ongoing relationship with the child and family is in the best position to help with these issues. The nurse can assist the family to find financial and medical assistance programs, take advantage of community resources, and participate in support groups. The nurse can also educate school personnel about the child's illness and assist them in maximizing the child's potential for academic success. Health Supervision and the Child Adopted Internationally Health supervision of the internationally adopted child must include comprehensive screening for infectious disease. In 2010, approximately 11,050 children were adopted from countries outside the United States, many from areas with a high prevalence of infectious diseases (Intercountry Adoption, Office of Children's Issues, U.S. Department of State, 2010a). China, Ethiopia, and Russia supplied over half of all international adoptees in 2010, followed by South Korea and the Ukraine (Intercountry Adoption, Office of Children's Issues, U.S. Department of State, 2010b). Proper screening is important not only to the child's health but also to the adopting family and the larger community. Screening is recommended within the first few weeks of the child's arrival into the United States. Intestinal parasites are a common problem with Giardia lamblia, the most common pathogen (Miller, 2008). Infected children are frequently symptom-free, so universal screening is recommended (Simms & Freundlich, 2007). Latent tuberculosis is also common. Though active tuberculosis infection has been rarely reported, an extensive outbreak oftuberculosis occurred in a North Dakota community in 1998. The index case was an internationally adopted child from the Marshall Islands (Curtis et al., 1999; Miller, 2008). Universal screening is recommended for this high-risk population (Shetty, 2010; Simms & Freundlich, 2007). Universal screening for hepatitis B, HIV, and syphilis infections is recommended (Shetty, 2010). Due to lack of resources in the home country, screening and treatment for these diseases are sporadic and ineffective. If testing is documented, it is likely to be unreliable. Testing supplies may have been outdated or improperly stored. Also, the test may have been performed before the child's seroconversion occurred.COMPONENTS OF HEALTH SUPERVISION Developmental surveillance and screening, injury and disease prevention, and health promotion are the critical components of health supervision for children. Health supervision visits for children without health problems and appropriate growth and development are recommended at birth, within the first week of life, by 1 month, then at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 15 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months, and then yearly until age 21 (Hagan, Shaw, & Duncan, 2008). Children with special needs or concerns will have more frequent and intensive visits. Health supervision visits include assessment of physical health along with intellectual and social development and parent-child interaction. Each health supervision visit will include (Hagan et al., 2008): A history and physical assessment, including head circumference (until 2 years of age), height, and weight Developmental/behavioral assessment Sensory screening (vision and hearing) Appropriate at-risk screening (such as lead screening, anemia screening, tuberculin test, hypertension screening, cholesterol screening) Immunizations Health promotion/anticipatory guidance (injury prevention, violence prevention, nutrition counseling) Disease prevention and health promotion are concepts well established in adult health supervision. Injury prevention and developmental surveillance/screening are additional components of pediatric health supervision visits that help every child achieve his or her optimal state of wellness. Developmental Surveillance and Screening Developmental surveillance is an ongoing collection of skilled observations made over time during health care visits. Components include: Noting and addressing parental concerns Obtaining a developmental history Making accurate observations Consulting with relevant professionals Developmental screenings are brief assessment procedures that identify children who warrant more intensive assessment and testing. Developmental screening assessments may be observational or by caregiver report ( Fig. 9.1 ). Development, or the emergence of the child's abilities, is a longitudinal process. Within the trust and security of the medical home, family and physicians can share observations and concerns. In collaboration, the family and the physician observe the child's accomplishments or milestones over time. Data collection for developmental surveillance of infants and young children is performed through developmental questionnaires, physician observations, and a thorough physical examination. School records and test results can provide academic performance data for the older child. Input from teachers, coaches, and other adults involved with the child can give insight into the child's emotional and social development. When developmental delay is suspected, frequent developmental surveillance is warranted. Reemphasizing parental roles and responsibilities fosters cooperation and compliance. It is therefore crucial that parents understand the need for frequent assessments. A pattern of developmental delays warrants a formal evaluation. The pediatric nurse must understand normal growth and development and become proficient at screening for problems related to development. The historical information obtained from the parent or primary caregiver about developmental milestones may indicate warning signs or identify risks for developmental delay ( Table 9.1 ). Factors placing the infant or toddler at risk for developmental problems include:FIGURE 9.1 Developmental screening provides the opportunity for the nurse to identify problems in the child's development. Birthweight less than 1,500 g Gestational age less than 33 weeks Central nervous system abnormality Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy Maternal prenatal alcohol or Hyperbilirubinemia requiring exchange transfusion Kernicterus Congenital malformations Symmetric intrauterine growth deficiency Perinatal or congenital infection Suspected sensory impairment Chronic (more than 3 months) otitis media with effusion Inborn error of metabolism HIV infection Lead level above 19 mg/dL Inappropriate parental concern about developmental issues (e.g., not allowing a developmentally appropriate 3-year-old feed him- or herself) Parent with less than high school education Single parent Sibling with developmental problems Parent with developmental disability or mental illness Infants or children with any of these risk factors should be screened carefully for developmental delays. This screening should occur in a prospective manner, with screenings occurring at frequent intervals to identify concerns early. Take Note! Any child who \"loses\" a developmental milestone\u2014for example, the child able to sit without support who now cannot\u2014needs an immediate full evaluation, since this may indicate a significant neurologic problem. A number of developmental screening tools are available to guide the nurse in assessing development ( Table 9.2 ). The Denver II is a frequently used tool (see Appendix B ). The Denver II should be used for diagnostic purposes only when administered by specifically trained personnel. Nurses not trained in the use of the Denver II should use screening tools based on the Denver II. Many screening methods assist the nurse in identifying infants and children who may have developmental delays, thus allowing for prompt identification and referral for evaluation. Additional data can be used to determine a school-age child's developmental level, include handwriting samples, ability to draw, school performance, and social skills. Injury and Disease PreventionDisease prevention is defined as interventions performed to protect children from a disease or to identify it at an early stage and lessen its consequences. These interventions are determined by the results of the nurse's assessment, nationally accepted practice guidelines, and the family's goals. Components of disease prevention include screening tests and immunizations. Injury prevention is primarily accomplished through education, anticipatory guidance, and physical changes in the environment. Injuries can be unintentional (poisoning, falls, or drowning) or intentional (child abuse, homicide, or suicide). The types of injuries a child is most likely to encounter vary greatly among age groups. Although aggressive public health initiatives have decreased mortality rates of childhood unintentional injuries significantly in the past 50 years, continued vigilance and innovation are needed (Singh, 2010). The nurse, in partnership with the family and the community, can have an enormous impact on child safety. Specific interventions are discussed in Chapters 3 through 7 . Screening Tests Screening tests are procedures or laboratory analyses used to identify children with a certain condition. These tests are done to ensure that no child with the disorder is missed. They have a high sensitivity (a high false-positive rate) and a low specificity (a low false-negative rate). If a screening test is positive, follow-up tests with higher specificity are performed. A risk assessment is performed by the physician in conjunction with the child and includes objective as well as subjective data to determine the likelihood that the child will develop a condition. In universal screening, an entire population is screened regardless of the child's individual risk. This type of screening is performed when a reliable risk assessment procedure is not available. In contrast, selective screening is done when a risk assessment indicates the child has one or more risk factors for the disorder. Take Note! To increase cooperation from young children during screenings, set up a reward system. Easy-to-do rewards include: Stamping the back of the child's hand with a \"smiley face\" Making an eye cover by placing two stickers back to back over a tongue blade and letting the child keep the cover after the screening Copying a design onto a sheet of paper and letting the child take it home to color Letting the child play with a simple device such as a pen-light or stethoscopeMETABOLIC SCREENING State law determines which metabolic screening tests are mandatory in that state. In some states, mandatory screening is limited to as few as four diseases. In addition to screening for hearing loss, the March of Dimes currently recommends universal newborn metabolic screening tests for 29 disorders for which effective treatment is available (March of Dimes, 2010): Amino acid metabolism disorders: phenylketonuria, maple syrup urine disease, homocystinuria, citrullinemia, combined immunodeficiency (SCID) During the initial health supervision visit, the nurse should confirm that newborn metabolic screening was performed prior to discharge from the birthing unit. If the test was not performed or was performed at younger than 48 hours of age, the screening should be performed at that visit. The metabolic screening results need to be noted in the child's permanent record at the medical home. HEARING SCREENING The AAP recommends hearing screening of all infants. Hearing loss is a common condition in newborns, and even mild hearing loss can cause serious delays in social and emotional development, language acquisition, and cognitive function (De Michele & Meyers,2010). Identification of hearing loss by 6 months of age is crucial to reduce the impact on the child's development (De Michele & Meyers, 2010). Refer to Healthy People 2020. Targeted screening based on risk factors will identify only 50% of infants with hearing loss, and with reliable screening tests available, universal screening has been implemented (De Michele & Meyers, 2010). Screening should be done before discharge from the birthing unit; if not, the newborn needs to be screened before 1 month of age. Behavioral observations of the infant's response to sounds, such as a ringing bell or clapping hands, are not sensitive enough to preclude mild to moderate hearing loss (De Michele & Meyers, 2010). Accepted methodologies for screening newborn hearing are displayed in Table 9.3 . HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov. Screening for hearing loss in older children begins with a history from the primary caregivers. If any problems are noted, audiometry should be performed. When the child is capable of following simple commands reliably, the nurse can perform some basic procedures to screen for hearing loss. The whisper test is easy to perform but to be valid requires a quiet room that is away from distractions. The Weber and Rinne tests can be used to screen for sensorineural or conductive hearing loss ( Fig. 9.2 ). Universal hearing screening with objective testing is recommended at ages 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 (Hagan et al., 2008). At the ages of 7, 9, and 11 through 21 years, age-appropriate risk assessment should be performed (Hagan et al., 2008). See Box 9.2 for examples of risk assessment. More frequent screening is recommended if there is any behavior that indicates the child's hearing may be impaired. Repeated hearing screenings are recommended if a child has risk factors for acquired hearing loss such as those listed in Box 9.3. BOX 9.2 HEARING RISK ASSESSMENT Ages 3 months to 4 years Auditory skill monitoring Developmental surveillance Assessment of parental concerns Age 4 years Difficulty hearing on the telephone Difficulty hearing people in a noisy background Frequent asking of others to repeat themselves Turning the television up too loudlyVISION SCREENING Newborns with ocular structural abnormalities are at high risk for vision impairment. Vision screening is performed at every scheduled health supervision visit. The screening procedures for children younger than 3 years of age or for nonverbal children involve evaluating the child's ability to fixate on and follow objects. The neonate should be able to fixate on an object 10 to 12 inches from the face. After fixation, the infant should be able to follow the object to the midline. By 2 months of age, the infant should be able to follow the object 180 degrees. The technique of photoscreening can help identify problems such as ocular malalignment, refractive error, and lens and retinal problems. Take Note! Use objects with black-and-white patterns when performing vision screening on an infant younger than 6 months of age. The infant's vision at this age is more attuned to high-contrast patterns than to colors. Try checkerboard patterns or concentric circles. Animal figures like pandas and dalmatians also work well. FIGURE 9.2 (A) The Weber test screens for hearing by assessing sound conducted via bone. (B) The Rinne test screens for hearing by comparing sound conduction via bone to sound conduction via air. BOX 9.3 RISK FACTORS FOR HEARING IMPAIRMENT Family history of hearing loss Prenatal infection Anomalies of the head, face, or ears Low birthweight (<1,500 g) Hyperbilirubinemia requiring exchange transfusion Ototoxic medications Low Apgar scores: 4 or less at 1 minute, or 6 or less at 5 minutes Mechanical ventilation lasting 5 days Syndrome associated with hearing loss Head trauma Bacterial meningitis Neurodegenerative disorders Persistent pulmonary hypertension Otitis media with effusion for 3 months Adapted from De Michele, A. M., & Meyers, A. D. (2010). Newborn hearing screening. eMedicine. Retrieved April 12, 2011, from http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/836646-overview After the age of 3 years, a variety of standardized age-appropriate vision screening charts are available. These charts include the \"tumbling E\" and Allen figures ( Fig. 9.3 A, B). These charts allow for a more precise vision assessment and aid the nurse in identifying preschool children with visual acuity problems. By age 5 or 6, most children know the alphabet well enough to use the traditional Snellen chart for vision screening (see Fig. 9.3 C). Refer to Healthy People 2020. Table 9.4 gives further information about vision screening tools. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Screenings should be performed when children are alert, as fatigue and lack of interest can mimic poor vision. When using any vision screening chart, several simple steps need to be followed (Bowden & Green-burg, 2008): Place the chart at the child's eye level. Make sure there is sufficient lighting. FIGURE 9.3 (A) The \"tumbling E\" chart is appropriate for children who do not yet know the alphabet but who can follow instructions to indicate the direction that the arms of the \"E\" are pointing. (B) A picture chart similar to the Allen object recognition chart is appropriate for vision screening in the preschool-age child. (C) The Snellen eye chart may be used for children age 6 or older who know the alphabet. The test can be obtained at www.preventblindness.org/children or by calling 1-800- 331-2020. Place a mark on the floor 10 to 20 feet from the chart (distance depends on what the tool is calibrated for). Align the child's heels on the mark. Have the child read each line with one eye covered and then with the other eye covered. Explain to the child to keep the eye covered but open ( Fig. 9.4 ). Have the child read each line with both eyes.In addition to visual acuity screening, children should also be screened for color discrimination. Any child with eye abnormalities or who has failed visual screening needs to be evaluated by a specialist appropriately trained to treat children. IRON-DEFICIENCY ANEMIA SCREENING Iron deficiency is the leading nutritional deficiency in the United States (CDC, 2011a). Iron deficiency can cause cognitive and motor deficits resulting in developmental delays and behavioral disturbances. The increased incidence of iron-deficiency anemia is directly associated with periods of diminished iron stores, rapid growth, and high metabolic demands. At 6 months of age, the in utero iron stores of a full-term infant are almost depleted (Baker, Greer, & The Committee on Nutrition, 2010). The adolescent growth spurt warrants constant iron replacement. Pregnant adolescents are at even higher risk for iron deficiency due to the demands of the mother's growth spurt and the needs of the developing fetus (CDC, 2011a). FIGURE 9.4 One eye must be covered while the other is tested in order to detect discrepancies in visual acuity between the two eyes and identify amblyopia early. Guidelines for universal iron-deficiency anemia screening vary. It is important for the nurse to assess for risk factors related to iron- deficiency anemia at each health supervision visit. Refer to Box 9.4 for Bright Future Guidelines and Box 9.5 for risk factors for iron- deficiency anemia. LEAD SCREENING Elevated blood lead levels (10 mcg/dL or higher) remain a preventable environmental health threat. Approximately 25% of children live in housing with lead-based paint, therefore leading to a risk of lead exposure and resulting cognitive impairments (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009). Although the prevalence of elevated lead levels has declined significantly over the past two decades, certain communities still possess a high level of lead exposure. A shift to targeted screening has occurred, with criteria continuing to develop. In the past, 80% of children on Medicaid were found to have an increased blood lead concentration (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009). Therefore, screening of all children eligible for Medicaid was recommended and even required by federal Medicaid. Recent research has shown that blood lead levels have decreased in certain enrolled Medicaid children and in response the CDC Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention is updating their recommendations to targeted screenings of specific groups of children that state and local officials deem to be living in areas of higher risk (Wengrovitz & Brown, 2009). Until these recommendations are finalized, the CDC and AAP continue to support universal screening of Medicaid-eligible children (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009). BOX 9.4 GUIDELINES FOR IRON-DEFICIENCY ANEMIA SCREENING Universal Screening Screen all full-term infants at 9-12 months.Selective Screening 4 months: Screen children with risk factors of prematurity, with low birthweight, on low-iron formula or not receiving iron- fortified formula or foods, and with early introduction of cow's milk. 18 months and annually beginning at 2 years: Screen children with special health needs that put them at risk for iron-deficiency anemia, on low-iron diets such as nonmeat, with environmental factors such as poverty, and with limited access to food. 6-10 years: Screen children on a strict vegetarian diet and not receiving iron supplementation. 11-21 years: Screen all nonpregnant females every 5 to 10 years throughout childbearing years at routine health care visits. Annually screen females with risk factors such as extensive menstrual flow, low iron intake, or previous diagnosis of iron- deficiency anemia. Adapted from Hagan, J. F., Shaw, J. S., & Duncan, P. M.

Targeted screening is recommended at 9 to 12 months with a repeat screening at 24 months (Hagan et al., 2008). For children who live in areas where health authorities have not made clear recommendations on risk, screening guidelines are less clear and therefore universal screening is currently recommended.

Many cases of elevated blood lead levels have been reported in children who are recent immigrants, refugees, or international adoptees. The CDC recommends blood lead testing for these children upon entering the United States and a repeat test 3 to 6 months after placement in a permanent residence (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009). HYPERTENSION SCREENING Obesity and resulting hypertension have been on the rise in children and can lead to adult cardiovascular disease. Universal hypertension screening for children beginning at 3 years of age is recommended (Hagan et al., 2008). If the child has risk factors for systemic hypertension, such as preterm birth, very low birth-weight, renal disease, organ transplant, congenital heart disease, or other illnesses associated with hypertension, then screening begins when the risk factor becomes apparent (Hagan et al., 2008).

Auscultation is the preferred method of measuring blood pressure in children, and an elevated blood pressure must be confirmed on repeated visits before a diagnosis of hypertension is given. Refer to Box 9.6 for hypertension guidelines. Anticipatory guidance on diet and lifestyle changes is appropriate for any child with prehypertension (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 2005). Refer to Chapter 19 for additional information on hypertension. HYPERLIPIDEMIA SCREENING Atherosclerosis has been documented in children, and a link exists between high lipid levels and the development of these lesions. Bright Futures Guidelines recommend universal screening for dyslipidemia once in late adolescence (Hagan et al., 2008). Selectively screening children at high risk for hyperlipidemia can reduce their lifelong risk of coronary artery disease. The risk assessment focuses on the child's family history. Refer to Box 9.7 for details regarding screening for hyperlipidemia. Remember Maya and Evan, the children introduced at the beginning of the chapter? How would you assess their growth and development? Which screening tests are warranted for them, and why? What further information would you need to determine which tests should be performed?

The nurse needs to understand the principles of immunizations, the proper use of vaccines, and barriers to immunization. Armed with this knowledge, the nurse can partner with families to provide the highest level of disease protection to children ( Fig. 9.5 ). Refer to Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov .FIGURE 9.5 Nurse administering intramuscular injection into the vastus lateralis of an infant. PRINCIPLES OF IMMUNIZATION The immune system has the ability to recognize materials present in the body as \"self\" or \"non-self.\" Foreign materials (non-self) are called antigens. When an antigen is recognized by the immune system, the immune system responds by producing antibodies (immunoglobulins) or directing special cells to destroy and remove the antigen. Immunity is the ability to destroy and remove a specific antigen from the body. The acquisition of immunity can be active or passive. Passive immunity is produced when the immunoglobulins of one person are transferred to another. This immunity lasts only weeks or months. Passive immunity can be obtained by injection of exogenous immunoglobulins. It can also be transferred from mothers to infants via colostrum or the placenta. Active immunity is acquired when a person's own immune system generates the immune response. Active immunity lasts for many years or for a lifetime. This long-term protection is the result of immunologic memory. After the initial immune response, specialized cells for that antigen continue to exist. When an antigen returns, these memory cells very rapidly produce a fresh supply of antibodies to reestablish protection. This immunity can occur after exposure to natural pathogens or after exposure to vaccines. Vaccines mimic the characteristics of the natural antigen. The immune system mounts a response and establishes an immunologic memory as it would for an infection. The classification of vaccines is based on the characteristics of the antigen present. The antigen may be viral or bacterial. It may be live attenuated (weakened) or killed. It may be the whole antigen or a portion of it (fractional). Live attenuated vaccines are modified living organisms that are weakened. The organism can produce an immune response but does not produce the complications of the illness. Killed vaccines contain whole dead organisms; they are incapable of reproducing but are capable of producing an immune response. Toxoid vaccines contain protein products produced by bacteria called toxins. The toxin is heat-treated to weaken its effect, but it retains its ability to produce an immune response. Conjugate vaccines are the result of chemically linking the bacterial cell wall polysaccharide (sugar-based) portions with proteins. This dramatically increases the immune response compared to presenting the poly-saccharide portion alone. Recombinant vaccines use genetically engineered organisms. For example, the hepatitis B vaccine is produced by splicing a gene portion of the virus into a gene of a yeast cell. The yeast cell is then able to produce hepatitis B surface antigen to use for vaccine production.The safety and efficacy of existing vaccines are constantly being reviewed, and research to improve vaccines is ongoing. The goal is to refine vaccines so that a maximum immune response is produced with the least amount of risk for the child. IMMUNIZATION MANAGEMENT The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a branch of the CDC, reviews the recommended immunization schedules at least yearly and updates the schedule to ensure that it reflects current best practices ( Tables 9.5 and 9.6 ). In addition to the recommended schedule, the ACIP publishes a \"catch-up\" schedule for children who have not been adequately immunized ( Table 9.7 ). The child's immunization record must be compared with the latest edition of these schedules when assessing the need for immunization. Take Note! When obtaining an immunization history from the parent, ask, \"When and where did your child receive his (or her) last immunization?\" The answer will provide more information than simply asking, \"Are your child's immunizations up to date?\" The nurse can compare this information with that on the immunization record, discover in what settings the child is getting health care, and use the information as a starting point in a discussion of any reactions to previous immunizations.

Retrieved April 17, 2011, from http://www.immunize.org/catg.d7p3085.pdf . We thank the Immunization Action Coalition.Vaccine storage and administration affect the efficacy of a vaccine. Improperly stored or reconstituted vaccines can be ineffective (CDC, 2011c). The vaccine must be given by the correct route; not all vaccines are given intramuscularly ( Box 9.8 , Table 9.8 ). The manufacturer's package insert is the best reference source for any vaccine. Take Note! Proper vaccine storage is critical to vaccine efficacy. If you suspect that a vaccine was not maintained at the proper storage temperature, do not use it! An ineffective vaccine is of no use in preventing disease. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) requires that Vaccine Information Statements (VISs; Fig. 9.6 ) be provided to parents before an immunization is given (CDC, 2010b). In accordance with the concept of partnership with the parents, allow ample time for them to read the VIS and to discuss their concerns. If the parents do not understand the information presented, they should feel comfortable asking questions. If the parents are illiterate, present the information orally and verify that the parents understand it. If the information in the VIS is not in the parent's native language, have a translator present the information. At this time, ask the parents about the child's reactions to previous immunizations, and screen for precautions and contraindications for each vaccine to be administered. Before the vaccine is given, the parents must sign consent forms. Any clinically significant adverse event that occurs after an immunization should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which is a cosponsored surveillance program by the CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, n.d.). For assistance in obtaining and completing a VAERS form, call 800-822- 7967 or visit www.vaers.hhs.gov . Documentation in the child's permanent record includes the following: Date the vaccine was administered Name of vaccine (commonly used abbreviation is acceptable) FIGURE 9.6 Federal law mandates the use of Vaccine Information Statements (VISs). These should be given to the parent or primary caregiver for each vaccine the child receives. (Obtained from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [2010].

This reinforces the importance of the procedure and reminds the parents to keep the child's immunizations up to date. Figure 9.7 shows a typical vaccine administration record. VACCINE DESCRIPTIONS This section reviews the most commonly used vaccines. These immunizations are recommended by the ACIP and the AAP. Each state has laws that determine which immunizations are required for school admittance. These requirements can be waived if a contraindication or precaution to the vaccine exists. Contraindications are conditions that justify withholding an immunization either permanently or temporarily. The only permanent contraindication to all vaccines is an anaphylactic or systemic allergic reaction to a vaccine component (Kroger, Sumaya, Pickering, & Atkinson, 2011). Children who are severely immunocompromised or women who are pregnant should not receive live vaccines (such as MMR and varicella, see below); with pertussis immunization (DTP, DTaP, or TdaP, see below), encephalopathy without an identified cause within 7 days of the immunization permanently contraindicatesfurther immunization with pertussis-containing vaccine (Kroger et al., 2011). Temporarily postponing vaccinations is recommended for moderate to severe illness, immunosuppression, pregnancy, or recently received blood products or other antibody-containing products (Kroger et al., 2011). Vaccination should not be postponed because of a minor respiratory illness or a low-grade fever (Kroger et al., 2011). Precautions are conditions that increase the risk of an adverse reaction or may impair the child's ability to acquire immunity from the vaccine. On an individualized basis, providers must weigh the benefits of immunization against the likelihood of an adverse event. DIPHTHERIA, TETANUS, AND PERTUSSIS VACCINES. Immunization against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis diseases is given via a combination vaccine. The vaccine currently used for children younger than age 7 is diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (DTaP). It contains diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis cell wall proteins. The older version of this vaccine\u2014diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (DPT)\u2014contained killed whole cells of pertussis bacteria and caused more frequent and severe adverse reactions than DTaP. Diphtheria and tetanus (DT) vaccine is used for children younger than age 7 who have contraindications to pertussis immunization. Full-strength diphtheria toxoid causes significant adverse reactions in people older than age 7 years. For this group, the TdaP adolescent preparation vaccine is used: it contains tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine. The lowercase \"d\" is used to designate the lower dose of diphtheria toxoid. The ACIP recommends that TdaP be used for all tetanus boosters in older children (11 to 12 years) and adolescents, because TdaP provides a boost to diphtheria and pertussis immunization. HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE TYPE B VACCINES. Haemophilus influenzae type B is a bacterium that causes several life- threatening illnesses in children younger than 5 years of age. These infections include meningitis, epiglottitis, and septic arthritis. H. influenzae type B conjugate vaccines (Hib) have been extremely effective in cutting the rates of these diseases in children. There are several different types of Hib conjugate vaccines. HibTITER (HbOC) and ActHib (PRP-T) require three doses for the primary infant series, while Pedvax-HIB and Comvax (PRP-OMP) require two doses. These vaccines are interchangeable, but if different brands are administered to a child, then a total of three doses are necessary to complete the primary series in infants. Hib vaccine is not given to children 5 years of age or older and is contraindicated in children younger than 6 weeks (Kroger et al., 2011). POLIO VACCINE. Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is the only polio vaccine currently recommended in the United States (ACIP, 2000). It is a killed virus vaccine that poses no risk for vaccine-acquired disease. Oral polio vaccine (OPV), a live attenuated virus vaccine, was the preferred polio vaccine until 2000. At that time it became apparent that the only victims of poliomyelitis were people who had acquired it from OPV. The ACIP determined that in this country the risks of OPV outweighed the benefits and withdrew its recommendation of OPV (ACIP, 2000). (MMR) is a live attenuated virus combination vaccine. It is the one most commonly used in childhood immunizations. MMR can be given the same day as other live attenuated virus vaccines such as varicella vaccine. However, if not given on the same day, the immunizations should be spaced at least 28 days apart (Kroger et al., 2011). Anaphylactic reactions are believed to be associated with the neomycin or gelatin components of the vaccine rather than the egg component. The vaccine is not prepared from the allergenic albumen portion of the egg, so egg allergy is no longer a contraindication for measles vaccine (Kroger et al., 2011). Pregnancy in a child's mother is not a contraindication to the vaccination of the child (Kroger et al., 2011). Individual measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines are available if needed.FIGURE 9.7 Sample of a vaccine administration record (Acquired from Immunization Action Coalition. [2011]. Vaccine administration record for children and teens. Retrieved April 17, 2011, from http://www.immunize.org/catg.d7p2022.pdf . We thank the Immunization Action Coalition.) HEPATITIS A VACCINE. Hepatitis A vaccine (HepA) is an inactivated whole virus vaccine. Hepatitis A is spread through close physical contact and by eating or drinking contaminated food or water. It is one of the most frequently reported vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States. Young children are particularly susceptible to hepatitis A because of their close contact with other children, inadequate hygiene practices, and tendency to place everything in their mouth. Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended to be given to all children at age 12 months, followed by a repeat dose in 6 to 12 months. HEPATITIS B VACCINE. Hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) is a recombinant vaccine. For infants, the mother's HBsAg status determines when immunization for hepatitis B begins. If the mother's status is positive or unknown, the neonate is immunized within the first 12 hours of life, at 1 to 2 months of age, and at 6 months of age. This is vital, because up to 90% of infected neonates develop chronic carrier status and will be predisposed to cirrhosis and hepatic cancer (CDC, 2010e). If the mother's status is negative, immunizations are given routinely at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. Because hepatitis B is a sexually transmitted infection, it is important to verify the immunization status of all adolescents. VARICELLA VACCINE. Varicella vaccine (Var) is a live attenuated virus vaccine. All children age 12 to 15 months who have not had varicella (chickenpox) should be immunized. A second dose is recommended at age 4 to 6 years. The vaccine provides effective postexposure prophylaxis if administered within 3 to 5 days after exposure. Varicella vaccine may be given the same day as other live attenuated virus vaccines. However, if not given on the same day, the immunizations should be spaced at least 28 days apart. Pregnancy in a child's mother is not a contraindication to the vaccination of the child. PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINES. Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is the most common cause of pneumonia, sepsis,meningitis, and otitis media in young children (CDC, 2011d). The two available pneumococcal vaccines are pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV). Beginning in 2010, PCV13, which contains 13 strains of S. pneumoniae, replaced PCV7, which only contained 7 strains, for use in routine vaccination for children (CDC, 2010d). It stimulates an immune response in infants and is given at 2 months of age as part of the initial immunization series but can be given as early as 6 weeks of age (CDC, 2010d). PPSV contains 23 strains of S. pneumoniae. It does not provoke an immune response in children younger than 2 years of age (CDC, 2010d). PPSV is given to children older than 2 years of age who are at high risk for pneumococcal sepsis. This group includes children with anatomic/functional asplenia; sickle cell disease; chronic cardiac, pulmonary, or renal disease; diabetes mellitus; or HIV infection; children getting or who have cochlear implants; and children with immunosuppression (CDC, 2010d). INFLUENZA VACCINES. Influenza immunization is recommended yearly for healthy and high-risk children 6 months of age or older. Caregivers and household contacts of these children should also be immunized. In 2009-2010, in addition to the seasonal influenza vaccinations, the CDC began recommending vaccination against H1N1 influenza due to the influenza pandemic that was occurring worldwide (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2010). In the 2010-2011 influenza season, one vaccine was recommended, which protects against three strains of influenza, including the 2009 H1N1 (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2010). For children younger than 9 years old who are receiving their first influenza vaccination, who were immunized for the first time last season but did not receive two doses, or who did not receive two doses of the 2009 H1N1 vaccine, the CDC recommends two doses separated by 4 weeks (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2010). There are two influenza vaccines available, the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). LAIV is given intranasally and is indicated for healthy persons between the ages of 2 and 49 years (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2010). The virus in LAIV can replicate, and a person who has received LAIV can shed virus for a week (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2010). LAIV should not be given to anyone who will be in contact with an immunosuppressed person requiring a protected environment. TIV is suitable for any eligible person age 6 months or older. TIV is not capable of causing disease and is given by intramuscular injection (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2010). ROTAVIRUS VACCINE. Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe gastroenteritis among young children (Cortese & Parashar, 2009). The virus is shed in the stool and easily spreads via the fecal-oral route. Rotavirus accounts for about 30% to 50% of annual hospitalizations for gastroenteritis in children younger than 5 years of age (Cortese & Parashar, 2009). Severe, watery, crampy diarrhea quickly leads to dehydration in the infected child. The most severe disease occurs in children ages 4 to 23 months (Cortese & Parashar, 2009). The rotavirus vaccine is a live vaccine targeting five strains of rotavirus and is given via the oral route to infants younger than 32 weeks of age. Recently, administration of rotavirus vaccine to children with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) was contraindicated (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010f). HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINE. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a DNA tumor virus transmitted through direct skin-to- skin contact. HPV is contracted most often during vaginal or anal penetrative sexual acts. HPV infection is most common in adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 24 years who are sexually active. HPV causes genital warts and is responsible for the development of cervical cancer. For these reasons, the ACIP and AAP have recommended that HPV vaccination occur in preadolescent girls (CDC, 2010g). Two vaccines have been licensed: Cervarix, or HPV2, and Gardasil, or HPV4. The three-vaccine series of either HPV2 or HPV4 is recommended to be given at 11 to 12 years of age but can be given as early as 9 years of age (CDC, 2010g). The vaccine is anticipated to prevent most cases of genital warts and cervical cancer. HPV4 has been licensed for use in males to prevent genital warts. Routine immunization has not been recommended, but it may be offered to adolescent males ages 9 to 26 years of age (CDC, 2010h). MENINGOCOCCAL VACCINE. Meningococcal disease may manifest as meningitis or as a deadly blood infection (meningococcemia). It is caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis, which is spread through direct contact or by air droplets. The incidence of meningococcal disease has decreased since 2000 but a peak in cases still is seen around the age of 18 years (CDC, 2011h). About 10% to 14% of infected persons die; of the remaining victims, about 11% to 19% suffer severe long-term consequences (CDC, 2009b). For these reasons, the meningococcal vaccine is recommended for all previously unvaccinated children at age 11 to 12 years with a booster dose at the age of 16 years (CDC, 2011h). These children should receive the meningococcal conjugated vaccine (MCV4). Certain high-risk groups may be vaccinated at 2 years of age (through age 10) with the meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4). Recall the Randall children, introduced at the beginning of the chapter. What immunizations would be appropriate for them to receive? Explain how you would administer the injections, and discuss any contraindications or precautions.BARRIERS TO IMMUNIZATION A fully immunized child is protected from the discomforts and complications of many infectious diseases. Disease prevention spares the family the emotional and financial burdens that serious illnesses can cause. Immunization programs prevent devastating epidemics in a community. Health care dollars not spent treating preventable diseases can be used for other urgent issues. Despite the numerous advantages of immunization and improved immunization rates, some communities in this country continue to have high numbers of undervaccinated or unvaccinated children (CDC Online Newsroom, 2010). Many factors lead to children not being fully immunized. Parental concerns about vaccine safety are a significant cause of inadequate immunization (CDC Online Newsroom, 2010). See Evidenced-Based Practice 9.1. Misconceptions of what constitutes a contraindication to vaccination and having more than one physician are major contributors to inadequate immunization status. The more children in a family, the less likely the children are to be fully vaccinated. The costs for vaccines can also deter families from obtaining immunizations. Parents may want to postpone some of the scheduled immunizations because they are concerned about the effects of multiple injections on their child. Postponing a portion of the immunizations puts the child at risk for contracting disease. Disrupting the optimal spacing of the immunizations can decrease the efficacy of vaccine, further putting the child at risk. OVERCOMING BARRIERS TO IMMUNIZATION The AAP recommends the use of a manufacturer-produced combination vaccine whenever it will reduce the number of injections at a visit (Freed, Cowan, Clark, Santoli, & Bradley, 2006). These combination vaccines have been studied and approved by the FDA. The nurse should never mix separate vaccines in the same syringe unless expressly permitted in the product insert for all vaccines involved. Examples of combination Children (VFC) program was implemented in 1994 (Ching, 2007). Prior to this program, free vaccines were available only through public health agencies. By providing free vaccines to low-income and uninsured families through their private physicians, immunization rates have improved (Ching, 2007). Additional information on the VFC program is available at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/ . Establishing a medical home for every child will alleviate many of the factors associated with lack of immunization. Parents who have a long-term, trusting relationship with a physician are more likely to have their concerns about vaccine safety discussed and removed. Missed opportunities for immunizations can be reduced by: EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 9.1 WHICH INTRAMUSCULAR VACCINATION TECHNIQUE RESULTS IN THE FEWEST ADVERSE REACTIONS IN CHILDREN? STUDY The incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases is decreasing, yet concern remains about adverse reactions following intramuscular immunizations. Also, inconsistencies in recommendations and practice exist. This study conducted a literature review of clinical trials and studies on intramuscular vaccine administration technique primarily in the pediatric population. Databases searched included the Cochrane Database of Systematic Review, Medline, and Embase. Prior to 2002, there are almost no published studies investigating the best technique for administering intramuscular injections, which has led to the wide variation in recommendations and techniques. Findings Existing evidence supports fewer reactions noted when the buttock versus the thigh is used as the site of injection and fewer reactions when the vaccine is administered intramuscularly versus subcutaneously. Longer needles and a 90-degree angle are associated with fewer reactions. Existing research did not provide evidence to support reactogenicity for aspiration, speed of injection, age/size of vaccine, experience of nurse, and pain on injection. Nursing ImplicationsParents often have concerns about adverse reactions associated with immunization. Current recommendations and techniques vary greatly internationally. Existing research supports the use of longer needles and a 90-degree angle, which is the technique supported by the World Health Organization. This technique decreases the potential of administering an intramuscular injection into the subcutaneous tissue along with decreasing the incidence of adverse reactions. The amount of muscle varies with the size of the infant and toddler, so the nurse must ensure that the needle chosen is long enough to place the medication intramuscularly. When appropriate, the buttocks as a site of injection needs to be considered. Adapted from Perousis-Harris, H. (2008). Vaccine injection technique and reactogenicity-Evidence for practice. Vaccine, 26(50), 6299-6304. Maintaining a centralized immunization record Verifying immunization status at every visit, not just health supervision visits Verifying the status of siblings accompanying the child to the appointment Providing parents with up-to-date information on vaccines geared to their concerns and needs Two excellent resources for vaccination recommendations in the United States are the CDC's Vaccines and Immunizations website ( http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/default.htm ) and the CDC Hotline (800-232-4636 or 800-CDC-INFO). Discuss potential barriers to the Randall children being fully immunized. As a nurse, how can you help overcome these barriers? Health Promotion Health promotion focuses on maintaining or enhancing the physical and mental health of children. The principal components of health promotion are identifying risk factors for a disease, facilitating lifestyle changes to eliminate or reduce those risk factors, and empowering children at the individual and community level to develop resources to optimize their health. The nurse implements health promotion through education and anticipatory guidance. Partnership development is the key strategy for success when implementing a health promotion activity. Identifying key stakeholders from the community allows problems to be solved and provides additional venues for disseminating information. Health promotion messages can be reinforced at schools, day care centers, community agencies, and churches. If families have difficulty getting to health care facilities, the community arenas may be the primary source of health promotion. Providing Anticipatory Guidance Anticipatory guidance is primary prevention. The nurse partners with the parents to create a \"road map\" to optimal health for the child. Healthy People 2020 provides a framework for determining health promotion goals. Bright Futures: Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents (Hagan et al., 2008) is another valuable resource. The \"skeleton\" of the guidance provided involves common childhood health problems. The nurse fleshes out that information using the results of risk assessments and screening tests, health concerns unique to the child, and the interests and concerns of the parents. Age-related anticipatory guidance information is provided in Chapters 3 through 7 . Provide appropriate anticipatory guidance for 3-year-old Maya and 9-month-old Evan. Promoting Oral Health Care Effective oral health practices are essential to the overall health of children and adolescents. Dental caries are the most common chronic illness seen in children, and 19.5% of children ages 2 to 5 years and about 23% of children ages 6 to 19 years have untreated dental caries (CDC, 2011i; Hagan et al., 2008; The Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, 2008). Poor oral health can have significant negative effects on systemic health. Children who suffer from untreated dental caries have an increased incidence of pain and infections and may have problems with eating and playing, difficulty at school, and sleep pattern disturbances (CDC, 2011i). Refer to Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Optimal oral health is not limited to the prevention and treatment of dental caries. It includes anticipatory guidance about nonnutritive sucking habits, injury prevention, oral cancer prevention, and tongue and lip piercing. Preventing and treating malocclusion can have a significant benefit for children. Comprehensive health care is not possible if oral health is not a priority in the health delivery system. Optimizing oral health can benefit the community as well as the individual child. There has been a 60% reduction in early childhood caries over the past 50 years since community water supplies were fluoridated at optimal levels (American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry [AAPD], 2008). The cost of pediatric oral health care could be reduced by 50% with the proper use of fluoride treatments coupled with other preventive measures (AAPD, 2008). These health care dollar savings will enhance community resources. Having a dental home enhances the likelihood that the child will obtain appropriate preventive and routine care. The AAPD adopted the policy of the dental home in 2001 (AAPD, 2010). It is modeled on the AAP medical home policy. The dental home provides the same benefits to the child as the medical home. Characteristics of a dental home are listed in Box 9.9 . The AAPD (2010) recommends that the dental home be established by the infant's first birthday. BOX 9.9 CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DENTAL HOME Preventive health program based on risk assessment Anticipatory guidance on oral health developmental issues, including dietary counseling related to oral health Plans for emergency dental trauma Anticipatory guidance on oral hygiene Comprehensive dental care (acute and preventative services) Referral to specialists for care not available at the dental home Adapted from American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry. (2010). Policy on the dental home. Retrieved April 17, 2011, from http://www.aapd.org/media/Policies_Guidelines/P_DentalHome.pdf Promoting Healthy Weight Childhood obesity is a growing problem. The number of overweight children has doubled since 1980; the rate for teens has tripled (CDC, 2008). The principal causes of this increase in obesity are unhealthy eating habits and decreased physical activity. Weight is best managed by balancing calories with a combination of diet and exercise (U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010). Nurses can have the maximum effect in promoting healthy weight in children by encouraging activities that address both healthy eating patterns and physical fitness. Children, parents, and communities are all targets for healthy weight promotion by nurses. Refer to Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . The focus of healthy weight promotion should be health centered, not weight centered. Linking success to numbers on a scale increases the possibility of developing eating disorders, nutritional deficiencies, and body hatred. Instead, emphasizing the benefits of health through an active lifestyle and nutritious eating creates a nurturing environment for the child. This allows the child to maintain his or her self-esteem. In addition, a health-centered orientation also allows the family to develop a lifestyle that incorporates its cultural food patterns and traditions. The nurse can stress the benefits of the mother's healthy nutritional habits on the fetus at prenatal visits. Parents who have a healthy eating pattern are likely to maintain and encourage those patterns in their children. The nurse provides parents with anticipatory guidance about age-related eating patterns during each health supervision visit. Parents with toddlers and preschoolers may need training in ways to cope with the child's growing autonomy while providing a variety of nutritious options. The nurse can begin directly advising the young child on healthy foods. Information and teaching modalities need to be age appropriate. With colorful posters and games, the nurse can teach the preschool child the difference between healthy and unhealthy food choices. As children enter school, group and peer-led activities can be very effective. The nurse must gear material toward the teen's growing autonomy in making self-care decisions. Before providing education to school-age and teenage children, it is important to obtain nutritional histories directly from them because increasingly they are eating meals away from the family table. As they spend more time away from their parents, they need to develop the ability to make nutritious choices. The goal is to help older children develop strategies for making healthy choices as part of their increasingly independent lifestyle. Detailed anticipatory guidance is provided in Teaching Guidelines 9.1 and in Chapters 3 through 7 . Teaching Guidelines 9.1 HEALTHY EATING Breakfast 1. Don't skip breakfast. You will not have enough energy to play well later in the day. Skipping breakfast can also lower your grades in school. 2. Avoid eating high-sugar foods at breakfast. They will make you sleepy during the day. 3. Start your breakfast with some fruit. A small glass of juice, berries on your cereal, or a banana is a good choice. 4. Protein is important at breakfast. Milk, either in a glass or on cereal, is a good source of protein; so is yogurt or peanut butter. Lunch 1. Check the quality of school-provided lunches. If they are high in fat or sugar, bring your lunch. Many schools publish their daily menus in advance. Check the newspaper or ask the school for a copy. 2. Add a variety of healthy alternatives to your lunches. a. Try different types of breads. Pitas, wraps, bagels, and taco shells can be a good change of pace in the sandwich routine. b. Freeze fruits before putting them in the lunch box. This will keep the lunch items cool and the fruit fresh tasting. Canned pineapple and grapes freeze well; so do bananas. c. Try alternatives to high-fat chips. Dried fruits, baked pretzels, and animal crackers are a few examples of tasty, healthy treats.d. Low-fat chocolate milk is more nutritious than prepackaged juice boxes, which have high sugar concentrations. Snacks 1. Limit snacks to after school and bedtime. Light snacks such as yogurt or fruit provide good hunger management. A very hungry child will tend to overeat at meals. 2. Children need to learn to eat only when they are hungry. Children often eat out of boredom. Discourage nonstop grazing by planning activities to occupy the child. 3. A small bedtime snack is OK if the child is hungry but should not become a habit. A light carbohydrate such as graham crackers or a piece of fruit works well. Dinner 1. Plan your menu a week ahead. Planning ahead reduces the likelihood of eating out or getting takeout food. Restaurant foods are more likely to be high in fats and carbohydrates. 2. Prepare homemade healthy versions of take-out favorites. Top prepared pizza crust with cooked chicken, vegetables, mushrooms, and cheese. Serve the pizza with a salad for a complete and healthy meal. \"Make your own tacos\" nights, using lean hamburger and low-fat sour cream, can be a lot of fun for children. 3. Don't turn dinner into a battle zone. Forcing children to eat foods they do not like will only deepen their dislike of them. Give them the healthy foods they do enjoy and eventually they will explore more options. 4. Lead by example. Children eventually adopt the eating patterns of their parents. If they see their parents eat vegetables, they will eventually try them. Promoting Healthy Activity Healthy physical activity can take many forms. During the preschool years, encourage parents to provide a wide variety of physical activities. This exposure to multiple types of exercise allows the child to find the one that is most enjoyable and increases the chances that he or she will maintain an active lifestyle. The focus should be on noncompetitive, fun activities. When the child enters school, the lure of television and computers can significantly diminish the amount of time spent in physical activity. Parents can encourage their children to stay physically active in several ways. They can limit the amount of time spent in sedentary activities and actively encourage the child to pursue any exercise that he or she enjoys. In addition to verbal encouragement, parents can promote exercise by participating in exercise with the child. A simple family walk can increase physical fitness while providing time for interaction between parent and child. Refer to Healthy People 2020. Teaching HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Teaching Guidelines 9.2HEALTHY ACTIVITY 1. Plan physical activities that your family can do as a group. 2. Write exercise activities on your family's daily schedule. 3. Look for activities that appeal to your child's interest, such as dance, team sports, or swimming. 4. Place value on noncompetitive as well as competitive activities. 5. Show your child you believe exercise is important. Exercise daily yourself. 6. Encourage the community to develop safe areas for spontaneous games and activities. Guidelines 9.2 gives additional suggestions for promoting physical activity. Promoting Personal Hygiene Handwashing is the first personal hygiene topic that needs to be introduced to children. Handwashing prevents disease by limiting a child's exposure to pathogens. The nurse can introduce the topic to preschool children using cartoons and games. Have the child sing \"Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star\" while washing his or her hands; this encourages adequate cleansing time. Use soap containers and towels with colorful characters to make the experience more fun. The school-age child can understand the concepts of germs and disease. Slogans such as \"Let's drown a germ\" can serve as a reminder of the importance of handwashing. The \"Glogerm\" program (n.d.) (see websites on is very effective in this age group. A nontoxic substance that shines under a black light is placed on the children's hands. The children can follow how germs travel from object to object. After washing their hands, the children can see if they did a good job (Glogerm program, n.d.). In response to peer pressure, teenagers are usually stringent about personal hygiene. Young teens may need guidance in dealing with pubescent body changes such as body odor, fungal infections such astinea pedis (athlete's foot), and acne. Promoting Safe Sun Exposure Skin cancer is a significant health problem in the United States. Blistering sunburns in children substantially increase the risk of melanoma and other skin cancers (National Cancer Institute, 2011). People with fair skin are at highest risk for skin cancers, but anyone can become sunburned and develop skin cancer. When teaching children about safe sun exposure, remind them that harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays can reflect off water, snow, sand, and concrete, so being in the shade or under an awning does not guarantee protection. Adequate sun protection requires using sunscreen, avoiding peak sun hours, and wearing proper clothing. Teaching Guidelines 9.3 gives more detailed instructions. Teaching Guidelines 9.3 SAFE SUN EXPOSURE Sunscreen 1. Use sunscreen lotions every day. Harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays penetrate clouds and cause damaging sunburns. 2. Use sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher. An adequate amount for an averagesized child is half an ounce. 3. Apply sunscreens half an hour before sun exposure. 4. Reapply every hour if the child is perspiring heavily. 5. Reapply immediately after swimming. 6. Infants 6 months old or younger should not use sunscreens. Take steps to avoid sun exposure completely with this age group. Clothing 1. Wear hats. The brim of the hat should be 4 inches or more and should shade the ears. Straw hats need to have a sun proof liner to be effective. Children introduced to hats as infants usually accept hats as part of the \"outfit.\" 2. Wear UV-blocking sunglasses. The eye is the second most common site for melanoma. 3. Wear long, loose, and lightweight clothing for maximum sun protection.Lifestyle 1. Avoid sun exposure between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. This is when UV rays are strongest. 2. Ask your physician if your medication will increase your sensitivity to UV rays. If the answer is yes, take extra precautions to reduce sun exposure. 3. Avoid tanning parlors. The devices emit UV rays just like the sun and can cause damage. 4. Check the UV index before going out. The higher the index, the more precautions you should take. UV index figures are available in newspaper, TV, and radio weather reports and on the Internet. 5. Advocate for safe-sun scheduling of recreational activities. Talk to others about scheduling outdoor activities before 10 a.m., after 4 p.m., or in the shade. 6. Consider UV-blocking plastic film for your house and car windows. Take Note! Give children the following physical reference when doing health promotion on safe sun exposure. Tell the child, \"Play outside only when your shadow is taller than you are.\" The child's shadow will be \"taller\" before 10 a.m. and after 2 p.m. The nurse can demonstrate this concept by placing a ruler on end and shining a bright light over it. As the nurse moves the light, the child will see the ruler's shadow lengthen. KEY CONCEPTS Health supervision for children is a dynamic process. Optimal wellness for the child can only occur if the nurse forms meaningful partnerships with the child, the family, and the community. These partnerships allow for free exchange of information and the establishment of mutually agreed upon goals. The medical home exists when there is a single primary care provider for the child. The medical home establishes a trusting long-term relationship with the child and family. This relationship leads to comprehensive, coordinated, and cost-effective care for the child. Children with chronic illnesses have a critical need for comprehensive and coordinated health supervision. Children with chronic illnesses require more frequent health supervision assessments. These children must have a medical home. The location of that medical home may be with a knowledgeable primary physician or at a multidisciplinary specialty facility. The location is determined by the child's needs and the family's preferences. The nurse incorporates frequent assessments of the many psychosocial stressors faced by families of children with chronic illnesses when establishing health care plans for them. Health supervision has three components: developmental surveillance and screening; injury and disease prevention; and health promotion. Developmental surveillance is an ongoing process requiring a skilled observer and interviewer. To be effective, the nurse must understand normal growth and development expectations and be proficient at developmental screening procedures and techniques. Caregivers are most likely to reveal risk factors or warning signs for developmental delay when the nurse has a long- term and trusting relationship with the family. Screening tests are part of injury and disease prevention. They are modalities that identify treatable disease in an early or asymptomatic state and allow for cure or lessening of the disease's injury. Vision and hearing screening are functional testing modalities that the nurse must be proficient in administering in order for the child's results to be valid. Immunizations are a cornerstone of pediatric disease prevention. The nurse increases the effectiveness of immunization by understanding the principles of immunization and applying them to the child's individual circumstances. Adhering to good immunization management practices, as outlined by the ACIP and the AAP, enhances the benefits and reduces the risks of immunization. Barriers to full immunization include fragmentation of health care, concerns about vaccine safety, financial constraints, and lack of knowledge. The nurse can be pivotal in ensuring that children and adolescents are fully immunized by serving as child educator and advocate. The principal components of health promotion are identifying risk factors for a disease, facilitating lifestyle changes to eliminate or reduce those risk factors, and empowering children at the individual and community level to develop resources to optimize their health. The nurse implements health promotion through education and anticipatory guidance. Anticipatory guidance provided involves common childhood health problems and seeks to prevent or improve the health ofchildren. The nurse uses the results of risk assessments and screening tests, health concerns unique to the child, and the interests and concerns of the parents to develop appropriate anticipatory guidance for each child and family.

Individualize elements of the health history depending on the age of the child. 3. Discuss important concepts related to health assessment in children. 4. Perform a health assessment using approaches that relate to the age and developmental stage of the child. 5. Describe the appropriate sequence of the physical examination in the context of the child's developmental stage. 6. Distinguish normal variations in the physical examination from differences that may indicate serious alterations in health status. 7. Determine the sexual maturity of females and males based on evaluation of the secondary sex characteristics. Elliot Simmons, 3 years old, is brought to the clinic for his annual examination. His mother states that he is very fearful and anxious about this visit.Assessment of the child's health status involves many components: the health interview and history; observation of the parent-child interaction; assessment of the child's emotional, physiologic, cognitive, and social development; and physical examination. The nurse's skills are vital to the success of the assessment process. The nurse must (Mandleco, 2005): Establish rapport and trust Demonstrate respect for the child and the parent or caregiver Communicate effectively by listening actively, demonstrating empathy, and providing feedback Observe systematically Obtain accurate data Validate and interpret data accurately The focus of the assessment process depends on the purpose of the visit and the needs of the child. Assessment is an ongoing process and is repeated to varying degrees at every encounter. The expert nurse is constantly evaluating the children in his or her care, whether directly or indirectly as part of conversation and play. Indeed, some of the subtlest developmental signs may express themselves only during relaxed and casual interaction with a child (Burns, Dunn, Brady, Starr, & Blosser, 2009). The nurse may observe gait while watching a child run down the hall, assess fine motor skills and social adaptation while the child is playing a board game, or observe balance and coordination while the child is bouncing a ball. Playful activities such as tickling a child can give the nurse feedback related to upper body strength when the child attempts to push the nurse's arms away. The nurse must also learn to perform a comprehensive and thorough examination of a child in an efficient manner. A thorough and thoughtful assessment of a child is the foundation upon which the nurse determines the needs of the child. A comprehensive history, a thorough examination, and developmental or cognitive testing as appropriate will provide practical information about the health of a child and guide the nurse's plan of care (developmental testing is covered in Chapter 9 ). The history and physical examination also provide a time for health education, teaching about expected growth and development, and discussing healthy lifestyle choices. The nurse uses critical thinking skills to analyze the data and establish priorities for nursing intervention or follow-up care (Burns et al., 2009). The health assessment may be documented using a number of formats such as a written narrative, a written flow sheet, or an electronic health record. The information should be easily retrievable and available to all members of the child's health care team.HEALTH HISTORY The health history provides the nurse with an overall picture of what the child has experienced, highlighting areas of concern such as recurrent upper respiratory infections or headaches. This not only helps the nurse to assess those specific areas more comprehensively but also provides the opportunity to ask focused questions and identify areas where education may be needed. The time used to obtain the health history also gives the nurse an opportunity to interact with the child in a nonthreatening manner while the child watches the interactions between the nurse and the primary caregiver (Burns et al., 2009; Miller, 2011). Preparing for the Health History Appropriate materials and a suitable environment are needed when performing a thorough health history. Take into account family roles and values. Consider the age and developmental stage of the child in order to approach the child appropriately and possibly involve him or her in the health history. Observe the child-parent interaction. Determine the extent of the health history that is needed in a given situation. Being well organized and staying flexible will help ensure success (Burns et al., 2009). Gathering Materials Before beginning, make sure the following are available: materials to record the history data (either a computer or chart paper and a pen), a private space with adequate lighting, chairs for adults and the nurse, and a bed or examination table for the child. The space should be safe for the child's developmental stage. Sit down for as much of the history taking as possible to demonstrate a relaxed and welcoming manner (Burns et al., 2009). Approaching the Parent or Caregiver Greet the parent or caregiver by name. While interviewing the parent, provide toys or books to occupy the child, allowing the parent to concentrate on the questions. Use open-ended questions and avoid making judgmental comments. Show respect by remaining approachable. Remember that the structure of the family and its roles and dynamics will affect how the family communicates and how they make decisions about health care. Demonstrate patience and help the parent stay on track when there are several children in the family. Throughout the interview, refer to the child by name and use the correct gender when referring to the child, demonstrating interest and competence. Take Note! Illness can cause great stress in families and individuals, so nurses must remember to protect themselves from potentially threatening behavior on the part of the family. Sit close to the door, and if uncomfortable with a family member, ask for assistance. The nurse may need to alert security personnel in certain cases (Griffin, 2003). Approaching the Child Show a professional demeanor while still being warm and friendly to the caregivers and child. A white examination coat or all-white uniform may be frightening to children, who may associate the uniform with painful experiences or find it too unfamiliar (Roohafza et al., 2009). The nurse can wear a variety of professional-looking outfits, whether colorful uniform tops, aprons, or smocks worn over white uniforms, or everyday clothing, depending on the setting of the nurse's practice. Make eye contact if possible and address the child by name. Use slow deliberate gestures rather than very quick or grand ones, which may be frightening to shy children. Some young children will warm up when given time to be invisible in the room, such as hiding behind a parent before they tentatively appear. Make physical contact with the child in a nonthreatening way at first. Briefly cuddling a newborn before returning him or her to the caregiver, laying a hand on the head or arm of toddlers and preschoolers, and warmly shaking the hand of older children and teens will convey a gentle demeanor. A joke, a puppet, a silly story, or even a simple magic trick may coax the child into warming up. Being at the same eye level as the child can also be more reassuring than standing over the child (Miller, 2011). This may require having extra seating for the nurse at the same level as the child and parent/caregiver. Aim to be seen as a trustworthy adult who is the child's partner in feeling better and staying healthy. Elicit the child's cooperation by allowing him or her control over the pace and order of the health history, or anything else that the child can control while still allowing the nurse to obtain the information needed. All of this establishes a personal relationship with the child and helps gain his or her cooperation (Miller, 2011). Communicating With the Child During the Health HistoryGive the child opportunities to actively participate in the health history and assessment process. For young children, such as toddlers and preschoolers, ask them to point to where it hurts and allow them to answer questions. Validation of the information by the parent/caregiver is essential because of the limited comprehension and language use of children at these ages. The school-aged child can answer more accurately because of his or her increased language skills and maturity level. Initially, address the child and obtain as much information from him or her as possible. School-aged children should be able to answer questions about interactions with friends and siblings and school and activities they enjoy or in which they are involved. Ask the parent/caregiver if any additional information or observations should be included. Adolescents may not feel comfortable addressing health issues, answering questions, or being examined in the presence of the parent/caregiver. The nurse must establish a trusting relationship with the adolescent to provide him or her with optimal health care. Ask adolescents whether they would be more comfortable answering questions alone in the examination area or whether they prefer their parents to be present. Either way, the parent/caregiver will have an opportunity to talk with the nurse after the health history and assessment are completed (Burns et al., 2009). Demonstrate an interest in the teen by asking questions about school, work, hobbies or activities, and friendships. Begin with these topics to make the teen feel comfortable in communicating with the nurse. Communicate honestly with the adolescent and explain the rationale for various aspects of the health history. Teens are very sensitive to nonverbal communication, so be very aware of gestures and expressions (Sass & Kaplan, 2011). Once a rapport has been established, move on to more emotionally charged questions that relate to sexuality, substance use, depression, and suicide. Always assure the teen that complete confidentiality will be maintained to the extent possible. Current state law will determine the types of information that may be withheld from parents. If the information that the nurse receives indicates that the teen may be in danger, then the nurse must inform the teen that the information will be shared with other providers and/or the parents (Burns et al., 2009). Take Note! Do not try to become the adolescent's peer. Remain in the role of the nurse while demonstrating respect and acceptance toward the teen. Clarify the meaning of jargon or slang that the teen uses, but do not use these words yourself; the teen will simply not accept the nurse as a peer. Observing the Parent-Child Interaction Observation of the parent-child interaction begins during the focused conversation of the health interview and continues throughout the physical examination. Explore the family dynamics, not only through questions but also by observing the family for behavioral clues. Does the parent make eye contact with the infant? Does the parent anticipate and respond to the infant's needs? Are the parents ineffective when dealing with a toddler's temper tantrum? The plan of care may need to be adjusted to teach appropriate responses to the infant's needs or toddler's behavior. Do the parents' comments increase the school-age child's sense of self-worth? Behavioral observations are crucial to proper assessment of the family's needs (Burns et al., 2009; Columbia University, 2011). Further observe the parent-child interaction to determine if the parent appears to be overwhelmed and if his or her behavior seems appropriate (Burns et al., 2009). Monitor the child's behavioral cues. Does the child look at the parent/caregiver before answering? Does the child seem relaxed and happy with the parent/caregiver, or is the child tense? The infant will appear calm and relaxed if his or her needs are generally met. Crying may occur when the baby is ill or frightened, but may also indicate discomfort with the parent or caregiver. Use a calm and comforting voice with the infant. Infants respond well to higher-pitched and soothing voices. When observing the relationship between the adolescent and the parent/caregiver, does the parent/caregiver allow the adolescent to speak, or does he or she frequently interrupt? Does the parent/caregiver contradict what is being said? Observe the body language of the adolescent: does the teen seem relaxed or tense? Since adolescents are between childhood and adulthood, they have unique needs. They are experiencing a time of multiple physical and emotional changes, many of which they cannot control. They need to know that the nurse is interested in what they have to say (Sass & Kaplan, 2011). The use of open-ended questions allows the adolescent to talk. \"Tell me about your....\" or \"What have you noticed about ... ?\" are comfortable phrases to use to elicit the information needed. Be aware of your own reactions to the adolescent's questions or behaviors, such as nonverbal and facial expressions. Talk with the adolescent using accurate language that is developmentally and age appropriate. Determining the Type of History Needed The purpose of the examination will determine how comprehensive the history must be. If the physician rarely sees the child or if the child is critically ill, a complete and detailed history is in order, no matter what the setting. The child who has received routine healthcare and presents with a mild illness may need only a problem-focused history. In critical situations, some of the history taking must be delayed until after the child's condition is stabilized. Evaluate the situation to determine the best timing and the extent of the history (Burns et al., 2009). Also, be sensitive to repetitive interviews in hospital situations, and collaborate with physicians or other members of the health care team to ensure that a family already under stress does not need to undergo prolonged or repetitive questioning. Remember Elliot, the 3-year-old being seen for his annual examination? When you enter the room, he is hiding behind his mother's legs. Considering his age and developmental level, how will you proceed with obtaining a health history? Performing a Health History The health interview is the foundation of an accurate health assessment. Careful conversation and interview with the child and/or the caregiver will provide important information about the child's health (Burns et al., 2009). Depending on the intent of the health assessment, many of the questions will be direct, and many will require the caregiver or child to answer simply \"yes\" or \"no.\" In other than emergency situations, though, asking open-ended questions offers an excellent opportunity to learn more about the patient's life. For example, \"Are you happy at school?\" may elicit a brief nod of the head, whereas \"Tell me what it's like on your school playground\" may result in a story about the child's friends, the kind of activities the child enjoys, any bullying that goes on, and so forth. These stories will provide the nurse with clues to the child's stage of physical, emotional, and moral development as well as his or her functional status (Burns et al., 2009; Columbia University, 2011). Establish a therapeutic relationship with the child and family. Without the trust that comes from this therapeutic relationship, the family may not reveal vital information due to fear, embarrassment, or mistrust (Bunik, Brayden, & Fox, 2011). Use therapeutic communication techniques such as active listening, open-ended questions, and eliminating barriers to communication. Establishing a \"medical home\" where ongoing health supervision occurs encourages trust through continuity of care and the family's continuing relationships with primary care providers (see Chapter 9 ). The structure of the health interview is determined by the nature of the visit. At an initial visit, large amounts of historical data are collected. Having the family fill out a questionnaire can save time, but a questionnaire is not a substitute for the health interview. The questionnaire may serve as a springboard to begin structured conversations between the family and the nurse. At subsequent visits the health interview can focus on the pertinent issues of that visit as well as any health issues that are being monitored. The health history includes demographics, chief complaint and history of present illness, past health history, review of systems, family health history, developmental history, functional history, and family composition, resources, and home environment. Take Note! Any questionnaires used in the health care setting should be written at a fifth-grade reading level and be in the primary language of the person completing them (The Joint Commission, 2010). Demographics Initially, questions should be simple and nonintrusive; once a rapport between the nurse and patient has started, sensitive questions can be asked. First obtain data such as the child's name, nickname, birth date, and gender. Determine the child's race or ethnicity, the language the child understands, and the language the child speaks. Record the child's address and home telephone number and the parent's or caregiver's work telephone number. Identify who the historian is (the child or the parent or caregiver), and note how reliable this source of information is considered to be. Do not assume that an adult with the child is the child's parent. Establish the relationship of the adult to the child, and ask who cares for the child if that person does not. Determine the composition of the household, including other children and other family members or other persons who live there. Chief Complaint and History of Present Illness Review of Systems Next, ask about the chief complaint (reason for the visit). The reason may not always be apparent to you. A question such as, \"What can I help you with today?\" or \"What did you notice in your baby/child that you wanted to have checked today?\" is very welcoming. The response from the child or parent may be a functional problem, a developmental concern, or a disease. Record the chief complaint in the child's or parent's own words. Next address the history related to the present illness. For each concern, determine its onset, duration, characteristics and course (location, signs, symptoms, exposures, and so on), previous episodes in patient or family, previous testing or therapies, what makes itbetter or worse, and what the concern means to the child and family. Inquire about any exposure to infectious agents. Past Health History Ask about the prenatal history (any problems with pregnancy), perinatal history (any problems with labor and delivery), past illnesses, or any other health or developmental problems. Document the child's prior history of illnesses (recurrent, chronic, or serious) and any accidents or injuries in the past. Inquire about any operations or hospitalizations the child has had. Document the child's diet. Note the child's allergies to foods, medications, animals, environmental or contact agents, or latex products. Determine the child's reaction to the allergen as well as its severity. Determine the child's immunization status (refer to Chapter 9 for further information on immunizations). Record any medications the child is taking, the dosage and schedule, as well as when the last dose was given. In preadolescent and adolescent females, determine menstrual history. Family Health History Obtaining information about the family's health is a key part of a health interview. Perform a three-generation family health history. This information may be documented in a genogram ( Fig. 10.1 ). Asking about the age and health status of mother, father, siblings, and other family members helps to identify trends and specific health issues (Burns et al., 2009; Hagan, Shaw, & Duncan, 2008). For example, do the grandparents have early-onset coronary artery disease? If they do, the child may benefit from additional health screening. Siblings may exhibit a genetic disease or carry a trait for the disease. This family health information helps to guide future health planning. Review of Systems Inquire about current or past history of problems related to: Growth and development Skin Head and neck Eyes and vision Ears and hearing Mouth, teeth, and throat Respiratory system and breasts Cardiovascular system FIGURE 10.1 Genogram. Gastrointestinal system Genitourinary system Musculoskeletal system Neurologic system Endocrine system Hematologic system Table 10.1 provides specific questions related to each of these systems. Developmental History Determine the age when landmarks in gross motor control were achieved, such as sitting, standing, walking, pedaling, and so on. Ask whether the child has attained fine motor skills such as grasping, releasing, pincer grasp, crayon or utensil use, and handwriting skills. Note the child's age and extent of language acquisition. Document speech problems such as a lisp or stuttering. The rate of developmental skill acquisition may vary from child to child, but the sequence of skill attainment should remain the same. Inquire about self-care ability (e.g., tying shoes, dressing, brushing teeth) and, in the younger child, how toilet training is progressing. Question the parents about the child's feeding skills, including how well the child drinks from a cup and uses utensils or whether the child has any special requirements. Inquire about social skills and comfort articles (e.g., blankets, stuffed animals). Note whether the child has a habit of thumb or finger sucking or using a pacifier. Document day care attendance and preschool or school adjustment and achievements. Functional History The functional history should contain information about the child's daily routine. Inquire about: Safety measures (e.g., car seats and their placement, use of seat belts, smoke detectors, bike helmets) Routine health care and dental care (including dates of dental care and what was done) Nutrition, including a 24-hour dietary recall or week-long food diary, use of supplements and vitamins, feeding pattern and satisfaction with diet, amount of \"junk food\" consumed, food likes and dislikes, and the parent's perception of the child's nutrition (refer to Chapters 3 through 7 for nutritional needs at various ages) Physical activity, recreation, play, and organized sports Television and computer habits Sleep behavior and bedtime Elimination patterns and any concerns Hearing or vision problems (dates of last screenings and results) Relationships with other family members and friends, coping and temperament, discipline strategies, attention or school behavior problems Religious involvement and other spiritual practices Use of adaptive and assistive devices such as eyeglasses or contact lenses, hearing aids, walker, braces, wheelchair Sexual practices (Burns et al., 2009; Hagan et al., 2008) Family Composition, Resources, and Home Environment Determine the marital status of the parents. Does the child live with the parents, a stepparent, or other family member? Is the child adopted or in foster care? Are the parents the primary caretakers for the child? If not, the primary caretaker should be included in the interview process if possible. Parents may not know some of the child's routines if the child spends much of the time being cared for by someone else. Working parents may learn about a health or behavior issue only after being alerted by the child's day care center or babysitter. It may be helpful to expand the family history to include the grandparents and their interaction with the child. Determine the employment status of the parents and their occupations, as this could affect the child's overall well-being; for example, the parents' work schedule may not allow them to spend much time with the child. Assess family income and financial resources, including health insurance and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly food stamps); Aid for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); or other governmental supplemental income. Major family changes can also affect how the parents and child interact, so evaluate for relationship problems or changes. Ask about the family's home and its age and environment. Is there a safe outdoor play area? If there is a pool, are safety features in place? Determine whether the home has electricity and an indoor water supply. Also determine whether the home has heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration. What pets does the family have? How are they housed? Are there infestations of insects or rodents in the home? Take Note! Homes or apartments built prior to 1978 may contain lead-based paint, and children who live there are at an increased risk for the development of lead poisoning (Hagan et al., 2008).PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The next step after the health history is the physical examination. It should focus on the chief complaint or any of the systems that engaged the nurse's critical thinking while obtaining the history. The examination will reflect the nurse's general practice style, the developmental stage and age of the child, the temperament of the child and caregiver, and the health status of the child. For example, a very ill child will not waste energy protesting the examination, so the nurse can move quickly in that situation. A healthy child, however, will express his or her normal developmental stage and will show varying degrees of resistance to the examination (Miller, 2011; Columbia University, 2011). Preparing for the Physical Examination When performing the physical examination, being prepared and organized ensures that the needed information will be obtained efficiently. The appropriate methods to use and ways to approach the child depend on the child's developmental stage. Gathering Materials The examination area should include an examination table or the child's hospital crib or bed. Appropriate lighting is necessary for adequate observation and inspection. Gather the equipment necessary for the examination such as clean gloves, stethoscope, thermometer, sphygmomanometer, tape measure, reflex hammer, pen-light, otoscope/ophthalmoscope, tongue depressor, and cotton ball. An infant or adult scale is needed, as well as a stadiometer for children capable of standing independently. Young children may be frightened by seeing a large amount of equipment, so take out one piece of equipment at a time. Some children can be very resistant to what they see as a threat or an invasion of their privacy, so it may help to have washable toys in the examination area to use as distractions during the assessment (Burns et al., 2009; Hagan et al., 2008; Miller, 2011). Children and their parents may be able to sense any frustration or anxiety on the part of the examiner, so display a confident and matter-of-fact approach. If the child is not cooperative, do not become discouraged; more time and explanation will usually do the trick. Regardless of the child's age, if the examination room is cold, the child will be uncomfortable and possibly less cooperative. Provide appropriate covers to ensure the child's comfort, or have the child remain dressed until the time of the examination (Miller, 2011). Approaching the Child Approach the child according to his or her developmental age and stage. Table 10.2 outlines a general approach to the physical examination in each broad developmental category. If several children are to be seen at the same time, begin with the child who will be most cooperative. If the other children do not see anything scary and realize that their sibling was examined without a problem, it sets the stage for better cooperation from the younger ones. NEWBORNS AND INFANTS If the infant is asleep, auscultate the heart, lungs, and abdomen first while the baby is quiet. Count the heart rate and respiratory rate before undressing the baby. Completely undress newborns and infants down to their diaper, removing it just at the end to examine the genitalia, anus, spine, and hips. It is best to examine the infant 1 to 2 hours before a feeding. Having the parent or care-giver hold the child during the examination can help to alleviate fears and anxieties ( Fig. 10.2 ). Allow the parent or caregiver to be a nurturer rather than assisting with painful procedures, unless there are no other choices available (Miller, 2011). Perform the assessment in a head-to-toe manner, leaving the most traumatic procedures, such as examination of the ears, nose, mouth, and throat, until last (Burns et al., 2009; Miller, 2011). Also delay eliciting the Moro reflex until the end of the examination, as the startling sensation may make the infant cry. Use firm, gentle handling while examining the infant. Make sure your hands and the stethoscope are warm. Perform the assessment as quickly and completely as possible. Use a soft and crooning voice, smile, and engage the infant in eye contact. In addition, use brightly colored objects to help distract him or her. If the baby is crying, a pacifier may be useful.FIGURE 10.2 The infant or toddler may feel more comfortable and secure being examined while sitting in the parent or caregiver's lap. Take Note! Many older infante demonstrate stranger anxiety as a normal part of development. If the parent is not holding the infant, make sure the parent is within the infant's view; this will increase the baby's comfort and cooperation (Bickley & Szilagyi, 2009; Burns et al., 2009; Miller, 2011). TODDLERS Toddlers usually prefer to remove their clothing one item at a time as needed for the examination. After one area is examined, the child may feel more comfortable replacing that item of clothing before removing another one (Bunik et al., 2011). An examination gown is usually not necessary before school age. Again, make certain the room temperature is comfortable. When the nurse enters the room, a child of this age is often sitting or standing by the parent. Incorporate play as appropriate during the health assessment. Remember your own facial expressions and tone. Use little touch at the beginning of the encounter with the child and the caregiver.FIGURE 10.3 The preschooler enjoys listening to her mother's heart first. Introduce the equipment to be used slowly, explaining briefly what is going to happen. Let the child touch and hold the equipment whenever possible, even taking a parent's temperature or putting the blood pressure cuff on a teddy bear ( Fig. 10.3 ). The toddler will prefer to sit on the caregiver's lap. When the toddler must be supine for the abdominal examination, sit in your chair knee-to-knee with the caregiver so the toddler may lie back on the caregiver's and your laps. Praise the child for being cooperative during the examination. \"You did such a good job holding still while I listened to your chest\" and similar phrases give positive feedback to the child. If the child is uncooperative, assess as thoroughly as possible and move on to the next area to be assessed. The caregiver may need to place an arm around the toddler's body to provide restraint for invasive procedures. Use short phrases to tell the toddler what you are going to do, rather than asking if it is OK (Miller, 2011; Nettina, 2010). Take Note! Toddlers are egocentric. Telling a toddler how well another child behaved probably will not be helpful in gaining the young child's cooperation.PRESCHOOLER The preschooler may fear body invasion and mutilation and will withdraw from any procedure or assessment that is viewed as intrusive. Otherwise, the sense of initiative often leads the preschooler to be cooperative. Use simple explanations to inform the child about each step of the examination, offering reassurance as appropriate. Allow him or her to \"help\" by holding the stethoscope or penlight. If choices are available, offer them to the child. Again, always compliment the child on his or her cooperation. Take Note! Preschoolers like to play games. To encourage deep breathing during lung auscultation, hold up a finger or a lit penlight and instruct the child to \"blow it out\" (Miller, 2011). SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN The school-age child's thinking is still very concrete, but he or she can be objective and realistic. Avoid using medical jargon and words that may have a double meaning to a young child. Instead of \"take your temperature,\" \"take your blood pressure,\" \"hit your \"Let's see how warm you are,\" \"I want to listen to you breathe,\" and other phrases that describe, in words the child can understand, what you are preparing to do. The school-age child may be very interested in how things work and why certain things need to be done and will be responsive to truthful and simple explanations. Instruments that are colorful or look like toys are very helpful throughout early childhood and the school-age period (Burns et al., 2009; Miller, 2011). Always respect a child's desire to avoid pain and insult. Allow children to wear their underpants under the examination gown to provide a sense of security until the genitalia need to be examined. Allow the child to replace his or her clothing as soon as possible. Privacy and respect for the child's feelings are important to children of this age (Bunik et al., 2011). Take Note! Describing and commenting on your findings during the physical examination is interesting to the school-age child, as children of this age like to learn about how the body works (Miller, 2011). ADOLESCENTS Provide privacy while the adolescent is undressing and putting on a gown. Demonstrate an attitude of respect. Perform the assessment in a head-to-toe manner, exposing only the area to be examined. Provide information about physical changes in a matter-of-fact way, such as, \"The hair on your legs is what is expected at this time.\" This provides information related to sensitive areas that the teen may be reluctant to ask about. It also provides the adolescent with information about the sexual development that is normal and expected. Allow opportunities for the teen to ask questions without the caregiver being present. Assure the adolescent that there are no \"dumb questions\" about the changes being experienced. Teenage girls should remove their bras so that the nurse can perform a breast examination, teach breast self-examination, and check for scoliosis. If the nurse is a male and the patient is an adolescent female, it is appropriate for a female staff member to be present during the breast and genital examination (Sass & Kaplan, 2011). Steps of the Physical Examination The physical examination of children, just as for adults, begins with a systematic inspection: checking color, warmth, characteristics, and texture visually and smelling for any odor. Palpation follows inspection to validate your observations. Percussion is a useful tool for determining the location, size, and density of organs or masses. Tapping with the reflex hammer elicits deep tendon reflexes. The stethoscope is used to auscultate the heart, lungs, and abdomen. Performing a Physical Examination A complete examination includes assessment of the general appearance, vital signs, body measurements, and pain, as well as examination of the head, neck, eyes, ears, nose, mouth and throat, skin, thorax and lungs, breasts, heart and peripheral perfusion, abdomen, genitalia and rectum, musculoskeletal system, and neurologic system. The nurse in most settings will not be assessing the breasts, genitalia, or eyes or ears in detail. Be aware of the role of the nurse in different settings and how the nurse can facilitate the assessment process. General Appearance Never discount first impressions. Does the child give an impression of being ill or well? What is the child's expression and energylevel? Note lethargy, listlessness, excessive activity, or inappropriate attention span for the child's age. Observe the child's state of alertness and whether he or she is responding appropriately to the stress of the situation. Note the child's posture and positioning: The newborn's posture is flexed, with arms and legs tucked in. The older infant should have improving head and then trunk control. The toddler demonstrates lordosis (swayback) and bowlegs, with a relatively large head and protuberant belly. The preschooler is more slender and upright in appearance. The school-age child and adolescent should demonstrate an upright, straight, and well-balanced posture. Note whether the child's development appears appropriate. Observing the child initially may yield a wealth of information about the child's development. Is the child active, moving about the room? Does the child's speech seem appropriate for his or her age? Notice whether the family interacts appropriately with one another and the child. Does the child appear clean and well cared for? Does the child appear well nourished or small for age or obese? Note the scent of tobacco smoke or alcohol on family members. Notice if the baby bottle or pacifier is nearby and whether the child has a toy or transitional object. Assess whether the siblings appear equally well cared for. Observe for tension in the room between adults or children/adolescents. This initial quick assessment of general appearance will serve the nurse well if it is objective; delay interpretation of this assessment until additional data are gathered. Measurement of Vital Signs Measure, document, and interpret the vital signs of children using age-appropriate equipment and approaches. The child's age and size, as well as knowledge of underlying health conditions, will affect analysis of the vital signs. Vital signs are the temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. These measurements fluctuate normally in children; assessing vital signs while the child is quiet is most appropriate. Comforting an infant or distracting a young child may be necessary while obtaining vital signs. If the child is crying or otherwise active during the assessment, document that fact. Many acute care settings require continuous measurement of vital signs using specific monitoring equipment. Also assess the child's pain level when assessing the vital signs. TEMPERATURE Temperature is measured as it is in adults. Thermometers are available in glass, electronic, and digital types. Use the same type of equipment consistently to allow reliable comparisons to be made and to permit tracking of temperatures during the course of illness (Bowden & Greenberg, 2008). No matter which type of thermometer is used, ensure accuracy by carefully following the manufacturer's instructions. The routes for taking the child's temperature are tympanic, temporal, oral, axillary, and rectal. Numerous research studies have been undertaken to determine the best method for temperature assessment in children. Take the child's temperature using the least invasive method that is best accepted by the child, parent, and physician. Take Note! Glass thermometers are not recommended for use due to the mercury they contain (Bowden & Greenberg, 200b). Choosing a method of measuring temperature depends on what is available at the facility and the child's age and physical condition. Tympanic temperature reflects the pulmonary artery temperature and can be measured with the tympanic thermometer within seconds. The accuracy of a tympanic temperature reading depends on the user's technique and can be safely and effectively used in children 3 months of age and older (Bowden & Greenberg, 2008). Refer to Nursing Procedure 10.1. NURSING PROCEDURE 10.1 Measuring Tympanic Temperature 1. Note age of child. If younger than 3 years, pull the earlobe back and down. 2. Insert the tympanic thermometer gently into the ear canal with the infrared sensor beam directed toward the center of the tympanic membrane rather than the sides of the ear canal. 3. Push the button to take the temperature and hold until a reading is obtained. The length of time required for the temperature to register varies per manufacturer but is only a few seconds at most.Temporal scanning uses infrared scanning on the skin over the temporal artery combined with a mathematical computation to determine the child's arterial temperature. Temporal artery thermometry may be used with any age child except infants younger than 90 days of age who are ill or have a fever (Asher & Northington, 2008). Measure temperature on the exposed side of the head (not the side that has been lying on a pillow or covered by a hat). Slide the sensor tip externally in a horizontal line across the child's forehead, midway between the eyebrows and hairline and ending at the temporal artery ( Fig. 10.4 ). Hold it there until the device registers the temperature reading, which usually requires 1 second. Accuracy may be affected by excessive sweating (Exergen Corporation, 2007). Oral temperature is highly reliable if the child can cooperate. By 5 years of age, the child can hold an electronic oral thermometer in the mouth well enough to obtain a reading. Place the probe under the tongue and ensure the child's mouth remains closed until the device registers the temperature. Oral intake, oxygen administration, and nebulized medications or treatments may affect oral temperature. The axillary method may be used for children who are uncooperative, neurologically impaired, or immunosuppressed or have injuries or have had surgery to the oral cavity (Bowden & Greenberg, 2008). Place the tip of the electronic or digital thermometer in the axilla to obtain the reading. Make sure the tip is indeed in the axilla and not just between the arm and the child's side. Hold the thermometer parallel rather than perpendicular to the child's side to obtain the most accurate reading. Keep the child's arm pressed down to the side until the thermometer registers, which will be as little as 10 seconds with certain electronic models but 2 or 3 minutes with digital models commonly used at home. Though long considered to reflect core temperature, the rectal route is invasive, not well accepted by children or parents, and probably unnecessary with the modern alternative methods now available. To take the rectal temperature, position the young infant supine with legs flexed. The older infant or child should be prone or side-lying. Small children may lie across the parent's lap for additional comfort. Apply a water-soluble jelly to the covered probe, insert the thermometer past the anal sphincter no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm), and hold it there until the temperature registers (as little as 15 seconds with certain electronic models but longer with digital models).FIGURE 10.4 Temporal artery thermometers are noninvasive and well tolerated by young children. For an accurate reading, move hair to expose forehead and hairline. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 10.1 PACIFIER THERMOMETERS STUDY Nurses and parents are concerned with being able to measure temperature accurately with the least invasive method possible. Research trials on pacifier thermometry in the past have been limited. The researchers utilized a convenience sample of children aged 7 days to 24 months in a prospective, cross-sectional study. Subjects were limited to those without gastrointestinal illness or contraindication to either the sublingual or rectal method of temperature measurement. Each child underwent pacifier temperature measurement with recordings at 3 and 6 minutes. The result was adjusted upward 0.5\u00b0F as recommended by the thermometer manufacturer. Rectal temperature was then taken. Findings Analysis of the pairs of recorded temperatures for each subject revealed close agreement between the rectal temperature and the adjusted 6-minute pacifier temperatures. Differences between the two were not statistically significant. Variations between measurements are certain to occur when temperature is measured at different sites, so the researcher does not recommend replacing rectal thermometers with pacifier thermometers when a rectal temperature is indicated. Rather, it is the researcher's recommendation to use the pacifier thermometer as a screening tool. Nursing Implications Pacifier thermometers are an acceptable tool for temperature screening in children 7 days to 24 months of age. Nurses must use the thermometer properly, as well as instruct parents in its appropriate use if it is to be used at home. Consistent use of one particular method is important for tracking trends in temperature management over time. The mathematical upward adjustment of 0.5\u00b0F must be included in the reporting of temperatures measured by pacifier thermometry. Adapted from Braun, C. A. (2006). Accuracy of pacifier thermometers in young children. Pediatric Nursing, 32(5), 413-418. A newer method of temperature measurement is with the pacifier thermometer. See Evidence-Based Practice 10.1. Take Note! Avoid the rectal route of temperature measurement in the immunouppressed child as well as the child who has diarrhea, a bleeding disorder, or a history of rectal surgery (Asher & Northington, 2008). PULSE Assess the heart rate while the child is resting or sleeping. The heart rate in infants is much faster than in adults. It also varies in infantsand children who are anxious, fearful, or crying. As the child grows, the heart rate slows and the range of normal values narrows. Table 10.3 lists heart rate ranges according to the child's age. The radial pulse is difficult to palpate accurately in children younger than 2 years of age because the blood vessels lie close to the skin surface and are easily obliterated (Bickley & Szilagyi, 2009). For children younger than 10 years of age, auscultate the apical pulse with the stethoscope for a full minute (Jarvis, 2008). In older children, palpate the radial pulse for a full minute ( Fig. 10.5 ). Note any irregularities in strength or rhythm. Finally, document the method used to obtain pulse measurement as well as any activity of the child during the assessment and any action taken. Take Note! In the infant and young child, the heart rate is often quite elevated due to fear or anxiety when the stethoscope is placed on the chest initially. For an accurate heart rate, wait several seconds until the rate slows, and then count for 1 full minute. RESPIRATORY RATE Assess respirations when the child is resting or sitting quietly, since respiratory rate often changes when infants or young children cry, feed, or become more active. They also tend to breathe faster when they are anxious or scared. The most accurate respiratory rate is obtained before disturbing the infant or child (Bowden & Greenberg, 2008). This can often be done easily when the parent/caregiver is holding the child before any clothing is removed. Count the respiratory rate for a full minute to ensure accuracy. Infants' respirations are primarily diaphragmatic, so count the abdominal movements. After 1 year of age, count the thoracic movements. Table 10.3 lists ranges of respiratory rate according to the child's age. Document the rate, activity of the child, any deviations from normal, and any action taken. FIGURE 10.5 Assessing the radial pulse of a young child. Take Note! Infants normally display an uneven or irregular breathing pattern, with short pauses between some breaths. This may be accentuated when they are ill (Bickley & Szilagyi, 2009).MEASURING OXYGEN SATURATION Since the incidence of respiratory dysfunction is high in ill children, pulse oximetry is often routinely included in the vital signs assessment. This method is reliable and noninvasive. Pulse oximetry determines the oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) in blood by using a sensor that measures the absorption of light waves as they pass through highly perfused areas of the body. The pulse rate on the oximeter should coincide with the apical pulse rate to ensure that the oxygen saturation reading is accurate. Nursing Procedure 10.2 details how to use the pulse oximeter. Identify whether pulse oximetry monitoring will be continuous or intermittent (as with vital signs). A few guidelines to follow when using pulse oximetry are as follows: The probe may be placed on the finger, toe, ear, or foot. Avoid placing the probe on the same extremity with a blood pressure cuff or an intravenous or other type of line. Use the physician's orders or health care agency guidelines to set parameters for high and low pulse rate as well as high and low oxygen saturation. Never turn off the alarm settings. Ensure that the probe is not applied too tightly, as this will prevent venous flow and cause inaccurate readings. Potential sources of errors in pulse oximeter readings include abnormal hemoglobin value, hypotension, hypothermia, ambient light interference, motion artifact, and skin breakdown. Falsely low readings may be associated with a nonsecure connection (movement of child's foot or hand), cold extremities/hypothermia, and hypovolemia. Falsely high readings may be associated with carbon monoxide poisoning and severe anemia (DeMeulenaere, 2007). BLOOD PRESSURE The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommends that children older than 3 years of age have their blood pressure measured at least once during every health care episode (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 2005). Children younger than 3 years old should have blood pressure measured if they have one of the following risk factors: History of prematurity, very low birthweight, or other neonatal intensive care complication Congenital heart disease Recurrent urinary tract infections, hematuria, proteinuria, known renal disease or urologic malformations, family history of congenital renal disease Malignancy, bone marrow transplant, or solid organ transplant Treatment with medications that raise blood pressure Systemic illnesses associated with hypertension such as neurofibromatosis and tuberous sclerosis Increased intracranial pressure (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 2005) In the hospital or outpatient setting when a child is ill or undergoing surgery or a procedure, the frequency of blood pressure measurement will depend on the child's physical status. Measurement of blood pressure can be frightening to a young child, so include an age-appropriate explanation and perform the procedure after obtaining the pulse rate and respirations ( Fig. 10.6 ). Accuracy of blood pressure measurement depends on the cuff size, as well as the operator's skill and accurate calibration of an electronic device. The NHLBI recommends that the cuff bladder width be at least 40% of the circumference of the upper arm at its midpoint (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 2005). The cuff bladder length should cover 80% to 100% of the circumference of the upper arm. Various pediatric and infant cuffs are available, as well as larger thigh cuffs that may be used on an arm in an obese adolescent. NURSING PROCEDURE 10.2 Pulse Oximetry Monitoring 1. Explain the procedure to the child and family (use a penlight to show how the sensor \"looks through the skin\"). 2. Attach the probe to the child and connect to the monitor. 3. Set the parameters for the alarm if monitoring pulse oximetry continuously. 4. Observe and record pulse rate and oxygen saturation. 5. Record the activity level of the child and the percentage of oxygen in use. 6. Check skin condition and rotate sensor position every few hours. Types of probesa. Infant continuous b. Finger continuous c. Finger intermittent Adapted from Nellcor Puritan Bennett, Inc. (2011). Clinician's guide to Nellcor sensors. Retrieved March 24, 2011, from http://www.nellcor.com/_Catalog/PDF/Product/CliniciansSensorGuide.pdf Take Note! Using an accurate cuff size is important: a wider cuff yields a lower reading and a narrower cuff yields a higher reading. Measure blood pressure in the upper arm, lower arm, thigh, or calf/ankle. The size of the cuff should match the extremity used. The measurement should be taken in the same limb, at the same place, and in the same position with each subsequent measurement to ensure consistency in tracking the blood pressure. To measure blood pressure using the upper arm, place the limb at the level of the heart, place the cuff around the upper arm, and auscultate at the brachial artery. When obtaining blood pressure in the lower arm, again, position the limb at the level of the heart, place the cuff above the wrist, and auscultate the radial artery. For measurement in the thigh, place the cuff above the knee and auscultate the popliteal artery. To obtain blood pressure on the calf or ankle, place the cuff above the malleolus or at the midcalf and auscultate the posteriortibial or dorsal pedal artery. Figure 10.7 shows appropriate cuff placement and auscultation points for the various sites.FIGURE 10.6 Allowing children to handle the equipment gives them some control over the situation. The NHLBI recommends auscultation as the preferred method of obtaining blood pressure readings in children (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 2005) ( Fig. 10.8 ). Systolic pressure in children is read at the moment the first Korotkoff sound is heard as the manometer pressure is lowered. The point at which the sound disappears is the diastolic pressure. The systolic blood pressure sometimes can be heard to a measurement of zero, so document the reading as systolic pressure over \"P\" for pulse. FIGURE 10.7 Various positions of cuff placement and auscultation area for obtaining blood pressure. ( A ) Upper arm. ( B ) Thigh. ( D ) Calf/ankle.FIGURE 10.8 Auscultation is the preferred method for measuring blood pressure in children. Due to the small arm vessels in infants and young children, it may be very difficult to hear the Korotkoff sounds by auscultation (Jarvis, 2008). Alternative methods for obtaining blood pressure measurements in children include the use of Doppler or oscillometric (Dinamap) devices. The Doppler ultrasound method uses high-frequency sound waves that bounce off body parts to obtain blood pressure. Apply the gel to the Doppler end and listen with the Doppler device where Korotkoff sounds would normally be auscultated. With either the Doppler method or auscultation, inflate the cuff 20 mm Hg past the point where the distal pulse disappears. Oscillometric equipment measures the mean arterial pulse and then calculates the systolic and diastolic readings. The accuracy of this method depends heavily on ongoing validation and calibration. Also, the cuff inflates to a preset value often far higher than the infant or child's blood pressure, resulting in a tight, uncomfortable cuff being in place for a longer period of time. Take Note! If the oscillometric device yields a blood pressure greater than the 90th percentile for gender and height, repeat the reading using auscultation. In children older than 1 year, the systolic pressure in the thigh tends to be 10 to 40 mm Hg higher than in the arm; the diastolic pressure remains the same. Refer to Appendix C for the NHLBI blood pressure levels based on gender and height. Systolic blood pressure increases if the child is crying or anxious, so measure the blood pressure with the child quiet and relaxed. If the reading is lower in the leg than in the arm, always consider coarctation of the aorta or interference with circulation to the lower extremities. Also pay attention to the pulse pressure (the difference between the systolic and diastolic readings): unusually wide (more than 50 mm Hg) or narrow (less than 10 mm Hg) pulse pressure readings suggest a congenital heart defect (Burns et al., 2009). Pain Assessment Pain is considered to be the \"fifth vital sign\" (Jarvis, 2008). Use the FLACC pain scale to measure pain in children who are too young to verbally or conceptually quantify their pain, or when there is a language barrier (Manworren & Hynan, 2003). The FLACC pain scale consists of a possible 10 points, with 0, 1, or 2 points given for each of five clinical signs (see Table 14.7 in Chapter 14 ). Children who are older and can express that pain is worsening or improving should use the Pain Faces Scale (see Fig. 14.3 in Chapter 14 ). Explain that each face represents a person who is happy or sad, depending on how much or how little pain he has: 0 is for a person who is \"very happy because he doesn't hurt at all\"; 1 means \"it hurts just a little bit\"; 2, \"it hurts a little more\"; 3, \"it hurts even more\"; 4, \"it hurts a whole lot\"; and 5, \"it hurts as much as you can imagine\u2014but you don't have to be crying to feel this bad.\" Then ask the child to point to the face that best describes the amount of pain being felt (Wong & Baker, 1988). For additional information related to pain assessment, refer to Chapter 14 . Body MeasurementsAppropriate growth in children is usually an indicator of good health. A child who is not growing well may be in poor health, have inappropriate or inadequate dietary intake, or have a chronic disease (Bickley & Szilagyi, 2009). Accurate assessment of growth is a critical skill for the pediatric nurse. Determine the child's height or length, weight, and weight for length or body mass index (BMI). Measure the head circumference for healthy children younger than age 3. Plot these measurements on a graph so they can be compared with earlier measurements and those of the child's peers. Additional anthropometric measurements used in children may include the chest circumference, mid-upper arm circumference, and skin-fold measurement at the triceps, abdomen, or subscapular regions, but these are not performed routinely and are usually used only when a nutritionist consultation is necessary. The growth chart is a screening tool for nutritional problems as well as a useful screen for chronic illness. Record each measurement in ink with a small dot at the correct location for the child's age and the date of the measurement written above it. Then use a plastic straightedge to connect the previous measurement to the most current one. Children grow at variable rates; in infancy and prepuberty, the growth velocity is normally more rapid. The growth chart allows the nurse to compare the child to other children of the same age and gender while allowing for normal genetic variation. When measurements fall close to the same percentiles over time, growth is normal for that child. Children whose measurements fall within the 5th and 95th percentiles are generally considered within the normal growth range (Rebeshi & Brown, 2007). Sudden or sustained changes in percentile may indicate a chronic disorder, emotional difficulty, or nutritional intake problem (Bickley & Szilagyi, 2009). These findings require further assessment of the physical status of the child as well as other types of evaluations such as dietary intake or serum laboratory measurements. Appendix A provides growth charts for boys and girls, ages birth to 36 months and 2 to 20 years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2002) recommends the use of these growth charts with all children, though special growth charts are also available for children with specific conditions. Look for a trend over time of healthy growth that is neither too fast nor too slow. Take Note! The most valid and reliable growth charts are those supplied by epidemiologists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. LENGTH OR HEIGHT Calculate the length of the infant and toddler in a lying position until the age of 24 months. Use a measuring board ( Fig. 10.9 ) or a cloth or paper measuring tape. Stretch out the legs to get a full extension of the body. Marking the examination paper at the child's head and extended foot is an option. Make sure that the growth chart where the measurement is plotted is marked for length and not height, as the two measurements differ. Document the length in centimeters and inches. FIGURE 10.9 The recumbent measuring board is the most accurate method for obtaining a length measurement in infants and very young children.Once the child can cooperate and stand independently, begin measuring the standing height. Using a stadiometer is best ( Fig. 10.10 ), but a cloth or paper tape can be used. Ask the child to remove his or her shoes and check that the back, shoulders, buttocks, and heels are against the wall, with the pelvis tucked as much as possible to correct for lordosis. The chin should be parallel to the floor. Plot this measurement on a growth chart marked for height rather than length. Record the height in centimeters as well as feet and inches. FIGURE 10.10 Standing height is most accurately measured with the stadiometer. Take Note! Cloth and paper measuring tapes may stretch over time. Periodically replace or recalibrate all measuring tools. WEIGHT Measure weight on a scale that is calibrated between every measurement. Just before placing the child on the electronic scale, press the \"zero\" or \"tare\" button and make sure the reading is 0. Calibrate the balance-type scale by setting the weight at zero, observing the beam balance, and making adjustments as necessary. Infants and toddlers should be weighed on a platform-type electronic or balance scale, with an examination paper placed between the child and the scale surface. Calibrate the scale with the examination paper in place. Remove the infant's diaper immediately before placing him or her on the scale. Toddlers may sit on the scale with the nurse or caregiver nearby to avoid falls ( Fig. 10.11 ). Weigh older children and adolescents on a standing scale ( Fig. 10.12 ). They may keep their underpants on and wear a lightweight examination gown. An alternate method for obtaining weight, though much less accurate, is to weigh the caregiver initially and then weigh the caregiver holding the child. The difference between the two weights is the child's weight. Regardless of the method used, weigh the infant to the nearest 10 g (or half-ounce) and the toddler and older child to the nearest 100 g (or quarter-pound). Record the weight in kilograms and in pounds. WEIGHT FOR LENGTH For children between the ages of newborn and 36 months, plot weight on the growth chart in comparison to the child's length. Thisallows the nurse to determine whether the child is a healthy weight for how long he or she is. Children placing less than the 5th percentile on the weight-for-length chart are considered underweight. Those placing greater than the 95th percentile are considered to be overweight. BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) With the recent increase in obesity in children, BMI is becoming an important measurement. BMI is a measure of body fat and is determined by comparing the child's height and weight (CDC, 2002). Calculate the BMI using the child's weight and height by either the English or metric method. Box 10.1 provides BMI calculation formulas. BMI is included on the charts for children ages 2 to 20 years. Plot the BMI on the growth chart according to the child's age. A child whose BMI for age plots at less than the 5th percentile is considered to be underweight. BMI between the 85th and 95th percentiles indicates risk for overweight. BMI greater than the 95th percentile indicates the child is overweight. FIGURE 10.11 A nurse or caregiver should remain nearby while weighing the infant or toddler.FIGURE 10.12 Children who can stand independently can be weighed on a regular standing balance scale. BOX 10.1 CALCULATION OF BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) The growth chart can indicate when a child is not growing adequately and can also be used to predict the development of overweight and obesity (CDC, 2002). Refer to Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . FIGURE 10.13 Measure occipitofrontal head circumference at the largest point. HEAD CIRCUMFERENCE Measure head circumference at well-child visits and upon hospital admission until the third birthday. Then measure it at the annual well-child visit until 6 years old if there are problems such as microcephaly or macrocephaly present at age 3. Measure the largest point across the skull, not including the ears, with a nonstretching cloth or paper tape. Begin at the forehead just above the eyebrows and bring the tape around the head in a taut circle just above the occipital prominence at the back of the head ( Fig. 10.13 ). Plot this measurement in relation to the child's age on the appropriate standardized growth chart (usual growth charts include head circumference only up to age 3 years). Monitoring Equipment Sometimes children in acute care settings require continuous monitoring of vital signs. This monitoring could be via an apnea monitor or a cardiopulmonary monitor. The apnea monitor measures abnormal or irregular breathing in infants. The cardiopulmonary monitor generally measures heart rate and respiratory rate. Additional equipment on this monitor also allows for blood pressure andtemperature monitoring. Set high and low alarm limits according to the health care facility's policies. Figure 10.14 indicates the placement of electrodes for the apnea and cardiopulmonary monitors. Assess the skin where the electrodes are placed to ensure there is no skin breakdown. If the alarm sounds, immediately check the child to ensure the leads are not disconnected or the child is not in distress. Skin The skin is the body's largest organ and reveals information about a child's nutrition, respiratory, cardiac, endocrine, and hydration status at a glance. A careful skin examination provides an invaluable understanding of a child's health (Jarvis, 2008). FIGURE 10.14 Placement of cardiac apnea monitor leads: white on the right upper chest, black on the left upper chest, green or red on the abdomen (not over bone). INSPECTION Inspect the color of the skin. The color should be appropriate to the child's racial or ethnic background, with the nail beds, conjunctivae, soles of the feet, and palms of the hands appearing pink. Normal variations include the following: Blueness of the hands and feet, known as acrocyanosis , is normal in babies up to several days of age and results from an immature circulatory system completing the switch from fetal to extrauterine life (see Fig. 3.3 A in Chapter 3 ). Cooling or warming the newborn and young infant may produce a vasomotor response that causes a mottling of the skin over the trunk and extremities (see Fig. 3.3 B). Babies of darkly pigmented Native American, African, and Asian parents will be paler than their parents for many months until the melanocytes in the epidermis begin production. Dark-skinned infants commonly have hyperpigmented areolas, genitals, and lineanigra. Other variations related to skin color are discussed in Box 10.2. Inspect the skin for the presence of lanugo . All infants display some degree of lanugo (soft, downy hair on the body, particularly the face and back). Lanugo is more abundant in infants of Hispanic descent and in premature infants and recedes over the first few weeks of life. Inspect the entire body for nevi and vascular and other lesions. Note their location, size, distribution, characteristics, and color. Pigmented nevi (also termed birthmarks) are indicated by a darker patch of skin and generally do not fade over time. Note the presence of hyperpigmented nevi (formerly called Mongolian spots), which appear as blue or gray, variably and irregularly shaped macules ( Fig. 10.15 ). These are a common finding in dark-skinned infants. These nevi fade over months to years as the child's skin pigment darkens. Do not mistake hyperpigmented nevi for bruises. Inspect the skin for vascular lesions. Table 10.4 describes vascular lesions and their significance. BOX 10.2 VARIATIONS IN SKIN COLOR AND THEIR CAUSES Pallor (defined as decreased pinkness in light-skinned patients, ashy-gray in dark-skinned) is caused by anemia, shock, fever, or syncope. Peripheral cyanosis (blue discoloration) occurs in nails, soles, and palms and may be caused by anxiety or cold; also associated with central cyanosis. Central cyanosis (blueness of the lips, tongue, oral mucosa, trunk) is caused by hypoxia or circulatory collapse. Overall yellow color (jaundice ) may be physiologic in the newborn or related to liver or hematopoietic disease in any age child. Yellowing of nose, palms, and soles may result from excess intake of yellow vegetables. Redness of the skin results from blushing, exposure to cold, hyperthermia, inflammation (localized), or alcohol ingestion. Lack of color in skin, hair, and eyes is related to albinism. Adapted from Bickley, L., & Szilagyi, P. G. (2009). Bates'guide to physical examination and history taking (10th ed.). Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; and Jarvis, C. (2008). Physical examination and health assessment (5th ed.). St. Louis: Saunders. Rashes are common in children and are often associated with communicable diseases. Describe the rash in detail, noting types of lesions, distribution, drying, scabbing, scaling, and any drainage. The newborn and young infant may display milia (small white papules) on the forehead, chin, nose, and cheeks. These recede spontaneously. In adolescents the skin examination may reveal open or closed comedones (pimples or blackheads) across the face, chest, and back. Teens may sport tattoos, brandings, or various body piercings; inspect these areas for signs of infection such as erythema or drainage ( Fig. 10.16 ). FIGURE 10.15 Transient hyperpigmentation most often occurs in darker-skinned infants. FIGURE 10.16 Adolescent with multiple piercings.Document the presence of any lacerations, abrasions, or burns. Note the distribution of the injury and whether it seems consistent with the mechanism described in the health history. Be alert to the possibility of child abuse if the type or number of burns, lacerations, or bruises seems unusual for the situation. Take Note! Petechiae or ecchymosis may be found over areas traumatized by the birth process; these may take a few weeks to resolve. Certain cultures use \"cupping\" or \"coining\" when a child is ill, and these practices may yield bruises or mild burns (International Cupping Therapy Association, 2006). PALPATION Palpate the skin for temperature, moisture, texture, turgor, and edema. Use the back of your hand to assess the skin's temperature, comparing the right side of the body to the left and the upper body to the lower. The skin should feel uniformly warm. Cool extremities are associated with environmentally cool temperatures as well as impending circulatory collapse and shock. Warm skin may be associated with fever or sunburn, or locally a burn or infectious process. The skin should feel fairly dry, occasionally moister in the creases. Dry, flaking skin may occur in the young infant, particularly if born postmaturely. Overall skin dryness in the well-hydrated child may occur with excess sun exposure, poor nutrition, or overbathing. Moist skin occurs with perspiration, fever resolution, and shock. The infant's and young child's skin is very soft ordinarily. Older children should continue to have a smooth and even skin texture. The preadolescent and adolescent may have oily-feeling skin on the face, shoulders, or back. Assess skin turgor by elevating the skin on the abdomen in the infant or on the back of the hand in the older child or teen. The \"pinched-up\" skin should quickly return to place. Skin that remains tented is strongly suggestive of moderate to severe dehydration. When edema is present, palpate the edematous area to determine its extent. Palpate any lumps or protrusions to determine firmness or tenderness. Palpate lesions or rashes with a gloved hand to document the size and extent of the lesions. Hair and Nails Inspect the hair and scalp, noting distribution of hair as well as color, texture, amount, and quality. The young infant's hair may be absent entirely or quite thick; it will be replaced by hair that is of a texture and color closer to what the child will have throughout childhood. Coarse, dry hair at any age may indicate a thyroid disorder or nutritional deficiency. Inspect the scalp thoroughly; it should be free from lesions and infestations. Note the presence of a greasy, scaly plaque on the scalp of infants; termed seborrheic dermatitis or cradle cap, it is benign and easily treated. Inspect the nails for color, shape, and condition. Full-term infants may have long, papery fingernails that can scratch their skin if not trimmed. Children should have healthy nails. Dry, brittle nails may indicate a nutritional deficiency. Inspect the skin around the nails to ensure that it is intact and without signs of infection. Many children (especially school-age children) have a nervous habit of nail biting or hangnail biting or pulling. Inspect the school-age child's or adolescent's toenails to ensure they are trimmed in a horizontal fashion. Self-trimming of toenailseither too low or in a curved fashion places the child at risk for the development of ingrown nails. Clubbing of the nails indicates chronic hypoxemia related to respiratory or cardiac disease. Nails that curve inward or outward may be hereditary or linked with injury, infection, or iron-deficiency anemia. Head Examining the head is critical in the newborn and infant periods but should not be overlooked in older children as an opportunity to check for diseases of the scalp and functional and developmental problems that are reflected in poor hygiene of the head and scalp. Note hair distribution and any bald or thinning areas. Use of gloves may be indicated, depending on the overall scalp cleanliness and chance of infestation by head lice (seen as small grayish specks near the base of hair shafts). INSPECTION Examine the head and face for shape and symmetry. In newborns, the head may be temporarily misshapen from uterine positioning or a lengthy vaginal delivery. Some infants have a slight flattening of the back of the head since the recommended sleeping position is supine. Note any irregularities or asymmetry. Observe the infant's head shape by looking down on it from above. Observe whether the head appears centered on the neck or tilts to one side. After 4 months of age, the infant should have achieved enough head control to hold the head erect and in midline when placed in a vertical position. Pull the infant from the supine position into sitting to determine the extent of head lag. To determine the extent of head control in older infants and children, ask the child to turn the head in different directions, either by simple commands or by following a colorful object. Observe the infant's face when crying, smiling, or babbling for symmetry of muscle movement. In children who are old enough to follow directions, a game of \"Simon Says\" is a playful way to determine facial symmetry and strength; ask them to puff out their cheeks, make kisses, look surprised, stick out their tongue, and so on (effectively testing function of cranial nerve VII [facial]) (Bickley & Szilagyi, 2009). Take Note! When you note a flattened occiput in an infant, encourage the parent or caregiver to allow the infant \"tummy time\" while awake and observed and to change the infant's head position frequently when upright in an infant seat (Dowshen, 2008). PALPATION Gently palpate the anterior and posterior fontanels ( Fig. 10.17 ). The fontanels are the soft areas on the skull that remain open in infancy to allow for rapid brain growth in the first months of life. Note the size of the fontanels. The anterior fontanel is about the size of a quarter at birth and slowly gets smaller until it can no longer be felt when it is closed by the age of 9 to 18 months. The posterior fontanel is much smaller and may close any time between shortly after birth and approximately 2 months of age. The fontanels should not be depressed or taut and bulging, though it is not uncommon to see them pulsate or briefly bulge if the baby cries. In an acutely ill infant, assess the fontanels while obtaining the vital signs. Dehydration can cause the fontanels to be sunken; increased intracranial pressure and overhydration can cause them to bulge. Palpate the skull for asymmetry, overriding or open sutures, and lumps or other deformities. Palpate the jaw joints as the child bites down to assess cranial nerve V (trigeminal). Use the postauricular, preauricular, submental, and submandibular lymph nodes, noting their size, mobility, and consistency ( Fig. 10.18 ).FIGURE 10.17 Note location and size of the fontanels. The anterior fontanel is diamond shaped and closes between the ages of 9 and 18 months. Take Note! Large fontanels may be associated with Down syndrome or congenital hypothyroidism. A fontanel that becomes larger over time rather than smaller may indicate the development of hydrocephalus, especially if accompanied by an accelerated increase in head circumference (Bickley & Szilagyi, 2009). FIGURE 10.18 Location of lymph nodes. Neck Inspect the neck for symmetry. The infant's neck is short, but by 4 years of age the child's neck should be similar in appearance to the adult's. Webbing or excessive neck skin folds may be associated with Turner syndrome, and lax neck skin may occur with Down syndrome. Assess the flexibility of the neck through a full range of motion. Take younger children through a passive range of motion. Older children will be able to look in all directions on command and stretch their chins to their chests themselves. Test cranial nerve XI (accessory) in the older child by having the child attempt to turn the head against resistance. Assessment of neck mobility is particularly important when infections of the central nervous system are suspected. Pain or resistance to range of motion may indicate meningeal irritation. Do not assess neck mobility in the trauma victim. Take Note! The infant or child who has experienced trauma should have the cervical spine maintained completely immobile until a radiologist has determined that the spinal cord is not damaged. Palpate the neck for masses and lymph nodes. Palpate the cervical and clavicular lymph nodes with the distal part of the fingers using gentle but firm pressure in a circular motion. Tilt the child's head upward slightly to allow better access. Assess the lymph nodes for swelling, mobility, temperature, and tenderness. In healthy infants and adolescents, the cervical lymph nodes are usually not palpable; in healthy children between 1 and 11 years, the cervical nodes are often found to be small, nontender, and mobile (see Fig. 10.18 for locations of lymph nodes). Enlarged cervical lymph nodes frequently occur in association with upper respiratory infections and otitis media. Report significant enlargement to the physician or nurse practitioner. Palpate the trachea; the thyroid is usually palpable only in older children. Eyes Assessment of the eyes includes evaluation of the external and internal structures as well as screening for visual acuity. Any nurse caring for a child should be adept at examining the external structures. Assessment of the internal structures will also be covered below but is usually performed only by the advanced practitioner. Refer to Chapter 9 for information on vision screening. Determination of visual acuity tests the function of cranial nerve II (optic). EXTERNAL STRUCTURES Observe the eyes for symmetry and spacing, even distribution of eyelashes and eyelids, and presence of epicanthal folds. Note the child's ability to blink, and report an inability to do so. The eyes should look symmetric and both should be facing forward in the midline when the child is looking directly ahead. The iris should be perfectly round and the sclerae should be clear. The cornea should be uniformly transparent. Inspect the corners of the eye (medial and lateral canthus) and the conjunctiva (lining of the eyelids). They should be free of discharge, inflammation, or swelling. Epicanthal folds may be present in children of Asian descent, children with genetic abnormalities, or those with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Using a small penlight or ophthalmoscope, inspect the function and clarity of the pupil by putting your nondominant hand on the child's forehead and moving the light toward and away from each eye. This will elicit the blink reflex. Next observe whether the pupil contracts with the light and expands when the light is removed. Make the same motion with a small toy or object and direct the child to look at it. The eyes demonstrate accommodation , or focusing at different distances, if the pupil constricts as the object moves closer. If normal findings are present, report PERRLA (pupils are equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation) ( Fig. 10.19 ). This is a particularly important assessment in head and eye injuries, as well as when other neurologic concerns are present. Absence of pupillary reflexive action after age 3 weeks may indicate blindness (Jarvis, 2008). Take Note! The normal infant may exhibit intermittent strabismus (crossing of the eyes) until about 3 months of age. However, persistent strabismus at any age or intermittent strabismus after 6 months of age should be evaluated by a pediatric ophthalmologist (Burns et al., 2009).FIGURE 10.19 The pupils should be equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation (PERRLA). FIGURE 10.20 Note reflected light falling symmetrically on each pupil with the Hirschberg test. Check extraocular muscle motility and function of cranial nerves III and IV (oculomotor and abducens) by instructing the child to follow the light through the six cardinal positions of gaze. Infants and very young children will follow an interesting object. Instruct the older child to look downward and inward (testing cranial nerve IV [trochlear]). Assess eye muscle strength using two tests. Using the Hirschberg test, bring the penlight to the middle of your face and direct the child to look at it. The small dot of reflected light seen in the iris should be placed symmetrically in each eye ( Fig. 10.20 ). The cover test also assesses eye muscle strength. Cover one of the child's eyes and instruct the child to focus on an interesting object. The eye should not waver. While the child is still focusing with the first eye, remove the cover from the second. Observe the uncovered eye for movement. Report any movement or drift. To test peripheral vision, have the child focus on a specific point or object directly in front. Bring a finger or a small object from beyond the range of vision into the area of the peripheral vision. When the child sees the object from the side, while still focusing on the object or point in front, the child should say \"stop.\" This also tests cranial nerve II (optic). INTERNAL STRUCTURES An advanced practitioner with experience in this type of assessment best accomplishes assessment of the internal structures of the eye. An adequate assessment requires that the child cooperate. Restraint for eye examination does not usually prove fruitful, as movement and tearing of the eyes interfere with the accuracy of the examination. Use the ophthalmoscope to inspect the internal eye structures. Observe the glow of the pupil, which appears red (creamy colored in children with very dark eye color). Inspect the optic disc, macula, fovea, and blood vessels. Refer any child with blurring or bulging of the optic disc or hemorrhage of vessels to a pediatric ophthalmologist for further evaluation. Take Note! Immediately report absence of the red reflex in one or both eyes, as this may indicate the presence of cataracts (Bickley & Sziiagyi, 2009). Ears Assessment of the ears includes evaluation of the external and internal structures as well as screening for hearing. Any nurse caring for a child should be adept at examining the external structures. Assessment of the internal structures will also be covered below but is usually performed only by the advanced practitioner. Refer to Chapter 9 for information on hearing screening. Testing of hearing also tests the function of cranial nerve VIII (acoustic). EXTERNAL STRUCTURES Assess the placement of the external ears on the head. They should be symmetric and placed no lower than the eyes. The pinna should deviate no more than 10 degrees from an imaginary line that is perpendicular to a line drawn between the outer canthus of the eye and the top of the ear. Low-set ears may be associated with genetic abnormalities or syndromes ( Fig. 10.21 ). Note protrusion or flattening of the ears, which may be normal for that child or may indicate inflammation (protrusion) or persistent side-lying (flattening). Note the presence of pits or skin tags in the preauricular area. Observe the exterior ear canal. A waxy cerumen that is soft and an orangish-brown color is normally found lubricating and protecting the external ear canal and should be left in place or washed gently away when bathing. Note drainage from the ear canal, which is always considered abnormal. Pull on the auricle and palpate the mastoid process, neither of which should result in pain in the healthy child. FIGURE 10.21 Low-set ears may be associated with chromosomal or other genetic anomalies. Take Note! Impacted and dry cerumen can be softened with a few drops of mineral or cooking oil and then gently irrigated from the canal with an ear syringe and warm water (Nettina, 2010). INTERNAL STRUCTURES Use a tympanometer to assess the mobility of the eardrum (tympanic membrane). Gently pull down on the earlobe of infants and toddlers and up on the outer edge of the pinna in older children to straighten the ear canal, and press the tip of the tympanometer over the external canal. A reading of air pressure is recorded by the instrument, and this is useful to assess middle ear disease. Many tympanometers record a wave pattern that may be printed to include in the child's chart. A nurse practitioner or physician generally performs inspection of the ear canal and tympanic membrane with an otoscope ( Fig. 10.22 ). The otoscopic examination is usually performed near the end of the physical assessment for infants and young children, as they are often quite resistant to this intrusive procedure. The infant or toddler may require restraint in the parent's lap for the otoscopic evaluation. The preschooler may cooperate if the nurse uses a game such as looking for pretend puppies or potatoes in the child's ear. As with the tympanometer, gently pull down on the earlobe of the infant or toddler and up on the outer edge of the pinna in older children to straighten the ear canal. Use an otoscopic speculum appropriate to the size of the child's ear canal. Insert the speculum into the ear canal to visualize the canal and the tympanic membrane. The canal should be pink, should have tiny hairs, and should be free from scratches, drainage, foreign bodies, and edema. The tympanic membrane should appear pearly pink or gray and should be translucent, allowing visualization of the bony landmarks. It may be red if the child has been crying recently. Compress the pneumatic insufflator bulb to provide a puff of air; this causes motion of the tympanic membrane when the middle ear is healthy. Note abnormalities such as a fluid level, bubble or pus behind the tympanic membrane, tympanic membrane immobility, holes or perforations in the tympanic membrane, and the presence of tympanostomy tubes, scarring, or vesicles. FIGURE 10.22 Otoscopic examination allows visualization of the internal structures of the ear. Take Note! Never attempt to flush a foreign object out with water until it has been identified, because small pieces of sponge, clay, or vegetative material like peas or beans swell with water, further obstructing the ear canal (Nettina, 2010). Nose and Sinuses The nose, as with all facial features in a child, should be symmetric, but it can be displaced temporarily by birth trauma in newborns. Children of Asian or African descent often display a flattened nasal bridge as a normal variation. Ensure that the nares provide unobstructed airflow by alternately occluding one nostril at a time and observing for air movement through the other nostril. If the child is breathing comfortably, there should be little nostril movement visible. Adolescents may have pierced their nose or nasal septum;ensure that the site is free from infection or loose jewelry that could migrate into the sinuses. Ideally the nose should not be draining, though clear mucus may be present if the child has been crying. Assess the amount, color, thickness, and presence of any odor if drainage is present. Inspect the interior of the nose by tilting the child's head backward and pushing the tip of the nose upward. Direct the beam of a penlight in the nostril. The nasal mucosa should be uniformly firm, pink, and free from edema, excoriation, or masses. Test the older child's sense of smell by having the child close the eyes and identify a familiar scent such as peppermint or coffee (cranial nerve I [olfactory]). Palpate the sinuses for tenderness. Take Note! Infants up to 3 to 6 months of age have traditionally been thought to be obligate nose breathers because of their long soft palate and relatively large tongue, which allows for swallowing without aspiration during breast or artificial nipple feeding. This lessens with age and as the infant becomes better able to breathe through the mouth when necessary (Bickley & Szilagyi, 2009). Mouth and Throat Wear a powder-free glove to examine the mouth, teeth, and throat. Inspection of the exterior of the mouth may be done at any point in the examination. Infants and young children may find assessment of the mouth and particularly the pharynx and uvula to be quite intrusive, so delay that part of the assessment until the end of the examination, after otoscopic evaluation. Assess the character and quality of the child's voice and the infant's cry. It should be neither too hoarse nor too shrill. INSPECTION OF THE MOUTH Observe the lips for color, symmetry, and absence of inflammation or edema. Salivation in infants begins at about 3 months of age; drooling occurs because the infant does not learn to swallow saliva until several months later. Next, inspect the interior of the mouth. The mouth is the first part of the digestive system, and a pink, moist, healthy mucosal lining is indicative of a healthy gastrointestinal tract. In infants, the tongue should lie within the mouth at rest and should be capable of extending over the lower gum line to help the baby feed. The tongue extrusion reflex is normal in infants up until the age of 6 months and allows the infant to suckle easily from birth. Observe movement of the tongue when the infant or young child babbles or cries. Ask the older child to touch the tongue to the roof of the mouth and then stick out the tongue and move it from side to side (testing cranial nerve XII [hypoglossal]). Full movement should be present and the tongue should be free from lesions or exudate. Visualize the hard and soft palate (which should be intact) or palpate with the gloved finger. Most infants have no teeth before the fifth to sixth month. When the teeth begin to erupt, they usually erupt symmetrically at the rate of about one a month, until toddlers have 20 teeth by 30 months of age. The infant may drool for several months before teething. During teething the gums will be swollen at the location of the impending tooth. In older children, the secondary teeth replace the primary teeth much more slowly and with little discomfort from the 5th to the 20th year. Figure 10.23 shows the usual permanent tooth eruption pattern. Look for dental caries or alignment problems and inspect the gums for signs of infection. Test cranial nerve IX (glossopharyngeal) by having the child identify taste with the posterior portion of the tongue. Take Note! Natal (present at birth) or neonatal (erupting by 30 days of age) teeth should be evaluated by a pediatric dentist for potential extraction, as they may pose an aspiration risk (Bickley & Szilagyi, 2009). INSPECTION OF THE THROAT Inspect the tonsils, uvula, and oropharynx. Assess the infant's throat during a yawn or cry, as any forcible attempt to depress the tongue with a tongue depressor produces a strong reflex elevation of the base of the tongue that completely blocks the view of the pharynx. The young child will require restraint so that the nurse can depress the tongue and visualize the back of the mouth without injuring the child ( Fig. 10.24 ). Asking the older child to open wide, stick out the tongue, and say \"aaaah\" simultaneously will allow for a quick look at the tonsils and pharynx without the need to use a tongue depressor, but the nurse must be very quick because the tongue rises rapidly after those maneuvers are performed. Tonsils usually cannot be seen in the infant. As the child becomes a toddler, the tonsils become dramatically larger and then begin to decrease in size again by the ninth year. The tonsils should be pink and often have crypts on their surfaces, which are sometimes filled with debris. Ensure that the uvula is midline and rises if the gag reflex is elicited (cranial nerve X [vagus]). Inspect the oropharynx, which should be pink and free from exudate.Thorax and Lungs Assessment of the thorax and lungs begins by observing the shape and contour of the thorax and determining work of breathing. Accurate auscultation of the lungs is essential, since children often have respiratory infections and disorders and may exhibit alterations in respiratory effort and breath sounds. Note the child's color, which should be pink; cyanosis indicates audible stridor (inspiratory high-pitched sound), expiratory grunting or snoring, audible wheezing (heard with the naked ear), or cough. Document type and extent of cough. Observe the nail beds for clubbing, which occurs with diseases inducing chronic hypoxic states. THORAX Examine the chest with the head in a midline position to determine size and shape as well as symmetry, movement, and bony landmarks. The newborn's chest should be smooth and round, with the transverse diameter nearly equal to the anterior-posterior diameter. The shape of the chest progresses to that of the adult by age 5 to 6 years. At that time the anterior-posterior diameter is about half the transverse diameter ( Fig. 10.25 ). At the point where the xiphoid process and the right and left costal margins meet, the costal angle should measure 90 degrees or less. Inspect for structural deformity such as symmetric movement of the chest wall with respiration. Infants and younger children are primarily diaphragmatic breathers, so the abdomen and chest will rise and fall together. Older children, particularly adolescent females, demonstrate thoracic breathing, yet the abdomen and chest should continue to rise and fall together. Asymmetry of chest wall movement is an abnormal finding. FIGURE 10.23 Usual sequence of permanent tooth eruption.FIGURE 10.24 The young child may need to be restrained so that the throat examination can be done safely. Observe the depth and regularity of respirations, noting the length of the inspiratory and expiratory phases in relation to each other. The newborn and young infant demonstrate an irregular respiratory pattern. Older infants and children should have a more regular respiratory pattern. Assess the child's respiratory effort by first observing for nasal flaring, which indicates labored breathing. Observe the chest wall and shoulders for accessory muscle use, which normally is not present. If retractions are present, note their location and severity. Typical locations for retraction include the intercostal, Fig. 10.27 ). Pay attention to the position the child naturally assumes to breathe comfortably; children in respiratory distress often sit forward and are uncomfortable lying down or talking (Jarvis, 2008). LUNGS Experienced examiners may palpate and percuss the lungs before using auscultation to evaluate the breath sounds. FIGURE 10.25 (A) The newborn's chest is round. (B) The adult chest has an anterior-posterior diameter about half the transverse diameter. PALPATION AND PERCUSSION. Palpate for symmetric respiratory excursion by placing the thumbs and fingers together along the costal margin on the chest or back. Movement should be symmetric with each breath. Palpate for the normal presence of tactile fremitus with the palms or fingertips while the infant is crying or the older child says \"99.\" Indirectly percuss the lungs of older children, noting resonance over lung fields. Hyperresonance may be present in conditions resulting in hyper-aeration of the lungs, such as asthma. AUSCULTATION. Use the bell of the stethoscope or switch to a small diaphragm to auscultate lung sounds in the infant or child. The adult-sized diaphragm may be used for the adolescent. Auscultate the lung fields with the infant or child in a sitting position, even ifthat requires propping the infant in a parent's lap. Infants and young children have loud breath sounds because of their thin chest walls. Breath sounds should be clear with adequate aeration throughout all lung fields. Listen to a full inspiration and expiration at the apices of the lungs as well as symmetrically across the entire lung field, systematically comparing the right to the left side. Listen on the anterior chest, on the posterior chest, and in the axillary regions. FIGURE 10.26 Pectus excavatum: note depression in xiphoid area. Playing games may encourage younger children to cooperate with deep breathing during lung assessment. The child can blow a cotton ball up in the air, blow a pinwheel, or \"blow out\" the light of the penlight (Miller, 2011). Older children are capable of deep breathing when instructed to do so. The child who has a respiratory disorder or who is experiencing respiratory distress may exhibit diminished breath sounds, most often in the lung bases. Diminished breath sounds are softer and quieter than lung sounds demonstrating adequate aeration. In the healthy infant or child, no adventitious sounds should be heard. If noisy breath sounds are heard in the infant or young child, particularly over all lung fields, compare the sound to the noises heard over the trachea or within the nose. Infants and young children with secretions in the nasopharyngeal area may have those sounds transmitted over the lung fields. These sounds usually clear with coughing or airway suctioning; they are not true adventitious sounds. Note adventitious breath sounds such as wheezes or crackles, documenting their location and whether they are present on inspiration, expiration, or both. It is most important to describe the abnormal breath sounds being heard rather than attempting to classify the sounds. Adventitious lung sounds are associated with a variety of disorders, and extensive experience is required to appropriately classify lung sounds. Adventitious breath sounds should be reported for further evaluation.FIGURE 10.27 Location of retractions. Breasts Assess the breasts of children of all ages and both genders. Note the size of the breasts in relation to the age of the child. Palpate the axillary lymph nodes during the breast assessment. INSPECTION Observe the breasts for position, shape, size, symmetry, and color. Newborns of both genders may have swollen nipples from the influence of maternal estrogen, but by several weeks of age the nipples should be flat and should continue to be so in all prepubertal children. In children the nipples are located lateral to the midclavicular line, usually between the fourth and fifth rib. The areola becomes darker in color as the child approaches puberty. Overweight children may appear to have enlarged breasts due to adipose tissue. Note the location of additional (supernumerary) nipples if present (usually located along the mammary ridge); they may appear as darkly pigmented, elevated or nipplelike spots. These are usually of no concern as they do not change over time, but they may be associated with renal disorders. Inspect the breasts for the current stage of development: widening of the areola, elevation of the nipple, and increase in breast size. Female breast development may begin as early as age 8, but starts by age 13 in most girls. Breast development then continues in a characteristic, but usually asymmetric, pattern, with one breast larger than the other throughout the lifespan. The sexual maturity rating scale developed by Tanner in 1962 is used to describe breast development (Tanner stages ; Fig. 10.28 ). Adolescent boys may develop gynecomastia (enlargement of the breast tissue) due to hormonal pubertal changes. When the hormone levels stabilize, male adolescents then have flat nipples. Occasionally gynecomastia is caused by marijuana use, anabolic steroids, or hormonal dysfunction (Jarvis, 2008). PALPATION Palpate the breasts in a systematic fashion. A tender nodule palpated just under the nipple confirms pubertal changes. This change may be difficult to assess in girls with excessive adipose tissue. Normal breast tissue should feel smooth, firm, and elastic. Note masses or nodules if present. Palpate for axillary lymph nodes with the child's arms relaxed at the side but slightly abducted. Note size and texture of nodes if present. Heart and Peripheral Perfusion The examination of the heart in children is identical to that of adults except for the focus of the examiner's attention. Congenital heart defects are the most common cause of heart problems in children, and children with these defects present differently than adults with heart disease. Take Note! The younger the child, the more responsive the heart rate is to activity changes. It increases with fever, fear, crying, or anxiety and decreases with sleep, sedation, or vagal stimulation (Jarvis, 2008). INSPECTION Observe the child's posture. Note the presence of pallor, cyanosis, mottling, or edema, which may indicate a cardiovascular problem. Inspect the anterior chest from the side or at an angle, noting symmetry in shape as well as movement. Observe for the apical impulse, which is visible in about half of children. It occurs at the point of maximum intensity (PMI) , which is located at the third to fourth intercostal space just medial of the child's left midclavicular line until age 4 years, at the fourth intercostal space at the left midclavicular line in children ages 4 to 6 years, and then lateral to the left midclavicular line at the fifth intercostal space in children ages 7 years and older ( Fig. 10.29 ). Note clubbing of the fingertips or distention of neck veins, both of which may be associated with congenital heart disease. PALPATION Using the fingertips, palpate the chest for lifts and heaves or thrills, which are not normal. Palpate the apical pulse in the area of the PMI (see Fig. 10.29 ). Check the pulses and compare the upper body to lower body pulses, as well as left versus right, noting strength and quality ( Fig. 10.30 ). The pedal, brachial, and femoral pulses are usually easily palpated. The radial pulse is very difficult to palpate in children younger than 2 years of age. Note warmth of the distal extremities. To assess capillary refill time, place slight pressure on the nail beds and quickly release it. Observe the length of time required for refill and return to original color. Compare capillary refill time of the fingers to the toes. A capillary refill time of less than 3 seconds indicates adequacy of perfusion. FIGURE 10.28 Tanner sexual maturity rating for breast development. (Adapted from Tanner, J. M. [1962]. Growth at adolescence. Oxford, England: Blackwell Scientific Publications.) FIGURE 10.29 The point of maximal intensity (PMI) or apical impulse. FIGURE 10.30 It is important to assess brachial and femoral pulses simultaneously to determine equality or differences in strength and intensity.FIGURE 10.31 Auscultating the child's heart. AUSCULTATION Perform auscultation of the heart with the child in two different positions, upright and reclined ( Fig. 10.31 ). Auscultate the heart rate in the area of the PMI as this is the point on the chest wall where the heartbeat is heard most distinctly (see Fig. 10.29 ). As you begin auscultation, listen first for respirations and note their timing so as not to confuse the heart sounds with the lung sounds. A crying infant may help by briefly holding his or her breath between cries. Once you are confident that you are listening to the heart, be sure to listen for 1 full minute because of the irregularity of rhythms in some children. Count the heart rate, which should be consistent with the palpated pulse (either radial or brachial, depending on the child's age). Develop a systematic approach to auscultation of the heart. Listen over all four valvular areas anteriorly ( Fig. 10.32 ). In the infant or younger child, also auscultate the heart in the axillary region and posteriorly (certain murmurs radiate to these areas). Note Sj, S 2 , extra heart sounds, or murmurs. S 1 is usually loudest at the mitral and tricuspid areas and increases in intensity with fever, exercise, and anemia. S 2 is usually most intense at the aortic and pulmonic areas. A split S 2 heard at the apex occurs in many infants and young children. S 3 may be heard in many healthy children and is considered normal, though the child with a chronic cardiac condition may develop an S3 when congestive heart failure is present. S 4 is usually considered abnormal, most often occurring with cardiac disease. Sinus arrhythmia is a common and normal finding in children and adolescents. It results in an irregular heart rhythm: the heart rate increases with inhalation and decreases with exhalation. If the child holds his or her breath, the rhythm becomes regular.FIGURE 10.32 Areas where the sounds of heart valves radiate. at left midclavicular line. Auscultate for murmurs. Note the location (where it is heard best or loudest) and timing of the murmur. A systolic murmur occurs in association with S1 (closure of the atrioventricular valves), a diastolic murmur in association with S2 (closure of the semilunar valves). Also note the duration of murmur. Does it occur early or late in diastole or systole? Does it occur all the way across systole (holosystolic)? Note the intensity of the murmur. Table 10.5 discusses grading of murmur intensity. Innocent murmurs occur frequently in children because of the child's more dynamic circulation, thin chest wall, and angulated vessels (Menashe, 2007). An innocent murmur is most often heard at the second or fourth intercostal space, and its timing is systolic. The innocent murmur is usually medium pitched and musical. Often an innocent murmur disappears when the child changes position. A venous hum that is heard in the supraclavicular area and possibly radiating down the chest is considered an innocent murmur. Refer any child with a murmur to an experienced practitioner for further evaluation. Abdomen The abdomen contains organs related to the genitourinary and lymphatic systems, in addition to the gastrointestinal system. These structures lie within the abdomen in approximately the same location as they do in adults. Dividing the abdomen into quadrants simplifies the description of normal organ location and the reporting of abnormalities. Draw an imaginary vertical line from the xiphoid process to the symphysis pubis. Cross this with an imaginary perpendicular line through the umbilicus. The sequence of physical examination is altered for the abdominal assessment: auscultation is done before percussion and palpation because manipulation of the lower abdomen may affect the bowel sounds (Bickley & Szilagyi, 2009). INSPECTION Inspect the abdomen for size, shape, and symmetry. The abdomen in the infant and toddler is rounded and protuberant until the abdominal musculature becomes well developed. Though rounded, the abdomen should not be distended (at any age). By adolescence, the stature is more erect and the abdomen begins to appear flat when standing and concave when supine. The thin skin of a young child may allow the visualization of superficial venous circulation across the abdomen. Inspect the abdomen for movement. At eye level with the abdomen, note abdomen and thorax movement occurring simultaneously. Visible peristaltic waves are abnormal and should be reported immediately. Inspect the newborn's umbilicus for color, bleeding, odor, and drainage. The umbilical stump should slowly dry, become black and hard, and fall away from the cutaneous navel by the end of the second week of life. Note drainage or granulation at the umbilical site indicating delayed drying of the umbilical stump. Inspect the umbilicus in older infants and young children for the presence of umbilical hernia. Because the umbilicus divides the rectus abdominis muscle, it is not uncommon to see an umbilical hernia protrude through and become larger when the infant or toddler strains or cries. This is a benign finding and will usually disappear as the abdomen becomes stronger. Adolescents may have jewelry piercing the umbilicus. AUSCULTATION Auscultate the abdomen using the diaphragm or the bell of the stethoscope pressed firmly against the abdomen. Count the bowel sounds in each of the four quadrants for a full minute. Bowel sounds should be present by a few hours after birth and should remain active throughout life. Note whether bowel sounds are normally active, hyperactive, hypoactive, or absent. Normal bowel sounds can be described as growls, gurgles, and clicking sounds. Hypoactive bowel sounds may occur postoperatively. Hyperactive bowels sounds are common with diarrhea. Classify bowel sounds as absent after listening for 5 full minutes in each area. Absent bowel sounds may indicate ileus or peritonitis. PERCUSSION Indirectly percuss all areas of the abdomen. Normal findings include dullness along the costal margins and tympany over the remainder of the abdomen. A full bladder may yield dullness to percussion. PALPATION Palpate the abdomen with the child in a supine position. If the child's legs are small enough, the knees may be brought up with the nondominant hand to flex the hips and relax the abdomen. Palpate all four quadrants of the abdomen in a systematic fashion, first lightly and then deeply. Apply light pressure with the fingertips to perform light palpation, assessing for tenderness and muscle tone ( Fig. 10.33 ). Note skin turgor by gently elevating a piece of skin and allowing it to fall back into place. Perform deep palpation to assess the organs and any masses. Place one hand on top of the other and palpate from the lower quadrants to the upper (see Fig. 10.33 ). The edge of the liver may be felt at the right costal margin, and the tip of the spleen can be felt at the left costal margin. The descending colon may be felt in the left lower quadrant as a small column and the bladder as a soft balloon below the umbilicus. The kidneys are rarely palpable. The abdomen should be soft and nontender to palpation. Report firmness, tenderness, or masses. Palpate the inguinal area for the presence of hernia or enlarged lymph nodes.FIGURE 10.33 (A) Light and (B) deep palpation of the abdomen. Take Note! To decrease ticklishness with abdominal palpation, place a flat, warm, still hand on the abdomen while distracting the child before palpation begins. An alternate technique is to first palpate with the child's hand under the examiner's hand. Genitalia and Anus Examination of the genitals should immediately follow the abdominal assessment in the younger child and should be reserved for the end of the assessment in the adolescent. Though the anus is part of the gastrointestinal tract, it is best assessed during the genital examination. Ensure privacy for the older child and adolescent. Keep the child covered as much as possible. Use a casual, matter-of- fact approach to place the child or teen at ease. During the genital examination, teach the child or adolescent about normal variations and changes with puberty, as well as issues related to health promotion. MALE Inspect the penis and scrotum for size, color, skin integrity, and obvious masses. The obese boy's penis may appear small because of additional skin folds. Penis size should correlate with pubertal stage ( Fig. 10.34 ). The penis may have a foreskin that covers the glans, protecting and lubricating it. If present, do not forcibly retract the foreskin. In circumcised males the urinary meatus is exposed and should be at the tip of the glans. Assess the meatus for absence of discharge. If possible, observe the stream of urine for strength of flow and patency of the urethral orifice. Skin lesions may indicate sexually transmitted infection. A foreskin that cannot be retracted in a boy older than 3 years of age may indicate phimosis. Report abnormal findings.FIGURE 10.34 Tanner male sexual maturity rating for genitalia and pubic hair. (Adapted from Tanner, J. M. [1962]. Growth at adolescence. Oxford, England: Blackwell Scientific Publications.) Take Note! When you first remove a male infant's diaper, this is the ideal time to assess the force of the urine stream and the erection reflex, as the cool air may make the infant void and briefly experience an erection. Assess the presence and distribution of pubic hair. Inspect the scrotum for size, slight asymmetry, color, and absence of edema. The scrotum may initially be swollen from birth trauma or maternal hormones, but this swelling should decrease in the first few days of life. The scrotum is ordinarily more deeply pigmented than the rest of the boy's skin. Figure 10.34 illustrates scrotal changes that occur with puberty. Assess the testicles by placing one finger over the inguinal canal and palpating the scrotum with the other. This prevents the retractile testes in a young child from slipping back up the inguinal canal. The testicles should be smooth, of similar sizes, and freely moveable. The infant's testicles may be palpated in the scrotum or in the inguinal canal, where they can be easily moved into the scrotum with gentle pressure from the examiner's nondominant hand ( Fig. 10.35 ). Beyond infancy, allow the boy to sit cross- legged to reduce the cremasteric reflex that retracts the testicles during palpation. An adolescent boy may need to stand for the nurse to fully palpate the scrotum. Document the presence of both testicles in the scrotal sac, if they are retractile, or if they are absent. Report unde-scended testicle or other abnormal findings.FIGURE 10.35 Placing a digit over the inguinal canal during testicular palpation prevents retraction of the testis into the canal. FEMALE In most cases, the female genitalia examination is limited to assessment of the external genitalia. Internal examination is not routinely performed before maturity unless the adolescent anticipates becoming or is sexually active or requests birth control, or if pathology is suspected. If an internal examination is needed, refer the child or adolescent to the appropriate advanced practitioner or physician. Position the infant in the parent's lap or on the examination table or crib. The toddler or preschooler should be examined in the parent's lap, in a frog-legged position. The school-age or adolescent girl should lie on the examination table or bed. Provide for privacy by keeping the genital area covered until it is time for the examination. Perform the assessment of the external genitalia in a systematic fashion. First, determine the presence and distribution of pubic hair. Infants and young girls (particular those of dark-skinned races) may have a small amount of downy pubic hair. Otherwise, the appearance of pubic hair indicates the onset of pubertal changes, sometimes prior to breast changes. Pubic hair generally begins to appear by age 11 years, with age 13 being the latest. Figure 10.36 illustrates the development of pubic hair through puberty in girls. Inspect the labia majora and minora for size, color, and skin integrity. The newborn's labia minora are swollen from the effects of maternal estrogen but will decrease in size and be hidden by the labia majora within the first weeks of life. Redness or swelling of the labia may occur with infection, sexual abuse, or masturbation. Lesions on the external genitalia may indicate sexually transmitted infection. Gently spread the labia to inspect the clitoris, urethral meatus, and vaginal opening. Some girls may prefer to spread the labia themselves. The urinary meatus and vaginal orifice should be visible and not occluded by the hymen. It is not uncommon to see a hymenal tag. Note clitoral size. Inspect the urinary meatus and vaginal opening for edema or redness, which should not be present. Observe for any vaginal discharge. A small amount of blood-tinged or mucoid discharge may be noted in the first few weeks of life as a result of maternal hormone exposure. A small amount of clear mucus-like discharge is normal in all females. If present, document labial adhesion or other abnormal findings. ANUS Inspect the anal area for fissures, rash, hemorrhoids, prolapse, or skin tags. Examine the infant's anal area while examining the genitalia. The younger child may lie back in the parent's lap and flex the knees to the chest. The older child or adolescent may be prone or in a side-lying position. If the adolescent boy is already standing for the scrotal assessment, have him bend forward so that you can assess the anal area. The anus should appear moist and hairless. Gently stroke the anal area to elicit the anal reflex (quick contraction). If indicated, inspect anal sphincter tone by inserting a gloved finger lubricated with water-soluble jelly just inside the anal sphincter.FIGURE 10.36 Tanner female sexual maturity rating for pubic hair. (Adapted from Tanner, J. M. [1962]. Growth at adolescence. Oxford, England: Blackwell Scientific Publications.) Musculoskeletal Assessment of the musculoskeletal system includes examination of the clavicles and shoulders, spine, extremities, joints, and hips. Determining the child's ability to move all extremities through the full range of motion is also important. CLAVICLES AND SHOULDERS Palpate the clavicles. In the newborn, tenderness or crepitus reveals a fracture sustained at birth. In the older infant or child, a bump indicates callus formation with clavicle fracture. Test shoulder strength and the function of cranial nerve XI in the older child by requesting that the child shrug the shoulders while you apply downward pressure. SPINE Observe the child's resting posture and alignment of the trunk. The newborn's position will look like the position the baby preferred in utero and is one of general flexion. The older infant moves more and can sit unassisted in the second half of the first year. Toddlers stand with a wide-based gait, a slightly swayed back, and the abdomen slightly protruding. The posture straightens in the preschool and school-age years. Adolescents often demonstrate kyphosis as the skeleton and muscles are both growing rapidly ( Fig. 10.37 ). Inspect the child's spine. The newborn's spine has a single C-shaped curve and remains rounded for the first 3 months of life. The cervical curve begins to develop around 3 to 4 months of age as the baby gains head control. By 12 to 18 months of age, the lumbar curve develops, which corresponds to the onset of walking. The S-shaped spine in older children and adolescents is similar to that of the adult's. The spine should be flexible, with good muscle tone and no rigidity. Assess the back, and hip and shoulder heights for symmetry.FIGURE 10.37 The teen's posture often demonstrates kyphosis. Examine the preadolescent and adolescent for the development of scoliosis. Refer to Chapter 23 for information about scoliosis screening. Scoliosis screening is generally performed during well-child examinations by the physician or nurse practitioner or by the middle or high school nurse on a particular day of the school year. Note mobility of the vertebral column by having the child bend forward and side to side. Flex the neck and move it from side to side. No resistance or pain should occur. Inspect the back for discoloration, tufts of hair, or dimples. A normal pilonidal dimple is sometimes seen at the base of the spine, but there should be no tuft of hair or nevi along the spine. Document and report abnormal findings. EXTREMITIES All children, even newborns, should be able to move all extremities spontaneously. Screen the infant younger than 6 months of age for developmental dysplasia of the hip by performing the Ortolani and Barlow maneuvers (refer to Chapter 23 for additional information). These maneuvers are usually best performed by a proficient examiner. Inspect and palpate the child's upper and lower extremities. Assess for symmetry in size, contour, movement, warmth, and color of the extremities. The infant's feet and legs appear bowed secondary to in utero positioning but can be straightened through passive range of motion. Observe the child in a standing position. Bowing of the lower legs (internaltibial torsion) lessens as the toddler begins to bear weight and usually resolves in the second or third year of life as the strength of the muscles and bones increases. When it persists past that time, it is termed genu varum (bow legs). Genu valgum (knock knee) is usually present until the child is 7 years old. Observe the child walking, noting any difficulty with leg position or balance. If the child is reluctant to walk, use play as a way to elicit the behavior. The school-age child should have gait and leg appearance similar to that of the adult. Note the normal flat foot in the toddler and young child. The arch develops as the child grows and the muscles become less lax, though some children may continue with flexible flat feet; this is considered a normal variation. Perform passive range of motion of the young infant's extremities. Inability to straighten the foot to midline may indicate clubfoot. Count the fingers and toes, noting abnormalities such as polydactyly (increased number of digits) or syndactyly (webbing of the digits). Palpate the joints for warmth or tenderness. Check the mobility of the joints of the upper and lower extremities by performing range of motion. Determine lower extremity muscle strength by having the child push against the examiner's hands with the soles of theforefoot. Assess upper extremity strength by having the child squeeze the examiner's crossed fingers and/or push up or down against the examiner's outstretched hands. Take Note! Slight tremors may be noticed in the infant's extremities in the first month of life. Neurologic The neurologic examination should include level of consciousness, balance and coordination, sensory function, reflexes, and a developmental screening. Motor function is assessed within the musculoskeletal section. Cranial nerve function is generally tested within other portions of the physical assessment as it applies to that section. LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS Note the state of alertness and attentiveness to parents and the environment in the newborn and infant. Older infants become interactive with other people, as do toddlers and preschoolers. Younger children demonstrate orientation by positive interaction with family members and by crying or fussing when they feel threatened. By school age, the child should be oriented to name and place and a few years later should be able to state the date as well (even if only the day of the week). BALANCE AND COORDINATION The cerebellum controls balance and coordination. Observe the child's gait to assess balance and coordination. Observe toddlers and older children rising and walking from a seated and supine position. They should be able to stand and balance without straining or holding on to objects. Continue to test cerebellar function by having the younger child skip or hop and requesting that the older child or adolescent walk heel to toe. Further tests of cerebellar function responsible for balance and coordination are discussed in Box 10.3. Demonstrate each test and make sure the child understands your instructions. SENSORY TESTING Portions of sensory testing related to most of the cranial nerves, vision, hearing, taste, and smell have already been incorporated into other sections as appropriate within the physical assessment. Test cranial nerve V (trigeminal) by lightly touching the child's cheek with a cotton ball. The young infant will root toward the side that is touched. With the child's eyes closed, ask the child to identify other locations where he or she is lightly touched (several different ones) to assess sensation. Ask the child to tell you when he or she is touched. Make a game of this activity to encourage cooperation in younger children. In the older child who knows the definition of sharp and dull, test for these sensations with the child's eyes closed. Use the rounded end of a tongue blade for dull and the broken edge of a tongue blade for the sharp sensation. The child should be able to discriminate the sensations of sharp and dull. BOX 10.3 CEREBELLAR FUNCTION TESTING Romberg: Ask the school-age or older child to stand still with eyes closed and arms down by the sides. Observe the child for leaning (stand close in case this does occur). This is considered a positive Romberg test, indicating cerebellar dysfunction. For the following tests, the child should demonstrate accuracy and smoothness: Heel-to-shin: Have the child lie in a supine position, place one heel on the opposite knee, and run it down the shin. Rapid alternating movements: The child pats the thighs with the hands, lifts them, turns them over, pats the thighs with the back of the hands, and repeats the process multiple times. An alternate test is for the child to touch the thumb to each finger of the same hand starting at the index finger, then reverse the direction and repeat. Finger-to-finger: The child's eyes are open. The child touches the examiner's outstretched finger with the index finger, then touches his or her own nose. The examiner moves the finger to a different spot and the child repeats this process several times. Finger-to-nose: The child's eyes are closed. The child stretches the arm with the index finger extended, then touches his or her nose with that finger, keeping the eyes closed. Adapted from Bickley, L., & Szilagyi, P. G. (2009). Bates' guide to physical examination and history taking (10th ed.). Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; and Jarvis, C. (2008). Physical examination and health assessment (5th ed.). St. Louis: Saunders. REFLEXESAssess the infant's primitive and protective reflexes. The primitive reflexes involve a whole-body response and are subcortical in nature. Selected primitive reflexes present at birth include Moro, root, suck, asymmetric tonic neck, plantar and palmar grasp, step, and Babinski. Most of the primitive reflexes diminish over the first few months of life, giving way to protective or postural reflexes. Protective reflexes are motor responses related to maintenance of equilibrium. They are necessary for appropriate motor development and remain throughout life once they are established. The protective reflexes include the righting and parachute reactions. Place one finger in each of the infant's hands to elicit the palmar grasp reflex (usually disappears by age 3 to 4 months). Touch the thumb to the ball of the infant's foot to elicit the plantar grasp reflex. The infant's toes will curl down (this reflex disappears by 8 to 10 months). Refer to Table 3.2 for illustrations and additional explanation of the other reflexes. Appropriate presence and disappearance of primitive reflexes, as well as development of protective reflexes, is indicative of a healthy neurologic system. Primitive reflexes that persist beyond the usual age of disappearance may indicate an abnormality of the neurologic system and should be further investigated (Bickley & Szilagyi, 2009). Assess deep tendon reflexes in all infants and children. Appropriate responses indicate that the reflex arc is intact. Use the reflex hammer in all ages or the curved tips of the two first fingers to elicit the responses in infants. The limb must be relaxed and the muscle partly stretched. Use a snapping motion of the wrist to tap with the fingertips or the reflex hammer. Test the biceps, triceps, patellar, and Achilles reflexes as you would in the adult. It may help to place a finger under the infant's knee to encourage relaxation. Young children who tense up when their reflexes are being tested may relax the area if you have them focus on another area, so have the child clasp the hands while testing the Achilles and patellar reflexes. As the child focuses on the hands, the lower extremities relax (Jarvis, 2008). Distraction may also be helpful. Grade the strength of the response using the standard scale from 0 to 4+: 0: no response 1 +: diminished or sluggish 2 +: average 3 +: brisker than average 4+: very brisk, may involve clonus The newborn's deep tendon reflexes are normally brisk (3+). They decrease to average (2+) usually by 4 months of age. Healthy children should have reflexes of 2 + if the reflex has been elicited properly. Absent, sluggish, or hyperreactive responses usually indicate disease (Bickley & Szilagyi, 2009). DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING An important component of the neurologic assessment and a comprehensive child health assessment is developmental screening. Developmental screening may be used to identify children whose developmental status may warrant additional evaluation. Become comfortable with the developmental screening tools used and what the results of the screening mean. Upon completion of the screening, discuss the child's abilities with the parent or caregiver. Developmental screening is often performed separately from the physical examination and is discussed in further detail in Chapter 9 (refer to page 239 ). Refer back to Elliot, the 3-year-old from the beginning of the chapter. What are some important considerations when per forming his physical examination? KEY CONCEPTS The health history in children includes more than just the chief complaint, history of present illness, and past medical history; it is important to include the perinatal history and developmental milestones. Allow the chief complaint to determine which parts of the history require more in-depth investigation. The developmental history will warrant more attention in the younger child, while school performance and adjustment will be more important in the school-age child and adolescent. Though the parent will provide most of the health history for the infant and young child, allow the young verbal child to answer questions during the health history as appropriate. Direct health history questions to the school-age child and adolescent, seeking clarification from the parents as needed. Provide confidentiality and privacy for the adolescent during the health history. Weight and length or height should be assessed at each well-child visit to determine adequacy of growth. Measure head circumference until age 3 years to monitor brain growth. Perform hearing and vision screenings for children of all ages. BMI can be used to identify children who are overweight or at risk for being overweight. The normal range of vital signs varies based on the child's age. The sequence of the physical examination in children should be based on the child's developmental age, his or her level of cooperation, and the severity of the illness. Obtain heart rate and respiratory rate and auscultate the heart and lungs while the infant or young child is quiet. Perform intrusive procedures such as examination of the ears, mouth, and throat last in the infant or young child. Perform the health assessment in a head-to-toe fashion in the school-age child or adolescent, reserving the genitalia and anus examination for last. Plan the health assessment in such a way as to minimize trauma to the child or adolescent. Use age-appropriate measurement tools to assess pain in children. Allow the infant or young child to remain in the parent's lap for as much of the assessment as possible so that the child feels secure. Use age-appropriate games during the health assessment to gain cooperation in the younger child. Having the young boy sit cross-legged for a testicular examination may reduce the cremasteric reflex. The newborn may exhibit a wide variety of normal skin variations. The infant's fontanels should be soft and flat; report a bulging fontanel immediately. Jaundice (outside of the newborn period), pallor, cyanosis, and poor skin turgor indicate illness and may need immediate intervention. Heart murmurs should be assessed for intensity, location, and duration. They may be innocent or may indicate a congenital heart defect. The infant's chest wall is relatively thin, allowing upper airway sounds to be transmitted throughout the lung fields. Substernal or xiphoid retractions indicate that the child is laboring to breathe, whereas a fixed, depressed sternum (pectus excavatum) is a structural abnormality. The Tanner stages of sexual maturity provide a basis for assessing pubertal development in boys and girls. Use the breast and pubic hair charts for girls and the pubic hair and penis and scrotum size chart for boys. REFERENCES Asher, C., & Northington, L. K. (2008).

A soft and muffled heart murmur is heard in a 4-year-old patient. The mother states that she has never heard that the child has a murmur. What should the nurse do? 2. A nurse is helping a new mother breastfeed her 4-day-old baby. The mother notices that the baby has a bluish cast to the skin on his hands and that sometimes the infant has a tremor. She asks the nurse if the baby is cold, though the baby is swaddled and comfortably resting against the mother's skin. How might the nurse help teach this mother? 3. Devise a plan for encouraging cooperation of the toddler or preschooler during various parts of the physical examination. STUDY ACTIVITIES 1. In the clinical setting, obtain a health history on an infant, child, or adolescent. 2. In the clinical setting, compare the approach you use for the physical examination of a toddler versus a school-aged child or adolescent. 3. No matter how thoughtfully and appropriately you plan your assessment, odds are good that you will have difficulty assessing a 2- year-old. Discuss with your classmates the strategies that you have used for success and brainstorm with them about their ideas for assessing a crying or resistant young child.11 Caring for Children in Diverse Settings Words of Wisdom Nurses should leave their \"comfort zone\" of practice and reach out to children on their turf to make a difference.

Jake Jorgenson, 8 years old, was brought to the clinic with a history of headaches, vomiting not related to feeding, and changes in his gait. Initial testing leads to a suspected brain tumor. Jake is to be admitted to the neurologic service at a pediatric hospital for further testing and treatment. Up until this point he has been a healthy child with no previous hospitalizations. He lives at home with his parents and two siblings, Jenny, age 11, and Joshua, age 5. As a nurse on this unit, how can you help prepare Jake and his family for this hospitalization?Nursing care of the child occurs in a variety of settings, from acute care in a hospital to well and ill care in community settings, such as physicians' offices, schools, churches, health departments, community centers, and even within the child's own home. Within each setting, the nurse incorporates basic nursing care with specific strategies to help promote positive outcomes for the child, family, and community as a whole. HOSPITALIZATION IN CHILDHOOD In today's health care environment, children receive much of their care for illnesses in community health settings such as physicians' offices, urgent care settings, or day surgery centers. As a result of this trend, fewer children may actually be admitted to a hospital unit, and those who are hospitalized are generally acutely ill. In addition, hospital stays are often shorter due to economic trends in the health care environment, such as the delivery system of managed care and other factors that attempt to control costs. Acute conditions, trauma, or chronic diseases or illnesses requiring surgical intervention lead to hospitalization for children. According to Child Health USA 2010, diseases of the respiratory system account for the majority of hospitalizations in children younger than 5 years of age, while diseases of the respiratory system, mental health problems, injuries, and gastrointestinal disorders lead to more hospitalizations in older children. Adolescents between 15 and 19 years of age are often hospitalized because of problems related to pregnancy, childbearing, mental health, and injury (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, 2010). Other health problems begin before birth or immediately following birth, such as congenital heart disease or gastrointestinal atresia. Just when they are getting used to the idea of having a new child, the family must also deal with illness and possibly extended hospitalizations. Specific genetic or environmental factors also predispose the child to disease and injury, such as the genetic disorder of hemophilia or the environmental situation of homeless-ness. Many of these factors or situations put the child and family at greater risk for chronic health conditions and long periods of illness, hospitalization, and even death. Hospitalization is often confusing, complex, and overwhelming for children and their families. Reactions and responses to illness and hospitalization depend on a number of factors, including the child's developmental stage. Nursing strategies are needed to prepare children and their families for this experience while minimizing negative effects. These strategies include identifying the needs of children and families through astute assessment of nonverbal and verbal behaviors, then validating the information with accurate interpretation and providing appropriate responses and interventions. Although the nurse implements these strategies throughout the interaction with the child and family, a critical time to ensure the best outcome for the child and family is during the admission process. The nurse assesses the learning needs and abilities of the child and family. For the interventions to be successful, the nurse must communicate and teach in the most effective method for the individual child and family. The nurse also evaluates the child's and family's competence in performing specific activities prior to discharge. Children's Reactions to Hospitalization In general, children are more vulnerable to the effects of illness and hospitalization because this is a change from their usual state of health and routine. They also have limited understanding and coping mechanisms to assist them in resolving the stressors that might occur during this time. Hospitalization creates a series of traumatic and stressful events in a climate of uncertainty for children and their families, whether it is an elective procedure that is planned in advance or an emergency situation resulting from trauma. The stressors that children experience in relation to hospitalization may result in various reactions. Children react to the stresses of hospitalization before admission, during hospitalization, and after discharge. Besides the physiologic effects of the health problem, the psychological effects of illness and hospitalization on a child include anxiety and fear related to the overall process and the potential for bodily injury, physical harm, and pain. In addition, children are separated from their homes, families, and friends and what is familiar to them, which may result in separation anxiety (distress related to removal from family and familiar surroundings). There is a general loss of control over their lives and sometimes their emotions and behaviors. The result may be feelings of anger and guilt, regression (return to a previous stage of development), acting out, and other types of defense mechanisms to cope with these effects. Children's typical coping strategies are tested during this experience. Anxiety and Fear For many children, entering the hospital is like entering a foreign world. The result is anxiety and fear. Anxiety often stems from the rapid onset of the illness or injury, particularly when the child has limited experiences with disease or injury. Normal fears of childhood include the fear of separation from their parents and family or guardians, loss of control, and bodily injury, mutilation, or harm. Children's fears are similar to adult fears of the unknown, including fear of unfamiliar environments and losing control. Therefore, when the child is in the hospital, he or she becomes distressed about the unfamiliar environment; health care procedures, especially the use of needles or associated pain that may occur; and situations, such as the strange words being used, ominous-looking equipment, strangers in unusual attire (e.g., surgical caps, masks, gowns), unfamiliar and frightening noises and smells, or the sounds of other children crying. This exposure to people, situations, and procedures that may be new to them and causethem pain leads to increased anxiety and fear ( Fig. 11.1 ). Overall, hospitalization is a difficult experience for children. FIGURE 11.1 The presence of familiar objects and home routines normalizes the environment and helps the child cope with hospitalization. Reading a favorite bedtime story can be comforting. Separation Anxiety Separation anxiety is a major stressor for children of certain ages. It usually begins around 8 months and ends as the child nears 3 years of age (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2010). John Bowlby described three stages that the infant goes through during separation anxiety\u2014protest, despair, and detachment (Main, 2000). The first phase, protest, occurs when the child is separated from the parents or primary caretaker. This phase may last from a few hours to several days. The child reacts aggressively to this separation and exhibits great distress by crying, expressing agitation, and rejecting others who attempt to offer comfort. The child may also display anger and inconsolable grief. If the parents do not return within a short time, the child exhibits the second phase, despair. The child displays hopelessness by withdrawing from others, becoming quiet without crying, and exhibiting apathy, depression, lack of interest in play and food, and overall feelings of sadness. Detachment (also known as denial) is the third and final phase of separation anxiety. During this phase the child forms coping mechanisms to protect against further emotional pain. This occurs more often in long-term separations. During this stage, the child shows interest in the environment, starts to play again, and forms superficial relationships with the nurses and other children. If the parents return, the child ignores them. A child in this phase of separation anxiety exhibits resignation, not contentment. It is more difficult to reverse this stage, and developmental delays may occur. Today, health care providers primarily observe the first and second stages because of the shorter hospital stays and the more common use of a family-centered approach to care. Loss of Control When hospitalized, children experience a significant loss of control. This loss of control increases the perception of threat and affects their coping skills. They lose control over routine self-care and their usual tasks and play as well as decisions related to the care of their own bodies. In the hospital, the child's usual routine is disrupted. He or she cannot choose what to do and at what time. The child can no longer accomplish simple tasks independently as he or she does at home or school. Confinement to the bed or crib worsens this loss of control. For example, if connected to tubes or intravenous lines, the child may not even be able to visit the bathroom alone. Hospitalization also affects the child's control over decisions related to his or her own body. Many of the procedures and treatments that occur in the hospital are invasive or are at least disturbing to children, and much of the time they do not have the option to refuse to undergo them. Adults are presumed to be competent to make health care decisions, but generally children are not. Though the parents and nurses of hospitalized children have the children's best interest in mind, children often feel powerless when inthe hospital, not having their feelings and wishes respected and having minimal control over events. Take Note! When advocating for a child, make sure to include the child's voice. Do not assume what his or her wishes may be; ask about them directly. Factors Affecting Children's Reaction to Hospitalization Various factors have a great impact on the ability of children to handle illness and hospitalization. These factors may increase or diminish the fears of the child who is ill and hospitalized. Each child responds differently and will perceive the hospital experience differently. Box 11.1 lists the various factors affecting a child's response to illness and hospitalization. BOX 11.1 FACTORS AFFECTING A CHILD'S RESPONSE TO ILLNESS AND HOSPITALIZATION Amount of separation from parent/caregiver Age Developmental level Cognitive level Previous experience with illness and hospitalization Recent life stresses and changes Type and amount of preparation Temperament Innate and acquired coping skills Seriousness of the diagnosis/onset of illness or injury (e.g., acute or chronic) Support systems available, including the family and health care professionals Cultural background Parents' reaction to illness and hospitalization Developmental Level The child's age, cognitive level, and developmental level will affect his or her perceptions of actual events, and this in turn will affect his or her reaction to illness and hospitalization. Children's responses to the stressors of fear, separation anxiety, and loss of control vary depending on their age and developmental level. Younger children, with their limited life experience and immature intellectual capacities, have a more difficult time comprehending what is happening to them. This can be particularly true for toddlers and preschoolers, who perceive the intactness of their bodies to be exposed during physical intrusions. In addition, they frequently interpret illness as punishment for wrongdoing or hospital procedures as hostile, mutilating acts. Although children are increasingly able to adapt as they grow older, lack of understanding about the need for hospitalization and threatened sense of control can make adaptation difficult. INFANTS Newborns and infants are adapting to life outside the womb with rapid growth and development and establishment of a healthy attachment to parents or primary caregivers. They are dependent on others for nurturance and protection. They gain a sense of trust in the world through rhythmic and reciprocal patterns of contact and feeding, resulting in bonding to the primary caregiver. They need a secure pattern of restful sleep, satisfaction of oral and nutritional needs, relaxation of body systems, and spontaneous response to communication and gentle stimuli. The caregiver-infant attachment is critical for psychological health, especially during periods of illness and hospitalization. Unfortunately, during illness and hospitalization, these critical patterns of feeding, contact, comfort, sleeping, elimination, and stimulation are disrupted, resulting in fear, separation anxiety, and loss of control. By 5 to 6 months of age, infants have developed an awareness of self as separate from mother. As a result, infants of this age are acutely aware of the absence of their primary caregiver and become fearful of unfamiliar persons. Infants may be separated from their parents when hospitalized if the parents cannot room-in because of hospital policy or if they must work or care for other children. This results in separation anxiety. The infant's oral needs, the basic source of infant satisfaction, are often not met in the hospital due to the condition of the child orthe procedures that must be performed. The infant is accustomed to having his or her basic needs met by the parent when he or she cries or gestures. The constraints of hospitalization result in loss of control over the environment, leading to additional anxiety in the infant. TODDLERS Toddlers are more aware of self and can communicate their desires. Because their autonomy is developing, toddlers need to master accomplishments to minimize the development of shame and doubt. Control becomes an issue for toddlers. Toddlers also need opportunities to explore, and they need consistent routines. In addition, toddlers are aware of the need for care and protection from others, so they need familiarity and closeness to the primary caregiver. When the toddler is hospitalized, disruption occurs in this development of autonomy. Toddlers are often fearful of strangers and can recall traumatic events. Simply walking toward the treatment room where a traumatic procedure previously occurred may upset the toddler. Ordinarily a resurgence in separation anxiety occurs during the toddler years. When the toddler is separated from his or her parents or caregivers in an unfamiliar environment, separation anxiety is compounded. In response to this anxiety, toddlers may demonstrate behaviors such as pleading for the parents to stay, physically trying to go after the parents, throwing temper tantrums, and refusing to comply with usual routines. Restrictions related to mobility and new skill acquisition result in loss of control. Disruption in usual routines also contributes to loss of control, and the toddler feels insecure. As a result, regression in toilet training and refusal to eat are common reactions in toddlers. PRESCHOOLERS The preschooler has better verbal and developmental skills to adapt to various situations, but illness and hospitalization can still be stressful. Preschoolers may understand that they are in the hospital because they are sick, but they may not understand the cause of their illness. Preschoolers fear mutilation and are afraid of intrusive procedures since they do not understand the body's integrity. They interpret words literally and have an active imagination. Therefore, when the nurse says, \"I need to take some blood,\" preschoolers' fantasies may run wild. They may not understand the concept of blood and may think everything will come out of their body. They may think that blood is \"taken\" the same way a child picks up a toy to take it out of the room. Preschoolers' thinking is egocentric; they believe that some personal deed or thought caused their illness, which can lead to guilt and shame. These feelings may be internalized. Overall, preschoolers' concrete, egocentric, and magical thinking (type of thinking that allows for fantasies and creativity) limits their ability to understand, so communication and interventions must be on their level. Separation anxiety may not be as much of an issue as it is for toddlers since preschoolers may already be spending time away from parents in preschool. They are, however, still acutely aware of the comfort and security that their family provides for them, so disruptions in these relationships lead to challenges. The preschooler may constantly ask for his or her parents or ask to call the parents. He or she may quietly cry, refuse to eat or take medication, or generally be uncooperative. In addition, the hospitalized preschooler loses control over the environment. The preschooler is naturally curious about his or her surroundings and learns best by observing and working with objects. This might be limited during hospitalization. Because the preschooler cannot participate in typical activities and explore the environment as usual, the child's normal creative, curious nature may give rise to a variety of fantasies that may present challenges. SCHOOL-AGE School-age children generally are hospitalized because of long-term illnesses or trauma. The general task of their development stage, to develop confidence through a sense of industry, can be disrupted during hospitalization. Even at this time, they generally want to continue to learn and maintain their skills and abilities. The stress of illness or anxiety related to diagnostic tests and therapeutic interventions may lead to inward or outward expressions of distress. If they have learned various coping skills, this distress may be minimized. After 11 years of age there is an increased awareness of physiologic, psychological, and behavioral causes of illness and injury. Typically, the school-age child has a more realistic understanding of the reasons for the illness and can better comprehend explanations. School-age children are concerned about disability and death, and they fear injury and pain. They want to know why procedures and tests are being performed. They can understand cause and effect and how it relates to their illness. They are uncomfortable with any type of sexual examination. Separation anxiety is not as much of an issue for school-age children. They are accustomed to periods of separation and may already be experiencing some separation anxiety related to being in school. At the same time, they may be missing school and friends as they try to adjust to the unfamiliar environment. They may feel that friends will forget them if they remain in the hospital for a long time. Some school-age children may regress and become needy, demanding their parents' attention or playing with special \"comfort toys\" they used at a younger age.Since school-age children are accustomed to controlling self-care and typically are highly social, they like being involved. They are used to making choices about meals and activities. Hospitalization presents loss of control by limiting their activities, making them feel helpless and dependent. This may result in feelings of loneliness, boredom, isolation, and depression. The key is to give them opportunities to maintain independence, retain a sense of control, enhance self-esteem, and continue to work toward achieving a sense of industry. ADOLESCENTS Adolescents fear injury and pain. Since appearance is important to them, they are concerned with how the illness or injury will affect their body image. Anything that changes their perceptions of themselves has a major impact on their response. Typically, adolescents do not like to be different; they like \"being cool,\" which means being in control and not showing how afraid they really are. They also may feel ambivalent about wanting their parents. Adolescents typically do not experience separation anxiety from being away from their parents; instead, their anxiety comes from being separated from friends. Loss of control is a key factor affecting the behavior of adolescents who are hospitalized. Anger, withdrawal, or general lack of cooperation may occur due to the feelings of loss of control. In addition, their desire to appear confident may lead them to question everything that is being done or that they are asked to do. Their feelings of invincibility may cause them to take risks and be non- compliant with treatment. Overall, adolescents strive for independence, self-assertion, and liberation while developing their identity. Previous Experiences In general, children's lack of understanding and experience of illness, hospitalization, and hospital procedures contributes to their anxiety level. However, previous experience with hospitalization and other health-related experiences can either facilitate preparation or impair it if the experiences were perceived as negative. For example, the child who associates the hospital with the birth of a sibling may view this experience as positive. However, the child who associates the hospital with the serious illness or death of a relative or close friend will probably view the experience as negative. The type of experience may contribute to increased anxiety and fear if the child must be admitted to the hospital. If children have had previous experiences, how the experience unfolded and their response to it will determine many of their reactions to hospitalization. Older children may cling to their parents, kick, or create a scene because of their previous experience. Recent Stresses and Changes and Individual Coping Skills The effects of hospitalization on children are influenced by the nature and severity of the health problem, the condition of the child, and the degree to which activities and routines differ from those of everyday life. A lack of sensory stimulation in the hospital environment can lead to listlessness, indifference, unhappiness, and even appetite changes. When the child's motor activity is restricted, anger and hyperactivity may result. Play, recreation, and educational opportunities can provide an outlet to distract the child from the illness, provide pleasant experiences, and help the child understand his or her condition. The child's ability to work through a situation will also affect his or her responses to illness and hospitalization. This ability depends on the age of the child, his or her perceptions of the event, previous encounters with health care personnel, and support from significant others. Box 11.2 lists various coping skills used by children and suggestions for promoting positive coping. Parents' Response to Child's Hospitalization Children take in their parents' anxiety and concern. Even whispers can set off children's imaginations. For example, preschoolers may invent elaborate stories to explain what is happening to them. Parents who do not tell children the truth or do not answer their questions confuse and frighten them and may weaken the child's trust in the parents. It is important for children to believe that someone is in control and that the person can be trusted. Some parents, however, have their own fears and insecurities. Thus, a child's reaction often is related to the parents' reaction to the illness and hospitalization. BOX 11.2 CHILDREN AND COPING Behavior/Methods for Coping Ignore or negate the problem Stoicism, passive acceptance Acting out\u2014yelling, kicking, screaming, crying Suggestions to Promote Coping Breathing techniques such as blowing bubbles, pinwheels, or party noise-makers Distraction with books or games Imagery with tapes or scenariosAnger, withdrawal, rejection Intellectualizing Music Teaching before events or procedures The relationship between the family and the hospital staff may either add to or ease the child's stress. This relationship can contribute significantly to the quality of the environment. Hospital personnel must assume responsibility for the care of hospitalized children by maintaining good partnerships with families. Remember Jake, the 8-year-old with a suspected brain tumor? What responses to hospitalization might you see in him and his family? Family's Reactions to the Child's Hospitalization Whether planned or unplanned, hospitalization increases the family's stress and anxiety level. The illness or serious injury of one family member affects all members of the family because the process disrupts the family's usual routines and may alter family roles. Parents and siblings have their own reactions to this experience. Reactions of Parents Watching a child in pain is difficult, especially when the parent is assisting with the procedure by holding the child. The parent may feel guilty for not seeking care sooner. Parents may also exhibit other feelings such as denial, anger, depression, and confusion. Parents may deny that the child is ill. They may express anger, especially directed at the nursing staff, another family member, or a higher power, because of their loss of control in caring for the child. Depression may occur because of exhaustion and the psychological and physical requirements of spending long hours in a hospital caring for a child. Confusion may develop because of dealing with an unfamiliar environment or the loss of a parental role. Finally, the parents' marriage may be strained because of dual roles, long separation, and increased stress. Reactions of Siblings Siblings of children who are hospitalized may experience jealousy, insecurity, resentment, confusion, and anxiety. They may have difficulty understanding why their sibling is ill or getting all the attention, leaving little for them. They may wonder if their sibling is going to die or ever return home. They may worry that their sibling's illness is going to happen to them. Certain age groups, such as preschoolers, may feel that they caused the illness. Little information or understanding about what is happening, combined with their magical and egocentric thinking, contributes to their fears that they may have caused the illness or injury by their thoughts, wishes, or behaviors. If the family roles or routines change significantly, the siblings may feel insecure or anxious. They may develop changes in behavior or in school performance. See Evidence-Based Practice 11.1. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 11.1 CAN EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS GEARED TOWARD SIBLINGS OF A HOSPITALIZED CHILD LOWER THEIR ANXIETY LEVELS? Studies have demonstrated that children who receive age-appropriate information handle the stress and anxiety associated with hospitalization better. Can the same hold true for siblings of the hospitalized child? STUDY In order to test the effectiveness of educational interventions on siblings of hospitalized children, a pretest-posttest control group experimental design study was performed. Fifty siblings of a child hospitalized for longer than 2 days, ages 6 to 17 years, were recruited from a children's hospital within a large university medical center. The siblings were matched according to age, sex, and race, and then placed into the control or experimental groups, with 25 siblings each in the experimental and control groups. Siblings assigned to the experimental group received interventions from a standardized educational intervention focused on teaching the sibling about hospitalization, including length of stay if known, daily routine, medical equipment in the room and/or being used on the child, illness or injury, and treatment for the child. The interventions were based on cognitive stages of development and were conducted by child life specialists on staff at the hospital.Anxiety levels were scored using the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS), which is a 37-item self-report scale entitled \"What I Think and Feel.\" Findings Siblings who received educational interventions had significantly lower levels of anxiety compared to siblings who did not receive educational interventions. Anxiety levels for the experimental group, though lower than the control group, still remained about the normative mean. Nursing Considerations Recognize that siblings of a hospitalized child often experience stress and anxiety. Provide education to the nonhospitalized child. Address the psychosocial and emotional needs of siblings of a hospitalized child. Enlist child life specialists to assist with the nonhospitalized child. Educate parents about the needs of the nonhospitalized child. Adapted from Gursky, B. (2007). The effect of educational interventions with the siblings of hospitalized children. journal of Developmental & Behavioral Pediatrics, 28(5), 392-398. Take Note! Research supports the need to provide support and information to the siblings to decrease their stress, anxiety, and confusion (Gursky, 2007). Factors Influencing Family Reactions The parenting style and the family-child relationship can influence the hospital experience as well as the family members' coping skills. Cultural, ethnic, and religious variations, values, and practices related to illness, general response to stress, and attitudes about the care of a sick child have a significant influence on the family's response. For example, religious beliefs can raise problems or can be a source of strength to the family and child. Families already in crisis or without support systems have a more difficult time dealing with the added stress of hospitalization. Chapter 2 gives further explanations of some of these influences on children and their families. Jake's parents are very upset that he has to be hospitalized. His mother says to you, \"I'm worried how Jake is going to react to all of this. What can we do to help him?\" How would you address his mother's concerns? The Nurse's Role in Caring for the Hospitalized Child In most instances, the nurse is the primary person involved in the care of a hospitalized child. The nurse is probably the first one to see the child and family and will spend more time with them than other health care personnel. Nurses are part of a medical community that makes decisions in the child's best interest, but the nurse needs to bear in mind the child's rights and must try to minimize the child's distress so that the hospital stay will be as pleasant an experience as possible. When establishing strategies to care for children in the hospital, nurses should examine the general effects of hospitalization on children in each developmental stage and should strive to understand both the reactions of the child and family to hospitalization and the factors affecting these reactions. Nursing Care Plan 11.1 summarizes the nursing care associated with a hospitalized child.In a study of hospitalized children, Crole and Smith (2002) found the nursing care for a hospitalized child occurred in four phases: introduction, building a trusting relationship, decision-making phase, and providing comfort and reassurance. All of these phases are interconnected. For example, if trust is not established, it becomes difficult to move to the next phase. The introduction phase involves the initial contact with children and their families and it establishes the foundation for a trusting relationship. Use favorite toys and common television shows to establish rapport. Allow the child to participate in the conversation without the pressure of having to comply with requests or undergo any procedures. Next, a trusting relationship can be built by using appropriate language, games, and play such as singing a song during a procedure, preparing the child adequately for procedures, and providing explanations and encouragement. Get down to the child's level and play on his or her terms. In the decision-making phase, the nurse gives some control over to the child by allowing him or her to participate in making certain decisions. This phase is critical to maintaining the trust the child has developed. For example, it is imperative to decide how much control the child will have during treatment, how much information to share with the child about upcoming events, and whether parents should participate. Reinforce the child's use of coping strategies that lead to healthy outcomes by providing options whenever it is safe to do so. Finally, the comfort and reassurance phase uses techniques such as praising the child and providing opportunities to cuddle with a favorite toy. Preparing Children and Families for Hospitalization When preparing children for hospitalization, be aware of the situations that may create distress in a child and try to minimize or eliminate them. Even the most minor situations may be frightening to young children. Remember, new experiences, unfamiliar sights and sounds, disruption of sleep patterns, and pain associated with procedures and treatments are major causes of stress for the hospitalized child and family. Table 11.1 presents some hospital activities that may seem scary or stressful to a child and gives suggestions for preparing the child and family. Thoughtful preparation for these situations may help relieve stress. Educate children about what to expect so they can cope with their imagination and distinguish reality from fantasy. Describe the intervention and the sequence of steps that will occur, and include sensory information such as how the child will feel. NURSING CARE PLAN 11.1 Overview for the Hospitalized Child and Family NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Anxiety related to hospital situation, fear of injury or bodily mutilation, separation from family or friends, changes in routine, painfulprocedures and treatments, and unfamiliar events and surroundings as evidenced by crying, fussing, withdrawal, or resistance Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child and family will exhibit a decrease in anxiety level as evidenced by positive coping strategies, verbalization or playing out of feelings, appropriate behaviors, positive interactions with staff, child and parent cooperation and participation, and absence of signs and symptoms of increasing anxiety and fear. Interventions: Minimizing Anxiety Orient child and family to the unit and the child's room to familiarize them with the facility. Assess for signs and symptoms of anxiety and fear to establish a baseline and assess effectiveness of interventions. Place the child in a room with another child of a similar age, developmental level, and condition severity to promote sharing. Provide atraumatic care to minimize exposure to distress, which would increase anxiety. Explain all events, treatments, procedures, and activities to the parents and child (at a level the child can understand) in a calm, relaxed manner to help the child prepare for what is to come and decrease fear of the unknown. A calm, relaxed manner helps to establish rapport and instill trust. Enlist the aid of a child life specialist to assist in age-appropriate preparation for all events, treatments, and procedures. Encourage parents to room-in if possible to provide the child with support; if parents cannot stay, encourage them to call to reduce child's fear of being alone. Urge parents to inform the child when they will be leaving and when they are expected to return to help child cope with their absence and promote trust. Assess child's usual routine at home and attempt to incorporate aspects of usual routine into hospital routine to ease the transition to the hospital and promote the child's participation in routine. Offer comfort measures such as holding, stroking, and rocking to relieve distress. Encourage the child to play (unstructured and therapeutic play as necessary) to allow for expression of feelings and fears and promote energy expenditure. Suggest that parents bring in a special toy or object from home to promote feelings of security. Provide positive reinforcement for participation in care activities to foster self-esteem. Assess for regression behaviors and inform parents that such behaviors are common to alleviate their concerns about this behavior. Provide consistency with care measures to facilitate trust and acceptance. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for powerlessness related to lack of control over procedures, treatments, and care, and changes in usual routine Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child and family will demonstrate an increase in control over the situation as evidenced by participation in care activities, identification of needs and choices, and incorporation of appropriate aspects of child's usual routine with that of the hospital. Interventions: Promoting Control Encourage child and parents to identify areas of concern to help determine priority needs. Encourage parent and child to participate in care activities to promote feelings of control. Incorporate aspects of child's routine at home and use terms similar to those used at home to foster a sense of normalcy. Offer child choices as much as possible, such as options for foods, drinks, hygiene, activities, or clothing (if appropriate) to promote feelings of individuality and control. Allow child opportunities for being out of bed or room within limitations as appropriate to foster independence. Work with child, as age and development allow, and family to set up a schedule to promote structure and routine. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Deficient diversional activity related to confinement in bed or health care facility, lack of appropriate stimulation from toys or peers, limited mobility, activity restrictions, or equipment as evidenced by verbalization of boredom or lack of participation in play, reading, or schoolwork Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will participate in diversional activities as evidenced by engagement in unstructured and therapeutic play that is developmentally appropriate and interaction with family, staff, and other children. Interventions: Promoting Adequate Diversional Activities Question child and family about favorite types of activities to establish a baseline for developing appropriate choices during hospitalization. Assist with planning activities within the limits of the child's condition to maintain muscle tone and strength without overexerting the child. Spend time with the child to provide stimulation and foster trust. Enlist the aid of a child life specialist to provide suggestions for appropriate activities. Encourage interaction with other children to promote sharing and avoid loneliness. Provide developmentally appropriate opportunities for unstructured and therapeutic play to facilitate expression of feelings. Encourage short trips to the playroom or activity room to provide a change of scenery and sensory stimulation. Integrate play activities with nursing care to achieve therapeutic effect. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Interrupted family processes related to separation from child due to hospitalization, increased demands of caring for an ill child, changes in role function, and effect of hospitalization on other family members such as siblings, as evidenced by parental verbalization of issues, parental presence in hospital, or child's hospitalization requiring parent to miss work Outcome Identification and Evaluation Family will demonstrate positive coping strategies and mutual support for one another as evidenced by visiting frequently and staying with the child as necessary, sharing of family responsibilities, obtaining assistance for relief or respite, and visiting by other members of the child's family and friends. Interventions: Maximizing Family Functioning Encourage parents and family members to verbalize concerns about child's illness, diagnosis, and prognosis to promote family-centered care and identify areas where intervention may be needed. Explain therapies, procedures, child's behaviors, and plan of care to parents to promote derstanding of the child's status and plan of care, which helps to decrease anxiety. Encourage parental involvement in care to promote feelings of the parents being needed and valued, providing them with a sense of control over their child's health. Identify support system for family and child to identify resources available for coping. Educate family and child on additional resources available to promote a wider base of support to deal with the situation. Suggest ways that parents can divide time between child and other siblings to prevent feelings of guilt. Provide support and positive reinforcement to promote family coping and foster family strength. Encourage frequent visits by family members, including siblings as appropriate, to promote ongoing family functioning. Stress the need for adequate rest, sleep, exercise, and nutrition for family members to promote family health and minimize stress of hospitalization on family. Assist with referrals for resources and help from additional family members and friends as necessary to allow for respite or relief of care responsibilities. Encourage family to maintain usual routine as much as possible to minimize the effects of hospitalization on family functioning. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Self-care deficit related to immobility, activity restrictions, regression, or use of equipment, devices, or prescribed treatments as evidenced by inability to feed, bathe, or dress self or accomplish other activities of daily living Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will participate in self-care within limitations of condition as evidenced by assisting with bathing and hygiene, feeding, toileting, and dressing and grooming. Interventions: Promoting Self-Care Assess child's usual routine for self-care and self-care abilities to provide a baseline for individualizing interventions. Provide child-sized equipment and devices to promote child's ability to complete the self-care task. Encourage parents and child to do as much self-care as possible, within limitations of the child's condition and developmental level, to promote feelings of independence and foster growth and development. Offer praise and encouragement for activities performed to foster self-esteem, confidence, and competence. Ensure adequate rest periods to minimize energy expenditure associated with self-care activities. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for delayed growth and development related to stressors associated with hospitalization, current condition or illness, separation from family, and sensory overload or sensory deprivation Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will demonstrate developmentally appropriate milestones as evidenced by age-appropriate behaviors and activities. Interventions: Promoting Growth and Development Assess child's developmental stage to establish a baseline and determine appropriate strategies. Use unstructured and therapeutic play and adaptive toys to promote developmental functioning. Provide stimulating environment when possible to maximize potential for growth and development. Praise accomplishments and emphasize child's abilities to foster self-esteem and encourage feelings of confidence and competence. Include parents in techniques to foster growth and development to promote feelings of control in their child's care. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Deficient knowledge related to hospitalization, surgery, treatments, procedures, required care, and follow-up as evidenced by questioning and verbalization, lack of prior exposure Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child and family will demonstrate understanding of all aspects of child's current situation as evidenced by identification of child's and family's needs, verbal statements of understanding and/or need for additional information, return demonstration of procedures and treatments, and verbalization of instructions for follow- up and continued care. Interventions: Providing Child and Family Teaching Assess child's and family's willingness to learn to ensure effective teaching. Provide family with time to adjust to diagnosis to facilitate their ability to learn and participate in the child's care. Repeat information to promote multiple opportunities for child and family to learn. Teach in short sessions to prevent overloading the child and parents with information. Gear teaching to appropriate level of understanding for the child and the family (depends on age of child, physical condition, memory) to promote learning. Provide reinforcement and rewards to facilitate the teaching/learning process. Use multiple modes of learning, such as written information, verbal instruction, demonstrations, and media, when possible to facilitate learning and retention of information. Provide the child and family with written step-by-step instructions for procedures or care to provide a reference if needed at a later date. Have child and family provide return demonstrations of care procedures to ensure effectiveness of teaching. Arrange for trial home care during hospitalization and after discharge as appropriate to ensure understanding and provide opportunities for additional teaching and learning. Good preparation can reduce the child's fears and increase his or her ability to cope with the hospital experience. Preparation should include exploring the child's perceptions, reviewing previous experiences, and identifying coping strategies. The goal should be to decrease fear and anxiety by allowing the child to better understand what is happening. Useful techniques include the following: Perform nursing care on stuffed animals or dolls and allow the child to do the same. Avoid the use of medical terms. Allow the child to handle some equipment. Teach the child the steps of the procedure or inform him or her exactly what will happen during the hospital stay. Show the child the room where he or she will be staying. Introduce the child to the health care personnel with whom he or she will come in contact. Explain the sounds the child may hear. Let the child sample the food that will be served. All techniques used to prepare the child for hospitalization should emphasize the philosophy of atraumatic care. Adapt all information to the cognitive and developmental level of the child. Identify what role the child will play in the situation: it is always helpful for children to have something to do, since it shows them that they are included. A rehearsal of what will occur in the hospital allows the child to become comfortable with the situation. If time permits, provide pamphlets that describe the procedure and suggest preparation activities for the child at home before admission. The child and family may be able to take a tour of the hospital unit or the surgical facility. Videotapes or DVDs, photographs, and books on hospitalization and surgery can serve as resources for the family and child. Many institutions offer programs to familiarize children and families with the hospital experience with a guided tour. During the tour, opportunities are provided for role-playing, and during stops along the way the child can see, touch, and feel the equipment that may be used ( Fig. 11.2 ). If the tour guide notes a child or family member is really scared or concerned about something, the pediatric staff can be alerted and therefore address this issue, further leading to improved family-centered care. The American Society of Anesthesiologists has prepared a coloring book entitled My Trip to the Hospital (American Society of Anesthesiologists, 1998). This book is designed to alleviate some of the fears that younger children may have related to the hospital experience. It describes the process from admission (whether it be to the hospital or ambulatory surgery center) through discharge and includes information about preoperative testing, anesthesia, and recovery. The book also includes information for parents. A link to the book's website is listed on . FIGURE 11.2 A child is being prepared for hospitalization by becoming familiar with some of the equipment that might be used. Parents are instrumental in preparing children by reviewing the materials that are given, answering questions, and being truthful and supportive. Teaching Guidelines 11.1 provides suggestions for parents in preparing their child for hospitalization. Teaching Guidelines 11.1 PREPARING YOUR CHILD FOR HOSPITALIZATION Read stories about experiences with hospitals or surgery. Talk about going to the hospital and what it will be like coming home. Be honest and encourage the child to ask questions. Visit the hospital and go through the preadmission tour if time permits. Provide support to the child via your presence, telephone calls, and special items brought from home. Encourage the child to draw pictures to express how he or she is feeling. Include siblings in the preparation. Take Note! Remember to enlist the assistance of the child life specialist, if possible, to assist with preparing children and families for hospitalization. Admitting the Child to the Facility Admitting the child to the facility involves preparing him or her for admission and introducing the child to the unit where he or she will be staying. Use the appropriate hospital forms. Chapter 8 gives general information about communicating with and teaching children and families. In today's health care environment, the admission process occurs quickly, with little time for extensive preparation; this is why preparation before admission is so important. Of course, the urgency of the child's medical condition also may limit the amount of preparation that can be done in advance. TYPES OF ADMISSIONS AND NURSING CARE The hospital units to which a child may be admitted include: General inpatient unit Emergency and urgent care department Pediatric intensive care unit Outpatient or special procedures unit Rehabilitation unit or hospital Regardless of the site of care, nursing care must begin by establishing a trusting, caring relationship with the child and family. Smile, introduce yourself, and give your title. Let the child and family know what will happen and what is expected of them. Ask the family and child what names they prefer to be called by. Maintain eye contact at the appropriate level. With a younger child, start with the family first so the child can see that the family trusts you. Communicate with children at age-appropriate levels. The next step, as the child's medical condition allows, involves an orientation to the hospital unit. Briefly explain policies and routines and the personnel who will be involved in the care of the child. During the nursing interview that follows, obtain information about the child's history, routines, and reason for admission. Obtain baseline vital signs and height and weight, and perform a physical assessment. Each health care setting has its own policies and procedures for this. Recognize the needs of the family and child during this process. If some of this information already exists, do not ask for it again, except to confirm vital information such as allergies, medications taken at home, and history of the illness. Typically, the information is collected immediately if the child's condition is urgent; otherwise, the information is collected within 8 hours, except for the information that is required for safe care. General Inpatient Unit Stays. Today, general inpatient unit stays for children are shorter and involve more acute conditions, resulting in little time for admission preparation. Many times the admission procedure and treatment actually occur simultaneously. Sometimes the stay is in a special 23-hour observation unit so the child is in the setting for less than 24 hours. General hospital stays may be in a pediatric hospital, a pediatric unit in a general hospital, or a general unit that occasionally admits children. General units often lack child-oriented services, such as play areas, child-size equipment, and staff familiar with caring for children. Take Note! When a child is admitted to a general unit, take extra time to orient and explain the routines and procedures to the child and family. Emphasize that the parents can stay with the child (if institutional policy permits). If possible, place the child in a room close to the nurses' station and order food appropriate for the child's age and developmental level. Emergency and Urgent Care Departments. A major cause for illness and hospitalization in children is injuries from accidents (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services dministration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, 2010). Many times a family's first experience with the acute care setting is the urgent care or emergency department. Due to the situation, the child and family may experience increased anxiety, and it may become overwhelming as uncertainties develop and critical decisions must be made. The family may be frightened, insecure, and in a state of shock.Procedures and tests are performed quickly, with minimal time for preparation. The family is often ill prepared for the visit, having little money or clothing with them. Siblings may be present if the parents did not have time to get a sitter. Due to the fast pace of the emergency department, the family may be hesitant to ask questions, so keep the family and child well informed. Allow the family to stay with the child, provide support, and allow the family, and when appropriate the child, to participate in decisions. Families may have a strong fear of the unknown and may be terrified that the child will die or be permanently disabled. Help the family to identify their concerns and their support systems. Prepare them for what they will experience. Provide comfort such as holding, touching, talking softly, and other appropriate interventions according to age and developmental level. Pediatric Intensive Care Units. The pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) specializes in caring for children in crisis. The same principles and concepts of general care of children apply to this setting, but everything is intensified. Families will be faced with an unfamiliar, high-tech environment and a large number of staff. Families must deal with the critical situation that brought them to the PICU. The child will likely experience pain, unusual noises, and increased stimulation and will probably undergo uncomfortable procedures. Parents may face the possibility of losing their child. Sometimes the child cannot talk, eat, or display other appropriate developmental behaviors. Sensory overload (increased stimulation) or sensory deprivation (lack of stimulation) can affect both child and family. Welcome families (if institutional policy permits) and encourage them to stay with the child and participate in care. Explain everything to the parents and, when appropriate, to the child. Frequently touch the child and encourage the parents to comfort him or her. Listen for clues about what the child and family need during the PICU stay. Isolation Rooms. Isolation rooms are used for situations involving the risk for infection. When a child is admitted with an infectious disease, or to rule out an infectious disease, or if the child has impaired immune function, isolation will be instituted. Children in this setting may experience sensory deprivation due to the limited contact with others and the use of personal protective equipment such as gloves, masks, and gowns. Encourage the family to visit often, and help them to understand the reason for the isolation and any special procedures that are required. Introduce yourself before entering the room and allow the child to view your face before applying a mask, if possible. Continue to have contact with the child and hold or touch the child often, especially if the parents are not present. Rehabilitation Units. The rehabilitation unit provides care for children beyond the initial period of illness or injury. The care involves an interdisciplinary approach that assists the child to reach his or her potential and achieve developmental skills. For example, rehabilitation units help children regain abilities lost due to neurologic injuries or serious burns. The facilities often resemble a home environment, with special services to help children to relearn activities of daily living and to help them deal with the physical or mental challenges associated with the original illness or injury. Typically, families are encouraged to participate and are given support for their child's eventual return home. There is a balance of nurturing and firm discipline while the child reclaims independence. Addressing the Effects of Hospitalization Developmentally When addressing the fears, separation anxiety, and loss of control that occur in hospitalized children, the nurse should consider the child's age and cognitive or developmental level. Interventions are then based on how the child experiences these stressors at that age or developmental level. The content, timing, setting, and method of preparation are also based on the child's age and cognitive or developmental level. General guidelines for addressing fear and anxiety, separation anxiety, and loss of control are provided in Box 11.3. BOX 11.3 GUIDELINES TO ADDRESS THE GENERAL EFFECTS OF HOSPITALIZATION Minimizing Fear and Anxiety Prepare the child and family for hospitalization and procedures. Explain everything to the child and their families before it occurs (see Chapter 8 ). Use age-appropriate communication techniques. Include the family in this process so they can help the child cope with fears. Allow time for children to play out their fears and concerns. Talk to the child and parents using a soft, friendly, comforting tone of voice. Have a calm, empathetic approach when caring for the child.Addressing/Minimizing Separation Anxiety Know the stages of separation anxiety and be able to recognize them. Remember that behaviors demonstrated during the first stage do not indicate that the child is \"bad.\" Encourage the family to stay with the child and always use a family-centered approach to care. Help the child cope, and intervene before the behaviors of detachment occur. Addressing Loss of Control Minimize physical restrictions, altered routines and rituals, and dependency issues, because they produce loss of control. Allow as much independence as possible within the constraints of the diagnosis. Allow the child to participate in care and decisions regarding care whenever possible. NEWBORNS AND INFANTS Assess the development or lack of development that is occurring in the infant, and assess the baby's attachment to the parents or primary caregivers. The infant's facial expression is the most consistent indicator of pain or bodily injury. To decrease fear and minimize separation anxiety, avoid separation from the primary caregiver if possible; this will also promote healthy attachment. If the parent or primary caregiver cannot stay with the infant, arrange for volunteers to provide consistent comfort to the baby. Maintaining the infant's home routine related to sleep and feeding helps decrease feelings of loss of control. Weigh the infant daily, at the same time, on the same scale. Monitor intake and output closely. Be alert to signs of discomfort other than crying, such as a furrowed brow or tense body posture. Additional nursing goals related to ensuring safety and promoting growth and development of the infant are presented in Table 11.2 . TODDLERS Key nursing concerns when caring for toddlers are separation anxiety, growth and development, and autonomy. Establishing a trusting relationship with the toddler through nonthreatening play may decrease the amount of fear the toddler feels. Be alert to subtle, nonverbal indicators of grief or discontent. Encourage the parent or primary caregiver to stay with the toddler in the hospital to decrease separation anxiety. Maintaining the home routine related to meals and sleep or a nap provides structure and may help decrease the toddler's feelings of loss of control. If indicated, weigh the toddler daily. Closely monitor intake and output. Refer to Table 11.2 for additional nursing considerations related to ensuring safety and promoting growth and development in the hospitalized toddler. PRESCHOOLERS Nursing care for hospitalized preschoolers focuses on their special needs, fears, and fantasies. When working with preschoolers, remember that they use magical thinking and fantasy. Be honest and specific, providing information just prior to the intervention to allay the child's fears. As with toddlers, encouraging parental involvement may decrease the amount of separation anxiety the preschooler experiences while in the hospital. Allowing the preschooler to make simple decisions such as which color bandage to use or whether to take medicine from a cup or syringe helps the child to feel some sense of control. Table 11.2 gives specific nursing considerations related to ensuring safety and promoting growth and development for the preschooler in the hospital. SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN Provide honest information using concrete, meaningful words to the school-age child to minimize fear of the unknown. School-age children are still very attached to their parents, so encouraging parental involvement or rooming-in decreases separation anxiety. Involve the child in making simple decisions and planning the schedule as appropriate to give him or her a sense of control. Nursing considerations when caring for hospitalized school-age children include ensuring safety and promoting growth and development (see Table 11.2 ). ADOLESCENTS The adolescent may or may not express fears. Educate the teen honestly; younger teens require more concrete explanations, while older teens can process more abstract concepts. Respect the teen's need for privacy. Encourage visits from the adolescent's friends to minimize anxiety related to separation. Prepare a mutually agreeable schedule with the teen, as appropriate, that includes the teen's preferences while incorporating the required nursing care. Collaborating with the adolescent will provide the teen with increased control. Refer to Table 11.2 for additional nursing considerations related to care of the adolescent in the hospital. Think back to Jake, the 8-year-old from the beginning of the chapter. Discuss nursing care you could provide that willhelp minimize stressors. Preparing the Child and Family for Surgery If the child is to undergo a surgical procedure, whether in the hospital or an outpatient setting, special interventions are necessary. The parents should be allowed to stay with the child until surgery begins. Parents should also be allowed to be with the child when he or she wakes up in the postanesthesia recovery area. Good preparation provides reassurance and comfort to the child and allows him or her to know what will happen and what is expected of him or her. Preoperative care for the child who is to undergo surgery is similar to that for an adult. The major difference is that the preparation and teaching must be geared to the child's age and developmental level. Table 11.3 discusses strategies for preoperative teaching. Many facilities offer special programs to help prepare children and families for the surgical experience. Presurgical preparation programs allow children and their families to experience a \"trial run\" in a supportive environment to reduce anxiety, increase knowledge, and enhance coping skills (Justus et al., 2006). Books, including the one cited earlier by the American Society of Anesthesiologists, are helpful in preparing the child and family. Child and family teaching is essential. Like any intervention, adapt the teaching to the child's developmental level. For example, when teaching a toddler or preschooler about breathing exercises, have the child blow a pinwheel or cotton balls across the table through a straw. The child will enjoy the activity while also reaping the respiratory benefits of the activity. In preparation for surgery, use items such as stuffed animals or dolls to help children understand what is going to happen to them ( Fig. 11.3 ). Allow the child to role-play various experiences with dolls. Dolls designed to simulate surgical experiences have been developed. For example, Shadow Buddies are custom-made dolls that have the same illness or surgery as the child; the doll may have an ostomy, a scar, or a catheter (Shadow Buddies Foundation, n.d.). The dolls were developed to help children cope with their illness or disease and send the message that it is okay to be different. These dolls also provide the child with a companion to talk to. Visit for a link to the Shadow Buddies website.Maintaining Safety During Hospitalization Safety is a critical aspect of care of the child in the hospital. Due to their age and developmental level, children are vulnerable to harm. Ensure the child has an identification band in place at all times. Sometimes in implementing interventions an armband is removed, so make sure it is attached to another extremity. Monitor children closely to avoid accidents such as a child pushing the wrong knob, picking up a piece of equipment or supplies left in the bed or room, or climbing out of bed ( Fig. 11.4 ). See Table 11.2 , which highlights nursing goals for ensuring safe, developmentally appropriate care for the hospitalized child. USE OF RESTRAINTS When caring for children, some type of restriction may be necessary. The restriction, often referred to as a restraint, may be needed to ensure the child's safety, allow a therapeutic or diagnostic procedure to be done, immobilize a body part or limit movement, or prevent disruption of prescribed therapy. However, restraints can be overused and can cause harm (Joint Commission Resources, 2008). As a result, each facility will have specific procedures and policies in place related to the use of restraints based on standardsdeveloped by the Joint Commission, regulations developed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state law, and facility requirements (Joint Commission Resources, 2008). These procedures and policies are designed to safeguard children's physical safety and psychological well-being. FIGURE 11.3 Using a stuffed animal to explain a surgical procedure to the child. According to these standards, hospitals are required to have a policy in place that specifies the following (Department of Health & Human Services, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2006; Disability Rights California, 2008; Joint Commission Resources, 2008): Reason for the restraint Client assessment parameters identifying the need for the restraintFIGURE 11.4 Safety is an essential aspect of pediatric nursing. A clear plastic cover over the crib prevents the older infant or toddler from climbing out and falling. Use of at least one alternative method for restriction before using a restraint Use of the least restrictive type of restraint for the purpose after the decision is made that a restraint is necessary Need for a written order by a licensed independent practitioner (LIP) within 1 hour of application of the restraint Need for face-to-face evaluation by LIP within 1 hour of application of the restraint In addition, the Joint Commission standards and CMS regulations also identify the need for specific staff training and frequent assessment and appropriate discontinuation of use. Take Note! Always refer to your institution's policy regarding restraint use. Restraints can promote physical distress in a child and be stressful for the parents as well. Children also may view restraints as punishment. Before a restraint is used, other measures need to be tried (Joint Commission Resources, 2008). Take Note! When deciding whether it is necessary to restrain a child, consider the child's age, developmental level, mental status, and threat to others and self. Explain why the child should not touch the intravenous site or should maintain a certain position so that he or she has a basic understanding of what is necessary. This may be all that is necessary for an older child. One-to-one supervision and behavior modification techniques may be other alternatives to the use of restraints. A traumatic Care Therapeutic hugging should be used for procedures and treatments, such as intravenous line insertion, where the child needs to remain still. Refer to Chapter 8 for further information. If it is determined that a restraint is needed, select the most appropriate, least restrictive type of restraint (Disability Rights California, 2008). For example, if the child has an intravenous catheter in the antecubital space that stops flowing when the child bends the arm, an elbow restraint or arm board, rather than a soft wrist restraint or four-point extremity restraint, would be appropriate. Table 11.4 lists the types of restraints and the major issues associated with the use of restraints in children. Take Note! When selecting a restraint, the nurse must choose the least restrictive type and apply it for the shortest time necessary (Department of Health & Human Services, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2006). Before applying a restraint, explain the reason for the restraint to the child and the parents. Emphasize that the rationale is to maintain the child's safety; the restraint is not punishment. Having the child and parents state the reason for the restraint demonstrates their understanding. A written order for the restraint and an evaluation of the child by an LIP must occur within 1 hour of applying the restraint (Department of Health & Human Services, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2006). In addition, the nurse must do the following: Ensure that the restraint fits properly. Secure the restraints with ties to the bed or crib frame, not the side rails. Use a clove-hitch type of knot to secure the restraints with ties (this allows for quick, easy access and release of the restraint). Check restraints 15 minutes following initial placement and then every hour for proper placement. Assess the temperature of the affected extremities, pulses, and capillary refill, initially after 15 minutes and then every hour after placement. Remove the restraint every 2 hours to allow for range of motion and repositioning, with documentation of this process and any findings. Encourage parent participation, providing continuous explanations about the reasons for the restraints and tentative time frame for use. Offer positive reinforcement to the child and parents. Review the criteria for removing the restraints; document removal and continued assessment. It is important the nurse is familiar with federal standards and regulations and he or she should always follow facility policy and procedures. unit, such as the playroom or treatment room; or for discharge. When the child is transported to other areas, specific guidelines need to address safety issues, the age and developmental level of the child, the child's physical condition, and thedestination. These factors need to be considered before transport so that the appropriate method can be used with the least amount of risk for the child. Various methods to transport children include carrying the infant and using strollers, wagons, or rolling beds ( Fig. 11.5 ). If possible, the parents should accompany the child to offer support and comfort. TRANSPORT OF THE CHILD Children may need to be transported to other units for diagnostic tests or surgery; to different areas in the same When carrying an infant, good support of the back and head is vital. Rails should be up on all beds and wagons. Use safety belts with strollers and wheelchairs. Take Note! Never leave a child unattended during transport. Keep the child visible at all times during the transport. FIGURE 11.5 Methods for transporting the infant or child. (A) Cradle method for carrying infants up to 3 months of age. One hand grasps the infant's thighs; the other arm supports the infant's head and back. (B) The \"over-the-shoulder\" method for carrying infants up to 7 months of age. Support the head if the infant does not have head control. (C) Football method for carrying infants up to 2 months of age. The forearm and hand support the body and head of the infant. (D) A wagon with rails and padding is used to transport small children. Providing Basic Care for the Hospitalized Child Basic care involves general hygiene measures, including bathing, hair care, oral care, and nutritional care. Young children are dependent on an adult for most, if not all, of their self-care needs. If parents are present, allow them to provide care for the child to decrease the child's stress. Older children may perform hygiene measures themselves but may need some assistance from the nurse. GENERAL HYGIENE MEASURES General hygiene measures help to maintain healthy skin, hair, and teeth. Skin is a complex structure; its primary function is to protect the tissues that it encloses and to protect itself. Injury to the child's skin may occur when inserting and maintaining an intravenous line, removing a dressing, positioning a child in bed, changing a diaper, using and removing electrode patches, and maintaining restraints. Risk factors for problems include impaired mobility, protein malnutrition, edema, incontinence, sensory loss, anemia, and infection. Agood time to assess the skin is during bath time. Bathing. Bathing infants and children is a common daily hygiene measure in the health care environment. Although the parents or primary caregiver often does this in today's family-centered environment, the nurse is still responsible for ensuring that bathing is done safely and hygienically. Adhere to safety principles to prevent falls, burns, and aspiration of water. Never leave a child alone in a bathtub. Use a gentle, pH-balanced soap with moisturizer if there is a need to rehydrate the skin. Note any condition that might require special considerations or further assessment, such as paralysis, loss of sensation, surgical incisions, skin traction/cast, external lines (intravenous lines, urinary catheters, or feeding tubes), or other alterations in skin integrity. Pay close attention to the ears, between skinfolds, the neck, the back, and the genital area for alterations in skin integrity. Table 11.5 highlights specific developmental considerations for bathing. Before bathing and performing other hygiene measures, assess the family's preferences and home practices for the child, such as time of day, rituals, special equipment, and allergies to products. This is a good time to assess the amount of assistance that might be required by the parents and to address learning needs related to hygiene. Follow general guidelines in bathing any client with regard to equipment, room temperature, privacy, and use of products such as deodorant and lotion. Hair Care. Lying in bed can make the hair matted and tangled. Avoid pulling on the child's hair when combing or brushing it. If necessary, use commercial detangling solutions to ease combing. If the hair requires washing, this is often done during the daily bath for infants. Typically, shampooing once or twice a week is sufficient for younger children. Adolescents may need more frequent shampooing due to the increase in sebaceous gland secretion. The frequency of shampooing also varies based on the child's condition; for example, if the child has experienced diaphoresis, more frequent shampooing may be indicated. Shampooing may be done at the bedside with specially adapted equipment, at a readily accessible sink while the child is sitting in a chair or lying on a stretcher, or in a tub or shower. Commercial no-rinse shampoos may be available for use. With these products, the shampoo is applied to the hair and then brushed or combed out. If the child uses a tub or shower for hair care, monitor the child's safety throughout to ensure that the child does not slip and fall due to the slippery surface or is burned because of improper water temperature. The child's ethnicity may require special measures for hair care. For example, a child of African American descent may use a broad-toothed comb for hair care. Ask the child's parents to bring one from home if one is not available. Also ask the child and parents about any products used on the hair to make it easier to handle; the parents can bring some from home. Encourage the parents to help with braiding or plaiting of the hair if desired. Take Note! The hair of African Americans typically is easier to comb when wet, so if possible comb the child's hair soon after shampooing (Connecticut Department of Children and Families, 2008). Oral Hygiene. Oral hygiene is an important part of basic care. Wipe the infant's gums with a wet cloth after each feeding. Assist children in brushing and flossing their teeth after each feeding or meal and before bedtime. The child who is immunosuppressed needs special attention to oral hygiene, such as using soft toothbrushes and moistened gauze sponges to prevent bleeding and careful inspection of the oral cavity for areas of breakdown. NUTRITIONAL CARE Adequate nutrition is necessary for growth and development and tissue repair, so it is an essential component of care for the ill or hospitalized child.Frequently, the ill or hospitalized child experiences a loss of appetite, which can affect the child's nutritional status. This may be compounded by other problems such as nausea and vomiting and nothing by mouth (NPO) restrictions for testing or surgery. The hospitalized child may adopt feeding habits that do not fit his or her age or stage of development, such as use of a bottle in an older infant/child or a child capable of self-feeding wanting to be fed. Readoption of these feeding habits should be accommodated when possible. Take Note! Relieve pain and nausea before meals are served. If possible, schedule procedures or treatments away from mealtimes. In younger children, refusing to eat may be related to the child's feeling of separation; in others, refusing to eat may reflect the child's attempt to control the situation. Encourage parents to use gentle persuasion instead of force to assist with intake. The use of force can lead to an aversion for food that carries beyond the hospital stay into the home environment. They should give the child choices about what to eat; this reinforces the child's sense of control. Remind parents that the child's appetite will probably improve as his or her condition improves. Teaching Guidelines 11.2 provides tips for promoting nutrition in the hospitalized child. Although geared to parents, nurses also can incorporate these guidelines into the child's plan of care. Providing Play, Activities, and Recreation for the Hospitalized Child Play is an important component in the child's plan of care. Today many health care settings providing care for children have playrooms with age-appropriate toys, equipment, and other creative activities ( Fig. 11.6 ). If the facility is large enough, there may even be a separate area for teens where they can listen to music, play video games, and visit with peers. Teaching Guidelines 11.2 PROMOTING NUTRITION FOR YOUR HOSPITALIZED CHILD Check with the nurse about any restrictions related to your child's diet. Find out if intake and output are being monitored. Encourage your child to eat his or her favorite foods. Assist your child with eating or drinking as necessary; be present at mealtimes to promote socialization. Frequently offer small cups of fluid and finger foods; avoid giving large quantities at one time. Try offering fluids at different temperatures at different times for variety. Remember that children can ingest greater amounts of thin liquids (e.g., gelatin or carbonated drinks) than thicker liquids (e.g., cream soups or milkshakes). Include ice chips as fluid intake. Ice is approximately equivalent to half the same amount of water (e.g., 1 cup of ice equals a half-cup of water). Use straws (unless not allowed) and brightly colored utensils, cups, or dishes to provide contrast and stimulation. Offer the child choices; allow the child to choose what he or she wants from the menu. Avoid spicy or highly seasoned foods. Talk with the dietitian to see if any special preferences can be addressed. Offer praise to your child for what he or she eats or drinks. Never punish the child for not eating or drinking. Encourage the older child to help keep track of what he or she eats and drinks. Take Note! Avoid using the term \"playroom\" when caring for older school-aged children and adolescents. Instead, call it the \"activity room\" or \"social room.\" Doing so promotes a greater feeling of maturity and makes it more likely that they will use the area. Obviously, some children will not be able to use these facilities if their activity level is restricted or if isolation is necessary. Children may also play in their rooms. Ensure that opportunities for unstructured play are provided to all children who can engage in play. Therapeutic play may be used to teach children about their health status or to allow them to work through issues in their lives.FIGURE 11.6 Children occupied in a hospital playroom. It is important to provide age-appropriate activities for younger and older children alike. Take Note! Keep the bed or crib and playroom as \"safe\" places. Perform invasive procedures such as venipunctures in the treatment room if possible. Never perform any nursing interventions in the playroom, no matter how nonthreatening they may appear to the nurse (Leahy et al., 2008). The nurse's greatest ally in the hospital in relation to atraumatic care is the child life specialist (CLS). They not only prepare the child for procedures but also provide activities and events to encourage play and normal growth and development. UNSTRUCTURED PLAY Unstructured play allows children to control events, ideas, and relationships. Encourage parents to bring small toys and favorite stuffed animals from home to make the child feel more comfortable in the strange environment of the hospital. Children also enjoy receiving small new toys as surprises when they are hospitalized. Many children enjoy diversional activities such as playing board games or electronic games, reading books, and watching TV, videos, or DVDs. Quiet activities appropriate to the child's developmental level provide the opportunity for play and encourage the use and development of fine motor skills even if the child is confined to bed. Infants and toddlers enjoy manipulating blocks and playing with stacking toys. The preschooler may enjoy coloring, dollhouses, or playing with plastic building blocks such as Legos. School-age children and adolescents may enjoy playing video games or building a model geared toward their developmental level. PLAY AS PART OF NURSING CARE Play is also an important part of nursing care. Use play as appropriate while providing routine nursing care to the child. An example of the use of play in nursing care involves the school-age child's love of competition and games. To increase range of motion in a school-age child who is hospitalized for traction due to a fracture, have the child throw a soft sponge ball or beanbag ball into a hoop, and compete against the child. To increase deep breathing, encourage the child to blow bubbles or blow a whistle. To increase intake of fluids, help the child create a graph to chart the number of glasses of fluids he or she drinks over a period of time. Award the child a sticker, baseball card, special pencil, or other small item if he or she reaches a certain level. When using play as part of nursing care, it is important to evaluate the outcome of play. Play used in the manner described above should enhance the child's outcome. For example, for the child blowing bubbles, determine whether this activity enhanced coughing and deep breathing. THERAPEUTIC PLAY Another important aspect of play is therapeutic play. Therapeutic play is nondirected and focuses on helping the child cope with feelings and fears. Health care professionals use therapeutic play to help the child deal with the physical and psychological challenges of illness and hospitalization. Supervised play with medical equipment in the hospital environment can help children work through their feelings about what has happened to them ( Fig. 11.7 ). In a large hospital or a children's hospital, the CLS typically coordinates these activities. Goals include maintaining normal living patterns, minimizing psychological trauma, and promoting optimal development of the child. If a CLS is not available, the nurse provides this type of activity. There is a greater emphasis on the developmental and psychosocial implications of illness and hospitalization and validation of the child's voice. In emotional outlet play or traumatic play, the child acts out or dramatizes real-life stressors. For example, using a wooden hammer and pegs, a soft sponge ball, or boxing gloves can allow the child to express anger over separation from family and friends. Commercial toys such as anatomically correct dolls and puppets have removable parts so children can see various organs of the body. Sometimes younger children \"talk\" to puppets and dolls, allowing them to express their feelings to a nonthreatening \"person\" about a specific situation or what they want from the health care provider. For example, the Shadow Buddies dolls mentioned earlier in the chapter provide a way of coping with a specific condition. The company creates an ostomy buddy who has a stoma, a cancer buddy with thinning hair and a chest catheter for chemotherapy treatments, and a heart buddy who has a chest incision and a repaired heart (Shadow Buddies Foundation, n.d.). FIGURE 11.7 The nurse supervises play with medical equipment to help the child work through her feelings about being hospitalized. Other types of therapeutic play include drawing and supervised \"needle play.\" Drawing is a way for the child to express his or her thoughts and feelings. Supervised \"needle play\" assists children who must undergo frequent blood work, injections, or intravenous procedures. A doll can receive an injection as the child works out his or her anger and anxiety. Keep in mind safety and the child's growth and development level before planning this type of directed play; an adult must always be present. Promoting Schoolwork and Education During Hospitalization Promote schoolwork while the child is in the hospital. Determine the amount of schoolwork that can be done by assessing the child's condition, the availability of teachers, and the family situation. Many children's hospitals have teachers at the hospitals; there may beclassrooms too. These teachers work closely with the child's school to continue schoolwork as the child's condition permits. Hospitals without an educational staff will rely on parents to coordinate with the child's school. Parents may bring in schoolbooks and the child's homework for completion while in the hospital. This connection to the child's school helps maintain normalcy for the child and minimizes the disruption of everyday life. Addressing the Needs of Family Members Assess the factors that may influence the family's reaction to the child's hospitalization and plan the care of the child to accommodate some of these issues. Encourage families to have support systems in place before, during, and after hospitalization. The practice of family-centered care, including good communication and ensuring nursing actions address the child and family's needs and preferences, increases the child's and parents' satisfaction with the health care setting (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007). PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS As stated previously, the anxiety level of caregivers greatly affects the anxiety level of the child. Thus, it is important to help the family members work through their feelings. Parents experience many emotions when a child is hospitalized, including disbelief, anger, guilt, fear, anxiety, frustration, and depression. Visiting restrictions, unexpected changes in the child's health status, lack of information or understanding of their child's health condition, changes in their routine and roles, financial stress, and feelings of being undervalued in the care of their child all contribute to their feelings. The importance of family involvement to the well-being of the child is reflected in the philosophies, policies, procedures, and physical environments where care is delivered. The philosophy of family-centered care places the family at the core of care. The family is the primary and continuing provider of care for the child. Encourage parents to room-in with the child throughout the hospital stay, if possible. Facilities can be designed to welcome family participation. For example, having computer ports and fax machines available and providing extra meals and beds for the parents can encourage parents to participate in care. View the parents as vital members of the health care team and partners in the care of the ill child. SIBLINGS Family-centered care recognizes the need to treat the child in context of the family, including siblings. Important questions that will affect how siblings deal with the hospitalization of their brother or sister include: Was the admission an emergency? Were there previous admissions, and how did the siblings perceive those hospitalizations? How serious is the illness or trauma? Is the prognosis known? Address the siblings' possible feelings of guilt. Use educational materials, allow time for visits, send photographs back and forth between siblings, and allow siblings to talk on the phone. Providing Child and Family Teaching Not all experiences with hospitalization are negative; in fact, the experience may enhance the child's and family's coping skills, bolster self-esteem, and provide new socialization experiences. It may allow the child to master self-care skills and provides an opportunity for the child and family to learn new information. Parents may learn more about their child's growth and development skills as well as additional parenting or caregiving skills, resulting in improved parenting abilities. In addition, the child's overall health may be improved because of the hospital stay if the child receives current immunizations and the parents learn more about health care practices. The overall goals of child and family teaching are to minimize the child's and family's stress, educate them about treatment and nursing care in the hospital, and ensure the family can provide appropriate care at home upon discharge. Providing support before, during, and after hospitalization may minimize stress. Preadmission programs can introduce the child and family to the setting. During the hospital stay, forming partnerships with the child and family, using strategies to promote coping, and providing appropriate preparation for procedures, tests, and surgery serve to decrease stress. Assess the child's and family's knowledge of the illness and hospital experience. This provides a baseline for teaching. Include hospital rules in child and family teaching. Behavioral changes in hospitalized children often disturb parents or caregivers. Determine the child's usual patterns of behavior and explain to the parents about the child's reaction to hospitalization. Encourage the family to maintain consistent discipline even while in the hospital to provide structure for the child as well as to prevent discipline issues after discharge. Also discuss how siblings may react to the hospitalization, and provide appropriate teaching to the siblings. Every interaction the nurse has with the child or family provides an opportunity for teaching. Explain the purpose of even simple proceduressuch as vital signs assessment to the child and family. Provide ongoing information about the child's illness or trauma, treatment plan, and expected outcomes. Chapter 8 provides general principles related to teaching children and their families. Preparing the Child and Family for Discharge Discharge planning actually begins upon admission. The nurse assesses the family's resources and knowledge level to determine what education and referrals they may need. Upon discharge, children and their parents or caregivers receive written instructions about home care, and a copy is retained in the medical record. These instructions are individualized for the child. Generally, discharge instructions should include: Follow-up appointment information Guidelines about when to contact the physician or nurse practitioner (e.g., new or worsening symptoms or indications that the child is not improving) Diet Activity level allowed Medications, including dose, times to be given, route, adverse effects, and special instructions; any prescriptions should be included Information on additional treatments the child requires at home Specific dates for when the child may return to school or day care Names and phone numbers of agencies the family has been referred to, such as durable medical equipment providers Provide and review educational booklets that give basic health information or general care for a child with a particular disease ( Fig. 11.8 ). Videotapes, DVDs, or CD-ROMs may also be used if available. The ability to watch a procedure over and over is helpful to some families. Explain, demonstrate, and request a return demonstration of any treatments or procedures to be done at home. Provide a written schedule if the child is to receive multiple medications, tube feedings, or other medical treatments. For complicated cases, a written teaching plan may be used to provide continuity of child/family education between various nurses. As the family attempts to perform each task, document whether the caregiver continues to require assistance or prompting with the task or whether he or she can perform the task independently. Parents of children with multiple medical needs may benefit from a trial period of home care. This occurs while the child is still in the hospital, but the parents or caregivers provide all of the care that the child requires. Support the family and praise their accomplishments during this trial period. FIGURE 11.8 The nurse uses charts with pictures to perform client teaching before the child goes home.COMMUNITY CARE IN CHILDHOOD Remember Jake Jorgenson, the boy with the suspected brain tumor from the beginning of the chapter? After a long hospital stay and complications resulting from his brain tumor, Jake requires intermittent gastrostomy feedings and has frequent respiratory infections. He has been receiving nursing care at home along with therapies but is now ready to make the transition to the local elementary school. Children receive most of their health care, well and ill care, in the community setting. Nurses play an important role in the health and wellness of a community. They not only meet the health care needs of individuals but also go beyond to create interventions that affect the community as a whole. Community health nursing refers to nursing care that strives to improve the health of a specific community as a whole. For example, community health nurses working in the Department of Health and Human Services would strive to make sure that all children in their particular community were up-to-date on immunizations. Community-based nursing focuses more on providing care to the individual or family (which, of course, impacts the community) in settings outside of acute care. For example, a community-based nurse would work in the local public school to care for students' health needs. Nurses practicing in the community promote the health of individuals, families, groups, communities, and populations and promote an environment that supports health. Community Health Nursing Nursing in the community is aimed at disease prevention and improvement of the health of populations and communities. Population is defined as \"a collection of individuals who have one or more personal or environmental characteristics in common\" (Community Health Nurses Association of Canada, 2008, p. 16 ). Community can be defined as a \"specific group of people, often living in a defined geographical area, who share a common culture, values, and norms and who are arranged in a social structure according to relationships the community has developed over a period of time\" (Community Health Nurses Association of Canada, 2008, p. 16 ). Community health nurses work in geographically and culturally diverse settings. They address current and potential health needs of the population or community. They promote and preserve the health of a population and are not limited to particular age groups or diagnoses. Public health nursing is a specialized area of community health nursing. Epidemiology can help determine the health and health needs of a population and assist in planning health services. Community health nurses perform epidemiologic investigations in order to help analyze and develop health policy and community health initiatives. Community health initiatives can be focused on the community as a whole or a specific target population with specific needs. Healthy People 2020 (HP 2020) is an example of national health initiatives developed using the epidemiologic process. HP 2020 ensures that health care professionals look at the individual as well as the community. It addresses the link between the individual's health and the health of the community. Nurses play a key role in the health of a community and the individuals who reside in it. HP 2020 is the fourth edition of national health goals, which were launched in 1979. HP 2020 is a comprehensive health initiatives plan. Nurses can help the nation meet these objectives by educating those in the community on appropriate prevention strategies, such as proper immunization and smoking cessation (see individual chapters for relevant HP objectives and nursing implications). HP 2020 is available online at http://www.healthypeople.gov/HP2020/ . Refer to Chapter 1 for more information. Community-Based Nursing In the past the major role of the nurse in the community was that of the community health nurse or public health nurse. Today, nurses practice in a variety of settings within a community, such as clinics and physicians' offices, schools, shelters, churches, health departments, community health centers, and homes. Shifting Responsibilities From Hospital-Based to Community-Based Nursing Care Over the past century changes in health care, such as strained health care funding, shorter hospital stays, and cost containment, have led to a shift in responsibilities of care for children from the hospital to homes and communities. Community care, especially home care, is a rapidly growing service in the United States. Community-based care has been shown to be a cost-effective way to provide care. It emphasizes wellness and prevention. Increases in disposable income and the longevity of children with chronic and debilitating health conditions have also contributed to the continued shift of health care to the community and home setting. Advances in technology have allowed for improved monitoring of children in community settings and at home, as well as allowing complicated procedures, such as intravenous administration of antibiotics, to be done at home. Another major reason for the increase in community care, especially home care, in children is the understanding that an acute care setting is not an appropriate environment for children to grow up in (Hewitt-Taylor, 2005). Caring for children at home not onlyimproves their physical health but also allows for adequate growth and development while keeping them within their family. They are in a familiar environment with the comfort and support of family, which leads to improved care and quality of life. Role of the Community-Based Nurse With the shift in responsibilities from hospital care to community care have come changes in nursing care. More opportunities exist for nurses to provide direct care to children in the community setting, especially the home. Community-based nursing care differs from nursing care in the acute setting. In the community or home care setting, the nurse provides direct care for the child but spends more time in the role of educator, communicator, and manager than the nurse in the acute care setting. In home care the nurse spends a significant amount of time in the supervision or management role. Community-based nursing focuses on the practice of nursing that provides personal care to individuals and families in the community. Community-based nurses focus on promoting and preserving health as well as preventing disease or injury. They are educators, managers of care, and advocates along with being direct providers of care. EDUCATION AND COMMUNICATION The community-based nurse must use the principles and techniques of interpersonal communication. The nurse must be able to assess the child's and family's learning needs and their readiness to learn. As hospital stays becomes shorter and admissions to the hospital become less frequent, teaching now begins wherever the child or family enters the health care system. Many times initial teaching occurs in the community setting, especially the home. In the community-based setting, teaching is often focused on assisting the child and family to achieve independence. DISCHARGE PLANNING AND CASE MANAGEMENT Due to the short lengths of stay in acute settings and the shift to community settings for children with complex health needs, discharge planning and case management have become important nursing roles. Discharge planning involves the development and implementation of a comprehensive plan for the safe discharge of a child from a health care facility and for continuing safe and effective care in the community and at home. Modern pediatric health care focuses on an interdisciplinary plan of care designed to meet the child's physical, developmental, educational, spiritual, and psychosocial needs. Nurses coordinate the implementation of this interdisciplinary plan in a collaborative manner to ensure continuity of care that is cost-effective, quality oriented, and outcome focused. This type of care is termed case management. When the nurse functions as a case manager, child and family satisfaction is increased, fragmentation of care is decreased, and compliance is increased, leading to improved health and quality of life (White & Hall, 2006). Case management uses a system of plans, often referred to as critical paths, which are derived from standards of care with a multidisciplinary approach that produces clinical practice guidelines. Implementing this philosophy leads to outcomes that are expected as a result of delivery of that care and may lead to future payment tied to the practice guidelines. The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research and the National Guidelines Clearinghouse maintain current clinical practice guidelines, which are rooted in evidence- based practice. ADVOCACY AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT Another important role of the community-based nurse is to advocate for the child and family to ensure that their needs are being met and that they have available resources and appropriate health care services. Working in a child and family's home can lead one to become overly involved in the situation. To best serve the child and family, the community-based nurse must be an advocate and educator but avoid becoming a personal friend (Thompson, 2000). Nurses must have a basic understanding of community, state, and federal resources to ensure they are providing families with the resources they may need. One such resource important in the community-based care of children with complex medical needs is Medicaid and Medicaid waivers. Medicaid is a national program providing medical assistance for children and families with low incomes. It is jointly run by the federal and state governments but is administered state by state; therefore, provisions vary widely. Medical model waivers are state-run programs that use federal and state funds to pay for health care for people with certain medical conditions. Home- and community-based waiver programs, such as the Katie Beckett waiver (also known as the Deeming waiver), allow children and young adults with complex medical needs to be cared for at home and make them eligible for Medicaid based on their own income and assets, regardless of their parents' income (Georgia Department of Community Health, Division of Medical Assistance, 2006). Without medical waiver programs, many children with special needs would either go without health care or would be institutionalized in order to qualify for Medicaid. (Find a link to read about Katie Beckett on .)PHYSICAL CARE The community-based nurse performs less direct physical care than the nurse in the acute care setting. Many times the nurse observes the child or caregiver performing physical care tasks. Excellent assessment skills are especially important in the community care setting. The nurse often functions in a more autonomous role; after data collection, the community-based nurse will often decide whether to initiate, continue, alter, or end physical nursing care. Assessment will go beyond physical assessment of the child to include the environment and the community. Community-Based Nursing Settings Community-based nursing takes place in a variety of settings, including outpatient and ambulatory care settings, physicians' offices, clinics, health departments, urgent care centers, schools, camps, churches, shelters, and clients' homes. Community-based nurses provide well care, episodic ill care, and chronic care. They work to promote, preserve, and improve the health of children and families in these settings. OUTPATIENT AND AMBULATORY CARE Outpatient and ambulatory care is health care provided to individuals who do not require care in an acute setting. Due to advances in medical technology, more medical procedures, such as diagnostic tests, treatments, and surgeries, can be administered on an outpatient basis and do not require clients to be hospitalized. Outpatient and ambulatory care delivers convenient and cost-effective health care to children and their families, many times right within their own community. These settings allow for increased independence and permit children to return to their normal routine as quickly as possible. More and more outpatient and ambulatory care centers are opening, sponsored by health maintenance organizations (HMOs), physicians' offices, community agencies and public health departments, and hospitals. Outpatient units are used to keep hospital stays short and decrease the cost of hospitalization. Outpatient units may be a part of the hospital or a freestanding facility. The child and family arrive in the morning; the child undergoes the procedure, test, or surgery and then goes home in the evening. Examples of surgeries and procedures performed in outpatient settings include tympanostomy tube placement, hernia repair, tonsillectomy, cystoscopy, bronchoscopy, blood transfusions, dialysis, and chemotherapy. The advantages of this environment include minimal separation of the child from the family, minimal disruption of the family pattern, decreased risk of infection, and decreased cost. Disadvantages include that the unit does not have the equipment for overnight stays, so if there are complications the child will need to be transported to the hospital. Many centers offer preoperative health assessment and teaching sessions. These allow the parent and child to ask questions and resolve them before the procedure. On the day of the procedure, parents should be allowed to be with their child until the procedure begins. Parents should also be allowed to be with their child in the post-anesthesia recovery unit as quickly as possible. This provides reassurance and comfort to the child while meeting his or her physical and emotional needs. The role of the nurse in the outpatient or ambulatory setting includes admission and assessment, preoperative teaching and preparation, client assessment and support, postoperative monitoring, case management, discharge planning, and teaching. Before the procedure the nurse reviews with the family the routine to be followed and any special instructions (such as NPO orders), and familiarizes the child with the setting to help alleviate fears. This may occur during the preoperative health assessment. Take Note! Encourage the parent to bring one of the child's favorite toys, blankets, or games to make the child feel more comfortable. The nurse performs any surgical preparation and discusses intraoperative procedures as necessary. The nurse provides postoperative care and assessment of the child. Once the child's condition is stable and he or she meets the discharge criteria of the facility, the nurse reviews with the parent postoperative instructions, including pain management; care of the incision if appropriate; diet; activity, including return to school; necessary follow-up; and when to call the physician or nurse practitioner. PHYSICIAN'S OFFICE OR CLINIC, HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, AND URGENT CARE CENTERS Physicians' offices, clinics, health departments, and urgent care centers are used by children and their families for well care, episodic ill care, acute care, and care of chronic conditions. For well care and illness or injury, children are often seen by their primary care physician. They may visit a physician's office or clinic or the health department. In more acute situations or for after-hours issues that cannot wait until clinic operating hours, a child may be seen in an urgent care center or may be referred to the emergency department. The American Academy of Pediatrics discourages children and families from using urgent care centers or the emergency department for routine care, since it is difficult to provide coordinated, comprehensive family-centered care consistent with a \"medical home\"concept (see Chapter 9 on medical homes) (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009). The nurse's role in these settings includes preparing clients, collecting pertinent health information, performing assessments, assisting the physician with diagnostic testing and procedures, administering injections and medications, changing wound dressings, assisting with minor surgery, helping to maintain records, and educating the child and family about home care and when to call the physician or nurse practitioner or return to be seen. An essential component of primary care practice is telephone triage. Pediatric office nurses often fill this role. When parents feel comfortable with the providers in their child's medical home office, they often call for advice in order to treat their child at home. A telephone triage nurse needs excellent assessment and critical thinking skills along with solid training and education. The triage nurse needs to assess the child's entire situation, including current signs and symptoms, history, and home treatment. Protocols, standardized policies and procedures, and professional judgment guide the triage nurse in the decision-making process. Pediatric telephone protocols are available for purchase through the American Academy of Pediatrics ( http://www.aap.org /). The triage nurse needs to determine whether the child requires emergency care, an office visit, or home management. Good listening and the ability to maintain a calm voice when talking to parents are skills necessary for successful telephone triage. The triage nurse should not discourage parents from bringing the child into the office to be seen; triage is not meant to keep children out of the office, and if a parent is very concerned, that is reason enough to be seen. Take Note! Parents often can pick up on subtle problems in their children. They may not be able to accurately describe signs and symptoms, but they know that their child \"isn't acting right.\" Nurses must listen to parents and act on their concerns. MEDICALLY FRAGILE DAY CARE CENTERS The medically fragile child is a child whose condition is considered medically complex and requires the use of medical technology and skilled nursing interventions (Rupert & Host, 2009). The number of medically fragile children is growing. Reasons include improvements in the treatment and care of complex medical conditions, increased sophistication of medical technology, and the increase in premature deliveries. For many years these children lived in hospitals their entire lives. Due to concerns about the high cost of long-term hospitalization and the diminished quality of life for these children, alternative care settings in the community, such as medically fragile day care centers, are being developed. Medically fragile day care centers are specifically designed to meet the needs of these children. Most centers accept children who have complicated medical needs or are dependent on technology. Examples include children with multiple congenital anomalies, children who are ventilator dependent, children with respiratory conditions, children with cardiac conditions, and children with cancer. Some centers accept children with less complicated needs, such as cardiorespiratory monitoring or asthma, and some enroll children without health care needs to promote peer relationships and acceptance. Just as at a regular day care center, the parents or care- givers can drop the child off in the morning and pick the child up in the afternoon. Some centers offer after-school, weekend, or respite services. The centers usually provide needed therapies and have indoor and outdoor play areas, educational activities, and arts and crafts. Health professionals are present at these centers to provide for the children's medical, emotional, and developmental needs. Nurses trained in pediatric and neonatal care, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, child life specialists, and social workers staff the centers; some centers have respiratory therapists on site. Children are able to receive all of their prescribed therapies while at the center. Nursing care includes direct care such as administering medication and changing dressings, assessing and evaluating the child's overall condition, identifying potential medical emergencies, determining the need for changes in care or treatment and monitoring, and providing frequent treatments or interventions to maintain life and health. Most centers are located in the community to help ease transportation issues. Some centers provide transportation to and from home or school. Centers are licensed by the state day care licensing authorities or in some states prescribed pediatric extended care (PPEC) agencies. Families may be able to obtain financial assistance from their private insurance or Medicaid. Advantages of community-based services over hospitalization or home care include decreased cost, social isolation, family stress, and rehospitalization rate (Rupert & Host, 2009). SCHOOLS School nursing is a specialized practice of professional nursing and focuses on improving students' health and safety to improve their achievement and success. School nurses work to remove or minimize health barriers to learning to provide students with the best opportunity to achieve academic success. The National Association of School Nurses defines school nursing as follows: A specialized practice of professional nursing that advances the well-being, academic success, and life-long achievement of students. To that end, school nursesfacilitate positive student responses to normal development; promote health and safety; intervene with actual and potential health problems; provide case management services; and actively collaborate with others to build student and family capacity for adaptation, self management, self-advocacy, and learning (Council on School Health, 2008, p. 1052 ). See Healthy People 2020. At the heart of school nursing is the belief that all children have the ability to learn and the right to an education, and that society is best served if all children are educated (Wolfe & Selekman, 2002). School nurses provide direct health care to students along with screening and referrals for health conditions. They provide leadership for health services, such as identifying health and safety concerns in the school environment and planning and training for emergencies and disasters. School nurses promote a healthy school environment by supporting Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . healthy food services and promoting proper physical education and sports policies and practices. They promote health education through health counseling and education of students and staff. School nurses coordinate school health programs and link health service programs within the school and community. School nurses carry out a variety of roles in providing health care to children ( Fig. 11.9 ). Box 11.4 lists some of the activities of the school nurse. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . The population of students has changed over the years. Access to public schools for children with disabilities is mandated. Due to improvements in technology, children with chronic conditions or special needs live longer and enter school. There has been an increase in the number of children with psychiatric conditions such as depression, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and more serious conditions such as bipolar disorder. All have contributed to an increase in the number of children with diverse and sometimes complex health needs in the school system. The essential role of the school nurse has not changed, but the responsibilities and expectations have. School nurses are challenged to meet the growing needs of the changing school population.FIGURE 11.9 The school nurse provides nursing assessment as well as health education to students in the school setting. BOX 11.4 EXAMPLES OF ACTIVITIES OF THE SCHOOL NURSE Conduct health screenings (such as vision, hearing, and scoliosis) Assess growth and development Provide emergency first aid Train and educate staff on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), first aid, and health issues Assess, monitor, and refer students with communicable diseases Educate on health promotion and disease prevention (such as immunizations; bike and car safety; decreasing high-risk behaviors, such as smoking, drinking, drug use, and sexual activity) Serve as a resource for health issues and education Act as a liaison between home, school, and community Act as a liaison between health care provider and school Reinforce client and family health education (such as discharge instructions, self-care measures) Monitor long-term illness in students Network with community agencies and make necessary referrals Recall Jake Jorgensen, the 8-year-old boy with history of a brain tumor and resulting complex medical needs? In recent years there have been many more children with special needs attending school than ever before. This brings many challenges for the teachers, staff, and school nurses employed by the school district. The principal of Jake's elementary school tells the school nurse that many of the teachers and staff have expressed concerns that they do not know anything about the health care needs of these children, including Jake. What kinds of interventions might the nurse plan?Just as nurses in the acute care setting develop nursing care plans, nurses in the school setting develop Individualized Health Plans (IHPs). An IHP formalizes the plan of support for a student with complex health care needs. It is a written agreement developed as part of an interdisciplinary collaboration of school staff along with the student, the student's family, and the student's health care provider. The plan describes the student's needs and how the school plans to meet these needs. The nurse plays a critical role in developing these plans. The nurse will use the nursing process and then, based on the nursing assessment and diagnosis, will develop goals and interventions to ensure that the child's needs are being met. Examples of students who may need an IHP are students with asthma, serious allergies, chronic conditions such as type 1 diabetes, physical disabilities, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and medication needs. Figure 11.10 gives an example of an IHP for a child with asthma. Take Note! The IHP needs to include directions for care while the child is at school and also must take into account circumstances that may affect the student's health care needs, such as variations in school routine, absence of staff, special outings such as field trips and extracurricular activities, and a plan in case of emergency. OTHER COMMUNITY SETTINGS Nurses work in a variety of different settings within the community. Their primary focus continues to be on promoting health, preventing disease and injury, and ensuring a safe environment. Nurses play important roles in child care centers, camps, health department clinics, and shelters. In child care centers, nurses help address infection control issues and assess for a safe environment. They provide education and training to staff members. A camp nurse ensures a safe environment for all campers and provides first-aid and acute illness care as needed. Camps for children with special needs exist, staffed by specially trained nurses. These camps cater to children with complex health care needs, such as diabetes, head injuries, and physical disabilities, and allow the children the opportunity to experience camp life while providing a safe environment and necessary medical care. Health department and shelter nurses focus on health supervision services and connecting clients to needed community resources. Take Note! Nurses have a unique opportunity to give back to their community by volunteering their services in various settings, such as shelters and clinics in medically underserved areas. HOME HEALTH CARE Home care provides short- or long-term services for children and their families in the home. It also is used for medically needy and technology-dependent children, such as ventilator-dependent children. Among those who often benefit from home care are children with acute illness, such as a child with osteomyelitis requiring intravenous antibiotics, or chronic health care issues, such as a child with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, who may have required traditional in-hospital care. Home care is geared toward the needs of the child and family. Private-duty nursing care is used when more extensive care is needed; it may be delivered hourly (several hours per day) or on a full-time, live-in basis. Periodic visiting nurse care is used when the child needs intermittent interventions such as intravenous antibiotic administration, follow-up with child and family teaching, and periodic monitoring, such as bilirubin monitoring. The goals of nursing care in the home setting include promoting, restoring, and maintaining the health of the child. Home care focuses on minimizing the effects of the illness or disability, along with providing the child or family with the means to care for the illness or disability at home. Nurses in the home care setting are direct providers of care, child and family educators, child and family advocates, and case managers. There are some disadvantages to home care. The presence of health care professionals in the home can be an intrusion on family privacy. Also, caring for children with complex medical needs can be overwhelming for some families. Financial issues can become a large burden: families may have higher out-of-pocket costs if their insurance does not reimburse for home care. Having one parent at home full time and not earning an income can contribute to increased financial strain, not to mention social isolation of that parent. All of these can lead to increased stress on family members. The advantages of home care usually outweigh the disadvantages, but nurses need to be aware of these potential disadvantages and provide support and resources as necessary.FIGURE 11.10 Example of an individualized health plan. (Adapted from Arnold, M. J., & Silkworth, C. K. [1999]. The school nurse's source book of individualized healthcare plans: Issues applications in school nursing practice, Vol. II. North Branch, MN: Sunrise River Press; and Zentner-Schoessler, S. [1997]. Computerized version and manual, Vol. I. North Branch, MN: Sunrise River Press.) Family-Centered Home Care. Family-centered care is a challenging pediatric nursing philosophy and is driven by evidence that a nurturing environment improves the chances of positive outcomes for the child. It places the family in a central position relative to the child and to the child's plan of care. Refer to Chapter 8 for further information regarding family-centered care. Family-centered home care focuses on increasing support for the emotional and developmental needs of the child. It encourages families to care for their children at home while health care professionals provide the support, empowerment, education, and expertise in caring for the child that they need. In family-centered home care, the family and health care professionals build a partnership of trust to meet the needs of the child. The nurse must value the role of the family and regard family members as the ultimate experts in caring for their child. In home care the family is extensively involved in the child's care, and the home care nurse is there to facilitate this. Any illness, especially a chronic illness, affects the entire family and can disrupt family structure. There is a change in the role of the parent when he or she has to care for an ill child. These role changes can result in stress for the family members and can affect their participation in the child's care. It is important for home care nurses to seek a partnership role with the family regarding care of the child. This can be difficult for both parties. Many times nurses set limits on parental involvement and do not consider the parents' perspective. Many nurses are concerned that the parents may not be able to care for the child safely. It is important for nurses to use self-awareness and reflective practice to help them understand and empower families as well as to develop a partnership for care. A communication framework, developed by Berlin and Fowkes (1983), that can assist nurses in the home care setting is the LEARN framework, which can help create cross-cultural collaboration and communication between nurses and families ( Box 11.5 ). The Nurse's Role in Home Care. Early discharge planning, teaching, and case management are keys to promoting a successful transition from the hospital setting to home. The environment differs greatly between the acute setting and home setting. In the acute setting the nurse is in control of the environment; in the home setting, the nurse is a guest in the home. It is important for the nurse to establish a trusting relationship with both the child and family ( Fig. 11.11 ). A trusting therapeutic relationship will make all aspects of care more effective. Box 11.6 gives hints on building this relationship. BOX 11.5 LEARN FRAMEWORK L: Listen empathetically and with understanding to the family's perception of the situation. E: Explain your perception of the situation. A: Acknowledge and discuss the similarities as well as differences between the two perceptions. R: Recommend interventions. N: Negotiate and agree on the interventions. From Berlin, E. A., & Fowkes, W. C. (1983). A teaching framework for cross-cultural health care\u2014Application to practice. The Western journal of Medicine, 739(6), 934-938. Nursing in the home care setting can be challenging. The focus is on meeting the child's physical and psychological needs while involving the family. In meeting the child's needs while involving the family, the nurse uses the nursing process. Assessment in the home is similar to that in the acute care setting but involves obtaining firsthand data about the family and the way it functions. The nurse needs to assess the child's growth and development and thoroughly assess the home environment (refer to Chapters 4 to 7 and 9 for additional information). The nurse needs to ensure that home offers a safe and nurturing environment for the child. The National Center for Healthy Housing has developed a Pediatric Environmental Home Assessment (PEHA) Survey and PEHA nursing care plan to assist in identifying and addressing hazards or potential threats that exist in the child's home (National Center for Healthy Housing, n.d.). These forms can be accessed from a link on . The nurse should always individualize these forms to meet the needs and requirements of his or her client and facility. FIGURE 11.11 Listening to the child helps to develop a trusting relationship between the home care nurse and the child and her family. BOX 11.6 HINTS TO ESTABLISHING A TRUSTING RELATIONSHIP IN HOME CARE Include the child in the conversation and make him or her feel a part of the interaction. Address caregivers formally unless otherwise instructed. Be friendly. Use a soft, calm voice. Be interested in the child's activities. Have the primary caregiver present at the initial visit. Listen to and show respect to the child and the family. The nurse also needs to assess availability of resources. This includes necessary equipment such as a hospital bed and oxygen, suitable physical and emotional surroundings (are the family members able to deal with the stress of the situation?), ability to contact emergency services, power backup if needed, and ease of evacuation of the child in case of a fire. The nurse needs to assess whether electricity, sanitary conditions, heat, air conditioning, and telephone access are present. If there is no phone in the home, the family needs to have plans for accessing a phone in case of emergency (perhaps a neighbor's phone or a pay phone near the home). Thenurse should identify areas of priority and provide appropriate referrals to resources. During the assessment phase the nurse identifies the person who is the primary caregiver; this may be the mother, father, grandparent, or older sibling. It is essential to include this person when developing the plan of care, as he or she is the expert on the child and family. The primary caregiver can provide insight into direct care and which strategies will be most effective with this child, taking into account the physical layout of the home, the financial ability of the family, and the way the family functions. The home care nurse must also assess the family's teaching and learning needs. After the assessment is complete, the nurse develops appropriate nursing diagnoses, outcomes, and goals and implements the plan of care. This will include the frequency and duration of the home visits. The nurse will use agency policies, certification standards, and private insurance and/or Medicaid regulations to assist in the development of the plan (Thompson, 2000). The nurse may be the provider of direct care to the child, or the care may be indirect, in which case the nurse plans and supervises the care that is given by others, such as unlicensed personnel and parents. Nursing care in the home requires excellent critical thinking skills. The nurse has a great deal of independence since there are no other nurses, supervisors, or physicians on site. When complex care is provided in the home, the nurse may need to adjust procedures to fit the setting. For example, feeding schedules may be adjusted to fit a child's school schedule or equipment may be adjusted to allow a child to receive feedings continuously while at school ( Fig. 11.12 ). FIGURE 11.12 The home care nurse may have to adjust procedures and equipment use to fit the home setting. Placing a feeding pump in a backpack allows this child to receive feedings continuously while at school. An important role of the home care nurse is empowering children and their families through education (refer to Chapter 8 for further information related to teaching). The nurse assesses the learning needs and provides education that is appropriate to the educational and developmental levels of the child and family. The nurse must encourage the family to participate in the child's care. The education goals of home care vary. In many situations parents or caregivers must learn care immediately so the child can be cared for at home, such as a child who needs dressing changes four times a day or a child who is ventilator dependent. A child newly diagnosed with diabetes will have some immediate teaching needs, but as the child grows and his or her condition changes, additional care will need to be taught. As with any nursing care, the effectiveness of nursing interventions along with changes in the child's or family's status needs to be continuously evaluated and the plan of care altered as needed. As the home care nurse, what can you do to help with Jake's transition to school? On your last visit, Jake's parents expressed concerns about this transition and the added stress it is causing the family. They appear tired from the round-the-clock care that Jake requires. What suggestions can you make to help ease their stress and fatigue? KEY CONCEPTS Stressors associated with hospitalization include separation from family and routines; fear of an unknown environment; potentialfor pain, bodily injury, or mutilation; and loss of control. Responses of children to the general stressors of hospitalization include anxiety, fear, anger, guilt, and regression. Parents may experience anger or guilt related to the hospitalization of their child. The responses of children and families to hospitalization can be influenced by the age and developmental level of the child, their perceptions of the situation, previous experiences, separation from family and peers, coping skills, and the preparation and support provided by the family, facility, and health care providers. Play, including therapeutic play, is an important strategy to prepare children for hospitalization and to help them adapt to the effects of illness and hospitalization. It provides an emotional outlet, opportunities for teaching and learning, and the ability to become familiar with a situation and improve physiologic abilities. A child life specialist is a specially trained individual who is a member of the child's multidisciplinary team. He or she works in conjunction with the child's health care providers and parents to foster an atmosphere that promotes the child's well-being. Family-centered care and atraumatic care are philosophies that pay special attention to the concerns of the family and child during hospitalization. Providing support to hospitalized children and their families is critical for minimizing stress. Whatever the reason for admission, preparation for admission is vital. Upon admission to the hospital or outpatient unit, orient the child and family to the unit, discuss unit policies and routines and the personnel who will be involved in the care of the child, and begin child/family teaching. Establish a trusting, caring relationship with the child and family. Let the child and family know what will happen and what is expected of them. Obtain information about the child's history, routines, and reason for admission. Obtain baseline vital signs and height and weight, and perform a physical assessment. Each health care setting has its own policies and procedures for this. Due to their age and developmental level, children may be vulnerable to harm, and the nurse must use appropriate safety measures in caring for children (e.g., identification of children, use of restraints and transportation, basic hygiene measures). These measures need to address developmental risks, such as that infants, toddlers, and preschoolers require close supervision and the nurse must avoid leaving small objects within reach. Discharge planning begins upon admission. Each interaction with the family is an opportunity for child and family teaching. Provide and review discharge instructions with the child and primary caregiver. Use educational booklets, videotapes, DVDs, or CD-ROMs that give basic health information or general care for a child with a particular disease. Explain, demonstrate, and request a return demonstration of any treatments or procedures to be done at home. Provide a written schedule if the child is to receive multiple medications, tube feedings, or other medical treatments. Community-based nurses focus on the practice of nursing that provides personal care to children and families in the community. These nurses focus on promoting and preserving health as well as preventing disease or injury. They help children and their families cope with illness and disease. They are direct providers of care as well as advocates and educators working to minimize and remove barriers to allow the child to develop to his or her full potential. Due to the short lengths of stay in acute settings and the shift to home care for children with complex health needs, discharge planning and case management have become important nursing roles. Discharge planning provides a comprehensive plan for the safe discharge of a child from a health care facility and for continuing safe and effective care at home. Case management focuses on coordinating health care services while balancing quality and cost outcomes. Both contribute to improved transitions from hospital to home for children, their families, and the health care team. Nursing in the home care setting can be challenging. The focus is on meeting the child's physical and psychological needs while involving the family. Health care professionals provide the support, empowerment, education, and expertise in caring for the child that families need. Goals of the nurse in the home care setting include promoting, restoring, and maintaining the health of the child. Home care focuses on minimizing the effects of the illness or disability and providing the child or family with the means to care for the illness or disability at home. Nurses in the home care setting are direct providers of care, child and family educators, child and family advocates, and case managers. Community-based nursing takes place in a variety of settings, including physicians' offices, clinics, health departments, urgent care centers, clients' homes, schools, camps, churches, and shelters (such as shelters for abused women, homeless shelters, and disaster shelters). Nurses provide well care, episodic ill care, and chronic care to children and their families in these various settings. Advantages of home care include shorter hospital stays and decreased health care costs, but the major advantage of home care is the comfort and family support it provides, promoting an improved quality of life for these children. Caring for children at home not only improves their physical health but also allows for adequate growth and development while keeping them within theirfamily. Disadvantages to home care include intrusion on family privacy. Caring for children with complex medical needs can be overwhelming for some families, and financial issues related to home care can become a large burden to families.

When this child is stable and can go back to school, what will be the role of the school nurse in caring for this child? STUDY ACTIVITIES1. Follow a child and family during the admission process, from preadmission to initial time on the unit, to identify the procedures and tasks involved. Examine the response of the child and family and how the nursing staff responds to their needs. 2. Develop a teaching plan to orient a toddler or preschooler and his or her family to a nursing unit. Include the resources, personnel, and techniques to include in the teaching plan. 3. Shadow a nurse working in a community setting, such as a camp, school, shelter, or health department. Identify the role the nurse plays in the health of the children and families in the setting and the community. 4. Spend a day in a medically fragile day care setting. Identify the needs of one child and his or her family, how they may differ form those of a child in a traditional day care setting, and the role of the nurse in meeting those needs. 5. Develop an IHP for a child with diabetes (use the IHP in Fig. 11.10 as a reference). 6. Shadow a nurse working in a home health care setting. Identify ways he or she helps the family to promote the child's growth and development and to ensure that the child has as normal a childhood as possible. Identify interventions that embody the key concepts of family-centered care.12 Caring for Children in Special Needs Child Words of Wisdom The touch of a mother's hand and the sound of her voice bring comfort to her special child, and when you bring comfort, you strengthen both of them. KEY TERMS chronic illness developmental delay developmental disability palliative care respite care terminal illness Learning Objectives Upon completion of the chapter, you will be able to: 1. Analyze the impact that being a child with special needs has on the child and family. 2. Identify anticipated times when the child and family will require additional support. 3. Describe ways that nurses assist children with special needs and their families to obtain optimal functioning. 4. Discuss early intervention and public school education for the special needs child. 5. Plan for transition of the special needs child from the inpatient facility to the home, and from pediatric to adult medical care. 6. Discuss key elements related to pediatric end-of-life care. 7. Differentiate developmental responses to death and appropriate interventions. Preet Singh, a 2-year-old boy who was born at 27 weeks' gestation, is seen in your clinic for the first time. He has a history of hydrocephalus and developmental delay. During the examination, his mother states, \"I'm concerned about finding a good, affordable preschool for Preet. His older brother attends public school, but I can't imagine Preet going there.\" After further discussion with Preet's mother, you realize he has not been involved in an early intervention program.The Maternal Child Health Bureau defines children with special health care needs as those who have or are at risk for a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional condition beyond needs generally required by children (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (USDHHS), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Maternal and Child Health Bureau, 2008). Children who have a terminal illness, or are otherwise dying, also require additional care. Nurses are in a unique position, both in the inpatient and outpatient setting, to have a significant and positive influence on the lives of these children and their families. For children with special needs, in addition to providing direct care, the nurse fills the critical role of child and family advocate and case manager. When a child is dying, nurses not only provide physical care to the child but also strive to meet the emotional needs of the child and family.THE MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILD The numbers of children with chronic illness (a long-lasting or recurrent illness) are increasing. Children with special health care needs make up a little over one eighth of the population of children in the United States and, of those children, 24% report being affected a great deal by their condition (USDHHS, HRSA, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, 2008). Increasing numbers of children are being diagnosed with physical and mental disorders and larger numbers of children are living with the assistance of high-tech treatments and equipment. Impact of the Problem Children with special needs may use or need prescription medication, medical care, mental health services, or education services more than other children their same age. They may be limited in abilities and may need physical, occupational, or speech therapy. Alternatively, they may require ongoing treatment for emotional, developmental, or behavioral problems (USDHHS, HRSA, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, 2008). These children and their families are often insured inadequately, have financial needs and/or unmet family support needs, or have difficulty obtaining the specialty care that the child requires (USDHHS, HRSA, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, 2008). It can be challenging for the family of a child with special needs to navigate the system and obtain all of the services their child requires. When an infant is born very prematurely, when a child is injured and requires long-term r ehabilitation and special care, or when a child is diagnosed with a complex chronic health condition, the parents are often devastated initially. The parents of medically fragile children may feel they must adapt to the risk and protect their child. They are interested in preserving their family while compensating for the past, and they cautiously look to the future and become hopeful again. While the infant or child is still in the hospital, nurses can help parents build on their strengths, empowering them to care for their medically fragile infant or special needs child. Education is paramount and should begin as early in the hospitalization as possible. In many situations, particular discharge needs are known early in the course of the infant's or child's hospitalization. Nurses should provide anticipatory guidance about the course of treatment and the expected outcome (Lewis, 2007). Most children with chronic illness, or those who are dependent on technology, progress through stages of growth and development just as typical children do, though possibly at a slower pace. The exception is the child with significant psychomotor retardation, though some developmental progression may occur. Children with special health care needs desire to be treated as normal, and they want to experience the same events that other children do. Of particular concern is a growing subset of children with emotional, behavioral, and developmental problems. Children with these needs have even greater difficulty receiving the care and services they require (USDHHS, HRSA, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, 2008). Many children with emotional, behavioral, or developmental problems also have health problems. Often, these children's problems are not diagnosed early and treatment is difficult (Horowitz & Marchetti, 2010). Ongoing counseling and therapy is very difficult for some families to obtain. Ultimately, this has a negative impact on the child's physical and mental health and may result in decreased achievement and productivity as the child matures. See Healthy People 2020.

Effects of Special Needs on the Child When a child is medically fragile or has special needs, the child's coping ability is affected. In addition, the child's ability to cope is significantly affected by the family's response to stressors, which are often numerous in this population. Children with special health care needs experience differing effects of the chronic illness or disability based on their developmental level, which naturally changes over time for most children.Infants may fail to develop a sense of trust or attach appropriately with the parents because of frequent hospitalizations, often with multiple caregivers involved; lack of consistency in nurturing; or parental detachment or grieving over the child's condition. The infant's ability to learn through sensorimotor exploration may be impaired due to lack of appropriate stimulation, confinement to a crib, or increased contact with painful experiences (Vessey & Sullivan, 2010). The toddler may experience difficulty developing autonomy because of increased dependency on the parent or overinvolvement by the parent. Motor and language skill development may be delayed if the toddler is not given adequate opportunities to test his or her limits and abilities (Vessey & Sullivan, 2010). Limited opportunity also reduces the preschooler's development of a sense of initiative. The preschooler may experience limited opportunities for socialization, causing him or her to withdraw or to feel criticized. Body image development may be hindered due to painful exposures and anxiety. In preschoolers, magical thinking may lead to feelings of guilt for having caused their own disease or condition (Vessey & Sullivan, 2010). The school-age child may have limited opportunities to achieve a sense of industry because of school absence and inability to participate in activities or competitive events. Lack of socialization limits the school-age child's ability to form peer relationships. The ability to learn via concrete operations is affected by the child's physical limitations or possibly the treatments required (Vessey & Sullivan, 2010). Adolescents may feel as though they are different from their peers because of their lack of skills/abilities or their appearance. This may hinder the teen's ability to form a sense of personal identity. Since the teen with special health care needs often requires significant amounts of support from the parents, it may be difficult for the adolescent to achieve independence. If the earlier stages of cognitive development have been delayed, then reaching the level of abstract thinking may be blocked (Vessey & Sullivan, 2010). The child with special health care needs may be able to focus on the positive experiences in his or her life as a method of coping, leading to as much independence as possible. Other children may always feel different from their peers (in a negative sense) and withdraw. Irritability and acting out may also occur. Some children may be compliant and/or seek support for themselves. The child's coping pattern may change over time or with certain situations, such as relapse or worsening of the condition. Children with overprotective parents may display marked dependence and may be very fearful. Children whose parents have been overly indulgent may be more independent and defiant. The nurse must assess the child's individual response to the current health care status and intervene as appropriate (Vessey & Sullivan, 2010). Effects on the Family Each member of the family experiences effects related to the child's special needs. Family members' experiences and their responses to the child's illness influence each other directly. Effects on Parents Raising a child with special needs is generally not the life parents expected to have. Some parents may adapt over time and ultimately accept the child's illness or disability. Others may adapt but do not accept the child's condition and experience the continual fading and reemergence of chronic sorrow. Denial of their child's problem may prevent parents from progressing through grief, but it also allows them to have hope (Knafl & Santacroce, 2010). Caring for the special needs child at home (rather than having the child in a facility) may decrease the parents' feelings of anxiety and helplessness ( Fig. 12.1 ). As with typically developing children, parents enjoy witnessing the emotional and social growth of the child. Parents of special needs children experience a multitude of emotions and changes in their lives. They worry about their child's and family's well-being, and as experts in their child's care often feel burdened with continual care. They often feel helpless and overwhelmed when their child is discharged from the hospital. Though willing to carry the burden, they may experience fear, anger, sadness, guilt, frustration, or resentment. Many parents experience grief as a result of losing the perfect child of which they dreamed (Knafl & Santacroce, 2010).FIGURE 12.1 The special needs child often requires a significant amount of care at home. STRESSORS OF DAILY LIVING Families with a child who has special health care needs experience life differently from other families. They may have to change their housing situation to accommodate the child's needs. Their sleep is affected. Constant supervision of the technology-dependent child makes it difficult to carry out other basic household activities. In addition to basic child care and running of the household, medical and technical care must be incorporated into daily life. The family's identity and the parents' employment may be altered radically. Holidays and vacations are affected, as it is difficult to plan activities. Nursing and other health care professional visits are disruptive to family life. Mothers appear to carry the larger burden of care, though fathers are not unaffected. Somehow, parents eventually take charge, and though they fear failure, they display vigilance, can negotiate and seek information, and become advocates for their child and experts on his or her care. Though parents may feel trapped and isolated and experience a loss of freedom, their need to survive as a family continues to motivate them. Parents may feel a need to be with their child at all times and experience stress related to coping with the heavy load of caregiving. The extended burden of caregiving can also have adverse health effects on caregivers: only a small percentage of parents of children with special health care needs report that they routinely participate in health-promoting activities for themselves. Additionally, parents of children with special health care needs are at increased risk for the development of depression (Knafl & Santacroce, 2010). In addition to the caregiving burden, parents experience role conflicts, financial burdens, and the struggle between independence in providing care and the isolation associated with it. It is very difficult to enjoy spontaneous events outside the home because so much planning is necessary. The possibility of independence revolves around mobility issues, education, and assistive technology. Though education for all children is federally mandated, parents have anxiety about educational decisions and also find it difficult to obtain the support and educational services the child needs. Additional stress is associated with transition times in the care of a special needs child. These transition times include: Initial diagnosis or change in prognosis Increased symptoms When the child moves to a new setting (hospital, school) During a parent's absence During periods of developmental change (Knafl & \"Vulnerable syndrome\" is a clinical state in which the parents' reactions to a serious illness or event in the child's past continue to have long-term psychologically harmful effects on the child and parents for many years (Duncan & Caughy, 2009). The parents view the child as being at higher risk for medical, developmental, or behavioral problems. Parents exhibit excessive unwarranted concerns and seek health care for their child very frequently. Risk factors for the development of vulnerable child syndrome include preterm birth, a congenital anomaly, newborn jaundice, a handicapping condition, an accident or illness that the child is not expected to recover from, or crying or feeding problems in the first 5 years of life. The parent has difficulty separating from the child, and the child senses that anxiety and then develops symptoms that reinforce the parent's fears. Alternatively (or additionally), the parents may try to retain control, particularly at times of increasing independence, and fear disciplining the child as they do not want to \"upset\" the child. Effects on Siblings The siblings of children with special health care needs are also affected dramatically. Their relationship with their parents is different from what it would have been if they had a typical brother or sister. Parents often need to spend more time with the child with special needs and have less time with their healthy children. Children exhibit emotional and psychological responses to their sibling's long-term needs (Looman et al., 2008). The sibling's knowledge about the illness, the sibling's attitude toward and adjustment to it, the sibling's own self-esteem, how socially supported the sibling is, and the parents' awareness of the sibling's feelings are all related to how well the sibling adjusts. Nursing Management of the Medically Fragile Child and Family Family-centered care provides the optimal framework for caring for medically fragile children and their families. Family-centered care minimizes the impact of chronic illness and maximizes the child's developmental potential. To provide the best nursing care for these children and their families, the nurse must first develop a trusting relationship with the family. To ensure optimal functioning, children with special health care needs require comprehensive and coordinated services from multiple professionals. These professionals should work collaboratively to address the child's health, educational, psychological, and social service needs. In addition to case management and advocacy, nursing management focuses on screening and ongoing assessment of the child, provision of home care, care of the technology-dependent child, education and support of the child and family, and referral for resources. Developing a Therapeutic Relationship Raising children is always challenging, but for the parent of a special needs child it is often overwhelming and exhausting. The parents' needs change continuously, so it is best if the family has a permanent relationship with a physician or nurse practitioner. This promotes trust and a more efficient two-way flow of information. Respect the parents' range of emotions and work with them as a team to manage the child's care. Parents need to be recognized for complying with the treatment plan or for other small gains that are made. Empowering the family strengthens them and gives them self-confidence. Feeling supported and invigorated gives parents strength, energy, and hope. Box 12.1 lists principles related to family involvement. Screening and Ongoing Assessment Nurses should perform screening to identify children with unmet health care needs. A screening tool developed by the Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative ( Fig. 12.2 ) may help to identify children with special health care needs. Web links for additional information related to the screening tool can be found on BOX 12.1 PRINCIPLES RELATED TO FAMILY INVOLVEMENT Families Are the constant in a child's life Define who they are and their culture Need to have access to information and training Deserve to receive culturally competent care Know their strengths, limitations, and fears Merit mutual respect and responsibility for outcomes Adapted from Goode, T. D., Haywood, S. H., Wells, N., & Rhee, K. (2009). Family-centered, culturally, and linguistically competent care: Essential components of the medical home. Pediatric Annals, 38(9), 505-512. Children with special health care needs may attain developmental milestones more slowly than typically developing children. If the Denver II is used for ongoing developmental surveillance of the young child, then the results should be compared from visit to visit to determine progress rather than using it as a screening tool. Assess special needs children and their families for vulnerable child syndrome. Promoting Home Care Home is the most developmentally appropriate environment for all children, even those who are technologically dependent (Looman et al., 2008). The child's home provides an emotionally nurturing and socially stimulating environment. Children desire to be cared for at home, and those who are cared for at home display an improved physical, emotional, psychological, and social status. Technology-dependent children may require supplemental oxygen, assisted ventilation, tracheostomy care, assisted enteral or parenteral feeding, or parenteral medication administration. Traditionally hospitalization would have been required for these children\u2014 in fact, intensive care would have been necessary for children who need assisted ventilation\u2014but with advances in technology, today even children with extensive medical and developmental needs may be cared for at home (Looman et al., 2008). Early discharge planning is important, and parents will need detailed instructions and support in caring for the technology-dependent child at home (Lewis, 2007). EARLY DISCHARGE PLANNING Early discharge planning and ongoing inclusion and education of the family facilitates continuity of care. Box 12.2 provides information about preparing the medically fragile child for discharge. CARING FOR THE TECHNOLOGY-DEPENDENT CHILD AT HOME Home care nurses are often involved in the care of technology-dependent children. Caring for a technology-dependent child at home is a complex process, yet children thrive in the home care setting with appropriate intervention and care. Many parents feel that rearing a technology-dependent child is different only because of the presence of the equipment. Nurses may tend to think that parents treat the technology-dependent child differently from the other children, while parents value normalization and want to raise and provide discipline to all of their children in the same manner. Parents should tell nurses about their childrearing expectations, and nurses need to respect the parents' wishes. Improved collaboration between parents and home care nurses may decrease the parents' stress and maximize opportunities for appropriate growth and development in the technology-dependent child. Thus, a strong relationship, good communication, and good negotiation skills are assets to the family and child.FIGURE 12.2 The CSHCN screener. (Used with permission from the Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative (CAHMI) at Oregon Health & Science University.) BOX 12.2 PREPARING FOR HOME CARE BEFORE DISCHARGE Promote liaison with community resources. Develop communication between various services. Plan appointments. Set up home nursing care (either private duty or visits). Teach skills, encouraging active caregiving in the hospital setting to increase the parents' self-confidence. Discuss psychological and emotional issues with parents. Obtain/organize equipment and supplies (running out of supplies may cause significant stress on families). Refer the family for necessary financial resources. Ensure the family's home environment is adequate (enough room for equipment, electricity on, air conditioner for warm weather, heater for cold weather, and refrigeration for food). For the baby being discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU): Teach the parents about the infant's cues and behaviors and the preemie's different sleep-wake patterns. Encourage kangaroo care and infant massage while in the NICU (as the infant's condition allows). Educate the parents about possible effects on short- and long-term neurodevelopment. Refer to local early intervention program. Assist the family with finding a primary care provider who is experienced in the ongoing follow-up of high-risk infants. Adapted from American Academy of Pediatrics, Committee on Fetus and Newborn. (2008). Hospital discharge of the high-risk neonate. Pediatrics, 122(5), 1119-1126. Help the family to incorporate the medical regimen into daily life to minimize the child's self-perception of being different from other children. Teach families about the technical issues, such as home and travel oxygen therapy, use of the ventilator, suctioning, chest percussion and postural drainage, tube feedings and care of the feeding tube, and medications. Assist parents with the planning and management of routine care, respiratory treatments, nutritional support, and developmental interventions. Reinforce exercises and techniques as prescribed by developmental therapists. Refer to Chapter 11 for additional information about home care nursing. Providing Care Coordination Once a child with special health care needs has been identified and has been discharged to the home setting, the nurse plays a vital role in care coordination. Any child with special health care needs benefits from a medical home. The nurse in the medical home is a critical team member, providing ongoing care coordination and follow-up. If such services are available in the local area, refer the child and family with special needs to an integrated health program that provides interdisciplinary, collaborative care for children requiring complex, coordinated care. Box 12.3 lists nursing interventions for families of children with special health care needs. BOX 12.3 NURSING INTERVENTIONS FOR FAMILIES OF CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS Develop written health plans. Provide care coordination and collaboration with specialists in other disciplines, early intervention, schools, and public agencies. Address needs for prior authorization for treatments, medications, or specialist referrals; retain copies in the child's chart of authorization forms and approvals. Modify office routines to promote family and child comfort. Assist parents with child care decisions. Know community resources available to children with special health care needs. When the child is hospitalized, encourage high levels of parental participation. Provide care coordination across multiple health settings. Educate child care providers on child health needs. Help parents get involved with parent support networks. Adapted from Looman, W. S., O'Conner-Von, S., & Lindeke, L. L. (2008).

W., Presler, E., Turchi, R., & Antonelli, R. C. (2009). Achieving effective care coordination in the medical home. Pediatric Annals, 38(9), 491-497. Providing Ongoing Follow-Up of the Former Premature Infant Many former premature infants experience myriad medical and developmental problems throughout infancy, early childhood, and beyond. Upon or following discharge, many former premature infants display one or many of the following medical or developmental problems: Chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) Cardiac changes such as right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary artery hypertension Growth retardation, poor feeding, anemia of prematurity, other nutrient deficiencies Apnea of prematurity, gastroesophageal reflux disease, Sudden death syndrome (SIDS) Rickets (osteopenia) of prematurity Hydrocephalus, ventriculomegaly, abnormal head magnetic imaging Inguinal umbilical hernias Retinopathy visual acuity Hearing deficits Delayed dentition Gross motor, fine motor, and language delay; sensory integration issues (Gargus et al., 2009; Kelly, 2010)Over the long term, former premature infants are at higher risk than typical infants of developing cognitive delay, cerebral palsy, attention deficit disorder, learning disabilities, difficulties with socialization, and vulnerable child syndrome (Duncan & Caughy, 2009; Gargus et al., 2009). Additionally, many former premature infants display alterations in muscle tone at or shortly after discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) that require physical therapy intervention. For these reasons, high-risk infants require special attention and thorough, appropriate assessment to discern subtle changes that may affect their long-term physical, cognitive, emotional, and social outcome. The pediatric nurse should have an understanding of the special concerns that former premature infants and children as well as their families may face. From the beginning, encourage families to keep a binder that includes all of the infant's pertinent checkup, insurance, and medical and developmental information; this will serve as a resource for the parents, and they will be able to supply complete information when visiting various providers. PROVIDING ROUTINE WELL-CHILD CARE OF THE FORMER PREMATURE INFANT Former premature infants require similar well-child care as typical infants do, with additional visits for management of multiple complex medical issues and developmental screening/intervention. Teach families routine newborn care, including bathing, dressing, and avoidance of passive cigarette smoke. All visits for primary care follow-up will be scheduled based on the infant's chronological age. Prior to discharge from the NICU, the infant will be tested for oxygen desaturation while seated in the car seat (Kelly, 2010). Clearance will be obtained prior to the infant's discharge. Former preemies require car seat use just as other infants do. Help the parents to find methods of padding the car seat or adding an additional semifirm cushion inside the seat for the infant to ride in the car safely. Some infants may need to continue cardiac/apnea monitoring while in the car seat. Since the former premature infant is at increased risk for SIDS compared to the general population, it is critical to teach parents to put the infant on his or her back to sleep (although this is contraindicated with gastroesophageal disease) (Kelly, 2010). Give immunizations according to the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-recommended immunization schedule, based on the infant's chronological age. All former preemies should receive the flu vaccine as recommended after 6 months chronological age. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis is critical for certain groups of premature infants (Kelly, 2010). Therefore, administer palivizumab (Synagis) vaccine according to the recommended schedule (refer to Chapter 18 for additional information about RSV prophylaxis). ASSESSING GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE FORMER PREMATURE INFANT When assessing growth and development of the infant or child who was born prematurely, determine the child's adjusted or corrected age so that you can perform an accurate assessment. The corrected or adjusted age should be used for evaluating progression in growth as well as development. For example, if a 6-month-old infant was born at 28 weeks' gestation (12 weeks or 3 months early), his growth and development expectations are those of a 3-month-old (corrected age). Continue to correct age for growth and development until the child is 3 years old. Many former premature infants require special diets to foster catch-up growth (Kelly, 2010). Extra calories are needed for increased growth needs. Additional calcium and phosphorus are required for bone mineralization. For these reasons, former preemies should be fed breast milk fortified with additional nutrients or a commercially prepared formula specific for premature infants. When former preemies demonstrate consistent adequate growth (usually by 6 months corrected age), they may be switched to a \"term infant formula\" such as Similac or Enfamil, concentrated to a higher caloric density if needed. Assess the infant's ability to suck efficiently and refer him or her to occupational or speech therapy if the infant is a slow feeder or has difficulty feeding. All anticipatory guidance related to nutrition is based on the child's corrected age. In other words, begin solids at 6 months corrected age, not chronological age, and delay the addition of whole milk until 12 months corrected age, rather than 1 year chronologic age (Kelly, 2010). Signs that the former premature infant may be ready to attempt spoon feeding include interest in feeding, decrease in tongue thrust, and adequate head control. Early screening and intervention for issues related to development are critical to the attainment of optimal development in the former preemie. The comorbidities that ex-preemies exhibit in the form of prior and current medical problems place these infants at high risk for developmental delay (lag in meeting developmental milestones). Even mild developmental delays warrant evaluation and intervention. The Denver II may be used as a screening tool for developmental concerns in the ex-preemie, though it does not always identify children at risk. Parent-report questionnaires demonstrate fairly accurate estimations of developmental problems, and their use is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (2008). Most importantly, assess the child's development based on corrected age until the child is 3 years old. Refer infants and children early if developmental concerns are suspected. Identifying and Managing Failure to Thrive and Feeding Disorders in Children With Special NeedsFailure to thrive (FTT) is a term used to describe inadequate growth in infants and children. The child fails to demonstrate appropriate weight gain over a prolonged period of time. Length or height velocity and head circumference growth may also be affected. Typical children may experience FTT, but it is much more common in the child with special needs. Adequate nutrition is critical for appropriate brain growth in the first 2 years of life and obviously for growth in general throughout childhood and adolescence (Burns, Dunn, Brady, Starr, & Blosser, 2009). Developmental disability (mental or physical or combination impairment resulting in lifelong disability) may contribute to FTT, as the child's ability to consume adequate nutrition is impaired because of sensory or motor delays, such as with cerebral palsy. Other organic causes of failure to thrive include inability to suck and/or swallow correctly, malabsorption, diarrhea, vomiting, or alterations in metabolism and caloric/nutrient needs associated with a variety of chronic illnesses. Infants and children with cardiac or metabolic disease, chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia), cleft palate, or gastroesophageal reflux disease are at particular risk. Feeding disorders or food refusal may occur in infants or children who have required prolonged mechanical ventilation, long-term enteral tube feedings, or an unpleasant event such as a choking episode. Inorganic causes of FTT include neglect, abuse, behavioral problems, lack of appropriate maternal interaction, poor feeding techniques, lack of parental knowledge, or parental mental illness. Poverty is the single greatest contributing risk factor (Block, Krebs, the Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect, and the Committee on Nutrition, 2005). The two categories of causes are not mutually exclusive. Organic causes of FTT may lead to behavioral problems that potentiate problems with adequate growth; hence, FTT is thought of as a multifactorial problem (Locklin, 2005). Screen all children for FTT to identify them early. In addition to poor growth, the infant or child with FTT may present with a history of developmental delay or loss of acquired milestones. Infants or children with feeding problems may display nipple, spoon, or food refusal; difficulty sucking; disinterest in feeding; or difficulty progressing from liquid to pureed to textured food. Perform a detailed dietary history and instruct the parents to complete a 3-day food diary to identify what the child actually eats and drinks. Assess the parent-child interaction, with particular attention to the parent's ability to read and respond to the infant's or child's cues. Observe feeding, noting the child's oral interest or aversion, oral-motor coordination, and swallowing ability, as well as parent-child interactions before, during, and after the feeding. Further aversion to eating may occur as the parent's anxiety over the thought of the child not eating or losing weight leads to attempts to force-feed the child (Ayoob & Barresi, 2007). Significant FTT may require hospitalization for evaluation and management. Sometimes enteral tube feedings are necessary in order for children with FTT or feeding disorders to demonstrate adequate growth. Box 12.4 lists nursing interventions for the hospitalized child with FTT. Take Note! Infants with FTT related to maternal neglect may avoid eye contact and be less interactive than other infants (Burns et al., 2009). BOX 12.4 NURSING INTERVENTIONS DURING THE CHILD'S HOSPITALIZATION FOR FAILURE TO THRIVE Observe parent-child interactions, especially during feedings. Develop an appropriate feeding schedule. Provide feedings as prescribed (usually 120 kcal/kg/day is needed to demonstrate proper weight gain). Weigh the child daily and maintain strict records of intake and output. Educate parents about proper feeding techniques and volumes. Provide extensive support to alleviate parental anxiety related to the child's inability to gain weight. Adapted from Ayoob, K. T., & Barresi, I. (2007). Feeding disorders in children: Taking an interdisciplinary approach. Pediatric Annals, 36(8), 478-483; and Locklin, M. (2005). The redefinition of failure to thrive from a case study perspective. Pediatric Nursing, 31(6), 474-479. Promoting Growth and Development When caring for the infant with special health care needs in the hospital, provide consistent caregivers to encourage the infant to develop a sense of trust. Allow and encourage the parent to stay with the infant, providing a comfortable place for the parent to sleep. To promote attachment, emphasize the baby's positive qualities. Encourage developmentally appropriate skills and allow the infant to have pleasurable experiences through all of the senses (Vessey & Sullivan, 2010). For the toddler, begin developmentally appropriate limit setting and discipline. Encourage independence as the toddler is able.Modify gross motor and sensory activities to accommodate the toddler's limitations. To encourage a sense of control, offer the toddler simple choices. As the preschooler develops, encourage mastery of self-help skills as the child is able. Encourage socialization with same-age peers to develop a sense of friendship. Reinforce to the child that the illness or disability is not a punishment for wrongdoing or the child's fault in any way (Vessey &Sullivan, 2010). Encourage the school-age child to attend school and make up work that must be missed for medical treatments or appointments. Provide education to the school staff and other students about the child's special needs. Promote involvement in appropriate sports activities; music, drama, or art activities; and clubs such as Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts. Educate the child about the illness or disability and the course of treatment (Vessey & Sullivan, 2010). Inform parents of teens that those with chronic illness often participate in the same activities as typical teens, such as risk taking, rebelling, and trying out different identities. Assist the teen with coping and interpersonal skills. Promote involvement in activities with other teens with special needs as well as typical adolescents. Ensure that the teen participates in rites of passage as able, such as attending the prom or obtaining a driver's license. Discuss future plans with the teen, such as college or vocation, as well as transition to a nonpediatric physician (Vessey & Sullivan, 2010). See Evidence-Based Practice 12.1. Providing Resources to the Child and Family Nurses should be familiar with community resources available to children with special health care needs. Educational opportunities for children with special health care needs include early intervention programs and programs offered through the public school system. Financial resources, respite care, and complementary therapies are other areas the nurse should become familiar with. EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE SPECIAL NEEDS CHILD The foundation for health and development in children is laid during the first years of life. Children with special health care needs often require multiple developmental interventions and special education in the early years in order to reach their developmental potential later in childhood. Children learn best when they are at the stage of maximal readiness, and the early years must not be missed as an opportunity for development. See Healthy EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 12.1 LIFE SKILLS INTERVENTION FOR CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND EFFECTS OF INTERVENTION ON PSYCHOSOCIAL ADJUSTMENT, FUNCTIONAL HEALTH STATUS, AND PHYSIOLOGIC STATUS OVER TIME STUDY As cystic fibrosis treatment methods have improved over the past couple of decades, enhanced survival and a healthier life course have resulted. With these improvements it has become necessary to further address the psychosocial and developmental needs of affected children. The authors performed a blinded, randomized controlled trial at four university cystic fibrosis (CF) centers. One hundred and sixteen children were participants in the study over a 9-month period of time. The intervention performed consisted of a home visit to assess each child's knowledge and management of CF. Information was provided using an educational problem-solving approach. Subsequent focus groups were held and the children discussed how to deal with peer issues. Findings Children who participated in the intervention group had greater improvements in loneliness, global self-worth, and perceived illness experience. The intervention did not demonstrate an impact upon physical or functional health status but did improve psychosocial status. Nursing Implications In addition to CF, many chronic and debilitating conditions affect children's quality of life. Any school-age or older child with a chronic condition that impairs physical functioning would benefit from interventions similar to those performed in this study. In particular, nurses who work in settings that allow them to have long-term relationships with these children have the potential to positively influence their lives. Nurses should help children learn communication and problem-solving skills that could lessen the impact of their chronic condition.Adapted from Christian, B. J., & D'Auria, J. P. (2006). Building life skills for children with cystic fibrosis: Effectiveness of an intervention. Nursing Research, 55, 300-307. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Early intervention programs are intended to enhance the development of infants and toddlers with, or at risk for, disabilities, thereby minimizing educational costs and special education. Early intervention is also directed toward enhancing the capacity of families to meet their child's needs as well as to maximize the likelihood of independent living (Schulman, Meringolo, & Scott, 2007). The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (formerly called Public Law 99-457) mandates government- funded care coordination and special education for children up to 3 years of age. This early intervention program is administered through each state. Federal law allows each state to define \"developmental disability\" differently, but in general qualified personnel perform an evaluation of the child's physical, language, emotional, and social capabilities to determine eligibility (108th Congress, 2004). The law guarantees that eligible children will obtain access to services that will enhance their development. Children who qualify for services receive care coordination, and an individualized family service plan is developed by the service coordinator in conjunction with the family. The service coordinator manages the developmental services and special education that the child requires. The intent of the program is that the child receives services in a \"natural environment,\" so most services occur in the home or day care center. Home visits by the service coordinator and maintenance of regular contact with the family ensure the success of the program. Refer children suspected of developmental delay to the local early intervention program. For children receiving these services, collaborate with the service coordinator on an ongoing basis, with particular involvement at hospital discharge and when transition of services occurs at age 3 years. Think back to Preet, the 2-year-old boy with a history of hydrocephalus and developmental delay, from the beginning of the chapter. Discuss with his mother the educational opportunities that are available for Preet. Explain what early intervention is and why it is important for Preet. Schools may have a profound impact on the child's overall health and development. Some children with special needs do not require additional services to succeed in school. For these children, the nurse's role is to assess for school success or failure and determine the effect of the school environment on the child's health. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, reauthorized in 2004, provides for the education of children with special needs through the public school system, from age 3 to 21 years. These services are provided within the public school system. According to the law, each special needs student is entitled to an individualized education program (IEP), which is a written plan designed to meet the preschool, primary, or secondary school student's individual needs. A committee consisting of the child's parent, a regular teacher, a special education teacher, and various other specialists develops the IEP. Nurses may be called to serve upon this committee. The IEP must include measurable short- and long-term goals. Parents are informed of the student's progress routinely and the IEP is reviewed at least annually (108th Congress, 2004). Preschool special education through the local public school system is provided from age 3 to 5 years; access to the curriculum is ensured for all children. A child is eligible for special needs preschool when a significant delay is present in the cognitive, language, adaptive, social-emotional, or motor development domains to the extent that it adversely affects the child's learning ability. The child receives (in the school setting) developmental therapy as needed to augment his or her ability to participate in the education process. The least restrictive environment is preferred, with special needs children participating in classes containing age-appropriate typicalpeers whenever possible (108th Congress, 2004). Special needs preschool services are often offered in the elementary school setting. FINANCIAL AND INSURANCE RESOURCES Many special needs children whose families demonstrate financial need may be eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). This program was created in 1972 through Public Law 92-603. SSI is a cash assistance program, and monthly benefits vary per individual. SSI qualification also qualifies the child for state-administered Medicaid. Medicaid benefits vary slightly from state to state but generally cover medical visits, medication, hospitalization, and limited adjuvant therapies. The State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) provides low-cost health insurance to eligible children. Eligibility and the extent of benefits provided by SCHIP vary by state (Vessey & Brown, 2010). Public Law 94-566 provides for state-administered Title V programs under the Maternal and Child Health Bureau Block Grant program. State Title V programs provide community-based, comprehensive service coordination for children with special needs (USA.gov, 2011). Online directories providing a wealth of links to resources for special needs children include Children's Disabilities Information and Special Child. Web links to these sites can be found on RESPITE CARE Primary caregivers of children with special health care needs must be dedicated, skillful, vigilant, and knowledgeable. Constant care is a stress on the primary care-giver, who needs temporary relief from the daily care-giving demands. Respite care provides an opportunity for families to take a break from the daily intensive caregiving responsibilities. Respite care should meet the child's health care needs and offer the child developmental opportunities. Finding and using respite care that the family is comfortable with and trusts may decrease the family's stress and lead to an enhanced quality of life for special needs children and their families. Nurses can facilitate access to respite care, educate respite providers, and ensure quality respite care practices through involvement in community agencies. COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES Families of children with special health care needs often use adjuvant therapies. These may include, among others, homeopathic and herbal medicine, pet therapy, hippotherapy, music, and massage. Many families desire to blend natural or Eastern medicine with traditional allopathic medicine for their special needs child in search of palliation or a cure. When obtaining the health history, ask specifically about homeopathy or herbal medications the child may be taking. Pet therapy may be used to decrease stress or as a component of psychotherapy. Hippotherapy is also referred to as horseback riding for the handicapped, therapeutic horseback riding, or equine-facilitated psychotherapy. Individuals with almost any cognitive, physical, or emotional disability may benefit from therapeutic riding or other supervised interaction with horses. The unique movement of the horse under the child helps the child with physical disabilities to achieve increased flexibility, balance, and muscle strength. Children with mental or emotional disabilities may experience increased self-esteem, confidence, and patience as a result of the unique relationship with the horse. A physical therapist or psychotherapist (depending on the situation) generally works very closely with specially trained equine staff (Gasalberti, 2006). Box 12.5 lists chronic medical conditions for which hippotherapy may be beneficial. Additional information may be obtained through the North American Riding for the Handicapped Association or the American Hippotherapy Association. Links to these sites can be found on .

Retrieved March 27, 2011, from http://www.americanhippotherapyassociation.org/hippotherapy/hippotherapy-as-a-treatment-strategy/ Music may be used to induce positive behavioral changes or various other positive effects. Massage therapy may be beneficial to a wide variety of children. It may be used to reduce pain, promote relaxation, or demonstrate a specific positive effect related to the child's particular medical condition (Gasalberti, 2006). Take Note! Become familiar with the risks and benefits of homeopathic and herbal medications, as many families use these treatments in an effort to improve their child's quality of life or outcome. Providing Support and Education At the time of initial diagnosis, allow and encourage the family to express their feelings. Parents of children with special health care needs require emotional, practical, economic, and social support. Encourage parents to obtain help with daily routines. Encourage stress reduction for the parents through exercise and allowing time for themselves. Be a supportive and encouraging listener, making sure to nurture the whole child, not just his or her special condition. Parents value peer support groups, sometimes feeling that only other parents of disabled or chronically ill children could understand the heartache, fear, and other emotions they often experience. Pediatric nurses should be proactive in helping families find support systems. Fathers have the same concerns about their children as mothers do, but they may show these concerns differently. It is important for nurses to involve them in the child's care. Teach skills to both parents, and actively involve fathers by asking about their observations and opinions. Parents become the experts on their child's needs and care, and they should be recognized as such. Parents want to be taken seriously and do not like being ignored. They should be viewed as having reliable and valuable information about their children. By being an active and reflective listener, the nurse can demonstrate to the parents that their opinion is valued, in addition to finding out what the child really needs. Some parents may hesitate to volunteer information, unsure about which information the nurse needs. Show respect for the parents' knowledge of their child's needs by seeking advice on the child's daily care, medical/physical needs, and current developmental level, no matter what the site of care is. Families may need additional support from the nurse at times of transition. As the equipment or treatment needs change, adjust the teaching plan. Educate the child and family about the use of adaptive equipment. Ensure that families understand how specific activities must be modified to accommodate the child's needs. Provide anticipatory guidance related to expected developmental changes, including resources and laws related to education. Act as a liaison between the family and the day care center or school. As the child grows and matures, encourage parents to relinquish caregiving tasks to the child as appropriate to encourage independence and promote self-esteem. Assisting the Adolescent With Special Health Needs Making the Transition to Adulthood Adolescence is a time of physical changes, psychosocial challenges, and initiation of independence from parents. The adolescent with a chronic illness or one who is technology dependent may experience this period differently from other teens. Puberty is often affected by chronic illness (either delayed or earlier). Chronic illness may lead to isolation from peers at a time when peer interaction is the core of psychosocial development. Teens may struggle to fit in with their peers by hiding their illness or health care needs (ignoring them), complying poorly with treatment regimens, or participating in risky behaviors. At a time when the child should be developing independence from the parents, he or she may be experiencing significant dependence related to the special health condition. For these reasons, the adolescent with special health care needs may require increased amounts of support from the nurse. Making the transition to adult care for a child with special health care needs can be difficult, and advance planning leads to a smoother transition. Transition planning involves multidisciplinary care coordination; acknowledgement of the changing roles among the youth, family, and health care professionals; and fostering of the youth's self-determination skills. A written plan for transition to adult care should be initiated in midadolescence. Have ongoing conversations with the teen about this transition. Issues to be resolvedprior to the transition include financial resources for medical care, college or vocational school attendance, living arrangements, and caretaking arrangements (White &Hackette, 2009). The Adolescent Health Transition Project (AHTP) recommends the following schedule: By age 14, ensure that a transition plan is initiated and that the IEP reflects post-high school plans. By age 17, explore health care financing for young adults. If needed, notify the local division of vocational rehabilitation by the autumn before the teen is to graduate from high school of the impending transition. Initiate guardianship procedures if appropriate. Notify the teen that all rights transfer to him or her at the age of majority. Check the teen's eligibility for SSI the month the child turns 18. Determine if the child is eligible for SSI work incentives. If the youth is attending college, contact the college's campus student disability service program. By age 21, ensure that the young adult has registered with the Division of Developmental Disabilities for adult services if applicable (AHTP, 2011). Prior to moving to adult care (with an adult medical provider), ensure that the adolescent understands the treatment rationale, symptoms of worsening condition, and especially danger signs. Teach the adolescent about when to seek help from a health professional. Introduce the teen to the medical insurance process. At transition, coordinate a seamless transfer by providing a detailed written plan to the care coordinator or advanced practice nurse (after verbal collaboration). After the transition, serve as a consultant to the adult office in relation to the teen's needs. Consult with a transition services coordinator or other service agency as available in the local community (AHTP, 2011). See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov .THE DYING CHILD The idea that a child may die is simply unimaginable to most people, yet children die daily. Each year, about 50,000 children die in the United States; of those, about 28,500 are infants (Heron et al., 2009). A child's chronic illness may progress to the point of becoming a terminal illness (illness deemed to be noncurable, ultimately leading to death). For example, despite the increased survival rates for children with cancer as a result of improved treatment options and protocols, cancer remains the leading cause of death from disease in all children older than the age of 1 year (Heron et al., 2009). Less frequently, other diseases also lead to terminal illness in children, with congenital defects and traumatic injuries being the more common causes. Pediatric nurses will inevitably encounter situations in which a child dies. These situations are extremely difficult for all persons involved, and the nurse plays a key role in caring for the dying child and his or her family. Caring for the dying child is a family-centered, multidisciplinary process. Nurses must respond to the child's and family's physiologic, emotional, and spiritual needs during this difficult time. Children display differing responses to the dying process and impending death depending on their developmental level. Children and their families need significant amounts of support throughout the process of dying. End-of-Life Decision Making Parents are obligated not only to protect their children from harm but also to do as much good for them as possible, both from an ethical and a legal standpoint. When the time comes for end-of-life decision making, parents are often torn about the \"right\" course of action. Parents may be asked to make decisions about stopping treatment, withdrawing treatment, providing palliative care, or consenting to \"do not resuscitate\" (DNR) orders. Children, parents, and physicians are generally in agreement that continued suffering is not desired for any child with a terminal illness. When all possible curative attempts have been made, then survival is no longer possible (Rushton, 2004). Nurses involved in this process must examine their own values related to dying and consider the American Nurses Association's code of ethics for nurses as well (2001). The family's feelings must also be acknowledged. During the process of end-of-life decision making, health care providers must assure families that the focus of care is changing and that the child is not being abandoned. Emphasize to parents that no matter what their decision is, the health care team is dedicated to the comfort and expert care of their child (Rushton, 2004). Ensure that communication is family centered. Quality of life must be taken into consideration when making decisions to continue or withhold treatment. Provide parents facing end-of-life decisions with honest information and education from the time of the diagnosis/prognosis forward. Anticipate that parents may vacillate in the decision-making process. Clarify information for them and allow them private time to discuss the options. Do not make judgments about or question the parents' decision. Be sensitive to any ethnic, spiritual, or cultural preferences during the terminal stage of the illness. Encourage parents to interact with other parents who have a child with a terminal illness (Rushton, 2005). Allowing Natural Death The decision to institute a DNR order is one of the most difficult decisions a family may ever have to make. DNR refers to withholding cardiopulmonary resuscitation should the child's heart stop beating. Parents may initially feel like this means they are giving up on their child. Nurses must educate families that resuscitation may be inappropriate and lead to more suffering than if death were allowed to occur naturally. The parents need to understand that when a palliative care route is chosen, rather than continuing a curative or treatment route, the focus of the child's care is changing but the child and family are not being abandoned. Families may wish to specify a certain extent of resuscitation that they feel more comfortable with (e.g., allowing supplemental oxygen but not providing chest compressions). Some institutions are now replacing the DNR terminology with \"allow natural death\" (AND), which may be more acceptable to families facing the decision to withhold resuscitation (Knox & Lenehan, 2005). Involving the Dying Child in the Decision-Making Process End-of-life decision making often involves ethical dilemmas for the child, family, and health care team. This is particularly true when the parents' wishes conflict with the child's or adolescent's desires. Children should be involved in decision making to the extent that they are able. Discuss intervention within the context of the child's condition and wishes. Children older than the age of 7 may \"assent\" to the continuation or withdrawal of treatment (Kon, 2006). Be available to the older child or adolescent to provide support and information if he or she desires. Talk with the child or adolescent with the parents present, as well as in private. Maintain the child's comfort and dignity. Encourage the child to spend time with other children with a terminal illness. Assure the child that everything will be done to make him or her comfortable. Consult parents about the timing and depth of end-of-life discussions. Just as parents do,the terminally ill child may vacillate in the decision-making process. Remain sensitive, and respect the child's decisions. Organ or Tissue Donation With large numbers of organ transplant candidates on waiting lists and the shortage of viable organs, pediatric organ and tissue donation is a priority (Bratton et al., 2006). For many families, knowing that a child's organs or tissues may save another child's life provides a way to help others despite their own loss. A healthy child who dies unexpectedly is an excellent candidate for organ donation. Many chronic illnesses in children preclude the option of organ or tissue donation, though individual determinations of eligibility should be made. The discussion of organ donation should be separated from the discussion of impending death or brain death notification. Written consent is necessary for organ donation, so the family must be appropriately informed and educated. Many families who never thought about it before may consider the option of donation if adequately educated about the process. All expenses for organ procurement are borne by the recipient's family, not the donor's. Ask whether the dying child ever expressed a wish to donate organs and whether the parents have considered it. Families need to know that procurement of the organs does not mar the child's appearance, so that an open casket at the child's funeral is still possible if the family desires. The donating child will not suffer further because of organ donation. The organs or tissues will be harvested in a timely fashion after the declaration of death, so the family need not worry about delay of the wake or funeral. The family's cultural and religious beliefs must be considered, and the team discussing organ donation with the family must do so in a sensitive and ethical manner (Bratton et al., 2006). Palliative Care of the Dying Child Appropriate palliative care is essential for any child with a life-threatening or progressive incurable condition. Whether palliative care is provided in the home, hospital, or hospice setting, the goal is to provide the best quality of life possible at the end of life while alleviating physical, psychological, emotional, and spiritual suffering. The Last Acts Palliative Care Task Force has established principles on which palliative care of children should be based. These include: Respecting children's goals, preferences, and choices Comprehensive caring Using the strengths of interdisciplinary resources Acknowledging and addressing caregivers' concerns Building systems and mechanisms of support (Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses [APON], 2003) Hospice Care Hospice allows for family-centered care in the child's home or a hospice facility. As with adult hospice care, the comfort of the entire family is important. The goals of pediatric hospice care are enhancement of quality of life for the child and family through an individualized plan of care. The recommended standards for pediatric hospice care do not preclude involvement in ongoing treatment (this is in contrast to adult hospice), but certain eligibility criteria must be met (Children's Hospice International, 2011). Parents are educated on ways to comfort and interact with their dying child, such as massage, movement, or singing. Spiritual support is available through a chaplain, a social worker, or the family's minister. The nurse not only educates the family about the dying process but also assists them with providing basic care and pain management. The decision to withhold nutrition or hydration may be made in certain instances. Pain management is of the utmost importance for the terminally ill child (APON, 2003). Ongoing bereavement care is also provided to the family by the hospice after the child's death. Nursing Management of the Dying Child Though interdisciplinary care is essential for quality care at the end of life, it is the nurse who plays the key role of child/family advocate and who is usually the constant presence throughout the dying process. Nursing management of the dying child focuses on managing pain and discomfort, providing nutrition, providing emotional support to the dying child and family, and assisting the family through the grief process. Throughout the process, it is important to focus on the family as the unit of care. Managing Pain and Discomfort Pain management is an essential component of care for the child with a terminal illness. Providing for comfort enhances the child's quality of life and minimizes suffering (Baker et al., 2008). Assess pain using a developmentally appropriate tool (see Chapter 14 for further information). Provide pain medication around the clock rather than on an \"as needed\" basis to prevent recurrence or escalationof pain. Determine the child's preferred comfort measures and use them to provide additional relief. Change the child's position frequently but gently to minimize discomfort. Limit nursing care to comfort measures that ease the child's discomfort. Maintain a calm environment, minimizing noise and light. Providing Nutrition Since the body naturally requires less nutrition as the child is dying, do not excessively coax the child to eat or drink. Offer frequent small meals or snacks of the child's choosing. Soups and shakes require less energy to eat and so may be desirable. If the child desires a different food, provide that one. Keep strong odors away from the child to decrease nausea. Administer antiemetics as needed. Provide mouth care and keep the lips lubricated to keep the mouth feeling clean and prevent the discomfort associated with chapped lips. Make sure the environment is a pleasant one for eating. Providing Emotional Support to the Dying Child and Family Be attuned to the entire family's needs and emotions in order to foster a holistic connection with the child and family. Nurses provide physical care through specific tasks and interventions for the dying child, but they also need to be fully present emotionally with the child and family. In general, people are uncomfortable with the concept of a dying child. Nurses should work through their own feelings about the situation to be able to be \"in the moment\" with the child and family. Ask yourself: Can I be fully present with this family? If not, then what can I change to be so? (Rushton, 2005). Families and dying children benefit from the presence of the nurse, not just the interventions he or she performs. Families report that the simple act of being present with the family is very healing (Mellichamp, 2007). Listen to the child and family; be still and silent for a time to accomplish this. Foster respect for the whole child by attending to him or her as such. Respect the parents of the dying child by helping them honor the commitments they have made to their child. Acknowledge that parents have diverse needs for information and participation in decision making. Allow and encourage family customs or rituals in relation to death and dying. Families may desire the pastor or priest to be present when the child's death is imminent. Certain rituals may be desired, depending on the family's religious or spiritual background. Ensure that these important events occur, and alter nursing care routines as needed to accommodate them. Respect the family's need to participate in these rituals and customs (Ethier, 2010).

Resources for families of a dying child are listed in Box 12.6. The Make-a-Wish Foundation works to grant the wishes of terminally ill children, giving the child and family an experience of hope, strength, and love. A link to the Make-a-Wish Foundation is included on EASING ANXIETY OR FEARS Parents may be afraid of their child dying alone or not know what to expect in the death process. This fear may contribute to increased anxiety, which the child may sense. Younger children may fear separation from their parents and older children may not want to die alone or experience pain or discomfort associated with dying. Each child and family is individual; discuss their particular fears and anxieties in order to determine the child's and family's needs for education and support (Baker et al., 2008). Involve the parents and other family members in all phases of the child's care. Explain all aspects of care to the child to minimize anxiety related to nursing interventions. Answer the child's questions honestly. Involve the child in decision making whenever possible. Limit interventions to those related to palliation, rather than treatment, advocating for the child as needed. Remain with the child when a parent or family member is not in the room so the child will not fear dying alone. MEETING THE DYING CHILD'S NEEDS ACCORDING TO DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE It is important to provide the type of support and education that the dying child needs according to his or her developmental stage. For the infant, unconditional love and trust are of utmost importance. Ensure that the infant's family is available to the child. The toddler, 1 to 3 years old, thrives on familiarity and routine. Maximize the toddler's time with parents, be consistent, provide favorite toys, and ensure physical comfort. Spirituality in the preschool years focuses on the concept of right versus wrong. The 3- to 5-year- old may see death as punishment for wrongdoing; correct this misunderstanding. Use honest and precise language. Help the parents to teach the child that though the family will miss the child, it will continue to function without him or her (Ethier, 2010). The school-age child has a concrete understanding of death. Children who are 5 to 10 years old need specific, honest details (as desired). Encourage the child to help make decisions, and help the child to establish a sense of control (Ethier, 2010). The young adolescent (10 to 14 years old) will benefit from reinforcement of self-esteem, self-respect, and a sense of worth. Respect the child's need for privacy and time alone as well as time requested with peers. Support the need for independence and encourage the child to participate in decision making. The older teen (14 to 18 years of age) has a more adult-like understanding of death and will need further support through honest, detailed explanations and will want to feel truly involved and listened to (Ethier, 2010). Assisting the Family Through the Grief Process The family may experience anticipatory grief when the diagnosis of terminal illness is made. Families may deny the prognosis, become angry at the health care system or a higher power, or experience depression. Acute grief is an intense process that occurs around the time of the actual death. Family members may feel short of breath or as though the throat is tight. They may verbalize that the situation is unreal to them or search for reasons why the death was not prevented. Families may also display hostility or restlessness. Each individual will express grief in his or her own manner. Mourning the death of a loved one takes a long time, and families should be supported throughout the process (Ethier, 2010). Local and national resources are available for grieving parents. Several resources for grieving parents are listed on . Refer parents to bereavement resources as appropriate. KEY CONCEPTS Children with special health care needs are those who have, or are at risk for, a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional condition that generally requires more intensive and diverse health services, as well as coordination of those services, than do typical children. Most children with chronic illnesses or who are dependent on technology progress through stages of growth and development just as typical children do, though possibly at a slower pace. Parents of special needs children experience a multitude of emotions and changes in their lives, often carrying a heavy caregiving burden. They become the experts on their child's care and should be empowered and supported in their efforts. The child and family with special needs may require additional support during times of transition, such as at initial diagnosis or change in prognosis, when symptoms increase, when the child moves to a new setting (hospital, school), during periods of developmental change, or during a parent's absence. Children with special health care needs are at increased risk for the development of vulnerable child syndrome, which may have psychologically harmful effects on the child and parents for many years. Home is the most developmentally appropriate environment for children with special health care needs and those who are technology dependent. Children display an improved physical, emotional, psychological, and social status when they are cared for at home. Family-centered care provides the optimal framework for caring for children and families with special needs. Empowering the family strengthens them. A medical home or permanent relationship with the physician or nurse practitioner benefits the family, ascare coordination and advocacy are provided. Use adjusted (or corrected) age when assessing growth and development of the infant or child who was born prematurely. Provide early screening and intervention for issues related to development to maximize the former preemie's potential for growth and development. Become familiar with the risks and benefits of adjuvant therapies used by some families of children with special health care needs. Screen children with special health care needs for failure to thrive or a feeding disorder. Screening helps to identify children with unmet health needs so that intervention may begin. Early intervention provides care coordination (developmental services and special education), as well as an individualized family service plan for qualifying children and their families. Each special needs student is entitled to an IEP, which is a written plan that is designed to meet the preschool, primary, or secondary school student's needs. Early discharge planning and ongoing inclusion and education of the family facilitate continuity of care. During midadolescence, initiate a written plan to help the special needs child make the transition to adult care. Support the dying child and the family throughout the end-of-life decision-making process, providing facts as desired about palliative care, hospice, and organ donation. Younger children who are dying generally need for their families to be close and to trust their needs will be provided for. Older children require honest explanations given at a level appropriate for the child's age or developmental stage. REFERENCES 108th Congress. (2004).

CHAPTER WORKSHEET MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS1. The parents of a 5-year-old with special health care needs talk to the parents of a 10-year-old with a similar condition for quite a while each day. What is the nurse's interpretation of this behavior? a. The nurse has not provided enough emotional support for the parents. b. This relationship between the children's parents is potentially unhealthy. c. Support between parents of special children is extremely valuable. d. Confidentiality is a pressing issue in this particular situation. 2. The nurse is caring for a child who has received all possible medical care for cancer, yet continues to experience relapse and metastasis. It is time to make the transition from curative care attempts to palliative care. What is the most important nursing consideration at this time? a. The health care professionals should make the decision about the child's care. b. The family may lose a sense of hope, so cancer treatments should continue. c. Involve the family in the decision-making process about the shift to palliative care. d. Palliative care can take place only at home, so the child should be discharged. 3. The nurse is caring for a 3-year-old with a gastrostomy tube and tracheostomy who is on supplemental oxygen and multiple medications. The mother is rooming in during this hospitalization. What is the priority nursing action? a. Incorporate the mother's assistance in care when convenient. b. Recognize the mother as the expert on her child's needs and care. c. Recommend that the mother go home to get some rest. d. Provide family-centered care since the mother is there. 4. The nurse is caring for a child with a developmental disability who is starting kindergarten this year. The mother is tearful and doesn't want the child to go to school. What is the best response by the nurse? a. \"Do you need some time alone to collect yourself?\" b. \"You've known for a while this time would come.\" c. \"Can I call your husband or a friend for you?\" d. \"It is normal to feel stressed or sad at this time.\" 5. The parents of a child with a developmental disability ask the nurse for advice about disciplining their child. What is the best response by the nurse? a. \"You should choose methods that are most congruent with your values about discipline.\" b. \"Children like this really can't follow directions, so they may be very hard to discipline.\" c. \"Punish your child only for socially unacceptable or offending behaviors.\" d. \"Spanking works well for this type of child, as they really don't like pain.\" CRITICAL THINKING EXERCISES 1. A 15-year-old boy is dying of cancer after all medical care options have been exhausted. Describe the plan of care for this child and his family. What strategies should the nurse use to support the child and his family through this difficult process? 2. A 5-month-old infant who was born at 24 weeks' gestation is ready to be discharged from the NICU. She will be going home on oxygen, gastrostomy tube feedings, and eight medications. Develop a teaching plan for the family. STUDY ACTIVITIES 1. In the clinical setting, care for a child with a terminal illness. Reflect in your clinical journal about the feelings you had during the care of the child, as well as the feelings and behaviors that you noticed in the child, siblings, parents, and nursing staff. 2. Visit a preschool that provides care for developmentally delayed and typical children. Choose two same-age children, one with a disability or impairment and the other a typical healthy child. Perform a Denver developmental screening or developmental assessment on each of the two children. Compare and contrast your findings. 3. Spend the day with a home care nurse providing care for a technology-dependent child. What obstacles has the family overcome to have this child at home? What adjustments does the nurse make to provide family-centered care in the home (as compared to the hospital setting)?13 Key Pediatric Nursing Interventions Words of Wisdom Quality technical skills delivered by a caring hand are a vital part of good nursing care. KEY TERMS biotransformation bolus feeding pharmacokinetics residual total parenteral nutrition Learning Objectives Upon completion of this chapter, you will be able to: 1. Describe the \"eight rights\" of pediatric medication administration. 2. Explain the physiologic differences in children affecting a medication's pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. 3. Accurately determine recommended pediatric medication doses. 4. Demonstrate the proper technique for administering medication to children via the oral, rectal, ophthalmic, otic, intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous routes. 5. Integrate the concepts of atraumatic care in medication administration for children. 6. Identify the preferred sites for peripheral and central intravenous medication administration. 7. Describe nursing management related to maintenance of intravenous infusions in children, as well as prevention of complications. 8. Explain nursing care related to enteral tube feedings. 9. Describe nursing management of the child receiving total parenteral nutrition. Lily Kline, a 9-month-old, is admitted to your unit for failure to thrive. The physician has ordered insertion of anasogastric tube to begin gavage feedings. The parents are very nervous and upset about this. They ask, \"What will this tube do for Lily? It sounds very uncomfortable. What do you have to do to insert it? Will it have to stay in all the time? Won't it move?\" How would you address their concerns? The ill child often requires medications, intravenous (IV) therapy, or enteral nutrition to restore health. These interventions occur most often in the inpatient setting, but with today's advanced technology many children may receive treatment in the home, day care center, school, physician's office, or other community setting. This chapter will discuss the key elements of, and guidelines for, care related to medication administration, IV therapy, and nutritional support in children. Child and parent education is emphasized. The chapter will focus on adapting and modifying medication administration and nursing procedures based on the child's growth and development and providing these treatments using a family- centered, atraumatic approach. Refer back to Chapter 8 for an overview of the important aspects of caring for a child who is to undergo a procedure. MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION At one time or another, every child will need to receive medication. As with adults, pediatric medication administration is a critical component of safe and effective nursing care. The pediatric nurse must adapt administration principles and techniques to meet the child's needs. Medication administration, regardless of the route, requires a solid knowledge base about the drug and its action. As with medication administration to any child, the nurse must adhere to the \"rights\" of medication administration ( Box 13.1 ). Differences in Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics Although a drug's mechanism of action is the same in any individual, the physiologic immaturity of some body systems in a child can affect a drug's pharmacodynamics (behavior of the medication at the cellular level). As a result, the body may not respond to the drug as intended. The intended effect may be enhanced or diminished, necessitating a change in the dosage to ensure optimal effectiveness without increasing the child's risk for toxicity. The child's age, weight, body surface area, and body composition also can affect the drug's pharmacokinetics (movement of drugs throughout the body via absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion). Drugs are administered to children via many of the same routes that are used for adults. However, this similarity ends once the drug is administered. During the absorption process, drugs move from the administration site into the bloodstream. In infants and young children, the absorption of orally administered medications is affected by slower gastric emptying, increased intestinal motility, a proportionately larger small intestine surface area, higher gastric pH, and decreased lipase and amylase secretion compared with adults. Intramuscular absorption in infants and young children is affected by the amount of muscle mass, muscle tone and perfusion, and vasomotor instability. Similarly, decreased perfusion alters subcutaneous absorption. Absorption by these routes is erratic and may be decreased. In contrast, topical absorption of medications is increased in infants and young children, which can result in adverse effects not seen in adults. Infants and young children have a greater body surface area, leading to increased absorption of topical medications. Absorption in infants is also increased due to greater permeability of the infant's skin. BOX 13.1 EIGHT RIGHTS OF PEDIATRIC MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION Right Medication Check order and expiration dates. Know action of medication and potential side effects (use pharmacy, drug formulary). Ensure that the medication provided is the medication that is ordered. Right Patient Confirm child identity since children may deny their identity in attempt to avoid an unpleasant situation, play in another child's bed, or remove ID bracelet. Confirm identity each time medication is given. Verify child's name with caregiver to provide additional verification. Right Time Give within 20 to 30 minutes of the ordered time. For a medication given on an as-needed (PRN) basis, know when it was last given and how much was given during the past 24 hours. Right Route of Administration Check ordered route and ensure this is the most effective and safest route for this child; clarify any order that is confusing or unclear. Give the medication by the route ordered. If there is a need to change route, always check with prescriber (e.g., if a child is vomiting and has an order for an oral medication, the medication may need to be given via the IV or rectal route). Right Dose Calculate the recommended dose according to child's weight and double-check your calculations. Always question the pharmacist and/or prescriber if the ordered dose falls outside the recommended dose range. Unusually large or small volumes or dosages should always be verified. Right Documentation Record administration of the medication on the appropriate paper or computerized form according to agency policy. Ensure that all medications administered and refused are documented. Right to Be Educated Provide simple explanations to the child based on his or her level of understanding. Explain to the parents or caregiver about the medication to be given and what to expect from it. Use a positive, firm approach with the child. Right to Refuse Provide explanations to the child and parents to clarify any misconceptions or relieve fears. Reinforce the rationale for medication use. Respect the child's or parents' option to refuse. The distribution (movement of a drug from the blood to interstitial spaces and then into cells) of medications is also altered in infants and young children. Medication distribution in children is affected by: Higher percentage of body water than adults More rapid extracellular fluid exchange Decreased body fat Liver immaturity, altering first-pass elimination Decreased amounts of plasma proteins available for drug binding Immature blood-brain barrier, especially in neonates, allowing permeation by certain medications Metabolism of medications in children is altered because of differences in hepatic enzyme production and the child's increased metabolic rate. Biotransformation (the alteration of chemical structures from their original form, which allows for the eventual excretion of the substance) is affected by the same variations affecting distribution in children. In addition, the immaturity of the kidneys until the age of 1 to 2 years affects renal blood flow, glomerular filtration, and active tubular secretion. This results in a longer half-life and increases the potential for toxicity of drugs primarily excreted by the kidneys. Developmental Issues and Concerns Children are constantly growing and developing. The specific psychosocial, cognitive, physical, and motor developmental levels of children are important. Nurses need a solid understanding of growth and development to ensure safe administration of medications to children. Table 13.1 details some growth and development issues related to administering medications to children. Always give developmentally appropriate, truthful explanations before administering medications to children, including: Why the drug is needed What the child will experience What is expected of the child How the parents can participate and support their child Refer to Chapters 3 through 7 for further information about growth and developmental issues. The child's past experiences with taking medications and the approaches that may have been used will often affect how the child reacts. Always approach children positively; let your manner convey the belief that they can accomplish this needed behavior. Never label the child as \"bad\" if he or she did not fully cooperate in taking medication. When medications must be administered with a needle (intramuscularly or subcutaneously), assure the child that this method is not a consequence of the child's behavior. Help parents to work through the feelings of frustration that may result from the child's refusal to cooperate with medication administration. Provide parents with facts about growth and developmental issues and children's fears and anxiety related to medication administration. Model alternative ways for the parents to deal with undesirable behavior. Take Note! Always administer medications promptly, assist the child in holding still using a comforting position for the child, and reward positive behavior. Determination of Correct DoseAdministering the correct dose is a key component of medication administration. Incorrect dosing is the most commonly reported medication error in the pediatric population (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007). Many drug references list recommended pediatric dosages, and nurses are responsible for checking doses to ensure that they are appropriate for the child. Two common methods for determining pediatric doses are based on the unit of drug per kilogram of body weight or body surface area (BSA). Dose Determination by Body Weight The most common method for calculating pediatric medication doses is based on body weight. The recommended dosage is usually expressed as the amount of drug to be given over a 24-hour period (mg/kg/day) or as a single dose (mg/kg/dose). Differentiate between the 24-hour dosage and the single dose. Use these guidelines to determine the correct dose by body weight: 1. Weigh the child. 2. If the child's weight is in pounds, convert it to kilograms (divide the child's weight in pounds by 2.2). 3. Check a drug reference for the safe dose range (for example, 10 to 20 mg/kg of body weight). 4. Calculate the low safe dose ( Box 13.2). 5. Calculate the high safe dose ( Box 13.2 ). 6. Determine if the dose ordered is within this range. The pediatric dosage should not exceed the minimum recommended adult dosage. Generally, once a child or adolescent weighs 50 kg or greater, the adult dose is frequently prescribed (Bowden & Greenberg, 2008). However, it remains important to always verify that the dose does not exceed the recommended adult dose. Dose Determination by Body Surface Area Calculating the dosage based on BSA takes into account the child's metabolic rate and growth. It is commonly used for chemotherapeutic agents. Some recommended medication doses may read \"mg/BSA/dose.\" To determine the dose using BSA, you will need to know the child's height and weight, which will be plotted on a nomogram ( Fig. 13.1 ). A nomogram is a graph divided into three columns: height (left column), surface area (middle column), and weight (right column). Use these guidelines to determine BSA:1. Measure the child's height. 2. Determine the child's weight. 3. Using the nomogram, draw a line to connect the height measurement in the left column and the weight measurement in the right column. 4. Determine the point where this line intersects the line in the surface area column. This is the BSA, expressed in meters squared (m 2 ). Once you have determined the BSA, use the recommended dosage range to calculate the safe dosage. Oral Administration Medications to be given via the oral route are supplied in many forms, including liquids (elixirs, syrups, or suspensions), powders, tablets, and capsules. Generally, children younger than the age of 5 to 6 are at risk for aspiration because they have difficulty swallowing tablets or capsules. Therefore, if a tablet or capsule is the only oral form available, it needs to be crushed or opened and mixed with a pleasant-tasting liquid or a small amount (generally no more than a tablespoon) of a nonessential food such as applesauce. However, never crush or open an enteric-coated or time-release tablet or capsule. The crushed tablet or inside of a capsule may taste bitter, so never mix it with formula or other essential foods. Otherwise, the child may associate the bitter taste with the food and later refuse to eat it. BOX 13.2 DOSAGE CALCULATION USING BODY WEIGHT After converting the child's weight in pounds to kilograms and checking the safe dose range: Calculate the low safe dose range (e.g., 10 to 20 mg/kg and the child weighs 30 kg): Set up a proportion using the low safe dose range 10 mg/1 kg = x mg/30 kg Solve for x by cross-multiplying: Calculate the high safe dose range: Set up a proportion using the high safe dose range 20 mg/1 kg = x mg/30 kg Solve for x by cross-multiplying: Compare the safe dose range (for this example, 300 to 600 mg) with the ordered dose. If the dose falls within the range, the dose is safe. If the dose falls outside the range, notify the prescriber.FIGURE 13.1 A nomogram to determine body surface area. Take Note! Certain drug formulations should not be crushed. Before crushing a pill or opening a capsule, always check that this will not alter the intended effects of the drug. Liquid medications, primarily suspensions, may be less concentrated at the top of the bottle than at the bottom of the bottle. Always shake the liquid to ensure even drug distribution. The key to administering liquid forms of oral medications is to use calibrated equipment such as a medicine cup, spoon, plastic oral syringe, or dropper ( Fig. 13.2 ). Take Note! Use the medicine cup or syringe with proper calibration instead of household cups or measuring spoons, since they are not calibrated and may deliver an incorrect dose of medication. If a dropper is packaged with a certain medication, never use it to administer another medication, since the drop size may vary from one dropper to another. If using a syringe for oral administration, only use the type intended for oral medications, not one designed for parenteral administration. When using a dropper or oral syringe (without a needle) for infants or young children, direct the liquid toward the posterior side of the mouth. Give the drug slowly in small amounts (0.2 to 0.5 mL) and allow the child to swallow before more medication is placed in the mouth ( Fig. 13.3 ). A nipple without the bottle attached is sometimes used to administer medication to infants. Place the medication directly in the nipple and keep the nipple filled with medication as the infant sucks so no air is taken in while the infant takes the medication. Always place the infant or young child upright (at least a 45-degree angle) to avoid aspiration. The toddler or young preschooler may enjoy using the oral syringe to squirt the medicine into his or hermouth. Older children can take oral medication from a medicine cup or measured medicine spoon. FIGURE 13.2 Devices used to administer oral medications to children.FIGURE 13.3 Position the infant or young child for safe medication administration. Take Note! Never force an oral medication into a child's mouth or pinch the child's nose. Doing so increases the risk for aspiration and interferes with the development of a trusting relationship. As children adapt to swallowing tablets or capsules, administration is similar to that of adults. When helping the younger child learn how to swallow medication, the tablet or capsule can be placed at the back of the tongue or in a small amount of food such as ice cream or applesauce. Always tell children if there is medicine in the food; otherwise, they may not trust you. BOX 13.3 GUIDELINES FOR ADMINISTERING MEDICATIONS VIA GASTROSTOMY OR JEJUNOSTOMY TUBES Verify correct placement (refer to Box 13.4 ). Give liquid medications directly into the tube. Draw appropriate amount into syringe and clear air. Mix powdered medications well with warm water first. If medication is in pill form, verify it is OK to crush. Then, crush tablets and mix with warm water to prevent tube occlusion. Open up capsules and mix the contents with warm water to dissolve the contents and prevent tube occlusion. Label each syringe appropriately. Flush the tube with water after administering medications to ensure that the entire amount of medication has been given and toprevent tube occlusion. Adapted from Bowden, V. R., & Greenberg, C. S. (2008). Pediatric nursing procedures. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. (2009). Abdominal and digestive home care. Retrieved January 23, 2010, from http://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/health/info/abdomen/home/g-tube-care.htm When the child has a nasogastric, orogastric, nasojejunal, nasoduodenal, gastrostomy (opening into the stomach), or jejunostomy tube, oral medications may be given via these devices. The tube allows for the medication to be placed directly into the stomach or small intestine area. Be aware that not all medications can be placed directly into the duodenum or jejunum. Medication for administration via a tube must be supplied in a liquid form, or a crushed tablet or opened capsule can be mixed with a liquid ( Box 13.3 ). Always check tube placement prior to administering the medication. After administration, flush the tube to maintain patency. Rectal Administration Rectal medications are typically supplied in the form of suppositories. The rectal route is not a preferred route for medication administration in children because the drug's absorption may be erratic and unpredictable and the method is invasive. The rectal route can be extremely upsetting to the toddler and preschooler because of age-related fears, and may be embarrassing to the school-age child or adolescent. However, the rectal route may be used when the child is vomiting or receiving nothing by mouth (NPO). Use age- appropriate explanations and reassurance. Helping the child to maintain the correct position may be necessary to ensure proper insertion and safety of rectal suppositories. FIGURE 13.4 Administering eye medication: gently press the lower lid down and have the child look up as the medication is instilled into the lower conjunctival sac. Lubricate the suppository well with a water-soluble lubricant. With the child in the side-lying position, insert the suppository into the rectum quickly but gently. Wear gloves or use a finger cot to insert the suppository. Insert the suppository above the anal sphincter. For an infant or child younger than the age of 3, use the fifth finger for insertion. For an older child, use the index finger. To prevent expulsion of the suppository, hold the buttocks together for several minutes or until the child loses the urge to defecate. If the child has a bowel movement within 10 to 30 minutes after administration of the medication, examine the stool for the presence of the suppository. If it is observed, notify the physician or nurse practitioner to determine if the drug needs to be administered again. Ophthalmic Administration Ophthalmic medications are typically supplied in the form of drops or ointment. Many children have a fear of having anything placed in their eyes. Therefore, provide an age-appropriate explanation to gain their cooperation. Also, have the child keep his or her eyes closed until you are ready to administer the medication. Ensure that the medication is at room temperature, as chilled medication may be uncomfortable to the child. Proper positioning of the child is necessary to control the child's head, keep the child's hands from interfering, and prevent injury to the eye. Attempt to administer the medication when the child is not crying to ensure that the medication reaches its intended target area.Wash hands thoroughly and don gloves. Place the child in the supine position, slightly hyperextending the neck with the head lower than the body so the medication will be dispersed over the cornea. Rest the heel of your hand on the child's forehead to stabilize it. Retract the lower eyelid and place the medication in the conjunctival sac; maintain sterile technique by being careful not to touch the tip of the tube or dropper to the sac. For eye drops, place the prescribed number of drops into the lower conjunctival sac ( Fig. 13.4 ). For ointment, apply the medication in a thin ribbon from the inner canthus outward without touching the eye or eyelashes. If the child is old enough to cooperate, instruct the child to gently close the eyes to allow the medication to be dispersed. If a child is uncooperative, he or she may need to be immobilized in order to administer the eye drops. Alternatively, one or two drops on the inner canthus of the closed eye can be administered while the child is lying supine. Then instruct the child to open his or her eyes and the drops will enter the eye. Wipe any excess medication from the skin. Punctal occlusion after application is also important to slow systemic absorption and ensure the medicine stays in the eye. Children often require ophthalmic medications at home. Parents or caregivers need instruction about how to administer this type of medication. Teaching Guidelines 13.1 provides information on administering eye drops and eye ointments. Teaching Guidelines 13.1 APPLYING EYE MEDICATIONS Wash your hands with soap and water. Dry them thoroughly using paper towels or a clean cloth. Allow the eye drops or ointment to come to room temperature (if the medication was stored in the refrigerator). If necessary, warm the eye drops or ointment tube in the palm of your hand. Keep the cap on to avoid any spillage. Make sure medication is well mixed if needed. Remove the cap, placing it on a dry, clean surface. For young children (3 years or younger), obtain assistance to keep their arms and fingers away during the procedure. If doing this procedure alone, wrap the child in a towel or blanket, keeping the arms inside. If you are applying eye drops, it may be easiest if you are standing or sitting behind the child, looking over the back of the child's head as he or she reclines. If you are applying an eye ointment, it may be easiest to face the child directly. Using one hand, hold the child's forehead in place while raising the eyelid with your thumb. With your other hand, hold the eye drop bottle or ointment tube above the eye, using an extended finger against the child's cheek, forehead, or nose to steady your hand. Gently squeeze the eye drop bottle, dispensing the proper number of drops, or gently squeeze the ointment tube, dispensing a small trail (about 2 cm) of ointment into the gap between the lower portion of the eye and bottom eyelid. Make sure the tip of the bottle or tube does not make contact with the eye or any other surface. For eye drops, gently press your finger against the inside corner where the eye meets the nose for about 1 minute, blocking the tears and medication from exiting through the tear duct. This will help the eye retain more of the medication. If the child is old enough, he or she may be able to do this unassisted. For ointment, have the child close his or her eye and not rub the area. Ask the child not to blink or squeeze the eye shut more than normal, as this may wash away the medication prematurely. Gently dab away any tears or medication on the face with a clean tissue. If necessary, clean the tip of the bottle or tube with a clean tissue and recap. Wash your hands again and dry them thoroughly. Adapted from Pediatric Glaucoma & Cataract Family Association. (2008).

Retrieved January 20, 2010, from http://www.pgcfa.org/ointment.htm Otic Administration Medications for otic administration are typically in the form of ear drops. This route of administration can be upsetting to the child because he or she cannot see what is happening. The child often receives otic drugs for an earache, and he or she may fear that the ear drops will increase the pain. Explain the procedure to the younger child in terms that he or she can understand to help allay these fears. Gain the older child's cooperation by explaining the purpose of the medication and the procedure for administration. Reinforce the need for the child to keep the head still. Younger children may require assistance to do so. Be sure that the eardrops are at room temperature. If necessary, roll the container between the palms of your hands to help warm the drops. Using cold ear drops can cause pain and possibly vertigo when they reach the eardrum (Bowden & Greenberg, 2008). Place the child in a supine or side-lying position with the affected ear exposed ( Fig. 13.5 ). Pull the pinna downward and back in children younger than age 3 and upward and back in older children. Instill the medication using a dropper. Then have the child remain in the same position for several minutes to ensure that the medication stays in the ear canal. Massage the area anterior to the affected ear to promote passage of the medication into the ear canal. If necessary, place a piece of cotton or a cotton ball loosely in the ear canal to prevent the medication from leaking. Nasal Administration Nasally administered medications are typically drops and sprays. Administering nose drops to infants and young children may be difficult, and additional help may be needed to help maintain the child's position. For nose drops, position the child supine with the head hyperextended to ensure that the drops will flow back into the nares. A pillow or folded towel can be used to facilitate this hyperextension. Place the tip of the dropper just at or inside the nasal opening, taking care not to touch the nares with the dropper ( Fig. 13.6 ). Doing so might stimulate the child to sneeze. Although the nasal membranes are not sterile, the drop solution is, and sneezing would contaminate the dropper, leading to contamination of the drop solution when the dropper is returned to the bottle. Once the drops are instilled, maintain the child's head in hyperextension for at least 1 minute to ensure that the drops have come in contact with the nasal membranes. FIGURE 13.5 Administering ear drops. (A) For the child younger than 3 years of age, the nurse pulls the pinna of the ear down and back. (B) For a child older than age 3 years, the nurse pulls the pinna of the affected ear up and back.FIGURE 13.6 Administering nose drops. Tilt the head down and back to instill nose drops. For nasal sprays, position the child upright and place the tip of the spray bottle just inside the nasal opening and tilted toward the back. Squeeze the container, providing just enough force for the spray to be expelled from the container. Using too great a force can push the spray solution and secretions into the sinuses or eustachian tube. Take Note! In young infants, instill the medication in one naris at a time, since they are obligate nose breathers. Intramuscular Administration Intramuscular (IM) administration delivers medication to the muscle. In children, this method of medication administration is used infrequently because it is painful and children often lack adequate muscle mass for medication absorption. However, IM administration is used to administer certain medications, such as many immunizations. Muscle development and the amount of fluid to be injected determine IM injection sites in children. Needle size (gauge and length) is determined by the size of the muscle and the viscosity of the medication. For example, more viscous medications often require a larger-gauge needle. In addition, the needle must be long enough to ensure that the medication reaches the muscle. The preferred injection site for infants is the vastus lateralis muscle (Immunization Action Coalition, 2010). The dorsogluteal site, often used in adults, is not recommended in children younger than 5 years of age (Bowden & Greenberg, 2008). The muscle has not fully developed and the sciatic nerve occupies a larger portion of this area in the young child. Take Note!Some experts no longer recommend use of the dorsogluteal site at any age due to the risk of damaging the sciatic nerve (Aschenbrenner & Venable, 2008). The deltoid muscle is used as an IM injection site in children older than 3 years of age and may be used in toddlers if the muscle mass is sufficient (Immunization Action Coalition, 2010). Figure 13.7 illustrates IM injection sites. Select the needle size and gauge based on the size of the child's muscle. The goal is to use the smallest length and gauge that will deposit the medication in the muscle. Table 13.2 provides general guidelines for solution amount, needle size, and needle gauge when administering IM medications. Insert the needle into the skin at a 90-degree angle. Aspirating and, if no blood was present, injecting the medication was the traditional procedure. However, recent research has shown decreased discomfort and no associated complications with rapid injection of intramuscular immunizations without aspiration (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010). In addition, there are no large blood vessels present in the currently recommended injection sites, the vastus lateralis and deltoid muscles (Kroger, Sumaya, Pickering, & Atkinson, 2011). Therefore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) no longer recommend aspiration before injection (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010; Kroger et al., 2011). Subcutaneous and Intradermal Administration Subcutaneous (SQ) administration distributes medication into the fatty layers of the body. It is used primarily for insulin administration, heparin, and certain immunizations, such as the MMR. The amount of subcutaneous tissue differs among individuals. Therefore, when selecting a site and needle size, choose the most appropriate based on adequacy and condition of the subcutaneous tissue and the frequency and duration of the therapy. The preferred sites for SQ administration include the anterior thigh, lateral upper arms, and abdomen (Bowden & Greenberg, 2008; Immunization Action Coalition, 2010). Use a 3/8- or 5/8-inch, 23- to 25-gauge needle. Pinch up the skin with the nondominant hand to isolate the tissue from the muscle. Insert the needle at a 45- to 90-degree angle, release the skin if pinched, and inject the medication slowly.FIGURE 13.7 Locating intramuscular injection sites. (A) Vastus lateralis: identify the greater trochanter and the lateral femoral condyle; inject in middle third and anterior lateral aspect. (B) Dorsogluteal: place hand on iliac crest and locate the posterosuperior iliac spine; inject in the outer quadrant formed when an imaginary line is drawn between the trochanter and the iliac spine. (C) Deltoid: locate the lateral side of the humerus, one to two finger widths below the acromion process. Inject into upper third of muscle. (D) Ventrogluteal: place palm of left hand on right greater trochanter so index finger points toward anterosuperior iliac spine, spread middle finger to form a V, and inject in the middle of the V. Intradermal (ID) administration deposits medication just under the epidermis. The forearm is the usual site for administration. ID administration is used primarily for tuberculosis screening and allergy testing. A 1-mL syringe with a 5/8-inch, 25- or 27-gauge needle is commonly used to administer the medication. Insert the needle, with the bevel up, beneath the skin at a 5- to 15-degree angle. Keep the fingers and thumb resting on the sides of the syringe to ensure the proper angle. Intravenous Administration Intravenous (IV) medication administration is commonly used with children, especially when a rapid response to a drug is desired or when absorption via other routes is difficult due to the child's illness or condition. In some cases, the IV route is the only effective method for administering a medication. Use of the IV route requires that the child have an IV device inserted, peripherally or centrally. Although insertion of this device is invasive and traumatic for the child, IV medication administration is considered to be less traumatic when compared to the trauma associated with multiple injections. Unfortunately, the veins of a child are small and easily irritated. Most medications given by the IV route must be given at a specified rate and diluted properly to prevent overdose or toxicity due to the rapid onset of action that occurs with this route. Therefore, when administering medications via the IV route, knowledge of the drug, the amount of drug to be administered, the minimum dilution of the drug, the type of solution for dilution or infusion, the compatibility or various solutions and medications, the length of time for infusion, and the rate of infusion is required. Careful maintenance of the IV site is required to prevent complications. The primary method for IV medication administration is a syringe pump. This method provides a highly precise rate of infusion. Nursing Procedure 13.1 gives the steps for administering medication via a syringe pump. If a pump is unavailable, the medication may be administered via a volume control device. The medication is added to the device with a specified amount of compatible fluid and then infused at the ordered rate. Direct IV push medication typically is reserved for emergency situations and when therapeutic blood levels must be reached quickly to achieve the desired effect. Direct IV push administration requires that the drug be diluted appropriately and given at a specified rate, such as over 2 to 3 minutes. Care must be taken to prevent fluid overload, which may occur due to flushing needed to maintain IV patency and prevent drug incompatibilities, and from the administration of multiple drug therapies. Providing Atraumatic Care When administering any medication, including oral medications, use the principles of atraumatic care (see Chapter 8 for more information). Children can experience stress and fear or upset when they must take medications. The child may become upset or stressed when he or she must be secured snugly or positioned to minimize movement. The child may experience further discomfort if the medication has an unpleasant taste or results in pain, such as with an injection. NURSING PROCEDURE 13.1 Administering Medication via a Syringe Pump Purpose: To provide accurate and safe administration of IV medication 1. Verify the medication order. 2. Gather the medication and necessary equipment and supplies. 3. Wash hands and put on gloves. 4. Attach the syringe pump tubing to the medication syringe and purge air from the tubing by gently filling the tubing with medication from the syringe. 5. Insert the syringe into the pump according to the manufacturer's directions. 6. Clean the appropriate port on the child's IV access device or tubing, flush the device or tubing if appropriate (e.g., an intermittent infusion device [saline lock or heparin lock]), and attach the syringe tubing to the IV tubing or device. 7. Set the infusion rate on the pump as ordered. 8. When the medication infusion is completed, flush the syringe pump tubing to deliver any medication remaining in the tubing, according to institution protocol. 9. Document the procedure and the child's response to it.Adapted from Bowden, V. R., & Greenberg, C. S. (2008). Pediatric nursing procedures. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. A traumatic Care Encourage the child to participate in care and provide the child with developmentally appropriate options, such as which fluid to drink with the medication or which flavor of ice pop to suck on before or after the administration (see Table 13.1 ). To decrease discomfort and pain for the child who is to receive an injection, apply a topical anesthetic such as EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetic) cream or vapocoolant spray to the site before injection (Kroger et al., 2011) (see Chapter 14 for additional information). Ensuring that the child doesn't move is essential to prevent injury when administering an injection. When administering an injection to a young child, at least two adults should hold him or her; this may also be necessary to help an older child to remain still. A traumatic Care Use positions that are comforting to the child, such as therapeutic hugging, during injections. Have the child sit on the caregiver's lap with the caregiver holding the child's arms and legs to his or her body. Refer to Chapter 8 , Figure 8.1 . After administration, encourage the parents or caregivers to hold and cuddle the child and offer praise. Educating the Child and Parents Teaching the child and parents or caregivers about medication administration is key. Many medications are given in the home, making the parents or caregivers the persons responsible for administration. They need to know what medications they are giving and why, how to give them, and what to expect from the drug, including adverse effects. Caregivers and parents often incorrectly dose over- the-counter medications and prescription medications or fail to complete prescribed orders (Broselow, Luten, & Schuman, 2008a). Therefore, ensure thorough instruction, including frequency of administration, when the next dose is due, and length of time the medication is to be given. Emphasize the importance of completing the prescribed dose. Demonstrate use with an actual syringe if possible, encourage return demonstration of medication administration, advise against the use of home measuring devices (such as a spoon), and emphasize the importance of always using the calibrated dispensing device that was given with the medication. If the medication is to be given via injection, parents and caregivers need to learn how to administer the injection properly. Encourage questions or concerns from parents or caregivers. See Evidence-Based Practice 13.1. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 13.1 DOES A PICTOGRAM-BASED HEALTH LITERACY INTERVENTION DECREASE LIQUID MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION ERRORS BY CAREGIVERS OF YOUNGCHILDREN? Research suggests that caregivers of young children make frequent mistakes when administering medication at home, including improper dosing and not following medication regimens correctly. Need for liquid medications, availability of varying concentrations of pediatric medications, and variation in dosing instruments all can contribute to medication errors at home. Good communication from health care providers is essential in ensuring proper medication administration at home. Complex medication regimens; the use of different units of measure such as milliliters, teaspoons, and tablespoons; and communication issues can contribute to confusion of the caregiver and lead to errors in medication administration at home. Parents or caregivers with language barriers, low literacy levels, and low socioeconomic status appear to be at higher risk. STUDY A randomized controlled trail was performed at an urban public hospital pediatric emergency department. A randomized sample of parents and caregivers of children aged 30 days to 8 years, who were prescribed liquid medications, was divided into a group to receive the pictogram-based intervention and a group to receive standard care (the control group). The pictogram intervention consisted of education that used plain language, pictogram-based medication, and patient-specific instruction sheets in both English and Spanish. The instruction sheets included the medication name, indication, dose, dose frequency, length of treatment, preparation, and storage. A medication log was also included for the caregivers. Research staff also demonstrated dosing with a standardized instrument and parents then demonstrated back to the research staff how they would give the medication (referred to as \"teach-back\"). The pictogram instruction sheet and a standard dosing instrument were given to each caregiver in the intervention group to take home. The intervention took 1.5 to 3 minutes to complete. More information about the specific intervention can be obtained at http://helpix.med.nyu.edu/ (NYU Langone Medical Center, 2009). The parents or caregivers were assessed before the intervention and then by phone or in person, 1 day after for daily dose medication and 3 to 5 days after for as-needed medications, after the emergency room visit. Findings The pictogram intervention significantly improved caregiver dosing accuracy and adherence to medication. Increased knowledge of dosing frequency was higher in the intervention group regarding daily dose medication. Correct medication preparation, such as to shake or not, was also higher in the intervention group. The intervention group was significantly more likely to use a standardized dosing instrument compared to the control group. Nursing Implications Nurses should consider the use of pictogram instruction sheets when discharging a child with home medications, especially if medication instructions are complex or the caregiver has a language barrier or low literacy levels. Nurses should demonstrate how to give home medications and utilize the method of teachback in order to improve caregiver dosing accuracy at home. Nurses should ensure caregivers are given a standardized dosing instrument to use at home to administer medications. Adapted from Yin, H. S., Dreyer, B. P., van Schaick, L., Foltin, G. L., Dinglas, C., & Mendelsohn, A. L. (2008). Randomized controlled trial of a pictogram- based intervention to reduce liquid medication dosing errors and improve adherence among caregivers of young children. Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, 162(9), 814-822. Parents and caregivers commonly need suggestions about the best ways to administer the medication to their child. Provide them with tips for administration, such as mixing unpleasant-tasting medications with applesauce or yogurt or offering a favorite liquid as a chaser. Also teach the parents how to properly measure the amount of drug to be given. Teaching Guidelines 13.2 gives pointers about oral medication administration. Refer to Chapter 8 for further information on teaching children and families about medication administration. Teaching Guidelines 13.2 ADMINISTERING ORAL MEDICATIONS Be firm when telling your child that it is time for his or her medication. State, \"It's time for your medicine\" instead of asking, \"Will you take your medicine?\" or \"Can you take your medicine for me?\" Allow your child to choose an appropriate liquid to help swallow the medication or drink after taking it. Limit the choices to twoor three. Never bribe or threaten your child to take his or her medication. Never refer to the medication as \"candy.\" Be honest about the taste of the medication. If necessary, mix it with another food such as applesauce, yogurt, or syrup to help mask the taste. Do not mix the medication with formula or baby food. Always check with your physician or nurse practitioner and pharmacy about opening capsules or crushing tablets and mixing them with food. Some medications should not be opened or crushed. If you are giving a liquid using an oral syringe or dropper, place the medication slowly along the inside of the cheek. Never squirt the medication forcibly to the back of the child's throat. It may cause the child to gag and spit out the medication or aspirate it into his or her lungs. Always praise the child after taking the medication and provide comfort and cuddling. Preventing Medication Errors The incidence of potentially harmful medication errors may be three times as high in pediatrics compared to adults (The Joint Commission, 2008). This can be related to weight-based dosing calculations, fractional dosing, and the need for the use of decimal points. Children are also more susceptible because many drugs used in pediatrics are formulated and packaged for adults and lack U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and dosing guidelines for children. Children, especially the very young, are less able to physiologically tolerate medication errors and are often unable to communicate if an adverse reaction is occurring (The Joint Commission, 2008). The need for safety takes on even greater importance due to the physiologic, psychological, and cognitive differences inherent in children. Confirming the child's identity and double-checking the dosage before administration of any medication are two critical safeguards that play a major role in preventing medication errors. Other ways to prevent medication errors include the following: Confirm the children's weight is accurate. Always weigh children in kilograms. Double-check medication calculations; utilize another health care provider when possible, especially for high-risk medications. If a dose seems unusually small or large, verify the order. Utilize medication ordering and dispensing systems if available. Always report medication errors or near-miss errors to help prevent future mistakes. Utilize the Joint Commission's official \"Do Not Use\" list (link to this list is provided on http://www.jointcommission.org/assets/1/18/Official_Do_Not_Use_List_6_111.PDF ). Take Note! If a parent, caregiver, or child questions whether a medication should be given, listen attentively, answer their questions, and double-check the order.INTRAVENOUS THERAPY IV access provides a route for the administration of medications and fluids. It is commonly used for children because it is the quickest, and often the most effective, method of administration. As with adults, numerous sites and various devices and equipment may be used to provide IV therapy over a short or long period of time. When administering IV therapy, safety is crucial. The nurse must have a solid knowledge base about the fluids or medications to be given as well as a thorough understanding of the child's physical and emotional development. Venipuncture can be a terrifying and painful experience for children and their families. Nurses play a crucial role in providing support and education to the child and family before, during, and after the procedure (refer to Chapter 8 for additional information related to provision of atraumatic care with procedures). Sites IV therapy may be administered via a peripheral vein or a central vein. Peripheral IV therapy sites commonly include the hands, feet, and forearms ( Fig. 13.8 ). In neonates and young infants, the scalp veins may be used (O'Grady et al., 2011). The scalp veins are easily visualized, being covered only by a thin layer of subcutaneous tissue. These veins do not have valves, so the device may be inserted in either direction, although the preference would be in the direction of blood flow. However, use of a scalp vein requires that that area of the infant's head be cleared of hair to enhance visualization. In addition, use of the scalp veins can be frightening to parents, who may think the fluid is infusing into the infant's brain. Thus, scalp veins are usually used only if attempts at other sites have been unsuccessful (Bergvall & Sawyer, 2009). When used, ensure appropriate education of the parents prior to insertion and, if shaving the child's hair is needed, inquire if parents would like to keep the child's hair. FIGURE 13.8 Preferred peripheral sites for intravenous insertion. Take Note! When selecting an IV site in an extremity, always choose the most distal site. Doing so prevents injury to the veins superior to the site and allows additional access sites should complications develop in the most distal site. Central IV therapy usually is administered through a large vein, such as the subclavian, femoral, or jugular vein or the vena cava. The tip of the device lies in the superior vena cava just at the entrance to the right atrium. The device is inserted surgically or percutaneously and exits the body typically in the chest area, just below the clavicle. A device can be inserted via a peripheral vein, such as the median, cephalic, or basilic vein, and then threaded into the superior vena cava. Equipment The choice of equipment is determined by the solution or medication to be administered, the duration of the therapy, the age and developmental level of the child, the child's status, and the condition of his or her veins. Various types of IV devices are commercially available. In addition, different types of tubing and infusion control devices may be necessary. Peripheral Access Devices Devices used for peripheral venous access in a child include over-the-needle catheters or winged-infusion sets, commonly referred to as \"butterflies\" or scalp vein needles. These devices are inserted into the vein and then connected to the IV solution via tubing to provide a continuous infusion of fluid. These devices can also be inserted for intermittent use if the child does not require a continuous fluid infusion. Typically, the hub of the device is capped or plugged to allow intermittent access, such as for administering medications or obtaining blood specimens. When used in this manner, these devices are termed peripheral intermittent infusion devices or saline or heparin locks. Needle size on the device also varies. Typically, the needle ranges from 21 to 25 gauge, depending on the child's size. The rule of thumb is to use the smallest-gauge catheter with the shortest length possible to prevent traumatizing the child's fragile veins. Typically, peripheral IV devices are used for short-term therapy, usually averaging 3 to 5 days (O'Grady et al., 2011). Midline catheters are also available, and the CDC recommends the use of midline catheters if therapy is to exceed 6 days (O'Grady et al., 2011). These catheters are longer than peripheral catheters and can stay in for 2 to 4 weeks (Cook, 2007; Moureau, Bagnall-Trick, Nichols, & Moureau, 2007). They are seated deep in the cephalic or basilic veins, but the tip does not extend past the axilla. Central Access Devices Numerous devices for central venous access are available. The type chosen depends on several factors, including the duration of the therapy, the child's diagnosis, the risks to the child from insertion, and the ability of the child and family to care for the device. The device may have one or multiple lumens. Although central venous access devices can be used short term, the majority are used for moderate- to long-term therapy. Central venous access devices are indicated when the child lacks suitable peripheral access, requires IV fluid or medication for more than 3 to 5 days, or is to receive specific treatments, such as the administration of highly concentrated solutions or irritating drugs that require rapid dilution (Cook, 2007; Moureau et al., 2007). Child preference is also a consideration. Central venous access is advantageous because it provides vascular access without the need for multiple IV starts, thus decreasing discomfort and fear. However, central venous access devices are associated with complications such as infection at the site, sepsis due to the direct access to the central circulation, and thrombosis due to partial occlusion of the vessel. Typically, a chest radiograph is performed after a central venous access device is inserted to verify proper placement. No fluids are administered until correct placement is confirmed. Table 13.3 describes the major types of central venous access devices. Infusion Control Devices Infants and young children are at increased risk for fluid volume overload compared with adults. Also, malfunction at the IV insertion site, such as infiltration, may result in much greater injury than a similar incident would cause in an adult. Therefore, IV fluids must be carefully administered and monitored. To ensure accurate fluid administration, infusion control devices such as infusion pumps, syringe pumps, and volume control sets may be used. Infusion pumps used for children are similar to those used for adults. Typically, the IV solution bag is attached to a calibrated volume control set that has been filled with a specified amount of IV solution ( Fig. 13.9 ). The fluid chamber holds a maximum of 100 to 150 mL of fluid that can be infused over a specified period of time as ordered. Usually, a maximum of a 2-hour infusion amount inthe chamber avoids accidental fluid overload in the pediatric population. This chamber can be filled every 1 to 2 hours so only small amounts of ordered quantities of fluid can infuse and the child is protected from receiving too much fluid volume. In addition, syringe pumps may be used to deliver fluid and medications to children. These pumps can be programmed to deliver minute amounts of fluid over controlled periods of time (see discussion on p. 388 for additional information about syringe pumps). Inserting Peripheral IV Access Devices Peripheral IV devices are used for most IV therapies. Prior to insertion, review the child's diagnosis and medical history for information that may affect therapy, such as site selection or insertion. For example, a child who has a history of chronic illness may have heightened fears and anxieties related to insertion due to his or her previous experiences or difficulty in accessing IV sites. Typically, the nondominant extremity should be used for insertion, but this may not be possible in certain situations, such as if a right- handed child has a cast on his left arm. Check the orders for the prescribed therapy. Determine the purpose and length of the IV therapy and the type of fluid or medication that is to be administered. This information aids in selecting the best device and insertion site. For example, the device needs to be of an adequate gauge to allow the solution or medication to infuse into the vein while at the same time allowing enough blood flow around the device to promote dilution of the infusion. Establish rapport with the child and parents. Inform them about IV therapy and what to expect. Be honest with the child. Explain that the venipuncture will hurt but only for a short time. Provide the child with a time frame that he or she can understand, such as the time it takes to brush his or her teeth or eat a snack.FIGURE 13.9 Volume control infusion device. A traumatic Care Use therapeutic play to assist the child in preparation and coping for the procedure (see Chapter 11 for more information). Insertion of an IV therapy device is traumatic. Follow the principles of atraumatic care, including the following: Gather all equipment needed before approaching the child. If possible, select a site using hand veins rather than wrist or upper arm veins to reduce the risk of phlebitis. Avoid using lower extremity veins and areas of joint flexion if possible because these are associated with an increased risk of thrombophlebitis and other complications (Alexander, Corrigan, Gorski, Hankins, & Perucca, 2010; Cook, 2007). Ensure adequate pain relief using pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods prior to insertion of the device (see Chapter 14 for more information about management of pain related to procedures). Allow the antiseptic used to prepare the site to dry completely before attempting insertion. Use a barrier such as gauze or a washcloth or the sleeve of the child's gown under the tourniquet to avoid pinching or damaging the skin. If the child's veins are difficult to locate, use a device to transilluminate the vein (utilizes a bright light, which illuminates the vein's size and direction of travel). Make only two attempts to gain access; if you are unsuccessful after two attempts, allow another individual two attempts to access a site. If still unsuccessful, evaluate the need for insertion of another device. Take Note! Some facilities have policies in place allowing only one stick per nurse with a maximum of two sticks; then the doctor needs to be notified unless the situation is an emergency. Encourage parental participation as appropriate in helping to position the child or to provide comfort positioning, such as therapeutic hugging. Coordinate care with other departments such as the laboratory for blood specimen collection to minimize the number of venipunctures for the child. Secure the IV line using a minimal amount of tape or transparent dressing. Protect the site from bumping by using a security device such as the IV house dressing (see Fig. 13.10 ). IV Fluid Administration Administering IV fluids to an infant or child requires close attention to the child's fluid status. Typically, the amount of fluid to be administered in a day (24 hours) is determined by the child's weight (in kilograms) using the following formula: 100 mL per kg of body weight for the first 10 kg 50 mL per kg of body weight for the next 10 kg 20 mL per kg of body weight for the remainder of body weight in kilograms Table 13.4 gives examples of calculating a child's fluid requirements using body weight. Once the 24-hour total fluid requirement is determined, this amount is divided by 24 hours to arrive at the correct hourly rate of infusion. Maintaining IV Fluid Therapy Throughout the course of therapy, monitor the fluid infusion rate and volume closely, as often as every hour. If a volume control set is used to administer the IV infusion, fill the device with the allotted amount of fluid that the child is to receive in 1 hour. Doing so prevents inadvertent administration of too much fluid. Never assume that just because an infusion pump is in use, the infusion is being administered without problems. Pumps can malfunction. The tubing can become blocked, or the IV device can move out of the vein lumen. Not enough fluid, fluid overload, or infiltration of the solution into the tissues can occur. In addition to monitoring the fluid infusion, closely monitor the child's output. Expected urine output for children and adolescents is 1.0 to 2.0 mL/kg/hour. Take Note! When measuring the output of an infant or child who is not toilet trained or who is incontinent, weigh the diaper to determine the output. Remember that 1 gram of weight is equal to 1 mL of fluid. Flushing the IV line when the device is used intermittently may be necessary to maintain patency, such as before and/or after medication is administered and after obtaining blood specimens. However, there is much debate as to how often flushing should be done and the best flush solution to use, heparin or saline (Hepzibha, 2010; Pryce, 2009; Tripathi, Kaushik, & Singh, 2008). Salinehas been found to be more compatible with the numerous solutions and medications administered intravenously, and is less expensive and less irritating to the vein. In addition, using saline lessens the incidence of pain and phlebitis. Heparin is expensive and incompatible with numerous medications and solutions, and it can affect clotting time, depending on the concentration of the flush solution used. Evidence appears to support the use of normal saline flush with catheters larger than 22 gauge, but more studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of normal saline flushes with catheters smaller than 22 gauge (Alexander et al., 2010). Additional research is also needed to determine the volume and concentration of the flush solution and interval for flushing. Always follow your agency's policy for flushing IV lines. If the child is receiving IV therapy via a central venous access device, provide site care using sterile technique and flush the device according to agency policy. Note the exit site for the device and inspect it frequently for signs of infection. If the device has multiple lumens, label each lumen with its use (i.e., blood specimen, medication, or fluid). Always check the compatibilities of solutions and medications being given simultaneously. Take Note! When flushing or administering medications through a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, follow the manufacturer's recommended syringe size, because PICC lines are fragile. Using a larger-volume syringe (i.e., 5 mL or larger) exerts less pressure on the PICC, thereby reducing the risk of complications (Bowden & Greenberg, 2008). Preventing Complications IV therapy is an invasive procedure that is associated with numerous complications. Strict aseptic technique is necessary when inserting the device and caring for the site. Adherence to standard precautions is key. Inspect the insertion site every 1 to 2 hours for inflammation or infiltration (inadvertent infusion of a nonirritant solution or medication into the surrounding tissue). Note signs of inflammation such as warmth, redness, induration, or tender skin. Check closely for signs of infiltration such as cool, blanched, or puffy skin. Use of a transparent dressing or IV house dressing provides easy access for assessing the IV insertion site. These types of dressings also help to prevent movement of the catheter hub, thus minimizing the risk of mechanical irritation, dislodgement, and complications such as phlebitis or infection (see Fig. 13.10 ). Typically in adults, an IV site is changed every 72 to 96 hours and at any time when the integrity of the system has been compromised or contamination is suspected (O'Grady et al., 2011). However, with children, the 72- to 96-hour time frame may need to be adjusted to minimize the child's exposure to the repeated trauma of insertion. Current recommendations include replacement in children only when clinically indicated (O'Grady et al., 2011). Follow the agency's policies and procedures related to site changes. Consider an alternative route for fluid and medication administration or the insertion of an alternative IV device, such as a PICC line. Catheter-related bloodstream infections often can occur with the use of central venous lines. These infections result in increased morbidity and health care costs (O'Grady et al., 2011). Prevention is paramount. Nurses need to practice proper hand hygiene, use maximal barrier protection during insertion, assess the site frequently, provide proper site care using strict sterile technique, and ensure the child's central venous catheter is removed as soon as it is no longer needed. In children it is important also to prevent the child from touching and playing with the central venous line site or dressing. Replace administration sets per agency policy.FIGURE 13.10 (A) Intravenous (IV) house over the IV site on a child's hand. (B) IV house over the site on an infant's foot. Administration sets or IV tubing should be changed at least every 96 hours (other than those used for blood, blood products, and lipids) (National Guideline Clearinghouse, 2008). Ensure proper disinfecting of all catheter hubs, needleless connectors, and injection ports prior to accessing them to minimize contamination. Take Note! Chlorhexidine-impregnated sponge (Biopatch) dressings may be used to help prevent infection in children older than 2 months of age (O'Grady et al., 2011). Always follow agency or institution policy and procedures regarding site care. Discontinuing the IV Device Prepare the child for removal of the IV device in much the same manner as for insertion. Many children may fear the removal of the device to the same extent that they feared its insertion. Explain what is to occur and enlist the child's help in the removal. A traumatic Care If appropriate, allow the child to assist in removing the tape or dressing. This gives the child a sense of control over the situation and also encourages his or her cooperation. In addition, practice atraumatic care by doing the following: Use water or adhesive remover to help loosen the tape. If a transparent dressing is in place, gently lift off the dressing by pulling up opposite corners using a motion parallel to the skin surface. Avoid using scissors to cut the tape, but if cutting the tape is necessary, be sure that the child's fingers are clear of the tape and scissors. Turn off the infusion solution and pump. Once all tape and dressings are removed, gently slide the IV device out using a motion opposite to that used for the insertion. Apply pressure to the site with a dry gauze dressing and then cover with a small adhesive bandage. If possible, allow the child to choose the bandage. Take Note! If the IV site was in the arm at or near the antecubital space, do not have the child bend his or her arm after removal of the device. Doing so increases the risk of hematoma formation (Johnson, 2007).PROVIDING NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT Adequate nutrition is important for all individuals but especially for children. During the growing years the quality of a child's nutrition affects his or her overall health and development. The presence of a chronic illness, disease, or trauma can increase the child's nutritional demands; if the child cannot meet these even with oral supplementation, other measures may be necessary to provide nutritional support. Such measures may include enteral nutrition (delivery of nutrition into the gastrointestinal tract via a tube) and par enteral nutrition (IV delivery of nutritional substances). The nutritional plan is determined by the child's age, developmental level, and health status. Enteral Nutrition Enteral nutrition, commonly called tube feedings, involves the insertion of a tube so that feedings can be delivered directly into the child's gastrointestinal tract. The tube may be inserted via the nose or mouth or through an opening in the abdominal area, with the tube ending in the stomach or small intestine. Nasogastric or orogastric through tube feedings, a tube from the nose to the stomach or from the mouth to the stomach, respectively, are commonly referred to as gavage feedings . Nasoduodenal or nasojejunal feedings involve a tube that is inserted through the nose and ends in either the duodenum or jejunum. Gastrostomy feedings involve the insertion of a gastrostomy tube through an opening in the abdominal wall and into the stomach. Jejunostomy feedings are similar to gastrostomy feedings except that the tube lies in the jejunum. Enteral nutrition is indicated for children who have a functioning gastrointestinal tract but cannot ingest enough nutrients orally. The child may be unconscious or have a severely debilitating condition that interferes with his or her ability to consume adequate food and fluids. Other conditions that may warrant the use of enteral nutrition include: Failure to thrive Inability to suck or tiring easily during sucking Abnormalities of the throat or esophagus Swallowing difficulties or risk for aspiration Respiratory distress Metabolic conditions Severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Surgery Severe trauma Enteral feedings may given ). Table 13.5 provides additional information about these types of feeding tubes. Enteral feedings costs less, are associated with fewer complications, and are considered safer than parenteral feedings. However, tube misplacement is a serious complication.FIGURE 13.11 (A) Gastrostomy tube. (B) Low-profile (button) gastrostomy tube. The filled balloon keeps the tube in place inside the stomach. Take Note! Small-diameter feeding tubes, though more comfortable, may easily become dislodged if the child coughs vigorously or vomits (Bowden & Greenberg, 2008; Florida State Hospital, 2009). Inserting a Nasogastric or Orogastric Feeding Tube Tubes for gavage feeding can be inserted via the nose or mouth. For infants, who are obligate nose breathers, insertion via the mouth may be appropriate. Oral insertion also promotes sucking in the infant. For the older child, nasal insertion is usually the preferred method. If the tube is to remain in place, the nose also is considered to be more comfortable. Nursing Procedure 13.2 gives the steps for inserting a gavage feeding tube. DETERMINING TUBING LENGTH FOR INSERTION Traditionally, morphologic methods, measuring from the nose to ear to midxiphoid to umbilicus or just nose to ear to midxiphoid, have been used to determine tube length for insertion. Recent research has shown that this way of measurement frequently underestimates the tube length (Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, 2009a). Improving the accuracy of predicting tube length will lead to an increase in successful nasogastric tube placements, and therefore improved outcomes and decreased health care costs.According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's National Guideline Clearinghouse (2009), determining tubing length for insertion of a nasogastric tube using age-related height-based methods versus the traditional morphologic, nose-ear- midxiphoid-umbilicus method is more accurate for children younger than 8 years 4 months, but not including neonates: In children between ages 2 weeks and 28 months tube insertion length is determined by 17.6 + 0.197(height in centimeters). In children between ages 28 months and 8 years 4 months tube insertion length is determined by 21.1 + 0.197 (height in centimeters) (National Guideline Clearinghouse, 2009). Continue to use traditional morphologic methods in neonates, children older than 8 years 4 months, and children with short stature, or if unable to obtain an accurate height (National Guideline Clearinghouse, 2009). NURSING PROCEDURE 13.2 Inserting a Gavage Feeding Tube Purpose: To provide a means for delivering nutrition to the child's functioning gastrointestinal tract 1. Verify the order for gavage feeding. 2. Explain the procedure to the child and parents using appropriate language geared to the child's development level. 3. Gather the necessary equipment; remove formula for feeding from refrigerator if appropriate and allow it to come to room temperature. 4. Wash hands and put on gloves. 5. Inspect the child's nose and mouth for deformities that may interfere with passage of the tube. 6. Position the infant supine with the head slightly elevated and with the neck slightly hyperextended so that the nose is pointedupward. If necessary, place a rolled towel or blanket under the neck to help in maintaining this position. Assist the older child to a sitting position if appropriate. Alternatively, have the parent or another person hold the child to promote comfort and reassurance. Enlist the aid of additional persons, such as a parent or other health care team member, to assist in maintaining the child's position. 7. Determine the tubing length for insertion: measure from the tip of the nose to the earlobe to the middle of the area between the xiphoid process and umbilicus. Also refer to p. 395 . Mark this measurement on the tube with an indelible pen or with a piece of tape. 8. Lubricate the tube with a generous amount of sterile water (many small-bore feeding tubes have a water-activated lubricant) or water-soluble lubricant to promote passage of the tube and minimize trauma to the child's mucosa. 9. Insert the tube into one of the nares or the mouth. Direct a nasally inserted tube straight back toward the occiput; direct an orally inserted tube toward the back of the throat. 10. Advance the tube slowly to the designated length; encourage the child (if capable) to swallow frequently to assist with advancing the tube. 11. Watch for signs of distress, such as gasping, coughing, or cyanosis, indicating that the tube is in the airway. If these signs develop, withdraw the tube and allow the child to rest before attempting reinsertion. 12. Temporarily secure tube, remove stylet if applicable, and check for proper placement of the tube. Refer to Box 13.4. 13. Document the type of tube inserted; length of tubing inserted; measurement of external tubing length, from nares to end of tube, after insertion; and confirmation of placement.Adapted from Bowden, V. R., & Greenberg, C. S. (2008). Pediatric nursing procedures. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. CHECKING TUBE PLACEMENT Once the gavage feeding tube is inserted, checking for placement is essential. Tube placement must be confirmed each time the tube is inserted and before each use. Radiologic confirmation of tube placement is considered the most accurate method, but the risks associated with repeated radiation exposure, high costs, and the impractical nature of obtaining a radiograph before feeding tube use make it unrealistic. Several methods have been proposed as reliable for checking tube placement, but no single method has been shown to be consistently accurate for continually assessing tube placement. Take Note! Instilling air into the tube and then auscultating for the sound is no longer considered a viable method for checking tube placement. Air instilled into a tube that is positioned above the gastroesophageal sphincter can still be auscultated as air in the stomach, thereby giving a false-positive result. Gastric auscultation alone results in a 60% to 80% reliability. When using both aspirate and nonaspirate verification methods (refer to Box 13.4 ), accuracy increases to 97% to 99% (National Guideline Clearinghouse, 2009). Research has suggested using measurements of bilirubin, trypsin, and pepsin levels and CO 2 monitoring to enhance assessment of tube placement, but no methods are available for bedside testing of these levels. Refer to Box 13.4 for methods to verify feeding tube placement. However, keep in mind that even with these methods, tube malpositioning can occur. Therefore, nurses need to be vigilant in checking for tube placement using the recommended methods and be cautious and proactive if there is any suspicion that the tube may be misplaced. Take Note! If bedside methods are conflicting or the child is high risk, such as children with swallowing problems, children with altered levels of consciousness, or children in the intensive care unit, radiologic verification is recommended (National Guideline Clearinghouse, 2009). If the gavage feeding tube is to remain in place, secure it to the child's cheek. Do not tape the tube to the child's forehead, because this could lead to irritation and pressure on, and possible breakdown of, the nasal mucosa. Also measure the length of the tube extending from the nose or mouth to the end and record this information. Double-check this measurement before administering each intermittent tube feeding to verify that the feeding tube is in the proper position. Once the position of the gavage feeding tube is confirmed, the feeding solution or medication can be administered. Remember Lily, the 9-month-old infant diagnosed with failure to thrive who is to receive gavage feedings with a nasogastric tube? What equipment will be needed, and what steps will you take to complete the procedure?Administering Enteral Feedings Enteral feedings can be given continuously or intermittently, regardless of the type of tube used. Intermittent feedings are commonly called bolus feedings . With a bolus feeding, a specified amount of feeding solution is given at specific intervals, usually over a short period of time such as 15 to 30 minutes. Given via a syringe, feeding bag, or infusion pump, bolus feedings most closely resemble regular meals. Continuous feedings are given at a slower rate over a longer period of time. In some cases, the feeding may be given during the night so that the child can be free to move about and participate in activities during the day. For continuous feedings, an enteral feeding pump is used to administer the solution at a prescribed rate. Checking for tube placement is a priority before administering any intermittent tube feeding and periodically during continuous tube feedings, regardless of the type of tube being used. (Refer to Box 13.4. ) For gastrostomy and jejunostomy tubes, ensure that the calibration, if present, has not changed. Measure the length of the tube daily from the exit site on the stomach to the end of the tube. Assess the abdomen for distension and bowel sounds (Springhouse, 2007). Also, measure the gastric residual (the amount remaining in the stomach; indicates gastric emptying time) by aspirating the gastric contents with a syringe, measuring it, and then replacing the contents. Check the residuals periodically, according to the facility's policy, such as every 4 to 6 hours, and before each intermittent feeding. If the residual volume exceeds the amount specified by the physician's order, hold the feeding and notify the physician or nurse practitioner. Begin the feeding by placing the child in a supine position with the head and shoulders elevated approximately 30 degrees so that the feeding will remain in the stomach area (Springhouse, 2007). Flush the tube with a small amount of water to clear it and prevent occlusion. This is not necessary for a gavage feeding if the tube is being inserted each time a feeding is given. Ensure that the feeding solution is at room temperature. Administer the feeding per the facility's policy. Feeding solutions may be placed into the barrel of a syringe or into a feeding bag attached to the feeding tube and allowed to flow by gravity. The rate of flow for gravity-assisted feedings can be increased or decreased by raising or lowering the feeding solution container, respectively. Typically, intermittent feedings last from 15 to 30 minutes. A feeding bag also may be attached to a pump to control the rate of flow. Monitor the child's tolerance to the feeding. BOX 13.4 METHODS FOR VERIFICATION OF FEEDING TUBE PLACEMENT Obtain radiographic confirmation of proper tube placement after initial placement. After initial confirmation, document pH of aspirate; document insertion distance and external length of tube in the chart. Mark and document the tube's exit site from the nose or mouth. Use bedside techniques at regular intervals to determine proper tube positioning. Measuring pH Gastric secretions have a pH less than 5. Small intestine secretions will usually have a pH greater than 6, but this does not reliably predict proper tube placement. A pH greater than 6 can occur with respiratory or esophageal placement, with proper tube placement (gastric or intestinal) when feedings are given continuously, or if the child is receiving acid-inhibiting medications. Therefore, if the pH is greater than 5, additional assessment is warranted. Observing appearance of fluid aspirated from tube Gastric secretions are usually grassy green or clear and colorless and can have off-white or tan mucous shreds. It may also be brown tinged if blood is present. Intestinal secretions are often bile stained, light golden yellow to brownish green. They tend to be thicker and more translucent than gastric secretions. Respiratory secretions can be white, yellow, straw colored, or clear. Instill air into the tube and then auscultate for the sound (gastric auscultation). Check external markings on tube and external tube length (tube remaining from nares to end of tube) to determine if the tube seems to have migrated or been misplaced. Continually assess for signs indicative of feeding tube misplacement, such as unexplained gagging, vomiting, or coughing; signs and symptoms of respiratory distress; and decreased oxygen saturations. If bedside techniques reveal conflicting results or the child is high risk, radiologic confirmation is recommended. Review routine chest and abdominal radiographs (if obtained) to double-check correct tube position. Always follow agencies' policy and procedures.

As the water leaves the syringe or tubing, clamp the tube to prevent air from entering the stomach. Then disconnect the syringe or tube- feeding bag from the tube. Take Note! If the child vomits during the feeding, stop the feeding immediately and turn the child onto his or her side or sit him or her up. If the child has a gastrostomy button, open the cap and connect an adaptor or insert extension tubing through the one-way valve. This allows access to the gastric conduit. The feeding solution container is connected to the extension tubing or adaptor and the feeding is given as described previously. After the feeding is completed, the extension tubing or adaptor is flushed with water and the flip-top opening is closed. Burp the infant during and after any type of tube feeding in the same manner as for an infant who is bottle- or breast-fed. Also, position the child on his or her right side with the head slightly elevated, approximately 30 degrees, for about 1 hour after the feeding to facilitate gastric emptying and reduce the risk of aspiration and regurgitation. Some children have a difficult time with gas and burping on their own after tube placement. Venting, which helps relieve gas, may be ordered by the physician or nurse practitioner. It removes excess air and can be helpful if the child is bloated or the abdomen is distended. Use a catheter-tip syringe with the plunger removed and attach to the end of the tube. Hold the syringe above the child's stomach for a few minutes. Once the air or gas is removed, allow any stomach contents or formula to flow back into the stomach. Weigh the child daily throughout enteral nutrition therapy to determine the effectiveness of the therapy. Providing Skin and Insertion Site Care Skin around the gastrostomy or jejunostomy insertion site may become irritated from movement of the tube, moisture, leakage of stomach or intestinal contents, or the adhesive device holding the tube in place. Keeping the skin clean and dry is important and will help prevent most of these problems. The skin around a gastrostomy or jejunostomy tube requires cleaning at least once a day. Routine site care includes gentle cleansing with sterile water or saline for newly placed tubes, or for established tubes, soap and water followed by rinsing or cleaning with water alone. To clean under an external disc or bumper, a cottontipped applicator may be used. Diluted hydrogen peroxide may be necessary to clean crusted drainage off the skin, tube, or disc (Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, 2008). During insertion site care, rotate the gastrostomy tube or button a quarter-turn to prevent skin adherence and irritation. Always follow agency or institution policies and procedures. Take Note! Do not rotate a jejunal tube because it can cause kinking (Bowden & Greenberg, 2008). Assess the insertion site and condition of the surrounding skin for signs and symptoms of infection, such as erythema, induration, foul drainage, or pain. A small amount of clear or tan drainage is normal. If any drainage is present, a dressing can be placed. Use a presplit 2 X 2 gauze and place it loosely around the site. Change this dressing when it is soiled. If no drainage is present, do not place a dressing as it can cause undue pressure and trap moisture, leading to skin irritation. Preventing movement of the tube also helps reduce skin irritation. Check the volume of the balloon with a balloon-tipped device about once or twice a week and reinflate the balloon to the initial volume if needed. The tube should be able to move slightly in and out of the child's stomach. The plastic disc should be snug against the skin but not tight enough to cause pressure. Tube stabilization methods help prevent the tube from moving around and sliding further into the stomach or jejunum. Stabilize the tube by pulling gently on the tubing and sliding the stabilizer bar or disc snugly against the abdomen. Take Note! Rotate sites where the tube is secured to the abdomen to prevent tension on the stoma or skin breakdown. Measure and record the length of the tube from the exit site of the abdominal wall to the end of the tube. All future measurements should be the same unless the tube length is changed. For tubes without a stabilizer bar or disc or for additional stabilization needs,several other methods may be used, including cut baby bottle nipples, taping methods, and commercially available stabilizers (see Fig. 13.12 ). It is always important to follow agency policy. Take Note! When using the nipple method, make sure to cut several holes in the base of the nipple to allow air circulation and site assessment. Promoting Growth and Development Some children receive all of their nutritional needs through tube feedings, whereas other children use tube feedings as a supplement to eating by mouth. Feeding time is a special time for infants and children. Occasionally, babies who are fed solely through an enteral feeding tube may forget or lose the desire to eat by mouth. Use a pacifier to help avoid this, allowing the infant to associate the nipple in his or her mouth with a feeding (Sexton & Natale, 2009). The sucking motion will also exercise the jaw and promote the flow of the feedings. The saliva produced during sucking aids in digestion. Combined with holding the infant and cuddling, rocking, and talking to him or her, this promotes a more normal feeding time. Talking with children, playing music, or reading a story promotes an active feeding time. At home, encourage parents to include the feeding as a part of regular family mealtime together to provide socialization for the child. Allow the child to participate in the feedings by gathering supplies and administering the actual feeding so that the child may experience independence and adaptation. If the child also eats food by mouth, feed him or her by mouth first and then administer the tube feeding. During tube feedings in bed, make sure the head of the bed is elevated at least 30 degrees to help prevent vomiting and aspiration (Springhouse, 2007). Children with feeding tubes should be allowed as normal a routine as possible. For example, they can crawl, walk, and jump just like children of the same age and developmental level. However, in some cases, contact sports such as football, hockey, and wrestling should be avoided because of the higher risk of injury. Securing the tubing under the child's clothing will prevent it from becoming accidentally dislodged and prevent the child from pulling and playing with it. Using one-piece outfits, an Ace wrap, or stretchy gauze to cover the tube can help protect it. Educating the Child and Family Educate children receiving enteral feedings and their parents thoroughly about this method of nutritional support. Reinforce the reason for the therapy and provide the child and parents with opportunities to verbalize their concerns and ask questions. Ensure that the parents understand the risks and benefits of the therapy and the expected duration. Provide the child, if developmentally appropriate, and parents with opportunities to participate in the feeding sessions. This helps allay some of their fears and anxieties and promotes a sense of control over the situation. They will also gain valuable practice in learning the skill should the feedings be required at home. Teaching Guidelines 13.3 identifies important topics to include in the teaching plan for a child receiving enteral nutrition at home. Troubleshooting problems at home is an important topic to cover. Refer to Teaching Guidelines 13.4. Education also involves helping the family develop appropriate coping strategies to adapt, solve problems, and access the support and services they will need after discharge.FIGURE 13.12 Methods to stabilize a gastrostomy tube include ( A ) the nipple method, ( B ) taping methods, ( C ) the tension loop method, and ( D ) commercially available stabilizing devices (GripLok\u00ae pictured here).

Amount and size of syringe will vary based on child's size and facility policy. Repeat if necessary. Instruct caregivers to never use an object or put anything into the tube. They should call the doctor or nurse if they are unable to unclog the tube. Declogging medications may be prescribed. If a tube is inadvertently removed, instruct the care-giver to cover the site with a small clean dressing tape, then to call the physician or nurse immediately; the tube needs to be replaced as soon as possible or the tract will close. Some institutions may instruct the family on how to replace the tube once the tube is more than 6 weeks old and has formed an established G-tube tract. If the site is red or irritated, instruct caregivers to continue with routine cleaning and call the physician. An antibiotic or skin barrier cream may be ordered. Assess for leakage and try to minimize if possible. Ensure tube is stabilized and secure and not dangling. If the tube is leaking, the caregiver needs to keep the dressing clean and dry. More frequent venting may help and the physician should be notified. Always teach following the instructions per agency policy and procedure regarding home care. Adapted from Bowden, V.

She is to be discharged home after having a gastrostomy tube inserted to continue feedings at home. What teaching is needed for her family prior to discharge? Parenteral Nutrition Nutritional support can be administered IV through a peripheral or central venous catheter. The concentration and components of the solution determine the type of parenteral nutrition. Parenteral nutrition given via a central venous access device is termed total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Comparison Chart 13.1 gives information about peripheral and central parenteral nutrition. Administering TPN Typically, the physician or nurse practitioner determines the concentration and components of the TPN solution based on a thorough assessment of the child's status, including the results of laboratory testing. This information is used as a baseline for evaluating the effectiveness of therapy. The solution is prepared under sterile conditions in the pharmacy. For TPN, a central venous access device is inserted and secured, if one is not already in place. Use specialized tubing with an inline filter (to prevent small microparticles from entering the circulation). TPN solutions may be refrigerated until they are to be used. Once started, a single solution of TPN should hang for no longer than 24 hours (Springhouse, 2007). The infusion of the solution is initiated at a slow rate that is gradually increased as ordered based on how the child tolerates the therapy. TPN solutions are highly concentrated glucose solutions that can cause hyperglycemia if given too rapidly. Use of an infusion pump is essential to control the rate of infusion. Fat emulsions are administered periodically to meet the child's need for essential fatty acids. These solutions are given as a piggyback solution into the TPN line, but below the inline filter. Throughout TPN therapy, be vigilant in monitoring the infusion rate, and report any changes in the infusion rate to the physician or nurse practitioner immediately. Adjustments may be made to the rate, but only as ordered by the physician or nurse practitioner. The infusion rate should never be adjusted more than 10% higher or lower than the current rate (Weinstein, 2006). Initially, check blood glucose levels frequently, such as every 4 to 6 hours, to evaluate for hyperglycemia. These levels can be obtained with a bedside glucose meter. Minimize the trauma and discomfort associated with frequent invasive procedures by using the principles of atraumatic care. If blood glucose levels are elevated, subcutaneous administration of insulin may be needed. Once thechild's glucose levels stabilize, the frequency of blood glucose level determinations decreases, such as every 8 to 12 hours, based on the facility's policy. COMPARISON CHART 13.1 PERIPHERAL PARENTERAL NUTRITION VERSUS TOTAL PARENTERAL NUTRITION Take Note! If for any reason the TPN infusion is interrupted or stops, be prepared to begin an infusion of a 5% to 10% dextrose solution at the same infusion rate as the TPN (Bowden & Greenberg, 2008). This helps to prevent rebound hypoglycemia that may occur due to the increased insulin secretion by the child's body in response to the use of the highly concentrated TPN solution. Perform catheter site care, tubing and filter changes, and dressing changes according to the facility's policy. Inspect the insertion site closely for signs of infection. Also monitor the child's vital signs, daily weights, and intake and output closely for changes. In addition, review laboratory test results, which can aid in early detection of problems, such as infection or electrolyte excesses or deficits. TPN can be administered continuously over a 24-hour period, or after initiation it may be given on a cyclic basis, such as over a 12-hour period during the night. When administering cycled TPN, the solution is infused at half the prescribed rate for the first and last hour to prevent hyper- and hypoglycemia. Preventing Complications Nurses play a key role in minimizing the risk for complications related to use of central venous access devices and TPN. Box 13.5 describes these complications. Key measures to reduce the risk of complications include the following: Monitor the child's vital signs closely for changes. Adhere to strict aseptic technique when caring for the catheter and administering TPN. Ensure that the system remains a closed system at all times. Secure all connections and clamp the catheter or have the child perform the Valsalva maneuver during tubing and cap changes. Use occlusive dressings. Chlorhexidine-impregnated sponge (Biopatch) dressings may be used to help prevent infection. Always follow agency or institution policy and procedures. Adhere to agency policy for flushing of the catheter and maintaining catheter patency. Assess intake and output frequently. Monitor blood glucose levels and obtain laboratory tests as ordered to evaluate for changes in fluid and electrolytes. Take Note! Never administer any medication, blood, or other solution through the TPN lumen. Doing so increases the risk for contamination of the system and subsequent infection (Springhouse, 2007).BOX 13.5 COMPLICATIONS THAT CAN OCCUR WITH CENTRAL VENOUS ACCESS DEVICES AND TOTAL PARENTERAL NUTRITION (TPN) Air embolism from inadvertent entry of air into the system during tubing or cap changes or accidental disconnection Cardiac tamponade due to catheter advancement with movement of the arm, neck, or shoulder Catheter occlusion from the development of a fibrin sheath or thrombus at the catheter tip, malpositioning or kinking, or the deposition of precipitates or a blood clot Venous thrombosis from injury to the vessel wall during insertion or movement of the catheter after insertion or from chemical irritation due to administration of concentrated solutions, vesicants, and other medications through the catheter Hyperglycemia, typically with too rapid an infusion of TPN Hypoglycemia, which may occur with rapid cessation Dehydration as the child's body attempts to rid itself of excess glucose through renal excretion Electrolyte imbalance (particularly potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus) Infection at the skin insertion site, along the catheter pathway, or in the bloodstream. Organisms can arise from the skin, hands of caregivers, or other areas such as wound drainage, droplets from the lungs, or urine. For example, connection sites can be contaminated during tubing or dressing changes. Promoting Growth and Development Meals are a time for meeting nutritional needs as well as a time for love, comfort, support, and socialization. TPN meets the child's nutritional needs, but the child's need for love and support also must be met. Implement measures similar to those for children receiving enteral nutrition (see discussion earlier in this chapter). Also provide opportunities for holding and cuddling the child. Allow the older child to participate in activities that can help to occupy the time associated with meals. Encourage the child and parents to participate in the care to promote a sense of independence as well as a sense of control over the situation. Educating the Child and Family Children who require long-term TPN therapy may receive TPN in the home. Administering TPN at home requires thorough education of the child and parents. This teaching can occur in the health care agency or in the child's home. The amount of information to be taught can be overwhelming, so ensure that ample time is available. Allow time for questions and concerns. Offer emotional support and guidance whenever necessary. Provide written and verbal instructions about the care involved. Have the child (if appropriate) and parents demonstrate the care needed, including care of the central venous access device. Review with them the measures for obtaining, storing, and handling the solutions and supplies. Develop plans for troubleshooting problems with devices and equipment, and give instructions on how to recognize and treat complications. Also teach them about danger signs and symptoms that require immediate notification. Be sure they have the name and number of a contact person in case of emergency situations. Initiate the appropriate referrals for support. Specialized home care infusion services are available for follow-up in the home. In addition, social services can be helpful in providing assistance with finances, health insurance reimbursement, scheduling, transportation, emotional support, and community resources. KEY CONCEPTS The \"eight rights\" of pediatric medication administration are the right drug, right dose, right route, right time, right patient, right documentation, right to be educated, and right to refuse. The physiologic immaturity of some body systems in children can affect a drug's pharmacodynamics, leading to differences in the body's response to the drug and thus enhancing or diminishing the drug's effects. The child's age, weight, body surface area, and body composition can affect the drug's phar-macokinetics. The two most common methods for determining pediatric drug doses involve the use of the child's body weight and body surface area. Children younger than the age of 5 to 6 are at risk for aspiration when receiving tablets or capsules because they have difficulty swallowing them; liquids may be more appropriate. When administering oral medications to children, always tell them whether a medication is being mixed with food. Medication administration via the rectal route is not preferred because the drug's absorption may be erratic and unpredictable andchildren find this route extremely upsetting or embarrassing. When administering otic medications, pull the pinna downward and back if the child is younger than age 3, and up and back for older children. Intramuscular administration is used infrequently in children because it is painful and children often lack the adequate muscle mass. When used with infants, the preferred site is the vastus lateralis muscle. Administration of medication via the IV route is common with children, especially when a rapid response to the drug is desired or when absorption via other routes is difficult or impossible. The primary method for IV medication administration is via a syringe pump. Preferred sites for peripheral IV therapy include the veins of the hands, feet, and forearms. The scalp vein may be used in infants but only if attempts at other sites have been unsuccessful. The rule of thumb for insertion of any peripheral devices is to use the smallest-gauge catheter for the shortest length of time possible to prevent trauma to the child's fragile veins. Central venous therapy usually is administered through a large vein, such as the subclavian, femoral, or jugular vein or vena cava. The tip of the device lies in the superior vena cava just at the entrance to the right atrium. Devices include single-or multiple-lumen short- and long-term catheters, peripherally inserted central catheters, tunneled catheters, and vascular access ports. Monitoring intake and output is important when a child is receiving IV therapy. Site inspection, proper care of the site, and proper dressing changes are key to preventing complications. Nutritional support can be administered enterally via a nasogastric or orogastric tube (gavage feeding) or via a gastrostomy or jejunostomy device or administered parenterally through a peripheral or central venous access device. Enteral nutrition is indicated for children who have a functioning gastrointestinal tract but cannot consume adequate amounts of nutrients orally. Prior to any enteral feeding, placement of the feeding tube must be confirmed. The gold standard for confirming placement is with a radiograph. At the bedside, checking the color and pH of the aspirate is used to confirm placement. Children receiving TPN require close monitoring of the infusion rate and volume, intake and output, vital signs, and blood glucose levels. Strict aseptic technique is necessary when caring for the central venous access site and TPN infusion. REFERENCES Alexander, M., Corrigan, A., Gorski, L., Hankins J., & Perucca, R. (Eds.). (2010).

Aiden Russell is a 6-year-old on the pediatric unit admitted for a wound infection. He requires BID dressing changes. In report you are told that Aiden cries and fights during the dressing change but otherwise seems to be playing and not experiencing much pain. The nurse reporting off duty states, \"Aiden's mother keeps requesting pain medication for Aiden. She states he's complaining of pain most of the time. I'm not sure if I believe her: when I see Aiden, he's playing Nintendo games or watching television and seems to be fine. I've tried to hold off on his pain medication as long as I can.\" Pain is a highly individualized, subjective experience that can affect any person of any age. It is a complex phenomenon that involves multiple components and is influenced by myriad factors. Pain is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience that is associated with actual or potential tissue damage\" (International Association for the Study of Pain, 2007). Another definition of pain that is commonly used defines pain as whatever the person says it is, existing whenever the person says it does\u2014that is, pain is present when the person says that it is (Ferrell, 2005; McCaffery, 1968; McCaffery & Pasero, 2011). The person experiencing the pain is the only one who can identify pain and know what the pain is like. Pain is a universal experience. Pain affects adults and children of all ages, even preterm infants. Pain can result from numerous causes, including disease processes, injuries, procedures, and surgical interventions. In 1995 the American Pain Society (1995) labeled it \"the fifth vital sign.\" The American Pain Society's goal was to encourage health care professionals to assess pain every time that temperature, pulse, respirations, and blood pressure are assessed and to institute measures to manage the pain. Unlike adults, however, children may lack the verbal capacity to describe their pain accurately. In addition, many caregivers and health care providers have misconceptions about pain in children, it is difficult to assess the complex nature of the pain experience, and limited resources and research are available related to pain relief strategies for children. Therefore, pain is a major source of distress for children and their families as well as for health care providers. If left unmanaged, pain in children can lead to serious physical and emotional consequences, such as increased oxygen consumption and alterations in blood glucose metabolism. In addition, the experience of untreated pain early in life may lead to long- term physiologic and psychological consequences for the child (Bowden & Greenberg, 2008). For example, inadequately controlled pain can have long-lasting negative outcomes such as increased distress during later procedures, nonadherence to treatment regimens, inactivity, prolonged bed rest, and the development of chronic pain. Detrimental effects on the course of the disease itself may also be seen with untreated pain. Preterm infants, due to long hospitalizations and numerous painful and invasive procedures, are often at greater risk for experiencing memories of pain (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2010). All these factors make pain management a critical element in the plan of care for children. Treating pain reduces anxiety during procedures and decreases the need for physical restraints, reduces anxiety regarding subsequent procedures, and prevents short- and long-term consequences of inadequately treated pain, particularly in newborns (Cohen & Baxter, 2008; Kennedy, Luhmann, & Zempsky, 2008). Pain management in children has improved, but underestimation and inadequate management still remain a problem (Bowden & Greenberg, 2008). Various national health associations have issued position papers and guidelines related to the need to treat pain and suffering in children. Effective pain management involves initial pain assessment, therapeutic interventions, and reassessment for all children in any health care setting. This chapter describes the pain experience in children, including the types of pain, factors influencing pain, and common fallacies and myths associated with pain in children. The nursing process is applied to provide an overview of the care for a child in pain. Various pain management strategies are described, including nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions and measures to address procedure-related and chronic pain.PHYSIOLOGY OF PAIN The sensation of pain is a complex phenomenon that involves a sequence of physiologic events in the nervous system. These events are transduction, transmission, perception, and modulation. Transduction Peripheral nerve fibers extend from the spinal cord to various locations in and throughout the body's tissues, such as skin, joints, bones, and membranes covering the internal organs. At the end of these fibers are specialized receptors, called nociceptors, which become activated when they are exposed to noxious stimuli. The noxious stimuli can be mechanical, chemical, or thermal. Mechanical stimuli may include intense pressure to an area, a strong muscular contraction, or extensive pressure due to muscular overstretching. Chemical stimulation may involve the release of mediators, such as histamine, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, or bradykinin, as a response to tissue trauma, ischemia, or inflammation. Thermal stimuli typically involve extremes of heat and cold. This process of nociceptor activation is called transduction. Transmission When nociceptors are activated by noxious stimuli, the stimuli are converted to electrical impulses that are relayed along the peripheral nerves to the spinal cord and brain. Specialized afferent nerve fibers are responsible for moving the electrical impulse along. Myelinated A-delta fibers are large fibers that conduct the impulse at very rapid rates. The pain transmitted by these fibers is often referred to as fast pain, most commonly associated with mechanical or thermal stimuli (Porth & Matfin, 2009). Pain also is transmitted by unmyelinated small C fibers. These fibers transmit the impulse slowly and are often activated by chemical stimuli or continued mechanical or thermal stimuli (Porth & Matfin, 2009). These fibers carry the impulse to the spinal cord via the dorsal horn. Neurotransmitters are released to facilitate the transmission process to the brain. Several theories have been proposed in an attempt to explain the process of pain transmission. The best known of these is the gate-control theory. According to this theory, the dorsal horn of the spinal cord contains interneuronal or interconnecting fibers. Large-diameter faster fibers carry nonnociceptive, tactile information, while small nerve fibers carry nociceptive or pain signals. Large fibers, when stimulated, close the gate or pathway to the brain, thereby inhibiting or blocking the transmission of the pain impulse. Subsequently, the impulse does not reach the brain, where it would be interpreted as pain. This theory helps explain why some nonphar-macologic therapies, such as massage and pressure, are effective in reducing pain (Porth & Matfin, 2009). Perception Once in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, the nerve fibers divide and then cross to the opposite side and rise upward to the thalamus. The thalamus responds quickly and sends a message to the somatosensory cortex of the brain, where the impulse is interpreted as the physical sensation of pain. The impulses carried by the fast A-delta fibers lead to the perception of sharp, stabbing localized pain that also commonly involves a reflex response to withdraw from the stimulus. The impulses carried by the slow C fibers lead to the perception of diffuse, dull, burning or aching pain. The point at which the person first feels the lowest intensity of the painful stimulus is termed the pain threshold. In addition to sending a message to the cerebral cortex, the thalamus also sends a message to the limbic system, where the sensation is interpreted emotionally, and to the brain stem centers, where autonomic nervous system responses begin. Modulation Research has identified substances called neuromodulators that appear to modify the pain sensation. These substances have been found to change a person's perception of pain. Examples of these neuromodulators include serotonin, endorphins, enkephalins, and dynorphins. Pain perception can be modified peripherally or centrally. In the peripheral nerve fibers, chemical substances are released that either stimulate the nerve fibers or sensitize them. Peripheral sensitization allows the nerve fibers to react to a stimulus that is of lower intensity than would be needed to cause pain. As a result, the person perceives more pain. Actions that block or inhibit the release of these substances can lead to a decrease in pain perception.FIGURE 14.1 Physiology of pain. (7) Exposure to thermal noxious stimuli results in activation of nociception (transduction). (2) Impulses are relayed along the peripheral nerves to the spinal cord through the dorsal horn (transmission). (3, 4) This results in the individual feeling the sensation of pain (perception). (5) Neurons in the brain stem send signals back down to the dorsal horn, and these fibers release substances such as endorphins, which can inhibit painful impulses in the dorsal horn (modulation). These neurotransmitters are taken back by the body, therefore limiting the analgesic value. Modification of pain perception can occur centrally in the spinal cord at the dorsal horn. Substances released by the excited interneurons can potentiate the pain sensation. Other neurochemicals, through their binding to specific receptors, can inhibit the perception of pain. Figure 14.1 illustrates the physiology of pain.TYPES OF PAIN Many different systems can be used to classify pain. Most commonly, pain is classified based on its duration, etiology, or source or location. Classification by Duration Pain is classified by duration as acute or chronic. Acute Pain Acute pain is defined as pain that is associated with a rapid onset of varying intensity. It usually indicates tissue damage and resolves with healing of the injury. Acute pain reflects stimulation of nociceptors and serves a protective function (i.e., alerting the person to a problem). Examples of causes of acute pain include trauma, invasive procedures, acute illnesses such as sore throat or appendicitis, and surgery. This type of pain generally lasts a few days. Take Note! Children often experience pain associated with various procedures done in health care settings. This type of pain is usually short in duration. Preparation of the child and family will help to decrease fears or anxiety. Depending on the type of procedure and the child's age, cognitive level, and temperament, various techniques and methods can be used. Advocating for atraumatic care and adhering to its guidelines will help to minimize procedure-related pain. Chronic Pain Chronic pain is defined as pain that continues past the expected point of healing for injured tissue. It provides no protective function. It may be continuous or intermittent, with and without periods of exacerbation or remission. It often interferes with sleep and performance of activities of daily living. It can result in loss of appetite and depression. Thus, chronic pain impairs a person's ability to function. In contrast to acute pain, environmental and psychological factors influence behaviors associated with chronic pain. In children, chronic, recurrent pain is most commonly associated with abdominal pain, nonspecific headache, limb pain, or chest pain. Some conditions, such as sickle cell disease and migraines, have characteristics of both acute and chronic pain (Porth & Matfin, 2009). Children with chronic pain may not exhibit the same physical or emotional responses as seen with acute pain. As pain becomes prolonged and continuous, the autonomic nervous system response tends to diminish. Classification by Etiology Pain can be classified by etiology as nociceptive or neuropathic. Nociceptive Pain Nociceptive pain reflects pain due to noxious stimuli that damages normal tissues or has the potential to do so if the pain is prolonged. The pain perceived often correlates closely with the degree or intensity of the stimulus and the extent of real or possible tissue damage. With nociceptive pain, nervous system functioning is intact. Reports of nociceptive pain vary depending on the location of the nociceptors being stimulated. Nociceptive pain ranges from sharp or burning, to dull, aching, or cramping, and to deep aching or sharp stabbing. Examples of conditions that result in nociceptive pain include chemical burns, sunburn, cuts, appendicitis, and bladder distention. Neuropathic Pain Neuropathic pain is pain due to malfunctioning of the peripheral or central nervous system. It may be continuous or intermittent and is commonly described as burning, tingling, shooting, squeezing, or spasm-like pain. Examples of neuropathic pain include posttraumatic and postsurgical peripheral nerve injuries, pain after spinal cord injury, metabolic neuropathies, phantom limb pain after amputation, and poststroke pain. Classification by Source or Location Pain also may be classified by the source or location of the area involved. It can be somatic pain (superficial and deep) or visceral pain. These classifications typically indicate nociceptive pain.Somatic Pain Somatic pain refers to pain that develops in the tissues. It can be further divided into two groups\u2014superficial and deep. Superficial somatic pain, often called cutaneous pain, involves stimulation of nociceptors in the skin, subcutaneous tissue, or mucous membranes. Typically the pain is well localized and described as a sharp, pricking, or burning sensation. Superficial somatic pain may be due to external mechanical, chemical, or thermal injury or skin disorders. Tenderness commonly is present. Deep somatic pain typically involves the muscles, tendons, joints, fasciae, and bones. It can be localized or diffuse and is usually described as dull, aching, or cramping. Deep somatic pain may be due to strain from overuse or direct injury, ischemia, and inflammation. Tenderness and reflex spasm may be present. Additionally, the person may exhibit sympathetic nervous system activation such as tachycardia, hypertension, tachypnea, diaphoresis, pallor, and pupillary dilation. Visceral Pain Visceral pain is pain that develops within organs such as the heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, liver, gallbladder, kidneys, or bladder. It is often produced by disease. It usually is diffuse and poorly localized and is described as a deep ache or sharp stabbing sensation that may be referred to other areas. Visceral pain may be due to distention of the organ, organ muscular spasm, contraction, pulling, ischemia, or inflammation. Tenderness, nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis may be present.FACTORS INFLUENCING PAIN Children, like adults, experience neurologic events that result in the perception of pain. However, research has found that environmental and psychological factors may exert a greater influence on the child's perception of pain (McGrath & Hillier, 2003). Certain factors such as age, gender, cognitive level, temperament, previous pain experiences, and family and cultural background cannot be changed. However, situational factors involving behavioral, cognitive, and emotional aspects can be modified. These situation-specific factors that affect the child's pain experience include \"what the child and parents understand, what they and the health care staff do and how the child and parents feel. Certain situational factors can intensify pain and distress, whereas others can eventually trigger pain episodes, prolong pain-related disability or maintain the repeated pain episodes in recurrent pain syndrome\" (McGrath, 2005, p. 437 ). Age and Gender Research has demonstrated that the nervous system structures needed for pain impulse transmission and perception are present by the 23rd week of gestation (Blount, Piira, Cohen, & Cheng, 2006). Therefore, children of any age, including preterm newborns, are capable of experiencing pain (Finley, Franck, Grunau, & von Baeyer, 2005). Early on, children can interpret pain as an unpleasant sensation, but this interpretation is based on their comparison with other sensations. As they get older, they learn to use words to describe their pain more fully. Gender and sex also may play a role in a child's perception of pain, but research has failed to yield concrete evidence supporting it (Hurley & Adams, 2008). It has been suggested that boys and girls differ in how they perceive and cope with pain and respond to analgesics. This may be influenced by various factors including genetics, hormones, family, and culture. Further research is warranted in this area to allow for more focused care in pain management. Cognitive Level Cognitive level is a key factor affecting a child's pain perception and response and usually goes hand in hand with the child's age. Cognitive level typically increases with age, thereby influencing the child's understanding of the pain and its impact and his or her choices for coping strategies. In addition, as the child's cognitive level increases, his or her ability to communicate information about pain increases. However, this increased understanding and ability to communicate with advancing age may not apply to the child experiencing developmental delays. For example, a developmentally delayed school-aged child or adolescent may have the cognitive level of a toddler or preschooler. Health care providers need to be cognizant of this difference when caring for the child in pain. Numerous research studies have revealed that young children often describe pain in concrete terms, whereas older children use more abstract terms that involve both physical and psychological components (McGrath, 2005). Temperament Literature suggests that temperament plays a role in predicting distress and pain levels in a child during painful events (Ranger & Campbell, 2008). For example, a child with a \"difficult temperament\" is more likely to have an increased distress response to pain. Nurses can personalize interventions in the clinical environment and during the pain experience to better fit the child's temperament and other personality traits of the child and family. Previous Pain Experiences A child identifies pain based on his or her experiences with pain in the past. The number of episodes of pain, the type of pain, the severity or intensity of the previous pain experience, the effectiveness of treatment of pain, and how the child responded all affect how the child will perceive and respond to the current experience. Research suggests that severe pain experiences in the neonate or young infant can lead to sensory disturbances and altered pain responses lasting into adulthood (Hatfield, Chang, Bittle, Deluca, & Polomano, 2011). Previous pain experiences with inadequate pain control may lead to increased distress during future painful procedures. For example, research studies have demonstrated that neonates who had undergone painful procedures such as circumcision and heel lancing showed a stronger negative response to routine immunizations and venipuncture weeks to months later (Kennedy et al., 2008). Family and Culture The child's cultural and family background will influence how he or she will express and manage pain. Some cultures transmit thestandard of accepting pain stoically; others allow outward expression. The parents have a strong influence on the child's ability to cope. For example, if a parent reacts to the child's pain in a positive manner and offers comfort measures, the child may have an easier time coping. If the parent shows anger or disapproval, the pain experience may be intensified for the child. Situational Factors Situational factors involve factors or elements that interact with the child and his or her current situation involving the experience of pain. These factors are highly variable and dependent on the specific situation. Situational factors result from the context in which the child is experiencing pain and include cognitive, which is what the child understands and believes about the pain experience; behavioral, which is how the child and family react and what they do about the pain experience; and emotional, which is how the child and family feels about the pain experience (Crowell, 2009). Due to children's limited experience with pain, situational factors may affect them more than adults (McGrath, 2005). A thorough pain assessment must include assessment for situational factors that may exacerbate pain. Examples of situational factors include: Child's lack of understanding of the source of pain Child's lack of ability to use coping mechanisms or pain-relieving strategies to decrease pain Stress and anxiety in anticipation of pain Child's lack of control of cause of pain Child's lack of ability to understand what to expect from potentially painful experiences Increased anxiety exhibited by the family Overly protective behaviors exhibited by the family Presence of emotions such as fear, anxiety, frustration, distress, underlying anxiety, and depression (Crowell, 2009; McGrath, 2005; McGrath & Hillier, 2003)DEVELOPMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS Since children of various developmental ages respond differently to pain and perceive pain in different ways, it is important to review developmental considerations. Refer to Chapters 3 through 7 for a more complete understanding of childhood development. Nurses must understand how children of various ages respond to painful stimuli and what behaviors may be expected based on their developmental level. By understanding these developmental considerations, the nurse can appropriately assess the child's pain and provide effective interventions. Infants Research has demonstrated that infants, including preterm infants, experience pain and can distinguish pain from other tactile experiences (Weissman, Arano-vitch, Blazer, & Zimmer, 2009). Much of this research focuses on pain related to invasive procedures, such as heel sticks and intravenous catheter insertion. Research suggests that neonates, especially preterm infants, actually experience pain at a greater intensity than older-age children and adults (American Medical Association, 2010; Codipietro, Ceccarelli, & Ponzone, 2008). The belief is related to the immaturity of the inhibitory mechanisms that develop higher in the central nervous system at a later time during fetal development. These mechanisms are more complex and do not become functional until later in gestation. In preterm and term newborns, behavioral and physiologic indicators are used for determining pain. Behavioral indicators include facial expression, such as brow contracting and chin quivering; body movements; and crying (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2010; Henry, Haubold, & Dobrzykowski, 2004). Physiologic signs include changes in heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation levels, intracranial pressure, and vagal tone, palmar sweating, and an increase in plasma cortisol or catecholamine levels (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2010; Henry et al., 2004). In the younger infant, facial expression is the most common response to pain ( Fig. 14.2 ). The brows may be lowered and drawn together, with the eyes tightly closed. The mouth is open, often forming a square. The body may be stiff, and thrashing may be seen. When the area is stimulated, the infant may demonstrate a generalized reflex withdrawal. The infant may exhibit a high-pitched, shrill cry. FIGURE 14.2 In the younger infant, facial expression is the most common response to pain. The older infant often displays similar behavioral manifestations of pain. The older infant may display an angry facial expression, but the eyes are open. He or she often demonstrates a definite withdrawal response when the area is stimulated. The older infant cries loudly and tries to push away the stimulus that is causing the pain. Other manifestations include irritability, restless sleeping, and poor feeding. Take Note! Although an infant usually exhibits typical behaviors indicating pain, absence of these manifestations does not indicate a lack of a pain; the response to pain is highly variable (Ranger, Johnston, & Anand, 2007; Weissman, Aranovitch, Blazer, & Zimmer, 2009). Infants also demonstrate physiologic responses to pain. These may include: Increased heart rate, usually averaging approximately 10 beats per minute; possibly bradycardia in preterm newborns Decreased vagal tone Decreased oxygen saturation Palmar or plantar sweating (as measured by skin conductivity testing); not reliable in infants before 37 weeks' gestation Toddlers Toddlers can react to painless procedures as intensely as painful ones, with intense emotional upset and physical resistance or aggression. They may bite, hit, scream, or kick. Other behaviors may include being very quiet, pointing to where it hurt, or saying such words as \"owww.\" Facial grimacing and teeth clenching may be noted. They may also react with fear and try to hide or leave the room. They often have limited vocabularies, so it may be difficult for them to express pain. It is important to ask about and encourage the child to verbalize his or her pain. Ensure the use of words the toddler understands, such as \"owie\" or \"boo-boo.\" Toddlers may demonstrate regressive behaviors, such as clinging to the parent or crying loudly. Take Note! Children do not use the word \"pain\" until around the age of 6. By 2.5 years they spontaneously will use the word \"hurt\" (von Baeyer, 2006). Preschoolers Preschoolers may become quiet or try to withdraw and hide in response to actual or perceived pain. For example, the child may say he or she needs to go to the bathroom or needs to get something from another room. Because of their magical type of thinking, preschoolers may believe pain is a punishment for misbehaving or having bad thoughts. Preschoolers may not verbally report their pain, thinking that pain is something to be expected or that the adults are aware of their pain. They can tell someone where it hurts and can use various tools to describe the severity of pain. However, because they may have limited experience with pain, they may have difficulty distinguishing between types of pain (sharp or dull), describing the intensity of the pain, and determining whether the pain is worse or better. School-Age Children School-age children can usually communicate the type, location, and severity of pain. Children older than the age of 8 years can use specific words, such as \"sharp as a knife,\" \"burning,\" or \"pulling\" to describe their pain. However, they may deny pain in an attempt to appear brave or to avoid further pain related to a procedure or intervention. They may be more concerned with their fear about the illness and its effects rather than the pain. They also may fear being embarrassed by acting-out behaviors in response to pain, such as screaming or thrashing. Thus, a typical response might be to withdraw by staring at the television. Other behaviors that may indicate pain in a school-age child include muscular rigidity, such as clenching the fists, stiffening the body, closing the eyes, wrinkling the forehead, or gritting the teeth. Adolescents Adolescents may be concerned primarily about body image and fear losing control over their behavior. This may result in denial or refusal of medications. Their mood and what they think is expected of them will also affect their response to pain. Adolescents often ask numerous questions and pay close attention to how others respond to them. Fearing that their behavior may be viewed asjuvenile, they may attempt to remain stoic and not exhibit any emotion. Subtle changes such as increased muscle tension with clenched fists and teeth, rapid breathing, and guarding the affected body part may occur. They may also show lack of interest in everyday activities or a decreased ability to concentrate.COMMON FALLACIES AND MYTHS ABOUT PAIN IN CHILDREN In general, children respond to pain based on the type of pain, the extent of pain, and their age and developmental level. Table 14.1 highlights some common myths and misconceptions related to pain in children. Because of these myths, children have been medicated less than adults with a similar diagnosis, leading to inadequate pain management. NURSING PROCESS OVERVIEW FOR THE CHILD IN PAIN Nursing care of the child with pain includes nursing assessment, nursing diagnosis, planning, interventions, and evaluation. Each step of this process must be individualized for each child. A general understanding of the physiology of pain, factors that influence pain, and effective pain management techniques can help to individualize the child's plan of care. Assessment Assessment of pain in children consists of both subjective and objective data collection. The acronym QUESTT is an excellent way to remember the key principles of pain assessment (Baker & Wong, 1987): Question the child. Use a reliable and valid pain scale. Evaluate the child's behavior and physiologic changes to establish a baseline and determine the effectiveness of the intervention. The child's behavior and motor activity may include irritability and protection as well as withdrawal of the affected painful area. Secure the parent's involvement. Take the cause of pain into account when intervening. Take action. Take Note! Children do experience pain! Pain management techniques work just as well with children as they do with adults. Health History When assessing pain in children, tailor the assessment to the child's developmental level and ask questions geared to the child's cognitive ability. During the health history, determine the child's previous exposure to pain, if any, and how the child responded. This information will provide clues about how the child copes and hisor her current response. Attempt to determine what word the child uses to denote pain. Some children may not understand the term \"pain\" but do understand terms such as \"ouchie\" or \"boo-boo.\" The health history also includes questioning the parents about their cultural beliefs related to pain and their child's usual responses. This information aids in planning developmentally and culturally appropriate family-centered care. QUESTIONING THE CHILD When questioning the child, phrase the questions in a manner that the child will be able to understand based on his or her developmental level. Some input from the child's family may be helpful in determining where best to focus the questions. Ask the child what pain means to him or her. Use words that the child may comprehend more easily, such as \"hurt,\" \"boo-boo,\" or \"ouch,\" as appropriate. Inquire about similar experiences in the past and how he or she responded. Determine whether the child let others know that he or she was hurting and how this message was conveyed (e.g., crying, acting out, or pointing to the hurting area). Review the history of the pain and various influences such as cultural aspects, caregiver attitudes or expectations, previous experiences, and any education or teaching related to pain management. Continue to formulate questions to ascertain the following: Location, quality, severity, and onset of the pain, as well as the circumstances in which the child experiences the pain. Have the child point to the area where it hurts or identify the location on a diagram or doll. Conditions, if any, that preceded the onset of pain and the conditions that followed the onset of pain Any associated symptoms, such as weight loss, fever, vomiting, or diarrhea, which may indicate a current illness Any recent trauma, including any interventions that were used in an attempt to relieve the pain Continue the health history by inquiring about what the child wants others, including the nurse, to do when the child hurts. Conversely, ask the child what he or she doesn't want others to do. Finally, question the child about measures that seem to be most effective in relieving the pain. Ask if there is anything special the child wants to tell the nurse, such as a special pain relief technique or a specific comfort object. If the child is experiencing chronic or recurrent pain, suggest the child and family record information in a symptom diary. Explain that this will be helpful in identifying the best ways to manage the pain. QUESTIONING THE PARENTS Parents play a key role in assessing pain in children. Often it is the parents who provide information about the child's current and past experiences with pain. In addition, parents can provide information about how the child exhibits and responds to pain. Parents may be aware of subtle changes in the child's behavior that may precede the pain, occur with the pain, or indicate relief of pain. Including the parents in this process helps create a positive experience for all involved and promotes feelings of control over the situation. The questions posed to the parents are similar in focus to those posed to the child. However, more detailed information may be obtained from the parents because they are usually able to describe events more fully or in greater detail due to their higher cognitive level. Parents typically know their child best. Take Note! Parents may assume that nurses have greater expertise when it comes to assessing their child's pain and taking appropriate action. Thus, they may not always report when they notice changes suggesting that their child is uncomfortable. Emphasize the important role that parents play in reporting any changes in their child so that pain relief measures can be instituted as soon as possible. When questioning the parents, use the following examples as a guide for assessing the child's pain: Has your child ever been in pain before? If so, what was the cause of the pain? How long did he or she have the pain? Where was the pain located? How did your child react to the pain? What did you do to lessen the pain? Did your child let you know that he or she was in pain? Did he or she tell you or did you notice something? Are there any special signs that let you know that your child is hurting? If so, what are they? Is there anything that your child does or that you do when he or she is hurting that helps relieve the pain? Does one thing work better than another when your child is hurting? Is there any special information that you want to tell me about your child? USING PAIN RATING SCALES Various pain assessment, or pain rating, scales are available. These scales allow the child to report his or her pain, and the pain level is quantified. These standardized rating scales provide a greater alignment between the child's pain and the nurse's assessment of the severity of the pain. Self-report measures should be used in conjunction with observation and discussion with the child and family, especially in children younger than age 5 or in children with cognitive impairments (American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Pain Society, 2001). Some studies have found validity in self-report tools used in children as young as 3 years of age, while others have found inconsistent findings when they are used in children younger than 5 years of age (Besenski, For-syth, & von Baeyer, 2007). Therefore, it is important to assess young children's ability to perform self-report tasks rather than rely solely on their chronological age (Besenski et al., 2007). Many health care facilities have specific policies and procedures related to pain assessment, including the frequency of assessment, the rating tool to use, and nursing interventions to be instituted based on the rating. For example, many facilities require assessment of the child using a specific tool with documentation at least once a shift and 30 minutes to 1 hour after a non-pharmacologic or pharmacologic pain relief intervention. This process provides a more objective method to determine whether the pain is increasing or decreasing and whether pain relief methods are effective. Take Note! Typically, different pain rating scales are appropriate for different developmental levels. However, children may regress when in pain, so a simpler tool may be needed to make sure that the child understands what is being asked. Regardless of the tool used, nurses need to be consistent in using the same tool so that appropriate comparisons can be made and effective interventions can be planned and implemented. Using the most appropriate tool consistently allows the most accurate assessment of the child's pain.FACES Pain Rating Scale. The FACES pain rating scale ( Fig. 14.3 ) is a self-report tool that can be used by children as young as 3 or 4 years of age (Oakes, 2011). The scale consists of six illustrations of faces arranged horizontally with expressions ranging from smiling (indicating no hurt) to crying with frowning (indicating hurts worst). Under each face is a short description such as \"hurts little bit\" and a number. The number scale can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 or 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. The nurse explains the words associated with each face to the child. Then the nurse asks the child to select the facial expression that best describes the level of pain he or she is feeling. The nurse then documents the number corresponding to the word description and face (Hockenberry & Wilson, 2009). Oucher Pain Rating Scale. The Oucher pain rating scale is similar to the FACES scale in that it uses facial expressions to indicate increasing degrees of hurt. However, instead of illustrations, six photographs are used: \"no hurt\" is placed at the bottom of the arrangement and \"most hurt\" at the top. Alongside the photos is a scale ranging from 0 to 10 that corresponds to the facial expressions in the photographs ( Fig. 14.4 ). After explaining the photos and numeric scale, the child is asked to point to the number that best describes his or her level of pain (Beyer, Denyes, & Villarruel, 1992). This scale is useful for self-reporting of pain in children between 3 and 13 years of age (Oakes, 2011). Three different scales have been developed for use with Caucasian, Hispanic, and African American children (Cohen et al., 2008). Poker Chip Tool. The poker chip tool, also known as the pieces of hurt tool, is a self-reporting pain assessment tool that uses four red poker chips to quantify the child's level of pain (von Baeyer, 2006). The chips are arranged in a horizontal line on a surface in front of the child. Starting with the chip closest to the child's left side, the nurse points to the chip and explains that the first chip means a little hurt, the next chip means more hurt, the third chip means more hurt, and the fourth chip means the worst hurt ever. Then the nurse asks the child how many \"pieces of hurt\" he or she is having ( Fig. 14.5 ). If the child is not experiencing any pain, typically the child will state that he or she isn't having any. When the child identifies the number of \"pieces of hurt,\" the nurse follows up by asking the child to tell the nurse more about his or her hurt (Hester, 1979). The poker chip tool is useful for assessing pain in children who are 3 to 4 years of age or older (Cohen et al., 2008; Stinson, Kavanagh, Yamada, Gill, & Stevens, 2006). Children may view this assessment tool as a game since it involves poker chips. However, the nurse needs to ensure that the child has the cognitive ability to distinguish the numbers. Word-Graphic Rating Scale. The word-graphic rating scale is a self-reporting scale that consists of a line with descriptors underneath: no pain, little pain, medium pain, large pain, and worst possible pain ( Fig. 14.6 ). The nurse explains the line and descriptors to the child. Then the child is asked to make a vertical mark on the horizontal line at the point that best describes the child's level of pain. The nurse uses a ruler to measure the distance from the \"no pain\" starting point to the area marked by the child. Take Note! Toddlers and preschoolers may not be used to being asked questions by strangers, and may not understand quantitative ratings or estimation. Preschoolers will often construct an answer even if they do not understand the question. They also will often use extremes of scales, such as no pain or the worst pain (von Baeyer, 2006). Visual Analog and Numeric Scales . Visual analog and numeric scales involve a horizontal or vertical line with marked endpoints. With a visual analog scale, the endpoints are identified as no pain and worst pain. A numeric scale typically has endpoints of 0 and 10, reflecting no pain and worst pain, respectively ( Fig. 14.7 ). The nurse explains the scale to the child. With the visual analog scale, the child makes a line that best describes the level of pain. The nurse then measures the distance from the \"no pain\" endpoint to the child's mark and records this as the pain score. With the numeric scale, the nurse asks the child to pick the number that best describes his or her level of pain. The visual analog scale can be used in children 7 years or older (Oakes, 2011). The numeric scale can be used with children 8 years or older (von Baeyer, 2006). Even though a younger child may be able to count and give numbers on the scale, they have not yet developed an understanding of the quantitative significance of the numbers. Adolescent Pediatric Pain Tool. The Adolescent Pediatric Pain Tool is a self-report type of tool useful for older children, usually between 8 and 17 years of age (Bowden & Greenberg, 2008). The tool involves three aspects of assessment. In the first assessment the child identifies the location of the pain on two illustrations of the body\u2014front and back views ( Fig. 14.8 ). The child is instructed to color the areas where he or she is hurting. The child is also instructed to color the area as big or as small as how much he or she is hurting. For example, if the hurt is mild or moderate, the child would color a moderate area of the location; if the pain is severe, he or she would color a much larger area. The second portion of the tool involves a scale that ranges from \"no pain\" to \"worst possible pain.\" The nurse instructs the child to identify the severity of his or her pain. The third assessment is a list of words that may be used to describe pain, such as throbbing, pounding, stabbing, or sharp. The nurse asks the child to point to or circle the words that describe the current pain. Children with limited reading skills or vocabulary may have difficulty with some of the words listed to describe pain. Work with the child and encourage the parents to help the child understand the various descriptive words. Parental participation fosters control over the situation and gives the parents some insight into what their child is experiencing (Crandall & Savedra, 2005). Physical Examination Physical examination of the child for pain primarily involves the skills of observation and inspection. These skills are used to assess for physiologic and behavioral changes that indicate pain. Auscultation also may be used to assess for changes in vital signs, specifically heart rate and blood pressure. OBSERVE FOR MANIFESTATIONS OF PAIN Observe for physical signs and symptoms of pain, keeping in mind the child's developmental level. Look for facial expressions of discomfort, grimacing, or crying. Be alert for movements that may suggest pain. For example, an infant or toddler may pull on the ear when experiencing ear pain. The child may move the head from side to side, suggesting head pain. Typically, children with abdominal pain will lie on one side and draw their knees up to the abdomen. Inspect the child's gait: a limp or avoidance of weight bearing may suggest leg pain. Immobility, guarding of a particular body area, or refusal to move an area may be observed. Inspect the skin for flushing or diaphoresis, possible indicators of pain. Also monitor vital signs for changes. Pulse or heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure may increase. Other physiologic parameters that suggest pain may include elevated intracranial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance and decreased oxygen saturation levels. Take Note! The body responds to acute pain via the sympathetic nervous system, leading to stimulation and a subsequent increase in vital signs. However, if the child has persistent or chronic pain, the body adapts and these changes may be less noticeable (Bowden & Greenberg, 2008; Oakes, 2011). The child also may exhibit behavioral changes indicating pain. Be alert for irritability and restlessness. Watch for clenching of teeth or fists, body stiffening, or increased muscle tension. Note any changes in the child's behavior. For example, a child who previously was talkative and playful may become quiet and almost withdrawn in response to pain. Remember, a child in pain may sleep or play in order to cope with the pain. In addition, pay close attention to the child's cultural background and how these beliefs may be affecting the behavioral response to pain. Each child is an individual with unique responses to pain, so the nurse must ensure that observations of behavior do indeed reflect the child's pain level. To help ensure the accuracy of observations, several physiologic and behavioral assessment tools have been developed to help quantify the observations. USING PHYSIOLOGIC AND BEHAVIORAL PAIN ASSESSMENT TOOLS Use of physiologic and behavioral pain assessment tools allows measurement of specific parameters and changes that would indicate that the child is experiencing pain. These measurements aid in determining the intensity of the pain experience. Along with the self-report pain rating scales, measurement of these changes allows the nurse to objectively assess pain and the effectiveness of pain management measures. Neonatal Infant Pain Scale. The Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) is a behavioral assessment tool that is useful for measuring pain in preterm and full-term neonates (Lawrence et al., 1993). Six parameters are measured: facial expression, cry, breathing patterns, arms, legs, and state of arousal ( Table 14.2 ). Each parameter except for cry is scored as a 0 or 1; cry is scored as 0, 1, or 2. The scores are then totaled and the maximum score that can be achieved is 7. A higher score indicates increased pain. This scale does not include any physiologic parameters; therefore, it may not detect early pain in neonates who are too ill to respond, who are receiving paralyzing agents, or who are premature (Hand, Noble, Geiss, Wozniak, & Hall, 2010). In these cases, a falsely low score may be produced. Riley Infant Pain Scale. The Riley Infant Pain Scale (RIPS) is a behavioral assessment tool useful for infants who lack verbal ability (Schade, Joyce, Gerkensmeyer, & Keck, 1996). Like NIPS, RIPS measures six parameters: facial expression, body movement, sleep, verbal or vocal ability, consolability, and response to movements and touch ( Table 14.3 ). Each parameter is scored as 0, 1, 2, or 3. The score is then totaled and the maximum score that can be achieved is 18. The higher the total score, the more intense the pain. Pain Observation Scale for Young Children. The Pain Observation Scale for Young Children (POCIS) is a behavioral assessment tool designed for use in children between 1 and 4 years of age (Boelenvander Loo, Scheffer, de Haan, & de Groot, 1999). This tool measures seven parameters: facial expression, cry, breathing, torso, arms and fingers, legs and toes, and state of arousal ( Table 14.4 ). Each parameter is scored as 0 or 1; the maximum score achievable is 7. The higher the score, the greater the pain being experienced by the child. This measurement is recorded as the pain score. The word-graphic rating scale is useful for children between 4 and 17 years old. CRIES Scale for Neonatal Postoperative Pain Assessment . The CRIES scale is a behavioral assessment tool that also includes measures of physiologic parameters (Krechel & Bildner, 1995). It was developed to quantify postoperative pain in the newborn. The tool also may be used to monitor the infant's progress over time during recovery or after interventions. The tool assesses five parameters: cry, oxygen required for saturation levels less than 95%, increased vital signs, facial expression, and sleeplessness ( Table 14.5 ). Each parameter is scored as 0, 1, or 2 and then totaled. As with other assessment tools, the higher the score, the greater the infant's pain. FLACC Behavioral Scale for Postoperative Pain in Young Children . The FLACC behavioral scale is a behavioral assessment tool that is useful in assessing a child's pain when the child cannot report accurately his or her level of pain (Merkel, Voepel-Lewis, Shayevitz, & Malviya, 1997). It has been demonstrated to be a reliable tool for children from age 2 months to 7 years of age (Oakes, 2011). This tool measures five parameters: facial expression, legs, activity, cry, and consolability ( Table 14.6 ). Observe the child with the legs and body uncovered. If the child is awake, observe him or her for 2 to 5 minutes; if sleeping, observe the child for 5 minutes or longer. Each parameter is scored as 0, 1, or 2. The scores are totaled, with a maximum achievable score of 10. As with other assessment tools, the higher the score, the greater the pain. Nursing Diagnoses, Goals, Interventions, and Evaluation After assessing the child, the nurse identifies appropriate nursing diagnoses. The most commonly identified nursing diagnosis would be acute or chronic pain. However, the related factors and defining characteristics can vary widely. Nursing diagnoses will focus on the effects of pain on the child, for example, the stress incurred as a result of the pain or the fear or anxiety associated with the pain or events causing the pain. Moreover, pain can affect physiologic functions, such as sleep, nutrition, mobility, and elimination. Examples of common nursing diagnoses may include: Acute pain related to repeated need for invasive procedures, surgical experience, recent trauma, or infection Chronic pain related to prolonged illness or injury, effects of cancer on surrounding tissues, or treatment-related effects Fear related to the unknown, separation from family, anticipation of invasive procedures, or effects of treatment Anxiety related to the stress and uncertainty of the situation Deficient knowledge related to current condition and appropriate methods for managing pain Sleep deprivation related to inability to manage pain effectively Impaired mobility related to increased episodes of pain Risk for constipation related to potential adverse effects of narcotic analgesic agents When caring for a child experiencing pain, the ultimate goal is that the child will be free of pain as evidenced by participation in age-appropriate activities of daily living and vital signs within age-appropriate parameters. However, at times, this may be unrealistic, especially if the child is experiencing chronic pain. Therefore, a more appropriate goal would be that the child reports that his or her pain has decreased to a tolerable level. Pain assessment tools can be used to quantify the amount by which the child's pain has decreased. For example, if the child has rated the pain as 7 out of 10, a realistic goal might be that the child reports a pain rating of no more than 4 out of 10. Additional goals would reflect improvement or resolution of the identified problem. For example, a short-term goal for a child experiencing disturbed sleep due to the pain might be that the child sleeps for a minimum of 4 consecutive hours through the night. A long-term goal might be that the child sleeps for 7 to 8 hours undisturbed through the night.Various interventions can be used for pain management. These interventions include nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic measures. A guiding principle when caring for the child experiencing pain is the provision of atraumatic care (see Chapter 8 for more information). For example, cognitive and behavioral approaches are appropriate for pain management, including pain management related to procedures. In addition to nonpharmacologic measures, pharmacologic measures are appropriate for pain management. For example, apply a topical anesthetic cream to a site early enough before a venipuncture that it becomes effective. Another idea is to use an intermittent infusion device to obtain multiple blood specimen samples rather than performing repeated venipunctures. In addition, it is a good idea to consider the use of sedation for more painful procedures. Throughout the child's care, be sure to discuss specific goals and interventions with the child and family as appropriate. Include the family in developing appropriate interventions so they can continue to support the child. Education of the child and family about interventions, including various therapies, is key. Ongoing assessment is needed to determine the effectiveness of the pain relief measures in achieving the desired goals. A traumatic Care Play therapy may be helpful in allowing the child to express his or her feelings and adapt to the stressors of the current situation. Nursing Care Plan 14.1 can be used as a guide in planning nursing care for the child experiencing pain. The nursing care plan should be individualized based on the child's symptoms and needs. Specific information related to pain management and the nurse's role will be discussed later in the chapter. When you enter Aiden's room, he is crying and says his leg hurts. What will be your initial action? What will be your plan of care to manage Aiden's pain (refer to QUESTT assessment)? How would you address the statements made by the nurse in report? What approaches can you use to change staff behavior about pain management? FIGURE 14.3 FACES pain rating scale. (From Hockenberry, M. J., & Wilson, D. [2009].

NURSING CARE PLAN 14.1 Overview for the Child in Pain NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Acute pain related to need for invasive procedures, surgery, recent trauma, or infection as evidenced by pain rating scale, facial grimacing, crying, irritability, withdrawal activity, or changes in vital signs Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will achieve adequate comfort level as evidenced by a decrease in rating number on a pain rating scale, quietness, calm resting behaviors, decrease in crying and irritability, and vital signs within acceptable parameters. Interventions: Promoting Pain Relief Assess pain level using a developmentally appropriate pain rating tool to establish a baseline. Assess for verbal and nonverbal indicators of pain to help determine child's pain level; question parents about child's typical behaviors and previous experiences with pain to determine factors that may be influencing child's response to pain. Institute nonpharmacologic methods for pain control based on the child's age and cognitive level to help decrease pain; encourage parental participation in use of methods to provide additional support and pain relief for the child. Administer pharmacologic agents as ordered using the least traumatic route possible to alter pain impulse transmission and minimize distress while promoting effective pain relief. Explain the action of the drug and what the child should expect from the medication at a level that the child can understand to promote trust and reduce fear while providing effective pain relief. Give analgesics around the clock if pain is continuous and can be predicted to maintain steady blood levels of the drug, thereby maximizing the drug's effect. Perform atraumatic care at all times to minimize the child's exposure to physical and psychological distress and pain. Anticipate timing of procedures or situations that may lead to pain and provide appropriate analgesic therapy as ordered to ensure that therapy is most effective at the time of the procedure. Ensure that the child's environment is quiet and conducive to rest, dim the lights, and close the door or curtain to reduce sensory overload that would increase the child's pain sensation. Encourage the parents to stroke, touch, caress, and hold the child to reduce discomfort and promote feelings of security. Reassess the child's pain level after use of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic methods to determine effectiveness; anticipate the need to modify or adapt nonpharmacologic methods or adjust analgesic dosage, route, or frequency to promote maximum pain relief. Perform nursing care activities after administering analgesic to prevent exacerbating the child's pain. Use diversional activities, distraction, and play appropriate to the child's age and cognitive level to promote additional pain relief NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Anxiety related to stress and uncertainty of the situation, unknown cause of pain, lack of familiarity with procedures, testing, and health care facility, and painful procedures, as evidenced by crying, irritability, withdrawal, stoic or aggressive behaviors Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child and family will demonstrate a decrease in anxiety level as evidenced by age-appropriate positive coping behaviors, verbalization of feelings, playing out of feelings, child and family cooperation with plan of care, and absence of signs and symptoms associated with escalating anxiety. Interventions: Minimizing Anxiety Assess child's and parents' understanding of the situation, including their understanding of what may be causing the pain and the reasons for the procedures and testing, to provide baseline information about the child's and parents' knowledge and possible clues to anxiety. Spend time with the child and parents discussing what they think might be happening, encouraging the child and parents to talk openly about their feelings, to facilitate continued expressions and communication. Allow time for questions and answer questions honestly to establish rapport and build trust. Approach the child and family in a calm, relaxed manner to foster trust and communication and decrease anxiety. Allow the child options related to interventions as much as possible, such as fluid to drink or snack to eat, extremity to use for venipuncture (right or left), color of bandage, or holding tape or dressing, to foster feelings of control. Provide atraumatic care to reduce exposure to distress, which would exacerbate the child's anxiety level. Explain any procedures, tests, or activities at a level the child can understand to reduce fear of the unknown. Incorporate aspects of the child's routine at home as much as possible to reduce feelings of separation and promote feelings of normalcy. Ensure consistency in care to facilitate trust and acceptance. Encourage parents in the use of comfort measures such as stroking, cuddling, holding, and rocking to promote feelings of security and minimize stress. Provide positive reinforcement for choices, participation in activities, and use of appropriate coping methods to foster self-esteem. Encourage the child's participation in play (unstructured and therapeutic play as needed) to promote expression of feelings and fears. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Deficient knowledge related to current condition and appropriate methods for managing pain as evidenced by crying, irritability, pushing away, questions and verbalizations about pain and relief methods Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child and parents will demonstrate adequate knowledge about the child's current condition and use of pain relief methods as evidenced by statements about the cause of the child's pain, demonstration of chosen nonpharmacologic relief methods, use of pharmacologic agents, and statements related to signs and symptoms of increased and decreased pain. Intervention: Providing Child and Family Teaching Assess the child's and parents' knowledge and understanding of the child's current condition and current pain level to establish a baseline for teaching. Provide time for the child and parents to ask questions; answer questions honestly and in terms they can understand to promote learning. Explain in simplified terms how the child's condition is associated with pain or the rationale for procedures needed that may contribute to pain to promote understanding and foster trust. Teach in short sessions to prevent overloading the child and parents with information. Provide reinforcement and rewards to help facilitate the teaching/learning process. Use multiple modes of learning, such as written information, verbal instruction, demonstrations, and media when possible, to facilitate learning and retention of information. Instruct the parents and child as appropriate in nonpharmacologic methods for pain relief; encourage practice and participation by parents in methods chosen to foster independence and use of method when necessary. Teach the child as appropriate and parents about pharmacologic methods for pain relief; review specific information about the drug to be used, including action, duration, administration, possible adverse effects, and care necessary when the drug is used, to promote learning; have the child and parents report back information or demonstrate administration to evaluate effectiveness of teaching. Provide parents with written information about pain relief methods for use at home if indicated to allow for reference at a later date. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Sleep deprivation related to inability to manage pain effectively as evidenced by frequent waking by child during night, signs and symptoms of pain including irritability and restlessness, statements about being tired, pain rating scale Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will exhibit increased ability to sleep during the night as evidenced by increasing periods of calm and restfulness (initially starting at 2 hours and gradually increasing to 7 to 8 hours), decreased pain level on pain rating scale, and statements of decreased fatigue. Intervention: Promoting Sleep and Rest Assist the child in using nonpharmacologic methods of pain relief, such as imagery, distraction, and muscle relaxation, to promote relaxation. Administer pharmacologic pain relief as ordered to minimize pain interfering with sleep; anticipate a change in drug therapy if pain relief is inadequate. Cluster nursing care activities to minimize energy expenditure and disruptions in the child's ability to rest. Help the child with a nighttime routine similar to one he or she uses at home to promote feelings of security. Offer the child a back rub, warm bath, or warm liquids; reading a story; or listening to music to facilitate relaxation; provide stroking, hugging, cuddling, rocking, and light touch to promote a sense of security and calm. Dim the lights and close the curtain or door to the room to provide a quiet, restful environment. Ensure round-the-clock pain relief for the child through the night to minimize the risk of pain.NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for injury related to possible adverse effects of analgesics Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will remain free of any injury related to signs and symptoms of adverse effects of analgesic therapy as evidenced by respiratory rate appropriate for age and no complaints of gastrointestinal (GI) upset, dizziness, or sedation or episodes of constipation, nausea, vomiting, or pruritus. Intervention: Promoting Safety Ensure that the child's call light is within reach to allow for notification of health care personnel should problems arise. Administer analgesic exactly as prescribed to reduce the risk of error and development of adverse effects. Assess the child's respiratory status closely for changes to allow for early detection of respiratory depression. If an opioid analgesic is being given, have naloxone readily available to reverse the action of the narcotic if respiratory depression occurs. Monitor appetite and assess bowel sounds for changes; note any abdominal distention or decreased bowel sounds, which would suggest decreased peristalsis. Ensure adequate fluid and fiber intake to reduce risk of constipation. Offer small frequent meals and give medication with food to minimize risk of GI upset. Assess for nausea and vomiting; if necessary, withhold food and fluids to rest the GI tract and administer antiemetics until nausea and vomiting resolve. Instruct the child to remain in bed after receiving analgesic, raise crib or side rails as appropriate, and instruct the child and parents to have someone accompany the child to the bathroom if allowed to reduce the risk of falls from sedation. Assess for complaints of itching and observe for rash or reddened areas; if pruritus occurs, urge the child not to scratch and expect to administer antihistamine as ordered to reduce pruritus. Provide the child with distraction to assist in helping to reduce effects of pruritus.MANAGEMENT OF PAIN Management of pain begins with assessment of the child's comfort level. If pain or the potential for pain, such as during an invasive procedure, is identified, steps must be taken to minimize or treat the pain. Three general principles guide pain management in children: 1. Individualize interventions based on the amount of pain experienced and the child's characteristics, such as developmental level, temperament, previous pain experience, and coping strategies. 2. Use nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches to ease or eliminate the pain. 3. Teach the child and family about pain relief interventions and techniques and discuss with the child and family expectations of pain management. Specific strategies for pain management include nonpharmacologic interventions such as relaxation, distraction, and guided imagery and pharmacologic interventions such as analgesics, and moderate sedation. Nonpharmacologic Management Various techniques may be available to assist in managing mild pain in children or to augment the effectiveness of medications for moderate or severe pain. Many of these nonpharmacologic techniques assist children in coping with pain and give them an opportunity to feel a sense of mastery or control over the situation. Two types of techniques are behavioral-cognitive strategies and biophysical strategies. It is important to involve the parents in the process when using these techniques. Behavioral-Cognitive Strategies Behavioral-cognitive strategies for pain management involve measures that require the child to focus on a specific area rather than the pain. These strategies help to change the interpretation of the painful stimuli, reducing pain perception or making pain more tolerable. In addition, these strategies help to decrease negative attitudes, thoughts, and anxieties, thereby improving the child's coping mechanisms. Typically, these interventions work well with older children, but younger children also benefit from these techniques if they are adapted to the child's age and developmental level. Common behavioral-cognitive strategies include relaxation, distraction, imagery, biofeedback, thought stopping, and positive self-talk. RELAXATION Relaxation aids in reducing muscle tension and anxiety. A wide variety of techniques can be used. Relaxation can be as simple as holding an infant or young child closely while stroking the child or speaking in a soft soothing manner, or having the child inhale and exhale slowly using rhythmically controlled deep breathing. It also can involve more sophisticated techniques such as progressive relaxation. With this technique the child is asked to focus on one area of the body and let that body part go limp. Then in an organized fashion, usually working from the toes to the head or vice versa, the child is asked to focus on another body part, making it go limp. Eventually the exercises work through all body areas, leading to relaxation of the entire body. DISTRACTION Distraction involves having the child focus on another stimulus, thereby attempting to shield him or her from pain. Research has shown distraction to be a statistically and clinically significant intervention in reducing pain. In addition, it is time and cost efficient to use (MacLaren & Cohen, 2007). This technique does not eliminate the pain but does help to make it more tolerable. Various methods can be used for distraction, including: Counting Repeating specific phrases or words, such as \"ouch\" Listening to music or singing Playing games, including computer and video games Blowing bubbles or blowing pinwheels or party favors Listening to favorite stories ( Fig. 14.9 ) Watching cartoons, television shows, or movies Visiting with friends Humor Humor has been demonstrated to be an effective distracting technique for pain management. However, make sure that thetechnique is age appropriate and be sure to determine what or who will make the child laugh. If possible, allow the child and his or her family to choose the materials that they consider humorous. The type of distraction used depends on the age of the child. For example, a younger child may enjoy blowing pinwheels and blowing bubbles. He or she also will enjoy listening to favorite stories or books. Older children may enjoy computer or video games, listening to favorite music, or visiting with friends. See Evidence-Based Practice 14.1. FIGURE 14.9 A child using distraction for pain management. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 14.1 WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF DISTRACTION ON PAIN, FEAR, AND DISTRESS DURING VENOUS PORT ACCESS AND VENIPUNCTURE IN CHILDREN WITH CANCER? Children with cancer undergo multiple procedures, and many describe these procedures as the most distressing part of their disease. Distraction can decrease procedural pain, distress, and fear by redirecting the child from threatening to nonthreatening stimuli, resulting in a therapeutic benefit. STUDY This study used an intervention-comparison group design in a large university-affiliated pediatric medical center. A convenience sample of 50 children with cancer, from 5 to 18 years old, was randomly assigned to either a comparison or an intervention group. Two oncology nurses performed all port access or venipunctures per institutional guidelines. Both groups received standard care with the intervention group also using a self-selected distracter from a pool of five choices, which were chosen based on recommendations in the literature (/ Spy: Super Challenger book, bubbles, music, VR glasses that allow the child to watch a video in 3-D and listen to music in stereo sound, and Nintendo Gameboy). Findings The pain and fear scores were lower in the intervention group, although the difference was not statistically significant. Fear and distress scores were significantly improved from during to after the procedure in the intervention versus the comparison group. Forty-six percent of those in the intervention group stated the current poke was \"better\" or \"much better\" than their last one, compared to 39% in the comparison group. Fifty-nine percent of parents in the intervention group, compared to 16% in the comparison group, felt this venous access or venipuncture was better than the last one. Ninety-one percent of those children in the intervention group stated that the distracter helped and they would use it again. All of the parents (100%) reported the distracter was effective and they would encourage their child to use it again. Nursing ImplicationsNurses need to encourage distraction strategies as they have been shown to positively enhance procedure outcomes. The nurse needs to facilitate and encourage parent participation in the use of distraction strategies. Adapted from Windich-Biermeier, A., Sjoberg, I., Dale, J. C., Eshelman, D., & Guzzetta, C. E. (2007). Effects of distraction on pain, fear, and distress during venous port access and venipuncture in children and adolescents with cancer. 0(1), 8-19. IMAGERY Imagery involves the use of the imagination to create a mental image. This mental image usually is a positive, pleasurable image, but it need not be real. The child is encouraged to include details and sensations that are associated with the image, such as specific descriptions of the image, colors, sounds, feelings, and smells. In some instances, the child may write down or record the image on a tape or compact disc. When pain occurs, the child is encouraged to create the mental image or read or listen to the description. BIOFEEDBACK Biofeedback involves having the child gain an awareness of his or her body functions and learn ways to modify them voluntarily. The child usually is taught specific skills about how to modify body functions using an apparatus that measures pain-related changes in muscle tone or physiologic data, such as blood pressure or pulse rate. This teaching usually is performed by a specialized health care provider and occurs over several sessions, in advance of the pain experience. With practice, the child learns to control the changes without the apparatus. This technique can be used by older children, such as adolescents, who can concentrate for longer periods of time. THOUGHT STOPPING Thought stopping involves substituting a pleasurable or positive thought for the painful experience. Examples of positive thoughts might be, \"It's only for a short time\" or \"It's important so I get better.\" The negative component of the pain is not ignored or suppressed; rather, it is transformed into something positive. Thought stopping also can involve the use of short, positive phrases. For example, the child may repeat \"quick stick, feel better go home soon\" when he or she anticipates pain or experiences pain. Thought stopping is a useful method for reducing anxiety before and during events associated with pain. Children can be taught to use this technique any time they experience anxiety related to a painful experience. Doing so helps to promote the child's sense of control over the situation. POSITIVE SELF-TALK Positive self-talk is similar to thought stopping in that it involves the use of positive statements. With positive self-talk the child is taught to say positive statements when he or she is experiencing pain. For example, the child may be taught to say, \"I will feel better and be able to go home and play with my friends.\" Take Note! Studies have shown hypnosis to be consistently effective in decreasing pain and anxiety in children during procedures involving acute pain (Evans, Tsao, & Zelter, 2008). Biophysical Interventions Biophysical interventions focus on interfering with the transmission of pain impulses reaching the brain. The interventions involve some type of cutaneous stimulation near the site of the pain. This stimulation decreases the ability of the A-delta and C fibers to transmit pain impulses. Examples of biophysical interventions include application of heat and cold, massage and pressure, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). SUCKING AND SUCROSE Sucking is a behavior from which infants derive satisfaction. Therefore, nonnutritive sucking (e.g., sucking a pacifier) can be used to reduce pain behaviors in neonates undergoing painful procedures. In addition, infants show reduced pain behaviors after ingestion of sucrose or other sweet-tasting solutions such as glucose during single-event procedures, such as heel lancing (Stevens, Yamada, & Ohlsson, 2010). Optimal dosing for sucrose needs further research and caution must be used in extremely low-birthweight infants and infants with unstable blood glucose levels. A traumatic CareBreastfeeding is also a noninvasive, natural, and feasible way to use sucking to reduce pain in infants. HEAT AND COLD APPLICATIONS Heat and cold applications alter physiologic mechanisms associated with pain. Cold results in vasoconstriction and alters capillary permeability, leading to a decrease in edema at the site of the injury. Due to vasoconstriction, blood flow is reduced and the release of pain-producing substances such as histamine and serotonin also is decreased. Moreover, transmission of painful stimuli via peripheral nerve fibers is decreased. Heat results in vasodilation and increases blood flow to the area. It also leads to a decrease in nociceptive stimulation and removal of chemical substances that can stimulate nociceptive fibers. The increase in blood flow alters capillary permeability, leading to a reduction in swelling and pressure on nociceptive nerve fibers. Heat may also trigger the release of endogenous opioids, which mediate the pain response. MASSAGE AND PRESSURE Massage and pressure, like other biophysical interventions, are believed to inhibit stimulation of the A-delta and C fibers. These methods are helpful in relaxing muscles and reducing tension. In addition, these techniques can aid in distracting the child. Massage can be as simple as rubbing a body part or pressing on an area such as an injection site for about 10 seconds. It can also be more involved, requiring the use of another person to perform the massage. Lotion or ointment can be used during the massage and may provide a comforting effect. Contralateral pressure or massage (i.e., of the opposite area) may be used, especially if the area of pain cannot be accessed or if the affected area is too painful to touch. A more formal method of pressure application is acupressure. In acupressure the fingertip, the thumb, or a blunt instrument is used to apply gentle, firm pressure to specifically designated sites to control pain. The pressure may be applied in one motion followed by releasing, in a circular motion for several minutes and then releasing or with a vibrating motion using the fingertips. The motion of applying and then releasing pressure is thought to facilitate the release of endogenous endorphins and enkephalins. The techniques of pressure and massage are easy to learn and use and can be taught to children and parents. The Nurse's Role in Nonpharmacologic Pain Intervention The nurse plays a major role in teaching the child and family about nonpharmacologic pain interventions. Help the child and family choose the most appropriate and most effective methods and ensure that the child and parents use the method before pain occurs as well as before the pain increases. Teaching Guidelines 14.1 lists some helpful instructions for the parents and child about nonpharmacologic pain management. Teaching Guidelines 14.1 TEACHING TO MANAGE PAIN WITHOUT DRUGS Review the methods available and choose the method(s) that your child and you find best for your situation. Learn to identify the ways in which your child shows pain or demonstrates he or she is anxious about the possibility of pain. For example, does he or she get restless, make a face, or get flushed in the face? Begin using the technique chosen before your child experiences pain or when your child first indicates he or she is anxious about, or beginning to experience, pain. Practice the technique with your child and encourage the child to use the technique when he or she feels anxious about pain or anticipates that a procedure or experience will be painful. Perform the technique with your child. For example, take the deep breath in and out or blow bubbles with him or her; listen to the music or play the computer game with your child. Avoid using terms such as \"hurt\" or \"pain\" that suggest or cause your child to expect pain. Use descriptive terms like \"pushing,\" \"pulling,\" \"pinching,\" or \"heat.\" Avoid overly descriptive or judgmental statements such as, \"This will really hurt a lot\" or \"This will be terrible.\" Stay with your child as much as possible; speak softly and gently stroke or cuddle your child. Offer praise, positive reinforcement, hugs, and support for using the technique even when it was not effective.It is also important to assist the child and parents when using the technique in order to make sure that they are using the technique correctly. Offer suggestions for modifications or adaptations as necessary. Parents are important components of the pain management program. Give them the option to stay with the child, or let them know that someone else will support the child if they opt not to stay. Offer simple, concrete ways to assist and help the child to manage pain. Many of the nonpharmacologic techniques can be done by parents, and children may respond better if their parents demonstrate the technique and encourage them to use it. Invite parents to participate in decisions as well as act as a coach to their child during procedures. Prepare the parents and explain the most appropriate pain management approaches and strategies. Discuss the type and amount of pain expected as well as the potential complications associated with pain management approaches. Ask how the parent predicts the child will react to a painful situation. Finally, offer techniques and strategies to the parents as they act as the coach during these situations. Take Note! Although parents want to help their children and some are able to act as coaches, the response of the child to pain and stress and to their parents' distraction interventions is highly variable. Some children appear to be soothed by their parents' distraction actions; others appear to become distressed. Be alert to factors that may influence the child's response, including age, sex, diagnosis, ethnicity, previous experience, temperament, anxiety, and coping style. Also be aware of parental factors, including ethnicity, sex, previous experience, belief in the helpfulness of the intervention, parenting style, and parental anxiety (McCarthy & Kleiber, 2006). Pharmacologic Management Pharmacologic interventions involve the administration of drugs for pain relief. Administration may occur using a wide variety of methods. The selection of the method is determined by the drug being administered; the child's status; the type, intensity, and location of the pain; and any factors that may be influencing the child's pain. Research overwhelmingly supports the appropriate use of analgesics to reduce pain perception in children. Medications Used for Pain Management Analgesics (medications for pain relief) typically fall into one of two categories\u2014nonopioid analgesics and opioid analgesics. Anesthetics also may be used. Drugs such as sedatives and hypnotics may be used as adjuvant medications to help minimize anxiety or provide or assist with pain relief when typical analgesics are ineffective. NONOPIOID Drug Guide 14.1 ). These agents may be used to treat mild to moderate pain, often for conditions such as arthritis; joint, bone, and muscle pain; headache; dental pain; and menstrual pain. Acetaminophen, probably the most widely known nonopioid analgesic, and ibuprofen are also commonly used to treat fever in children. Take Note! Aspirin should not be used in children for analgesic and antipyretic purposes because of the high risk of Reye syndrome. According to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) pain ladder, acetaminophen and NSAIDs are first-line agents for the treatment of pain (WHO, 2010). Although this ladder was developed for the relief of cancer pain, it can be applied to any child experiencing pain of increasing intensity. Nonopioid agents are typically administered orally or rectally. In some cases, such as with postoperative pain, they may be administered intravenously as a continuous infusion or as bolus doses. Administration via intramuscular injection is not recommended because the injection can cause significant pain and the onset of pain relief is not increased. Adverse effects commonly associated with these agents include gastrointestinal irritation, blood clotting problems, and renal dysfunction. However, research has demonstrated that children experience only mild gastrointestinal upset and negligible effects on a healthy, well-functioning renal system. Blood clotting problems arise primarily when these agents are given perioperatively before primary hemostasis has occurred (Maunuksela & Olkkola, 2003). Nonopioids are relatively safe, have few incompatibilities with other medications, and do not depress the central nervous system. Unfortunately, they exhibit a ceiling effect for analgesia. That is, after a certain level, they do not provide increasing pain relief even when administered at increased doses. As a result, they may be combined with opioids for more effective pain relief. DRUG GUIDE 14.1 COMMON DRUGS FOR PAIN MANAGEMENTOPIOID ANALGESICS Opioid analgesics are typically used for moderate to severe pain. They are classified as either agonists (when they act as the neurotransmitter at the receptor site) or antagonists (when they block the action at the receptor site). Opioid agents that act as butorphanol, and nalbuphine (see Drug Guide Opioids can be administered orally,rectally, intramuscularly, or intravenously. In addition, some agents such as fentanyl can be administered transdermally or transmucosally. Morphine is considered the \"gold standard\" for all opioid agonists; it is the drug to which all other opioids are compared and is usually the drug of choice for severe pain (Oakes, 2011). Opioid agonists, such as morphine, are associated with numerous adverse effects, resulting primarily from their depressant action on the central nervous system. Take Note! When administering parenteral or epidural opioids, always have naloxone (Narcan) readily available to reverse the opioid's effects should respiratory depression occur Opioids stimulate the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), leading to nausea and vomiting. Moreover, drug tolerance (increased dosage required for the same pain relief previously achieved with a lower dose) and physical dependence (need for continued administration of the drug to prevent withdrawal symptoms) are commonly noted when opioids are given repeatedly. Drug Guide 14.1 gives additional information related to the opioid analgesics. Take Note! Drug tolerance occurs when increasing doses are required to manage the pain. Physical dependence can occur after as few as 5 days of continuous use of the drug; symptoms of withdrawal begin if it is suddenly stopped (Oakes, 2011). Mixed agonist-antagonists are associated with less respiratory depression than agonists. Unfortunately, like NSAIDs, this group also has a ceiling effect, leading to inadequate pain relief even with increased dosages. When this occurs, increasing the dosage of the mixed agonist-antagonist or combining it with an agonist provides no additional pain relief. Take Note! Meperidine (Demerol), an opioid agonist, is not recommended as agent for pain relief in children. Meperidine's metabolite, normeperidine, is associated with the development of restlessness, irritability, twitching, agitation, tremors, and, most importantly, seizures (American Medical Association, 2010). Normeperidine is a central nervous stimulant and its adverse effects cannot be reversed by an opioid antagonist such as naloxone (Kim, 2009). ADJUVANT DRUGS Adjuvant drugs are drugs that are used to promote more effective pain relief, either alone or in combination with nonopioids or opioids. Their primary indication is for diagnoses other than pain. These agents are not classified as analgesics but may provide a coanalgesic effect or may treat side effects. Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam and midazolam, help to relieve anxiety. Midazolam also produces amnesia. Anticonvulsants, such as carbamazepine, and tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline and nortriptyline, are used to treat neuropathic pain. LOCAL ANESTHETICS Local anesthetics are commonly used to provide analgesia for procedures. They are effective in providing successful pain relief with only minimal risk of systemic adverse effects. However, local anesthetics such as lidocaine historically were not used in children because these drugs need to be injected. The belief was that children feared needles and use of a local anesthetic subjected the child to two needlesticks instead of one. Advances in technology have led to the development of improved methods of delivery such as topical ointments and iontophoresis for administration of local anesthetics, thereby promoting atraumatic care. (For a more detailed discussion, see the next section on drug administration methods and later in the chapter on the nurse's role in managing procedure- related pain.) Drug Administration Methods With any medication administered for pain management, the timing of administration is vital. Timing depends on the type of pain. For continuous pain, the current recommendation is to administer analgesia around the clock at scheduled intervals to achieve the necessary effect (Oakes, 2011). Scheduled dosing has been associated with decreased pain intensity ratings for children (Paice, Noskin, Vanagunas, & or PRN dosing is not recommended for continuous pain. This method can lead to inadequate pain relief because of the delay before the drug reaches its peak effectiveness, and as a result the child continues to experience pain, possibly necessitating a higher dose of analgesic to achieve relief. This then places the child at risk for overmedication and toxic effects.For pain that can be predicted or considered temporary, such as with a procedure, analgesia is administered so that the peak action of the drug matches the time of the painful event. There are various methods for administering pain medications to children. The preferred methods are the oral, rectal, intravenous, topical, or local nerve block routes. Epidural administration and moderate sedation also can be used. ORAL METHOD The oral method is often preferred because it is simple, easy, and convenient. The medication may be in the form of a pill, capsule, tablet, syrup, or elixir. Oral administration provides relatively steady blood levels of the drug when administered as a scheduled dose. Effectiveness typically occurs 1 to 2 hours after administration. As soon as possible, switch the child to oral dosing from parenteral dosing. However, keep in mind that higher doses of the oral medication may be needed to achieve the same effect. RECTAL METHOD The rectal method may be used when the child cannot take the medication orally, such as when he or she has difficulty swallowing or is experiencing nausea and vomiting. It is a viable alternative for drug administration. Some analgesics are available in suppository form. For others that are not, the drug can be compounded into a suppository form. The absorption rate varies with rectal administration, and children may find insertion of a suppository uncomfortable and embarrassing (Bowden & Greenberg, 2008). INTRAVENOUS METHOD Intravenous analgesia administration is the method of choice in emergency situations and when pain is severe and quick relief is needed. With intravenous administration, the drug usually takes effect within 5 minutes. Intravenous administration can be accomplished with bolus injections or continuous infusions. Continuous infusions may be preferred over bolus doses because steady blood levels are more easily maintained, thereby enhancing the drug's effect in relieving pain. Typically, opioids such as morphine, hydromorphone, and fentanyl are used due to their short half-life and decreased risk for toxicity. PATIENT-CONTROLLED ANALGESIA In patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) , a computerized pump is programmed to deliver an infusion of analgesics via a catheter inserted intravenously, epidurally, or subcutaneously. The analgesic may be given as a continuous infusion, as a continuous infusion supplemented by patient-delivered bolus doses, or as patient-delivered bolus doses only. Typically the child presses a button to administer a bolus dose. The pump has a lockout function that is preset with the dose and time interval. If the child presses the button before the preset time, he or she will not receive an overdose of medication. By delivering small, frequent doses of opioids, the child can experience pain relief without the effects of oversedation. The child also experiences a sense of control over the pain experience. Both the Institute for Safe Medical Practices (ISMP) and the Joint Commission have identified infants and young children as not being good candidates for PCA usage (D'Arcy, 2007). However, PCA has been used successfully in children as young as 5 or 6 years old (D'Arcy, 2007). It is essential to assess each child individually and consider his or her developmental level and psychosocial factors in determining appropriate PCA use. The child must have the necessary intellect, manual dexterity, and strength to operate the device. PCA has been used to control postoperative pain and the pain associated with trauma, cancer, and sickle cell crisis. It can be used in acute care settings or in the home. Most commonly, morphine, hydromorphone, and fentanyl are the drugs used with PCA. The dosage is based on the child's response. Dosages for infusions depend on the child's age, the opioid used, and the type of pain. A commonly used range for morphine infusion to treat postoperative pain ranges from 0.01 to 0.04 mg/kg/hour. Higher dosage ranges have been used to treat the pain associated with sickle cell crisis and cancer. Serious adverse events, such as oversedation, respiratory depression, and even death, can occur when family members, caregivers, or clinicians who are not authorized administer PCA doses \"by proxy\" (D'Arcy, 2007; The Joint Commission, 2004). The ISMP recommends developing specific criteria in any situation where authorized agent-activated PCA is being used (D'Arcy, 2007). Proper education and instruction are crucial in any situation where someone other than the child may be administering PCA doses. Thorough assessment is necessary to ensure the child's pain is neither undertreated nor overtreated. To ensure safety with PCA use, each institution must have policies and procedures in place, appropriate education of health care staff, quality control measures, and quality machines. LOCAL ANESTHETIC APPLICATION A local anesthetic may sometimes be used to alleviate the pain associated with procedures such as venipuncture, injections, wound repair, lumbar puncture, or accessing of implanted ports. Local anesthesia is a type of regional analgesia that blocks or numbs specific nerves in a region of the body. Medications called local anesthetics include topical forms, such as creams, agents delivered byiontophoresis, vapocoolants, and skin refrigerants, and injectable forms. Topical Forms. A common choice for effective, painless local anesthesia is EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics [lidocaine and prilocaine]). It achieves anesthesia to a depth of 2 to 4 mm, so it reduces pain of phlebotomy, venous cannulation, and intramuscular injections for up to 24 hours after the injection. However, it requires a 60- to 90-minute application time to intact skin using an occlusive dressing for superficial procedures and up to 2 to 3 hours for deeper, more invasive procedures ( Box 14.1 ). EMLA is approved for use in infants 37 weeks' gestation or older. Maximum dosage and maximum area of application are based on the child's weight. Parents can be taught how to apply the EMLA at home in preparation for a procedure ( Fig. 14.10 ). Sometimes EMLA is not used due to the expense and the time needed to allow the drug to act. New approaches to EMLA delivery have been developed. Examples include other drug formulations and a patch delivery with a heat-activated system (Synera) that enhances the delivery of lidocaine and prilocaine. Synera is labeled for children older than 3 years of age and needs to be applied only 20 to 30 minutes before the procedure. BOX 14.1 APPLYING EMLA Follow these guidelines when applying EMLA: Explain the purpose of the medication to the child and parents, reinforcing that it will help the pain go away. Check the scheduled time for the procedure; plan to apply the cream 60 minutes before a superficial procedure such as a heel stick or venipuncture or 2 to 3 hours before a deeper procedure such as a lumbar puncture or bone marrow aspiration. Place a thick layer of the cream on the skin at the intended site of the procedure, making sure that the area where the cream is being applied is free of any breaks. Do not rub the cream in once it is applied to the skin. Cover the site with a transparent dressing such as Tegaderm or Op-site and secure it so that the dressing is occlusive. Alternatively, use plastic film wrap and tape the edges to secure the dressing. Instruct the child not to touch the dressing once it is secured. If necessary, cover the occlusive dressing with a protection device or a loosely applied gauze or elastic bandage. After the allotted time, remove the occlusive dressing and wipe the cream from the skin. Inspect the skin for a change in color (blanching or redness), which indicates that the medication has penetrated the skin adequately. Verify that sensation is absent by lightly tapping or scratching the area. Use this technique also to demonstrate to the child that the anesthetic is effective. If sensation is present, reapply the cream. Prepare the child for the procedure. Assess the child's pain after the procedure to evaluate for pain and to differentiate pain from fear and anxiety. Take Note! EMLA is used with caution in children younger than 3 months and other susceptible persons because it may be associated with methemoglobinemia (Oakes, 2011; Zempsky, 2008). It is contraindicated or idiopathic methemoglobinemia ( OpenAnesthesia.org , 2011). It must be used cautiously in those younger than age 12 months who are receiving methemoglobin-inducing agents, such as sulfonamides, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and acetaminophen. Use of these agents in combination with EMLA increases the child's risk for methemoglobinemia, a condition that and OpenAnesthesia.org , 2011).FIGURE 14.10 A parent applies EMLA cream to the child at home in preparation for a procedure. TAC (tetracaine, epinephrine, cocaine) and LET (lidocaine, epinephrine, tetracaine) are other examples of topical anesthetics. These are commonly used for lacerations that require suturing. The agent is applied directly to the wound with a cotton ball or swab for 20 to 30 minutes until the area is numb. These methods are not used in children with known sensitivity to any of these medications. Lidocaine can also be dispersed in liposomes to is into the skin without the use of an occlusive dressing. Anesthesia to the area is reached in 15 to 30 minutes and lasts about 60 minutes. Recent studies suggest that the analgesic effect may be equal to that of EMLA with the advantage of a shorter onset (American Medical Association, 2010). Research has shown that liposomal lidocaine 4% cream was highly effective in reducing the pain associated with intravenous cannulation (Zempsky, 2008). The researchers cited a short onset of action (30 minutes) and minimal vascular effects as benefits. They found that the liposomal encapsulation protects the anesthetic from being metabolized too quickly (Zempsky, 2008). Study results have shown higher intravenous cannulation success rates, less pain, shorter total procedure time, and minor dermal changes among children (Taddio, Needle-free powder lidocaine (Zingo) is another topical analgesic. It is labeled for use in children 3 to 18 years of age. It is a single-use, prefilled disposable system that provides analgesia in 1 to 3 minutes. Studies have shown it to be safe and well tolerated with a rapid onset and significant reduction in needlestick pain (Zempsky et al., 2008). Another choice for local anesthesia is iontophoresis. Iontophoretic lidocaine (Numby Stuff) provides a deeper analgesia in a shorter duration (approximately 10 to 25 minutes) and is used over intact skin. A mild electrical current from a small battery-powered generator and two iontophoretic drug-delivery electrodes push drug molecules (lidocaine HCl 2% with epinephrine 1:100,000) into the skin. A mild tingling sensation may be felt during drug delivery, with an increase in tingling noted with higher currents. This type of local anesthesia is not recommended for use in children who have a history of allergy or sensitivity to these drugs, in children who have electrically sensitive equipment such as a pacemaker, or in children who have damaged skin or scar tissue. Vapocoolant spray, another type of local analgesia, can be sprayed onto the skin or administered using a cotton ball soaked in liquid. The depth of anesthesia is not known, but it appears to provide immediate pain control. It is inexpensive and requires no waiting time. The effect lasts for approximately 1 to 2 minutes. Studies have found it to be an effective analgesic for short-duration procedures (American Medical Association, 2010). Injectable Forms. Injectable forms of lidocaine or procaine can be administered subcutaneously or intradermally around the procedural area approximately 5 to 10 minutes before the procedure. Common problems with this form of anesthetic include the painassociated with the subcutaneous injection and some burning associated with lidocaine administration, as well as blanching of the skin. Take Note! The burning that lidocaine causes on injection may be diminished by buffering lidocaine with sodium bicarbonate, using 10 parts lidocaine and 1 part sodium bicarbonate (1 mL of 1% to 2% lidocaine and 0.1 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate). Then inject 0.1 mL or less of the solution intradermally at the site of venipuncture. Anesthetic action is almost immediate. The solution is stable for only approximately 1 week if not refrigerated. EPIDURAL ANALGESIA For epidural analgesia, a catheter is the epidural space at L1-L2, L3-L4, or L4-L5. The drug, usually fentanyl or morphine, diffuses into the cerebrospinal fluid and crosses the duramater to the spinal cord. Then it binds with the opioid receptors located at the dorsal horn. The drugs can be administered as bolus injections (a one-time bolus or on an intermittent schedule), a continuous infusion, or PCA. Usually an opioid, such as morphine, fentanyl, or hydromorphone, is given in conjunction with a long- acting local anesthetic such as bupivacaine. Epidural analgesia is typically used postoperatively, providing analgesia to the lower body for approximately 12 to 14 hours. The small amount of medication used with this type of analgesia causes less sedation, thereby allowing the child to participate more actively in postoperative care activities. This type of analgesia also is effective for children undergoing upper or lower abdominal surgeries because it controls localized intense pain, somatic pain, and visceral pain. When epidural analgesia is being administered, additional narcotic analgesics are not given in order to prevent complications such as respiratory depression, pruritus, nausea, vomiting, and urinary retention. Take Note! Respiratory depression, although rare when epidural analgesia is used, is always a possibility. When it does occur, it usually occurs gradually over a period of several hours after the medication is initiated. This allows adequate time for early detection and prompt intervention. Constant assessment is essential because insertion of an epidural catheter and epidural analgesia can lead to infection at the site of the insertion, epidural hematoma, arachnoiditis, neuritis, or spinal headache (rare) due to a cerebrospinal fluid leak and respiratory depression. Frequent assessment, typically every 1 to 2 hours, of heart rate, respiratory rate, and depth of sedation, and every 2 to 4 hours of blood pressure, pain level, and motor function, is imperative (Oakes, 2011). Assessing for adverse reactions such as nausea and vomiting and pruritus, checking the tubing and catheter site, and ensuring the occlusive dressing is intact are all important nursing interventions. The dermatome, which is the area of the body associated with supply by a particular nerve, that innervates the diaphragm can become suppressed during continuous epidural analgesia, resulting in respiratory depression. It is important to assess the child's sensory level frequently. Using cool water or an alcohol pad, bilaterally touch the child's body every 2 to 3 cm. The level where the child states he or she feels the temperature change is the level of anesthesia. (Refer to Figure 14.11 for dermatome levels.) MODERATE (CONSCIOUS) SEDATION Moderate sedation used to be labeled conscious sedation, but the term \"conscious\" has been replaced since it can be misleading (Krauss & Green, 2006). It is a medically controlled state of depressed consciousness that allows protective reflexes to be maintained so the child has the ability to maintain a patent airway and respond to physical or verbal stimulation. This procedure requires adherence to specific protocols, and many regulatory bodies, such as the Joint Commission, and societies, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Society of Anesthesiologists, and American College of Emergency Physicians, have published standards and guidelines to improve patient safety and outcomes (Krauss & Green, 2006). The depressed state is obtained by using various agents such as morphine, fentanyl, midazolam, chloral hydrate, or as pentobarbital. Midazolam and fentanyl often are the drugs of choice for moderate sedation because they act quickly, last only a short time, and are available in oral and intravenous formulations ( Box 14.2 ). Midazolam provides only sedative effects and no analgesia; therefore, it is commonly administered with an opioid.FIGURE 14.11 The level of anesthesia should not go higher than T4, the nipple line, in children. Take Note! The combination of meperidine (Demerol), promethazine (Phenergan), and chlorpromazine (Thorazine), commonly called DPT, is no longer recommended because it has been shown to cause excessive depression of the central nervous system, extrapyramidal reactions, and prolonged recovery times (Buck, 2010; American Academy of Pediatrics, 1995). in addition, the combination must be administered intramuscularly, which causes the child to experience more pain. BOX 14.2 ORAL FORMS OF MIDAZOLAM AND FENTANYL Two of the most commonly used agents for moderate sedation are midazolam and fentanyl. Each of these is available in an oral form, which promotes atraumatic care. Oral Midazolam Syrup Clear purplish-red cherry-flavored syrup Syrup containing 2 mg/mL Recommended dosage: 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg to a maximum dose of 20 mg Action usually within 10 to 20 minutes Major adverse effects: respiratory depression and arrest Fentanyl Oralet Oral transmucosal formulation Candy-type lozenge on a plastic holder Available in 200, 300, and 400 mcg Recommended dose: 5 to 15 mcg/kg Not recommended for use in children weighing less than 15 kg Onset of action in about 15 minutes of sucking lozenge; duration of action approximately 1 hour Take Note! Studies have found a high rate of complications, mainly vomiting and pruritus with transmucosal fentanyl, therefore limiting its usefulness (Klein et al., 2002). Moderate sedation is used for procedures that are painful and stressful. For example, moderate sedation is suggested instead of restraints, especially for toddlers and preschool children who are undergoing frightening or invasive procedures and who are manifesting extreme anxiety and behavioral upset. Other indications include situations involving: Evidence that the child is experiencing a heightened stress reaction (e.g., attempting to flee, crying inconsolably, or flailing) Verbalization by the child that he or she is frightened and does not want to be touched Inability to remain immobilized, such as during laceration repair or computed tomography Any procedure that is painful and fear provoking The route of administering the medications for sedation should follow the guidelines of atraumatic care. Oral, topical, or an existing intravenous route should be used. Personnel administering moderate sedation must be specially trained, and emergency equipment and medications must be readily available. The Nurse's Role in Pharmacologic Pain Management The nurse plays a major role in providing pharmacologic pain relief. As with any medication, the nurse is responsible for adhering to the rights of medication administration\u2014right drug, right dose, right route, right time, and right patient. In addition, the nurse also adheres to three additional rights\u2014the right of the child and parents to be educated, the right of the child to refuse the medication, and the right documentation. The nurse also must have a solid knowledge base about the medications used for pain relief. This knowledge includes information about the drug's pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) and pharmacodynamics (mechanism of action, including adverse effects). Refer to Chapter 13 for further information. Assessment is crucial when pharmacologic pain interventions are used. An initial assessment of pain provides a baseline from which options for relief can be chosen. Factors that can affect the choice of analgesic, such as the child's age, pain intensity, physiologic status, or previous experiences with pain, also need to be considered. The nurse acts as an advocate for the child and the family to ensure that the most appropriate pharmacologic agent is chosen for the situation. Assessment is ongoing once the agent is administered. Monitor physiologic parameters such as level of consciousness, vital signs, oxygen saturation levels, and urinary output for changes that might indicate an adverse reaction to the agent. More intensive monitoring is needed when agents are administered intravenously or epidurally or by moderate sedation. For example, if the child is receiving moderate sedation, interventions include: Ensuring that emergency equipment is readily available Maintaining a patent airway Monitoring the child's level of consciousness and responsiveness Assessing the child's vital signs (especially pulse rate, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate) Monitoring oxygen saturation levels Typically, a specially trained health care provider is specifically designated to perform these activities during the administration of the sedation. Afterwards, the nurse is responsible for ongoing monitoring of the child's status.Monitor the child closely for evidence of adverse effects. Table 14.7 describes the interventions useful for responding to these adverse effects. Be alert for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression secondary to opioid administration. Have an opioid antagonist the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (Romazicon) readily available should the child experience respiratory depression. In addition to assessing physiologic parameters, assess the child's and parents' emotional status before and after the agent is administered. For example, increased anxiety and fear may necessitate a change in method of administration, such as topical application instead of an intradermal injection of a local anesthetic. Use nonpharmacologic methods to help lessen anxiety, thereby promoting more effective relief from the drug. Nurses also are responsible for ensuring that the child and parents are adequately prepared for the use of the pharmacologic agent. Teach the child and parents about the drug, why it is being used, its intended effects, and possible adverse effects, tailoring the teaching to the child's cognitive level. Provide opportunities for the child and parents to ask questions, offering support and guidance throughout the experience. Provide a demonstration or use visual aids so that the child and parents know exactly what to expect. Encourage the use of play to help the child express fears and anxieties related to the administration. Management of Procedure-Related Pain One of the most common causes of pain in children is procedure-related pain. The procedure may be minor, such as an intramuscular injection, heel stick, or venipuncture, or it may be more involved, such as lumbar puncture, bone marrow aspiration, or wound care. Regardless, pain is real for children and painful procedures are often extremely distressing to them. Variables that affect pain include the intensity or length of the procedure and the skill of the health care provider performing the procedure. The Nurse's Role in Managing Procedure-Related Pain Through the use of behavioral and pharmacologic approaches, nurses can significantly reduce the pain and distress of procedures. Use the guiding principles of atraumatic care, which include the following: Use topical EMLA, iontophoretic lidocaine, vapocoolant spray, or buffered lidocaine at the intended site of a skin or vessel puncture. Incorporate the use of nonpharmacologic strategies for pain relief in conjunction with pharmacologic methods. Prepare the child and parents ahead of time about the procedure and then keep all equipment out of site until it is ready to be used. Use therapeutic hugging (see Chapter 8 ) to secure the child. Use the smallest-gauge needle possible or an automated lancet device to puncture the skin. Use an intermittent infusion device or peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) if multiple or repeated blood samples are necessary. Coordinate care so that several tests can be performed from one sample if possible. Opt for venipuncture in newborns instead of heel sticks if the amount of blood needed would require much squeezing. Use kangaroo care (skin-to-skin contact) for newborns before and after heel stick. Provide nonnutritive sucking, with sucrose solution, if appropriate; pacifier; or breastfeeding for newborns several minutes before the procedure. Take Note! Individualize interventions based on the painfulness of the procedure and the child's developmental age and personality. Use behavioral-cognitive approaches and pharmacologic interventions. For example, encouraging the school-age child to assist during painful procedures in age-appropriate ways may actually help ease some of the pain related to a heightened state of anxiety, or at least assist the child in coping with the situation. Always use appropriate pharmacologic treatment especially for the first procedure to provide as painless an experience as possible for the child. Nursing care for the child with procedure-related pain includes the child as well as the parents. Be sure to prepare them for the procedure using an appropriate developmental approach. Promote environmental comfort, too. Ensure that the child's privacy is maintained and that the lighting is adequate for the procedure but not so bright as to cause the child discomfort. Painful procedures performed in the child's room can lead to an association of pain or fear with the room or bed. Many hospitals have a special treatment room where procedures can be performed. These rooms are usually equipped with many activities, toys, and decorations to help distract the child. The use of a treatment room may not be feasible or desirable in all situations or for all procedures. The ultimate goal is to do what is best for the child; therefore, the nurse needs to consider the needs of the child, the demands of the procedures, and the conditions that would facilitate the best outcome. Unless contraindicated, encourage the parents to be present before, during, and after the procedure to provide comforting support to the child. Also encourage the child and parents to use nonpharmacologic methods to help maximize pain relief and reduce anxiety. For example, nonpharmacologic methods that are helpful for the toddler and preschooler may include positioning the child on the lap and hugging the child, distracting the child with toys or interactive books, and blowing bubbles. Play therapy can be useful when preparing children for painful procedures. Encourage children to make decisions about their care related to pain management if their condition or procedure allows. It is also helpful to anticipate and recognize painful situations and provide pain medication before the actual procedure to ensure comfort. Many nonpharmacologic strategies can be enhanced and better implemented with the help of the child life specialist or play therapist, who have specialized training in these techniques. Recall Aiden from the beginning of the chapter. What are some interventions that may be helpful prior to, during, and after his dressing change? Management of Chronic Pain Typically, pain in children is acute pain, but chronic pain is a significant problem in the pediatric population. Historically, chronic pain was defined by the duration of the pain, such as longer than 3 to 6 months. However, research has identified elements associated with chronic pain as occurring much earlier in time (American Pain Society, 2001). Currently, chronic pain is identified as the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and environmental factors (American Pain Society, 2001). According to the American Pain Society (2001), children with chronic pain and their families experience significant emotional and social consequences from the pain and disability; also, the experience of chronic pain in childhood may predispose the individual to chronic pain in adulthood. The Nurse's Role in Managing Chronic Pain The nurse's role in managing chronic pain in children is similar to that for the child experiencing acute pain or procedure-related pain. Assessment of the child's pain is key and should include a history of the present problem. Questions should focus on the onset of the pain; its intensity, duration, and location; and any factors that alleviate or exacerbate it. In addition, it is important to question the child and parents about the impact of the pain on the child's daily life, such as sleep, play, eating, school, and interactions with peers, other family members, and friends. Also address the impact of the child's chronic pain on the family's life. Another key area of assessment is determining how the pain affects the child's and family's level of stress. Areas to address include the child's and parents' feelings of hopelessness, anxiety, and depression. Also question the child and parents about what they think has caused the pain and how they have coped with it. In addition, ascertain what methods the child and parents have used to alleviate the pain and the success of these methods. Inquire about any home remedies or alternative therapies that may have been used. Review past physical examination findings for clues to the underlying problem. Observe the child's overall appearance, gait, and posture. Assess the child's cognitive level and emotional response, especially related to the experience of pain. Expect to complete a neurologic examination and observe for muscle spasms, trigger points, and increased sensitivity to light touch. Abnormal body postures assumed by the child due to chronic pain may result in the development of secondary pain in the muscles and fascia. When children tense their muscles due to fear of examination, somatic pain may occur. Various nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies are used to manage chronic pain. Often multiple strategies are combinedto address pain relief as well as the pain's impact on other areas, such as sleep or school functioning. When pharmacologic agents are used, the oral form is the method of choice. As with any pain management strategy, education of the child and family is paramount. A referral to a pediatric pain specialist may be needed if the child's pain is not controlled effectively. KEY CONCEPTS Pain is a highly individualized subjective experience affecting persons of any age. It is a universal experience and is considered the fifth vital sign. Pain management is a critical element in a child's plan of care because children may lack the verbal capacity to describe their pain experience; caregivers and health care providers often have misconceptions about pain; assessment of the complex nature of the pain experience is difficult; if left unmanaged, pain in children can lead to serious physical and emotional consequences; and available resources and research related to pain relief strategies in children are limited. The sensation of pain involves a sequence of physiologic events: transduction, transmission, perception, and modulation. Pain can be classified by duration as acute or chronic, by etiology as nociceptive or neuropathic, or by source or location as somatic or visceral. Factors influencing a child's perception of pain include age and gender, cognitive level, temperament, previous pain experiences, and family and cultural background, all of which cannot be changed. Situational factors involve behavioral, cognitive, and emotional aspects and can be changed. Infants, including preterm infants, experience pain. Behavioral and physiologic indicators are used to assess pain. Toddlers commonly react with intense emotional upset and physical resistance or aggression. Preschoolers may feel that pain is a punishment for misbehaving or having bad thoughts. School-age children can communicate the type, location, and severity of pain but may deny having pain to appear brave or avoid further pain. Adolescents, with their focus on body image and fear of loss of control, often ask numerous questions and may attempt to remain stoic to avoid being viewed as childish. Assessment of pain in children includes both subjective and objective data. Nurses need to tailor the assessment to the child's developmental level and ask appropriate questions geared to the child's cognitive level. Parental questioning during the health history also is important. Self-report pain rating scales are valuable assessment tools that allow the child's level of pain to be quantified. Examples include the FACES pain rating scale, the Oucher pain rating scale, the poker chip tool, the word-graphic rating scale, visual analog and numeric scales, and the Adolescent Pediatric Pain Tool. Different pain rating scales are appropriate for different developmental levels. However, children may regress when in pain, so a simpler tool may be needed to make sure that the child understands what is being asked. Consistency in using the same tool is essential so that appropriate comparisons can be made and effective interventions can be planned and implemented. Physical examination of the child for pain primarily involves the skills of observation and inspection. These skills are used to assess for physiologic and behavioral changes that indicate pain. Auscultation also may be used to assess for changes in vital signs, specifically heart rate and blood pressure. Physiologic and behavioral pain assessment tools, such as the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale, Riley Infant Pain Scale, Pain Observation Scale for Young Children, CRIES Scale for Neonatal Postoperative Pain Assessment, and FLACC Behavioral Scale for Postoperative Pain in Young Children, measure specific parameters and changes that would indicate that the child is in pain. Nonpharmacologic pain management strategies aim to assist children in coping with pain and to give them a sense of mastery or control over the situation. These strategies may be categorized as behavioral-cognitive, in which the child focuses on a specific area or aspect rather than the pain (e.g., relaxation, distraction, imagery, biofeedback, thought stopping, and positive self-talk), or biophysical, in which the focus is on interfering with the transmission of pain impulses reaching the brain (e.g., heat and cold applications, massage and pressure). The nurse plays a major role in teaching the child and family about available nonpharmacologic pain interventions, helping them choose the most appropriate and most effective methods, and ensuring that the child and parents use the method before the pain occurs as well as before it increases. Pharmacologic interventions involve the administration of drugs for pain relief, most commonly nonopioids and opioid analgesics. The selection of the method is determined by the drug being administered; the child's status; the type, intensity, and location of the pain; and any factors that may be influencing the child's pain. The preferred methods for administering analgesics include the oral, rectal, intravenous, or local nerve block routes; epidural administration; and moderate sedation. Nonopioid analgesics used to treat mild to moderate pain include acetaminophen and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, the \"gold standard\" for all opioid agonists; it is the drug to which all other opioids are compared and isusually the drug of choice for severe pain (Oakes, 2011). Local anesthetics are commonly used to provide analgesia for procedures. They are effective in providing successful pain relief with only minimal risk of systemic adverse effects. The first choice for the most effective, painless local anesthesia is EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics [lidocaine and prilocaine]). It achieves anesthesia to a depth of 2 to 4 mm, so it reduces pain of phlebotomy, venous cannulation, and intramuscular injections up to 24 hours after injection. Epidural analgesia involves the insertion of a catheter into the epidural space through which drugs can be administered as bolus injections (a one-time bolus or on an intermittent schedule), as a continuous infusion, or as PCA. Usually an opioid, such as morphine, fentanyl, or hydromorphone, is given in conjunction with a long-acting local anesthetic, such as bupivacaine. Moderate sedation is a medically controlled state of depressed consciousness that allows protective reflexes to be maintained so the child has the ability to maintain a patent airway and respond to physical or verbal stimulation. When providing pharmacologic pain relief, the nurse must adhere to the five rights of medication administration and have a solid knowledge base about the medications used for pain relief and the drug's pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) and pharmacodynamics (mechanism of action, including adverse effects). Initial and ongoing assessment is crucial. The principles of atraumatic care guide nursing interventions for providing pain relief, especially for procedure-related pain. Chronic pain in children can significantly affect the child's daily life and activities as well as the family's life. REFERENCES American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Pain Society. (2001).

His mother tells you, \"He's been very irritable and crying more than usual.\"Infectious and communicable diseases are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. As the world has become increasingly connected, infectious diseases have presented new challenges. Children are particularly vulnerable to these types of illnesses. Their immune systems are still developing and their natural curiosity, especially in infants and toddlers, leads to wide-range handling of objects and surfaces coupled with a tendency to place their hands and objects in their mouths without washing first. Infectious diseases in children can range in severity from mild with few or no symptoms to serious illness, such as damage to organs, and even death. Infectious and communicable diseases include bacterial infections (e.g., sepsis), viral infections (e.g., viral exanthems and rabies), zoonotic infections, vector-borne infections, and sexually transmitted infections (e.g., chlamydia and gonorrhea). There has been a dramatic decrease in the incidence and severity of infectious and communicable diseases since the advent of vaccines, antibiotics, antiviral drugs, and antitoxins (Global Health Council, 2011). Some diseases have been effectively controlled, but the vast majority will not be eliminated. New diseases emerge and old diseases are reappearing, sometimes in a drug-resistant form. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tracks certain infectious diseases. This list of nationally reportable diseases is revised periodically to add new pathogens or remove diseases as their incidence declines. Reporting by each state to the CDC is voluntary. Therefore, slight variations exist from state to state. Box 15.1 lists nationally reportable diseases. BOX Chlamydia trachomatis Diphtheria Ehrlichiosis Gonorrhea Hepatitis A, B, and C Influenza (pediatric mortality) Lyme disease Malaria Measles Meningococcus Mumps Pertussis Poliomyelitis, paralytic Q fever Rabies Rocky Mountain spotted fever (spotted fever rickettsiosis) Rubella Streptococcal disease, invasive group A Syphilis Tetanus Tuberculosis Varicella (morbidity) Varicella (deaths only) For a complete list of nationally notifiable diseases in the United States, go to http://www.cdc.gov/osels/ph_surveillance/nndss/phs/infdis2011.htm Nurses, particularly those working in schools, child care centers, and outpatient settings, are often the first to see the signs of infectious or communicable diseases in children. These signs are often vague at first (e.g., a sore throat or rash). Therefore, nurses must have accurate assessment skills and be familiar with the signs and symptoms of common childhood infectious diseases so that they can provide prompt recognition, treatment, guidance, and support to families. Identifying the infectious agent is of primary importance to prevent further spread. Many infectious diseases can be prevented through simple and inexpensive methods such as hand washing, adequate immunization, proper handling and preparation of food, and judicious antibiotic use. Nurses play a key role in educating parents and the community on ways to prevent infectious and communicable diseases.HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov .INFECTIOUS PROCESS Infection occurs when an organism enters the body and multiplies, causing damage to the tissues and cells. The body's response to this damage due to infection or injury is inflammation. The body delivers fluid, blood, and nutrients to the area of infection or injury and attempts to eliminate the pathogens and repair the tissues. The body does this through vascular and cellular reactions. The vascular response is an initial period of vasoconstriction followed by vasodilatation. This vasodilatation allows for the increase of fluids, blood, and nutrients to the area. The cellular response involves the arrival of white blood cells (WBCs) to the area. WBCs are the body's defense against infection or injury. The types of WBCs are neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. Elevations in certain portions of the WBC count reflect different processes occurring in the body, such as infection, allergic reaction, or leukemia. Table 15.1 explains the function of each type of WBC. Each type is generally present in a balanced state; the types are reported as a percentage of the total WBC count or as the number per certain volume of blood. WBCs use phagocytosis to ingest and destroy the pathogen . If bacteria escape the action of phagocytosis, they enter the bloodstream and lymph system and the immune system is activated. With activation of the immune system, B lymphocytes (humoral immunity) and T lymphocytes (cell-mediated immunity) are matured and activated. B and T cells recognize and attack infectious pathogens. B cells, which mature in the bone marrow, produce specific antibodies to a specific offending antigen (a substance that the body recognizes as foreign). T cells, which mature in the thymus, attack the antigen directly. Once B and T cells have been exposed to an antigen, some cells will remember the antigen. Therefore, if the particular antigen invades again, the body will act more quickly. A third type of lymphocyte, natural killer cells are a part of the innate immune system and function to destroy foreign material present. Fever Infection or inflammation caused by bacteria, viruses, or other pathogens stimulates the release of endogenous pyrogens (interleukins, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon). The pyrogens act on the hypothalamus, where they trigger prostaglandin production and increase the body's temperature set point. This triggers the cold response, resulting in shivering, vasoconstriction, and a decrease in peripheral perfusion to help decrease heat loss and allow the body's temperature to rise to the new set point. Fever, defined as a temperature greater than 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), then occurs. Box 15.2 gives specific temperature parameters for fever based on what route is used for measurement. Antipyretics are often used to lower fever and increase comfort. They decrease the temperature set point by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins. As a result, sweating and vasodilation occur and there is heat loss and a drop in temperature. It is important to distinguish between fever and hyperthermia. Hyperthermia occurs when normal thermoregulation fails, resulting in an unregulated rise in core temperature. Hyperthermia may occur if the central nervous system of the child becomes impaired by disease, drugs, and abnormalities of heat production or thermal stressors, such as being left in a hot automobile or exertional heat stroke. In the absence of hyperthermia and in the normally neurologic child, the body does not allow fever to rise to lethal levels. The body actually produces a natural antipyretic, called cryogen. If there is no hyperthermic insult, it is rare to see a child's temperaturerise above 41.4\u00b0C (106\u00b0F) (Crocetti & Serwint, 2005). BOX Infectious Disease Infectious diseases follow a similar pattern. They progress through certain stages ( Table 15.2 ) in which communicability (ability to spread to others) can be predicted. It is important for nurses to understand these stages to help control and manage infectious diseases. Chain of Infection The chain of infection is the process by which an organism is spread. Behaviors of infants and young children, mainly pertaining to hygiene, increase their risk for infection by promoting the chain of infection. Poor hygiene habits, including lack of hand washing, placing toys and hands in the mouth, drooling, and leaking diapers, all can contribute to the spread of infection and communicable diseases. Table 15.3 reviews the chain of infection and nursing implications related to it. Preventing the Spread of Infection Nurses play a key role in breaking the chain of infection and preventing the spread of diseases. It is important to follow infection control and prevention practices. It is also very important to educate parents and children on the measures they can take to prevent the spread of infection. Take Note! Frequent hand washing is the most important way to prevent the spread of infection. Isolation precautions help nurses break the chain of infection and provide strategies to prevent the spread of pathogens among hospitalized children. Guidelines can be found on the CDC website ( http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/2007IP/2007isolationPrecautions.html ). Additional guidelines are available from various infection control societies and regulatory agencies such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The Joint Commission has also developed infection control standards. This leads to an array of complex guidelines that all health professionals need to be familiar with. The Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) has presented guidelines for hospitalized children that include two tiers (Siegel, Rhinehart, Jackson, Chiarello, and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee, 2007). Tier 1 is standard precautions, which are designed for the care of all children in the hospital regardless of their diagnosis. Tier 2 is transmission-based precautions, designed for children who are known, or suspected, to be infected with epidemiologically importantpathogens. These pathogens can be spread by air-borne, droplet, or contact transmission. Box 15.3 gives an overview of standard and transmission-based precautions. Take Note! Hand hygiene includes both hand washing with soap and water and the use of alcohol-based products (gels, rinses, foams) that do not require water. If there is no visible soiling of the hands, approved alcohol-based products are preferred because of their superior microbicidal activity, reduced drying of the skin, and convenience (World Health Organization, 2009). When caring for children, these guidelines may need to be modified. For instance, diaper changing is routine in the pediatric setting. Since it does not usually soil hands, it is not mandatory to wear gloves (except if gloves are required due to transmission-based precautions). According to the standard precaution guidelines, single rooms are required for those who are incontinent and cannot control bodily excretions. Since the majority of young children are incontinent, obviously this guideline is inappropriate in the pediatric setting. Pediatric units often have common rooms, such as playrooms and schoolrooms. Children placed on transmission-based isolation are not allowed to leave their rooms and therefore are not allowed to use these common rooms. VARIATIONS IN PEDIATRIC ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY Normal immune function is an amazing protective response by the body. It involves complex responses including phagocytosis, humoral immunity, cellular immunity, and activation of the complement system. Blood and lymph are responsible for transporting the agents of the immune system. Due to the immature responses of the immune system, infants and young children are more susceptible to infection. The newborn displays a decreased inflammatory response to invading organisms, contributing to an increased risk for infection. Cellular immunity is generally functional at birth, and humoral immunity occurs when the body encounters and then develops immunity to new diseases. Since the infant has had limited exposure to disease and is losing the passive immunity acquired from maternal antibodies, the risk of infection is higher. Young children continue to have an increased risk for infection and communicable disorders because disease protection from immunizations is not complete. (Refer to Chapter 9 for further details.) BOX 15.3 STANDARD PRECAUTIONS AND ISOLATION PRECAUTIONS Standard Precautions (Tier One) Apply to all children Apply to all body fluids, secretions, and excretions except sweat, nonintact skin, and mucous membranes Designed to reduce the risk of transmission of microorganisms from recognized and unrecognized sources Techniques include: Proper hand hygiene Use of gloves (clean or sterile) when touching blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions, and contaminated items Masks, eye protection, and face shields when patient care may include splashing or sprays of blood, body fluid secretions, or excretions, and during bronchoscopy, endotracheal intubation, of the respiratory tract Fluid-resistant nonsterile gowns, to protect skin and clothing, when patient care may include splashing or sprays of blood, body fluid secretions, or excretions Patient care equipment handled in a manner that prevents skin or mucous membrane exposure and contamination of clothing All used linen is considered contaminated and needs to be handled and disposed of appropriately. Mouthpieces, resuscitation bags with one-way valves, and other ventilation devices should be readily available. Cleaning and disinfecting noncritical surfaces in patient care areas Respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette: applies to any person with signs of illness including cough, congestion, rhinorrhea, or increased respiratory secretions that is entering a health care facility. It includes education regarding covering the mouth/nose with a tissue; prompt disposal of used tissues, along with surgical masks used by a person who is coughing when appropriate; hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions; and separation, ideally greater than 3 feet, of persons with respiratory infections in common waiting areas when possible. Safe injection practices: use of sterile single-use disposable needle. When possible use of single-dose vials; precautions used to prevent injury when using, cleaning, or disposing of needles and sharps Use of masks for insertion of catheters or injection into the spinal or epidural space via lumbar puncture procedures Transmission-Based Precautions (Tier Two) Designed for children with known or suspected infection with pathogens for which additional precautions are warranted to interrupt transmission Air-Borne Designed to reduce the risk of infectious agents transmitted by air-borne droplet nuclei or dust particles that may contain the infectious agent Examples of such illnesses include measles, varicella, and tuberculosis. Techniques include standard precautions as well as: Room with negative air pressure ventilation, with air externally exhausted or high-efficiency particulate air filtered if recirculated; if unavailable, mask the child and place in private room with the door closed. Wear a mask or respirator depending on specific recommendations based on disease, such as if infectious pulmonary tuberculosis is suspected or proven, wear a respiratory protective device, such as an N95 respirator, while in the child's room. Susceptible health care personnel should not enter the room of children with measles or varicella zoster infections. Those withproven immunity to these viruses need not wear a mask. Droplet Intended to prevent transmission of pathogens spread through close respiratory or mucous membrane contact with respiratory secretions. Designed to reduce the risk of infectious agents transmitted by contact of the conjunctivae or the mucous membranes of the nose or mouth of a susceptible person with large-particle droplets containing pathogens generated from a person (generally through coughing, sneezing, talking, or procedures such as suctioning) who has a clinical disease or who is a carrier of the disease Examples of such illnesses include diphtheria, pertussis, streptococcal group A, influenza, mumps, rubella, and scarlet fever. Techniques include standard precautions as well as: Private room (if unavailable, consider cohorting children with the same disease. If this is not possible, separation of at least 3 feet between other children and visitors should be maintained.) Wear a mask if within 3 feet of the child. Contact Most important and most common route of transmission of health care-associated infections Designed to reduce the risk of infectious agents transmitted by direct or indirect contact. Direct-contact transmission involves skin-to-skin contact and physical transfer of pathogens between a susceptible host and an infected or colonized person. Examples include patient care activities that involve physical contact such as turning and bathing. Direct-contact transmission also can occur between two children, where one serves as the source of infectious pathogen and the other as a susceptible host. Indirect-contact transmission involves contact of a susceptible host with a contaminated intermediate object, usually inanimate, in the child's environment. Examples of such illnesses include diphtheria, a pediculosis, scabies, and multidrug-resistant bacteria. Techniques include standard precautions as well as: Private room (if unavailable, consultation with infection control personnel is recommended. Consider cohorting children with the same disease. If this is not possible, separation of at least 3 feet between other children and visitors should be maintained.) Gloves (clean or sterile) should be used at all times. Proper hand hygiene after glove removal Use gloves and gowns for all interactions that involve contact with the child or potentially contaminated areas. Don before entering and remove before leaving the child's room. Prevention standards are applied in all health care settings and are modified to meet each setting's unique needs. Health care workers must practice within the specific institution's guidelines. a Certain infections require more than one precaution. Adapted from Siegel, J. D., Rhinehart, E., Jackson, M., Chiarello, L., and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee. (2007).

Retrieved on June 8, 2011, from http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/isolation/Isolation2007.pdfCOMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS A variety of medications and other medical treatments are used to treat infectious disorders in children. Most of these treatments will require a physician's or nurse practitioner's order when the child is in the hospital. The most common treatments and medications are listed in Common Medical Treatments 15.1 and Drug Guide 15.1 . The nurse caring for the child with an infectious disorder should be familiar with what the procedures are, how they work, and common nursing implications related to use of these modalities. NURSING PROCESS OVERVIEW FOR THE CHILD WITH AN INFECTIOUS OR COMMUNICABLE DISORDER Care of the child with an infectious or communicable disorder includes assessment, nursing diagnosis, planning, interventions, and evaluation. There are a number of general concepts related to the nursing process that may be applied to the care of children with infectious disorders. From a general understanding of the care involved for a child with an infectious disorder, the nurse can then individualize the care based on the child's specifics. Remember Samuel, the 3-month-old with fever, congestion, and irritability? What additional health history and physical examination assessment information should you obtain? Assessment Assessment of the child with a communicable or infectious disorder includes health history, physical examination, and laboratory and diagnostic testing. Health History The health history consists of the past medical history, including the mother's pregnancy history; family history; and history of present illness (when the symptoms started and how they have progressed), as well as treatments used at home. The past medical history might be significant for lack of recommended immunizations, prematurity, maternal infection during pregnancy or labor, prolonged difficult delivery, or immunocompromise. Family history might be significant for lack of immunization or recent infectious or communicable disease. When eliciting the history of the present illness, inquire about the following: Any known exposure to infectious or communicable disease Immunization history History of having any common childhood communicable diseases Fever Sore throat Lethargy Malaise Poor feeding or decreased appetite Vomiting Diarrhea Cough Rash (in the older child ask for a description [i.e., Is it painful? Does it itch?) Take Note! Many childhood infections and communicable diseases involve a rash. Rashes can be difficult to identify. Therefore, it is important to obtain a thorough description and history from the caregiver. Physical Examination Physical examination of the child with an infectious disorder includes inspection, observation, and palpation. INSPECTION AND OBSERVATION Begin the physical examination with inspection and observation. Assess the child's skin, mouth, throat, and hair for lesions or wounds. Note the color, shape, and distribution of any lesions or wounds. Assess whether there is any exudate from the lesions or wounds. A thorough and accurate description is important to assist in identifying the rash and causative organism. Observe for scratching, restlessness, avoidance of the use of a body part, or guarding of a body part. Observe the child's affect, energy level, and interaction with caregivers. Lethargy can indicate serious infection or sepsis. Observe if there is any discharge from the nose, cough, or respiratory difficulty. Assess hydration status. Inspect the oral mucosa; dry and pale mucous membranes can indicate dehydration. Observe for other signs of dehydration, such as sunken eyes and no tears with crying. Assessment of vital signs can provide more information about the child's condition. Elevated temperature can indicate infection. Often tachypnea and tachycardia accompany fever. Hypotension may also occur, but it is usually a late sign with sepsis. Take Note! Neonates may not present with fever; some (Anderson-Berry, Bellig, & Ohning, 2010). PALPATION Palpate the skin to assess temperature, moisture, texture, and turgor. In a child with an infectious or communicable disease, the skin may be warm and moist due to fever. Turgor may be decreased secondary to dehydration. In infants, palpate the fontanels; if they are sunken, the infant may be dehydrated. Palpate the rash to determine if it is raised or flat. A thorough picture of the presenting rash can help identify the child's illness. Palpate the lymph nodes and note any that are swollenand tender. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 15.1 discusses the tests used most commonly when communicable disorders are suspected. The tests can assist the physician or nurse practitioner in diagnosing the disorder and/or be used as guidelines in determining ongoing treatment. Laboratory or nonnursing personnel obtain some of the tests, while the nurse might obtain others. In either instance the nurse should be familiar with how the tests are obtained, what they are used for, and normal versus abnormal results. This knowledge will also be necessary when providing child and family education related to the testing. OBTAINING BLOOD SPECIMENS Giving a blood specimen may be very frightening to children because of the fear of needles, pain, and blood loss. Provide atraumatic care when performing venipunctures and other needlesticks in children (refer to Chapter 8 for further information). Whether the laboratory technician or the nurse is drawing the blood, the procedure should be performed in an area other than the child's bed, such as the treatment room; the child's bed should be kept as a \"safe\" area. Provide teaching about the procedure based on the child's developmental level and readiness to learn. In infants and younger children, additional assistance with positioning and restraint will be needed to perform the procedure safely and to ensure proper collection. Use a topical anesthetic cream or gel, refrigerant spray, or iontophoresis before venipuncture. In young infants, administer oral sucrose beginning 1 to 2 minutes before the procedure and throughout the course of the venipuncture (Hatfield, Chang, Bittle, Deluca, & Polomano, 2011). Refer to Chapter 14 for additional information about decreasing venipuncture-related pain in infants and children. The usual sites for obtaining blood specimens via venipuncture are the superficial veins of the dorsal surface of the hand or the antecubital fossa, although other locations may also be used. In specific situations, the jugular or femoral vein may be used; in this case either the physician or nurse practitioner will perform the venipuncture. Capillary puncture of the child's fingertip, the great toe, or the infant's heel may also be used to obtain blood specimens. Fingertip puncture is similar to that in the adult, directed to the sides of the fingertip. Great toe puncture is performed in the same way. Capillary heel puncture must be performed in the proper location to avoid striking the medial plantar artery or periosteum (see Nursing Procedure 15.1 ). Automatic lancet devices can be used to deliver a more precise puncture depth (Folk, 2007). A traumatic Care The young infant will benefit from the use of oral sucrose via pacifier before and during the capillary puncture (Hatfield et al, 2011). Occasionally, blood samples may be obtained from an artery rather than a vein or capillary. Blood gases in particular are usually obtained by arterial puncture. Arterial puncture requires additional training and in many institutions is performed only by the respiratory therapist, physician, or nurse practitioner. Children with indwelling venous access devices may be spared the trauma of puncture for blood specimens. Follow your institution's guidelines for withdrawing blood from peripherally inserted venous catheters or central venous catheters. The initial blood will be discarded to prevent contamination with intravenous fluids or medications such as heparin. The amount discarded depends on the size of the catheter, the weight of the child, and the institution's guidelines. After aspirating the specimen, flush the venous access device with normal saline to prevent clogging. The device may then be reconnected to the intravenous fluid or flushed according to the institution's protocol. Nursing Diagnoses, Goals, Interventions, and Evaluations After completing a thorough assessment, the nurse might identify several nursing diagnoses, including: Risk for imbalanced body temperature Impaired comfort Impaired skin integrity Risk for infection Deficient fluid volume Social isolation Deficient knowledge (specify) After completing an assessment of Samuel, you note the following: rectal temperature of 39\u00b0C, poor sucking, and lethargy. Based on these assessment findings, what would your top three nursing diagnoses be for Samuel? Nursing goals, interventions, and evaluation for the child with a communicable or infectious disorder are based on the nursing diagnoses. Nursing Care Plan 15.1 provides a general guide for planning care for a child with an infectious or communicable disorder. Additional information about nursing management will be included later in the chapter as it relates to specific disorders. Managing Fever Fever in their children is one of the most common reasons parents seek medical attention (Sullivan, Far-rar, & the AAP's Section on Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, and Committee on Drugs, 2011). Most infections or communicable diseases are accompanied by fever. Many parents have great concerns about fever. For example, they fear febrile seizures, neurologic complications, and a potential serious underlying disease. Many health care providers share these fears. This leads to the common recommendation to intervene and reduce fever. These fears and misconceptions about fever can lead to mismanagement of fever, such as inappropriate dosing of antipyretics, awakening the child during sleep to give antipyretics, or inappropriate use of nonpharmacologic treatments such as sponging the child with alcohol or cold water (Crocetti & Serwint, 2005; Sullivan et al., 2011). It is important to educate parents that fever is a protective mechanism the body uses to fight infection. Evidence exists that an elevated body temperature actually enhances various components of the immune response (Crocetti & Serwint, 2005; Sullivan et al., 2011). Fever can slow the growth of bacteria and viruses and increase neutrophil production and T-cell proliferation (Crocetti & Serwint, 2005). Studies have shown that the use of antipyretics may prolong illness (Crocetti & Serwint, 2005; Sullivan et al., 2011. Another concern is that reducing fever may hide signs of serious bacterial illness (Crocetti & Serwint, 2005; Sullivan et al., 2011). Take Note! Infants younger than 3 months of age with a rectal temperature greater than 38>\u00b0C should be seen by a physician or nurse practitioner. They are considered at risk for sepsis until proven otherwise due to their immature immune system and inability to localize or handle infection very well (Powell, 2007a). In infants older than 3 months of age, fever less than 39\u00b0C usually does not require treatment (Powell, 2007b). Antipyretics provide symptomatic relief but do not change the course of the infection. The major benefits of decreasing fever are increasing comfort in the child and decreasing fluid requirements, which helps to prevent dehydration. Children with certain underlying conditions, such as cardiovascular disease or pulmonary disease, also benefit from treating fever because such treatment decreases demands on the body. HOME MANAGEMENT OF FEVER Fever is typically managed at home, so it is important to give guidance and instruction at well-child visits and review this information at subsequent visits. Written and video materials about fever management may be effective in increasing caregivers' knowledge. Parents can refer to the written instructions when needed (see Teaching Guidelines 15.1 ). The use of acetaminophen or ibuprofen to reduce fever in children has been shown to be safe and effective when the appropriate dose is administered at the appropriate interval (Crocetti & Serwint, 2005). However, some studies have shown that ibuprofen is superior in reducing fever faster and lasts longer than acetaminophen (Walling, 2009). Box 15.4 gives dosing recommendations for both medications. Take Note! Never give aspirin to children to reduce fever, due to the risk of Reye syndrome. CAUTIONS ABOUT ACETAMINOPHEN USE Acetaminophen is widely used and accepted, but toxic reactions can be seen in children (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009). Causes of acetaminophen toxicity include overdosing or incorrect dosing due to failure to read and understand the label instructions, use of an incorrect measuring device or concentration, and coadministration with an over- the-counter fixed-dose combination medication (the parent may not recognize that it has acetaminophen in it). Another factor that may cause acetaminophen toxicity is the controversial, but common, practice of alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen to help reduce fever. Studies of the use of alternating acetaminophen with ibuprofen have had conflicting results (Walling, 2009). This practice can result in overdose or improper administration. It can be hard for parents to keep track of the time each medication is due. Parents may confuse which medication is given every 4 hours and which is given every 6 hours. They may exceed the recommended daily doses or may confuse the strength or dosage of the medicines. See Evidence-Based Practice 15.1 . Managing Skin Rashes Skin rashes accompany many infectious or communicable diseases. These rashes can be very uncomfortable and irritating for the child. Management often occurs at home, so it is important to educate parents on ways to relieve the discomfort and protect and maintain skin integrity. The physician may prescribe anti-pruritics, including oral medications or topical creams or ointments (see Drug Guide 15.1 ). Instruct parents on the importance of maintaining skin integrity to prevent infection or scarring. Teach parents to keep their child's fingernails short and hands clean. Explain the importance of discouraging scratching, and discuss distraction techniques they can use with the child. Cool compresses or cool baths can relieve itching. Encourage the child to press on rather than scratch the itchy area; this can relieve discomfort while maintaining skin integrity. Refer to Chapter 24 for more information on managing skin rashes. Based on your top three nursing diagnoses for Samuel, describe appropriate nursing interventions. COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS 15.1 DRUG GUIDE 15.1 COMMON DRUGS FOR COMMUNICABLE DISORDERSCOMMON LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS 15.1 NURSING PROCEDURE 15.1 Capillary Heel Puncture 1. Choose the collection site and apply a commercial heel warmer or warm pack for several minutes prior to specimen collection. 2. Assemble equipment: Gloves Automatic lancet Antiseptic wipe Cotton ball or dry gauze Capillary blood collection tube Band-aid 3. Perform hand hygiene and don gloves. Remove the warm pack. 4. Cleanse the site with antiseptic prep pad and allow to dry. 5. Hold the dorsum of the foot with the nondominant hand; with the dominant hand, pierce the heel with the lancet. Place the extremity in the dependent position. 6. Wipe away the first drop of blood with the cotton ball or dry gauze.7. Collect the blood specimen with a capillary specimen collection tube. Avoid squeezing the foot during specimen collection if possible, as it may contribute to hemolysis of the specimen. 8. Hold dry gauze over the site until bleeding stops, elevate extremity above the level of the heart, and then apply a Band-aid. NURSING CARE PLAN 15.1 Overview for the Child With an Infectious or Communicable Disorder NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for imbalanced body temperature: fever related to infectious disease process as evidenced by rectal temperature greater than 38\u00b0C or 100.4\u00b0F Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will maintain temperature within adaptive levels and be comfortable and remain hydrated. Temperature will be 38\u00b0C or 100.4\u00b0F or less. Child will verbalize or exhibit signs of comfort during febrile episode; child will demonstrate adequate signs of hydration. Interventions: Managing Fever Assess temperature at least every 4 to 6 hours, 30 to 60 minutes after antipyretic is given and with any change in condition: recognizing the pattern of fever may help identify source. Use same site and device for temperature measurement to reflect a more accurate trend in temperature, since different sites can result in significant differences in temperature reading. Administer antipyretics per physician order when the child is experiencing discomfort or cannot keep up with the metabolic demands of the fever. Fever is a protective response of the body to fight infection. Antipyretics provide symptomatic relief but do not change the course of the infection. The major benefits to decreasing fever are increasing comfort in the child and decreasing fluid requirements, helping to prevent dehydration. Notify physician of temperature per institution or specific order guidelines: increases in temperature may indicate worsening infection and relevant changes in condition. Assess fluid intake and encourage oral intake or administer intravenous fluids per physician order: increased metabolic rate and diaphoresis related to fever can cause fluid loss and lead to fluid volume deficit. Keep linens and clothing clean and dry: diaphoresis can leave clothing and linen soaked, increasing discomfort for the child. Use of nonpharmacologic measures such as tepid bath and removal of clothing and blankets is controversial. If used, discontinue if shivering begins. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Impaired comfort related to infectious and/or inflammatory process as evidenced by hyperthermia, pruritus, rash or skin lesions, sore throat, or joint pain Outcome Identification and Evaluation Pain or discomfort will be reduced to level acceptable to child. Child will verbalize absence or decrease of pain using a pain scale (FLACC, FACES, or linear pain scale), will verbalize decrease in uncomfortable sensations such as itching and aches; infants will exhibit decreased crying and ability to rest quietly. Interventions: Improving Comfort Assess pain and response to interventions frequently with use of pain scales or other pain measurement tools: provides baseline of pain and allows for evaluation of effectiveness of interventions. Administer analgesics and antipruritics as ordered to relieve pain via interruption of central nervous system (CNS) pathways and to decrease discomfort related to itching. Apply cool compresses to areas of pruritus or provide a cool bath to decrease inflammation and soothe pruritus. Keep child's fingernails short (use mitts, gloves, or socks over hands if necessary) to prevent injury to the skin, which leads to increased pain. Encourage child to press on rather than scratch the area of pruritus: pressing on the area that itches can soothe the itching and prevent scratching, which can leadto skin injury. Provide fluids frequently and offer warm fluids such as soup or cold foods such as popsicles to ease the discomfort of a sore throat. Provide cool mist humidification to ease the discomfort of a sore throat. Dress the child in light clothing: restrictive clothing and diaphoresis can lead to increased pruritus. Use diversional activities and distraction appropriate to developmental level: distraction from pain can reduce the need for pharmacologic agents, and distraction from pruritus can minimize scratching. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Impaired skin integrity related to mechanical trauma secondary to infectious disease process as evidenced by rash, pruritus, and scratching Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will maintain or regain skin integrity. Child will breakdown. Child or parent will be able to describe or and heal skin and proper care for any lesions. Interventions: Promoting Skin Integrity Monitor skin for color changes, temperature, redness, swelling, warmth, pain, signs of infection, or changes in rash lesions, distribution, or size to help identify problems early and allow for prevention of infection; can also provide information regarding the course of the illness. Encourage fluid intake and proper nutrition to promote wound healing. Keep child's fingernails short (use mitts, gloves, or socks over hands if necessary) to prevent injury to the skin, which leads to increased pain. Encourage child to press on rather than scratch the area of pruritus; pressing on the area that itches can soothe the itching and prevent scratching, which can lead to skin injury. Use antipruritics and topical ointments or creams as ordered to minimize scratching to prevent injury to skin; can aid in healing. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Risk for infection related to insufficient knowledge regarding measures to avoid exposure to pathogens, increased environmental exposure to pathogens, transmission to others secondary to contagious organism or presence of infectious organisms Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will exhibit no signs or symptoms of local or systemic infection. Child will not spread infection to others. Symptoms of infection will decrease over time; others will remain free of infection. Child and family will demonstrate appropriate hygiene measures using proper technique, such as hand washing, to prevent the spread of infection. Interventions: Preventing and Controlling Infection Monitor vital signs: elevation in temperature may indicate infection. Monitor skin lesions for signs of local infection: redness, warmth, drainage, swelling, and pain at lesions can indicate infection. Maintain aseptic technique and practice good hand washing to prevent introduction of further infectious agents and prevent transmission to others. Administer antibiotics as prescribed to prevent or treat bacterial infection. Encourage nutritious diet and proper hydration according to child's preferences and ability to feed orally to assist body's natural defenses against infection. Isolate child as required based on transmission-based precautions to prevent nosocomial spread of infection. Teach child and family preventive measures such as good hand washing, covering mouth and nose with cough or sneeze, and proper disposal of used tissues to prevent nosocomial or community spread of infection. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Fluid volume deficit, risk for, related to increased metabolic demands and insensible loss due to fever, vomiting, poor feeding or intake Outcome Identification and Evaluation Fluid volume will be maintained and balanced. Oral is elastic, urine output is at least 1 to 2 ml/kg/hour. Interventions: Promoting Adequate Fluid Balance Administer IV fluids if ordered to maintain adequate hydration in children who are nothing by mouth (NPO), unable to tolerate oral intake, or unable to keep up with fluid losses. When oral intake is allowed and tolerated, encourage oral fluids to promote intake and maintain hydration. Assess for signs of adequate hydration such as pink and moist oral mucosa, elastic skin turgor, and adequate urine output to detect fluid imbalance. Monitor intake and output to identify fluid imbalance. Assess urine specific gravity, urine and serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and osmolality and daily weights to monitor fluid status. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Social isolation related to required isolation from peers secondary to transmission-based precautions, as evidenced by disruption in usual play secondary to inability to leave hospital room, activity intolerance, and fatigue Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will participate in stimulating activities. Child is able to verbalize reason for isolation and length of isolation (if developmentally appropriate); child verbalizes interest in activities. Interventions: Preventing Social Isolation Explain reasons for transmission-based precautions and length of time: this helps increase understanding and decrease anxiety about isolation. Children sometimes mistake isolation as punishment. Explaining length of time gives child an endpoint he or she can work toward. Visit child frequently, at least every hour, and try to spend some uninterrupted time to play and allow child time to verbalize feelings about separation from others: helps establish a therapeutic relationship and demonstrates caring. Let child see caregiver's face before applying mask if appropriate to help child identify and relate to those caring for him or her and minimize anxiety about strangers and the unknown. Consult child life specialist to arrange for stimulating activities child enjoys: can help child to understand reasons for isolation. Contact volunteers to spend time with child, if appropriate: gives child attention and support, which will help child to cope and decrease stress.NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Knowledge deficit related to lack of information regarding medical condition, prognosis, and medical needs as evidenced by verbalization, questions, or actions demonstrating lack of understanding regarding child's condition or care Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child and family will verbalize accurate information and understanding about condition, prognosis, and medical needs. Child and family demonstrate knowledge of condition and prognosis and medical needs, including possible causes, contributing factors, and treatment measures. Interventions: Providing Child and Family Teaching Assess child's and family's willingness to learn: child and family must be willing to learn in order for teaching to be effective. Provide family with time to adjust to diagnosis to facilitate adjustment and ability to learn and participate in child's care. Repeat information to give family and child time to learn and understand. Teach in short sessions: many short sessions are more helpful than one long session. Gear teaching to level of understanding of the child and family (depends on age of child, physical condition, memory) to ensure understanding. Provide reinforcement and rewards to facilitate the teaching/learning process. Use multiple modes of learning involving many senses (provide written, verbal, demonstration, and videos) when possible: the child and family are more likely to retain information when it is presented in different ways using many senses. Teaching Guidelines 15.1 FEVER MANAGEMENT Fever is a sign of illness, not a disease; it is the body's weapon to fight infection. Diurnal variation may allow temperature changes as much as 1\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F) over a 24-hour period, peaking in the evening. Antipyretics are used if the child demonstrates discomfort. Always check correct doses before administration. Never give aspirin or aspirin-containing products to a child younger than 19 years with a fever due to the risk of Reye syndrome In some children fever can be associated with a seizure or dehydration, but this will not lead to brain damage or death. Discuss the facts about febrile seizures (see Chapter 16 for further information on febrile seizures). Watch for the signs and symptoms of dehydration; it is important to provide oral rehydration by increasing fluid intake. Dress the child lightly and avoid warm, binding clothing or blankets. The use of sponging with tepid water is controversial; if used, encourage the parent to give an antipyretic prior to sponging. Ensure the sponging does not produce shivering (which causes the body to produce heat and maintain the elevated set point), and reinforce the importance of using tepid water, not cold water or alcohol. Instruct the parent to stop if the child experiences discomfort. Call the provider for: Any child younger than 3 months of age who has a rectal temperature above 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) Any child who is lethargic or listless, regardless of temperature Fever lasting more than 3 to 5 days Fever greater than 40.6\u00b0C (105\u00b0F) Any child who is immunocompromised by illness, such as cancer or HIV, will need further evaluation and treatment. BOX 15.4 DOSE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACETAMINOPHEN AND IBUPROFEN Acetaminophen, 10 to 15 mg/kg/dose No more than every 4 hours No more than five doses in a 24-hour period Ibuprofen, 5 to 10 mg/kg/dose Only children older than 6 months of age No more than four doses in a 24-hour period Adapted from Gal, P., & Reed, M. D. (2007). Medications. In R. M. Kliegman, R. E. Behrman, H. B. Jenson, & B. F. Stanton (Eds.), Nelson's textbook of pediatrics (18th ed., pp. 2955-2999). Philadelphia: Saunders.EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 15.1 MORE EFFECTIVE THAN IBUPROFEN ALONE? Fever is one of the most common health concerns seen in pediatrics. Alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen for fever reduction is a common practice, but there has been limited evidence on its safety or efficacy. It may be a harmful practice due to combined toxicity and potential parental confusion in timing and dosing. STUDY This study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trail. It evaluated the antipyretic efficacy of alternating acetaminophen with ibuprofen versus acetaminophen with a placebo. It also evaluated the safety of the two regimens along with caretaker perception of efficacy. Study participants were healthy children ages 6 months to 6 years presenting to a medical center with the chief complaint of fever. Findings A significant difference was seen in fever reduction in the alternating group versus the acetaminophen alone group at hours 4 and 5, but this difference diminished by hour 6. Administration, including dosing and interval, were undercontrolled conditions during this study; however, safety concerns remain. Parents, even without the confusion of alternating two medications, often over- or underdose these medications. No association of perception of efficacy by caregivers was found based on regimen used. Nursing Implications Although this study suggests improved fever reduction with alternating of acetaminophen and ibuprofen, safety concerns remain. Further research with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up are warranted. To alleviate some of the concerns that parents have with fever, nurses should consistently educate parents about why fever occurs and fever facts and myths. Adapted from Kramer, L.C., Richards, P.A., Thompson, A.M., Harper, D.P., & Fairchok, Alternating Antipyretic efficacy of acetaminophen versus alternated with ibuprofen in children. Clinical Pediatrics, 47(9), 907-912.SEPSIS Sepsis is a systemic overresponse to infection resulting from bacteria (most common), fungi, viruses, or parasites. It can lead to septic shock, which results in hypotension, low blood flow, and multisystem organ failure. Septic shock is a medical emergency and children are usually admitted to an intensive care unit (see Chapter 31 ). The cause of sepsis may not be known, but common causative organisms in neonates include Escherichia Streptococcus, enteroviruses, older Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus (Enrione & Powell, 2007). Sepsis can affect any age group but is more common in neonates and young infants (Santhanam & Tolan Jr., 2011). Neonates and young infants have a higher susceptibility due to their immature immune system, inability to localize infections, and lack of immunoglobulin M (IgM), which is necessary to protect against bacterial infections. The prognosis for sepsis is variable and depends on the child's age and the cause of the sepsis. The mortality rate ranges from 9% to 35% (Santhanam & Tolan Jr., 2011). Neonates are at highest risk for a poor outcome. Due to this high mortality rate, when an ill-appearing febrile neonate presents, a full workup is indicated (Powell, 2007b). Usually, admission to the hospital to rule out sepsis is the standard of practice. Pathophysiology Sepsis results in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to infection. The pathophysiology of sepsis is complex. It results from the effects of circulating bacterial products or toxins, mediated by cytokine release, occurring as a result of sustained bacteremia. The pathogens cause an overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines, previously termed endotoxins. These cytokines are responsible for the clinically observable effects of the sepsis. Impaired pulmonary, hepatic, or renal function may result from excessive cytokine release during the septic process. Therapeutic Management Therapeutic management of sepsis in infants, especially neonates, is more aggressive than for older children. Neonates and infants with sepsis or even suspected sepsis are treated in the hospital. The infant is admitted for close monitoring along with antibiotic therapy. Intravenous antibiotics are started immediately after the blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures have been obtained. The length of therapy and the specific antibiotic used will be determined based on the source of the positive culture and the results of the culture and sensitivity. If final culture reports are negative and symptoms have subsided, antibiotics may be discontinued (usually after 72 hours of treatment). If the child is not responding to therapy and symptoms worsen, sepsis may be progressing to shock. Management of the child with septic shock is usually done in the intensive care unit. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 452 . Assessment findings pertinent to sepsis are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Signs of sepsis can vary with each child. Some common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Child just does not look or act right Crying more than usual, inconsolable Fever Hypothermia (in neonates and those with severe disease) Lethargic and less interactive or playful Increased irritability Poor feeding or poor suck Rash (e.g., petechiae, ecchymosis, diffuse erythema) Difficulty breathing Nasal congestion Diarrhea Vomiting Decreased urine output Hypotonia Changes in mental status (confused, anxious, excited) Seizures Older child may complain of heart racing Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as: Prematurity Lack of immunizations Immunocompromise Exposure to communicable pathogens In neonates and young infants, seek pregnancy and labor risk factors such as: Premature rupture of membranes or prolonged rupture Difficult delivery Maternal infection or fever, including sexually transmitted infections Resuscitation and other invasive procedures Positive maternal group -streptococcal vaginosis Sepsis may occur in the hospitalized child. Assess for risk factors such as: Intensive care unit stay Presence of central line or other invasive lines or tubes Immunosuppression Take Note! Listen to the parents' descriptions of the neonate's or infant's behavior and appearance, as well as changes they have observed. Many times they are the first to notice when their child is not acting right, even before clinical signs of infection are seen. Physical Examination Perform a thorough physical examination of the infant or child with proven or suspected sepsis. Specific findings related to inspection and observation are noted below. INSPECTION AND OBSERVATION Observe the child's general appearance, color, level of arousal, and hydration status. The child with sepsis may appear lethargic and pale and show signs of dehydration. In neonates and infants, observe the quality of their cry and reaction to parental stimulation, noting weak cry, lack of smile or facial expression, or lack of responsiveness. Inspect the skin for petechiae or other skin lesions. Petechiae may indicate a serious bacterial infection (often N. meningitidis), and other skin lesion patterns may help identify the cause of the fever. Observe respiratory effort and rate. The infant or child with sepsis may demonstrate tachypnea and increased work of breathing, such as nasal flaring, grunting, and retractions. Assess vital signs, noting abnormalities. Note elevation in temperature or hypothermia in the young infant. Note tachypnea or tachycardia in the child or apnea or bradycardia in the infant. Document blood pressure. Hypotension, especially when accompanied by signs of poor perfusion, can be a sign of worsening sepsis with progression to shock (refer to Chapter 31 ). Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Symptoms of sepsis can be vague in infants. Therefore, laboratory tests play a crucial role in confirming or ruling out sepsis. Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of sepsis include: Complete blood count: WBC levels will be elevated; in severe cases they may be decreased (this is an ominous sign). C-reactive protein: elevated Blood culture: positive in septicemia, indicating bacteria is present in the blood Urine culture: may be positive, indicating presence of bacteria in the urine Cerebrospinal fluid analysis: may reveal increased WBCs and protein and low glucose Stool culture: may be positive for bacteria or other infectious organisms Culture of tubes, catheters, or shunts suspected to be infected: the fluid inside these tubes may be tested for bacteria. Chest radiograph: may reveal signs of pneumonia such as hyperinflation and patchy areas of atelectasis or infiltrationNursing Management Monitor the infant or child closely for changes in condition, especially the development of shock. Administer antibiotics as ordered. Refer to Nursing Care Plan 15.1 for nursing diagnoses and related interventions. In addition to these interventions, it is important to prevent infection and provide education to the child and family. Preventing Infection Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening illness, and prevention is important. Hand washing is the most effective intervention against nosocomial infection. Nurses play a key role in minimizing environmental sources by cleaning equipment, disposing of soiled linens and dressings properly, and adhering to proper aseptic technique with all invasive procedures. Follow your institution's policies and use evidence-based practice guidelines for interventions such as invasive line dressing changes and intravenous tubing changes to reduce the risk of infection. Encourage immunization as recommended. To reduce group B streptococcus infection in neonates, screen pregnant woman. If the results are positive, administer intrapartum antibiotics. Take Note! There has been a dramatic reduction in invasive Haemophilus influenzae type B diseases since the widespread use of the Hib vaccine (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008b). Educating the Child and Family Early recognition of the signs of sepsis is essential in preventing morbidity and mortality. Educate parents about the significance of fever, especially in neonates and infants younger than 3 months old. Instruct parents to contact their physician or nurse practitioner if their infant or neonate has a fever. A physician or nurse practitioner should see any child with a fever accompanied by lethargy, poor responsiveness, or lack of facial expressions. Signs and symptoms of sepsis can be vague and vary from child to child. Encourage parents to contact their physician or nurse practitioner if they feel their febrile child is \"just not acting right.\"BACTERIAL INFECTIONS Bacteria are one-celled organisms that can live, grow, and reproduce. They exist everywhere. Most are completely harmless and some are very useful. Others can lead to disease either because they are in the wrong place in the body or they are designed to invade and cause disease in humans and animals. Children are at a high risk of developing bacterial infections, which can result in life- threatening illness. Fortunately, many bacterial diseases, such as diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus, can be prevented by immunization (see Chapter 9 for more information on immunizations). Community-Acquired Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CAMRSA) is a staphylococcal infection that is resistant to certain antibiotics. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in the community is increasing in occurrence throughout the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011a). These infections range from minor skin rashes to abscesses to serious, complicated, life- threatening infections. Serious and invasive infections, such as sepsis, necrotizing pneumonia, and osteomyelitis, often are secondary to a skin or soft tissue infection. The CDC and World Health Organization (WHO) have recognized MRSA as a major health threat (Hinckley & Allen, 2008). Prior to the early 1990s, MRSA was mainly considered a hospital-acquired infection. However, health care professionals began to identify MRSA in the community setting in seemingly healthy individuals, including children (Rose & Senita, 2009). Transmission occurs through direct person-to-person contact, respiratory droplets, blood, or sharing personal items, such as hair brushes, towels, and sports equipment, and touching surfaces or items contaminated with MRSA. Clusters of MRSA have been found in day care centers and among athletic teams. Staphylococci are resistant to heat and drying and can be found on environmental surfaces months after contamination. Intact skin and mucous membranes, along with proper hand hygiene, are the best barriers to MRSA. Nursing Assessment In the child, skin and tissue infections are common infections caused by CAMRSA. Symptoms include a bump or skin area that is red, swollen, painful, and warm to touch. It may also include fever, fluctuance, and purulent drainage. The lesion may have appeared suddenly and be red and raised, resembling an insect bite. Necrotic areas may develop. Abscesses, especially abscessed hair follicles, and pimples are common presentations. Assessment needs to include a thorough past medical history to determine history of recurrent skin infections with or without complete resolution along with assessment for risk factors. Risk factors include playing contact sports; openings in the skin, such as abrasions and cuts; contact with contaminated items and surfaces; poor hygiene; and crowded living conditions (Hinckley & Allen, 2008). Diagnosis is determined through culture. Diagnostic tests include incision and drainage (I&D), aspiration of the abscess, and culturing the fluid or tissue. Antimicrobial susceptibility along with culture is critical. Nursing Management Care of the child with CAMRSA will typically occur at home. Antibiotics with microbial susceptibility will often be prescribed. Comprehensive wound care, which may include I&D, may occur. Follow-up for reassessment is key. Child and family education is crucial. Include the following in the teaching plan: Educate the family on the importance of taking the antibiotics as directed and finishing all the medicine. Emphasize that this will help slow the creation of antimicrobial-resistant organisms. Teach the child and parents proper hand hygiene and hand washing. Discourage family members from sharing personal items. Explain the risk factors involved in transmission. Explain the importance of keeping cuts and scrapes cleaned and covered. Review the signs of MRSA and emphasize the importance of early recognition and treatment. Scarlet Fever Scarlet fever is an infection resulting from group A streptococci. It usually occurs with a group A streptococci throat infection (i.e., strep throat). However, in the case of scarlet fever, the bacteria produce a toxin that causes a rash. Not all children with a group A streptococci infection will develop the rash of scarlet fever. Only children who are infected with streptococci that produce pyrogenicexotoxins and do not have antitoxin antibodies, making them sensitive to the bacterial toxin, will develop scarlet fever (Gerber, 2007). Scarlet fever is usually seen in children younger than 18 years of age, with the peak incidence between the ages of 4 and 8 years (Balentine & Lombardi, 2010). It is rare in children younger than 2 years old (Balentine & Lombardi, 2010). Transmission is through droplets and follows contact with respiratory tract secretions. Transmission is facilitated by the type of close contact that occurs in schools and child care centers. Food-borne outbreaks have occurred due to human contamination of food. After exposure, the incubation period is 2 to 5 days (Gerber, 2007). Communicability is highest during acute infection, and the child is no longer contagious 24 hours after the initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy (Gerber, 2007). There has been a dramatic decrease in the mortality rate from scarlet fever due to antibiotic use, but complications such as rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis can still occur (Balentine, & Lombardi, 2010; Gerber, 2007). Nursing Assessment Symptoms of scarlet fever begin abruptly. The health history may reveal a fever greater than 101\u00b0F, chills, body aches, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. Inspect the pharynx, which is usually very red and swollen. The tonsils may have yellow or white specks of pus, and cervical lymph nodes may be swollen. Inspect the skin for the most striking symptom of scarlet fever, which is an erythematous rash appearing on the face, trunk, and extremities. The rash is typically absent from the palms and soles of the feet. It looks like a sunburn but feels like sandpaper ( Fig. 15.1A ). The rash lasts approximately 5 days and is followed by desquamation, typically on the fingers and toes. Early in the illness the tongue develops a thick coat with a strawberry appearance. The tongue will later lose the coating and become bright red (see Fig. 15.1B ). Diagnosis is made by identification of group A streptococcus on throat culture. Several rapid tests for group A streptococcal pharyngitis are available. The accuracy of these tests depends on the quality of the specimen. It is important that the secretions obtained are pharyngeal or tonsillar (see Common Medical Treatments 15.1 for more information on throat cultures). Nursing Management Children with scarlet fever are usually cared for at home. Penicillin V is the antibiotic of choice. In those sensitive to penicillin, erythromycin may be used. Educate the family on the importance of taking the antibiotic as directed and finishing all the medicine. Encourage fluid intake to maintain adequate hydration due to fever. Teach parents ways to provide comfort for the child. A cool mist humidifier can soothe the child's sore throat. Soft foods, warm liquids like soup, or cold foods like Popsicles may also be helpful. If the child is hospitalized, droplet precautions, along with standard precautions, are necessary. Diphtheria Diphtheria is caused by infection with Corynebacterium diphtheriae and may affect the nose, larynx, tonsils, or pharynx. Tonsillar and pharyngeal infections are the most common and will be the focus of this discussion. A pseudomembrane forms over the pharynx, uvula, tonsils, and soft palate ( Fig. 15.2 ). The neck becomes edematous and lymphadenopathy develops. The pseudomembrane causes airway obstruction and suffocation. Diphtheria is very rare in the United States but continues to infect people worldwide due to lack of routine immunization (Mayo Clinic Staff, 2011). Risk factors include children and adults who are unimmunized or underimmunized, living in crowded or unsanitary living conditions, having a compromised immune system, and traveling to developing countries where diphtheria remains endemic (Mayo Clinic Staff, 2011). Routine infant immunization can prevent the disease. Therapeutic management involves administration of antibiotics and antitoxin, as well as airway management.FIGURE 15.1 (A) Rash of scarlet fever. (B) Strawberry tongue. FIGURE 15.2 In diphtheria a pseudomembrane forms over the pharynx, uvula, tonsils, and soft palate. Nursing Assessment Children at risk for diphtheria are those who are unimmunized. Note history of sore throat and fever, usually less than 38.9\u00b0C. As the pseudomembrane forms, swallowing becomes difficult and signs of airway obstruction become apparent. A specimen of the membrane may be cultured for C. diphtheriae. Nursing Management Close observation of respiratory status is of utmost importance. Administration of antibiotics and the antitoxin is critical to encourage sloughing of the membrane. The child should remain on strict droplet precautions in addition to standard precautions and should maintain bed rest.Pertussis Pertussis is an acute respiratory disorder characterized by paroxysmal cough (whooping cough) and copious secretions. The highest incidence is seen in children younger than 1 year of age, and children younger than 6 months of age are at greatest risk for severe disease and death (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010e). The disease is caused by Bordetella pertussis. The incubation period is 6 to 21 days, usually 7 to 10 days. Pertussis usually starts with 7 to 10 days of cold symptoms. The paroxysmal coughing spells then begin and can last 1 to 4 weeks. Convalescence occurs over the course of several weeks to months. Initially, immunization decreased the incidence of pertussis, but since the 1980s there has been a gradual increase (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011b). In recent years, there has been an increase in pertussis cases and reports of localized outbreaks, especially in adolescents and adults (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011b). Therefore, children older than 11 years of age and adults are now required to get one immunization booster of Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) instead of Td (tetanus and diphtheria) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011b, 2011c). Over the last several years an increased incidence of disease in children 7 to 10 years has been reported. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) revised their recommendations and currently recommends the use of Tdap in undervaccinated children aged 7 to 10 years (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010e, 2011c). Infants and young children continue to be required to get five doses of DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years. Complications of pertussis include hypoxia, apnea, pneumonia, seizures, encephalopathy, and death. Therapeutic Management Therapeutic management of pertussis focuses on eradicating the bacterial infection and providing respiratory support. CDC guidelines recommend antimicrobial treatment (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011b). For infants older than 1 month of age, macrolide drugs, including erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin, are the drugs of choice (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2005). For younger infants, azithromycin should be used and erythromycin and clarithromycin avoided (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2005). An alternative to macrolides in children older than 2 months is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2005). A course of macrolide antibiotics is also recommended to treat symptomatic close contacts within 3 weeks of exposure (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2005). Nursing Assessment The most important risk factor for the development of pertussis is lack of immunization. The history may reveal cold and cough symptoms, progressing to paroxysmal coughing spells. During the paroxysms, the child might cough 10 to 30 times in a row, followed by a whooping sound. This might be accompanied by redness in the face, progressive cyanosis, and protrusion of the tongue. Saliva, mucus, and tears flow from the mouth, nose, and eyes. Between the paroxysmal episodes, the child might rest well and appear relatively unaffected. Auscultate the lungs to assess air exchange. The diagnosis may be confirmed by a variety of laboratory tests accompanied by clinical history. Culture is considered the gold standard, but polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used by some laboratories due to its increased sensitivity and faster results (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011b). Nursing Management Nursing care will focus on providing a high-humidity environment and frequent suctioning to mobilize secretions. Observe for signs of airway obstruction. Encourage fluids to keep secretions thin and maintain adequate hydration. Offer reassurance to the child and family; the coughing episodes can be very frightening. Droplet precautions along with standard precautions are necessary for the hospitalized child. Tetanus Tetanus is an acute, often fatal neurologic disease caused by the toxins produced by Clostridium tetani. Tetanus is rare in the United States but continues to be significant worldwide due to lack of routine immunization (Arnon, 2007). It is characterized by increased muscle tone and spasm. C. tetani spores can live anywhere but are found most commonly in soil, dust, and feces from humans or animals, such as sheep, cattle, chickens, dogs, cats, and rats. The spores can enter the body through a wound that is contaminated, through a burn, or by injecting contaminated street drugs. Once it enters the body, an anaerobic environment allows it to multiply and a poisonous toxin is released. There are four forms of tetanus. Neonatal tetanus is the most common worldwide, affecting newborns in the first week of life secondary to an infected umbilical stump or unsterile surgical technique during circumcision (Arnon, 2007). Most women in the UnitedStates have been immunized and will pass the immunity to their fetus. Along with proper hygiene during delivery and adequate cord care, this makes this type rare in the United States, but in underdeveloped countries it remains a significant problem (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011b). The second form is local tetanus. This rare form is characterized by local muscle spasms within the area of the wound. The third type is cephalic tetanus, which is associated with recurrent otitis media or head trauma. It is also rare and affects the cranial nerves, especially facial nerves. Generalized tetanus is the most common form and results in spasms that progress in a descending fashion beginning at the jaw. The most profoundly affected muscles are those of the neck and back. In the United States the fatality rate associated with tetanus has declined and cases are rare, but 1 in 10 cases will result in death (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011i). The general incubation period is 3 to 21 days, with an average of 8 days. Recovery can be long and difficult, and children with tetanus may have to spend several weeks in the hospital in an intensive care setting. It has been suggested that the shorter the incubation period, the higher the risk of more severe illness and poorer prognosis. Complications associated with tetanus include breathing problems, fractures, elevated blood pressure, dysrhythmias, clotting in the blood vessels of the lung, pneumonia, and coma. Therapeutic Management Therapeutic management is directed toward supporting respiratory and cardiovascular function. Tetanus immunoglobulin may be given as well as the tetanus vaccine. Removal of the offending organism, by debridement of the wound, may occur, and intravenous antibiotics such as metronidazole may be initiated. In severe cases, the child may require intensive nursing care with mechanical ventilation. Nursing Assessment Note history of initial signs such as headache, spasms, crankiness, and cramping of the jaw (lockjaw), which are followed by difficulty swallowing and a stiff neck. Tetanus progresses in a descending fashion to other muscle groups, causing spasms of the neck, arms, legs, and stomach; seizures may result. Document the presence of fever along with an elevated blood pressure and tachycardia. Opisthotonos may be noted due to severe spasms of the neck and back. The spasms or muscle contractions in children may be strong enough to result in fractures. The diagnosis of tetanus is based on the clinical findings of the history and physical examination. Nursing Management Nursing management focuses on observing for signs of respiratory distress. Provide a quiet environment with reduced external stimuli to decrease the incidence of spasms. Appropriately manage pain. Encourage adequate nutrition and hydration. Administer sedatives and muscle relaxants as ordered to reduce the pain associated with the muscle spasms and to prevent seizures. Encourage the parents to stay with their child. The child's mental status is unaffected by the disease, and therefore he or she is aware of what is happening. Efforts need to be made to reduce the child's anxiety and to provide reassuring, sympathetic care to the child and family. Tetanus is not contagious from person to person; therefore, standard precautions are sufficient. Tetanus is a preventable but potentially fatal disease. Education is essential regarding the importance of receiving this routine immunization (refer to Chapter 9 for immunization schedule) as well as a booster every 10 years. Instructing parents on proper wound care can also help prevent tetanus. All wounds should be cleaned thoroughly and a proper antiseptic used. If a wound is deep and contamination is suspected, the child should be seen by a physician or nurse practitioner. If it has been more than 5 years since the last tetanus dose, a booster may be needed. This can help to neutralize the poison and prevent it from entering the nervous system.VIRAL INFECTIONS Viruses are very small particles that infect cells. They cannot multiply on their own and require a living host, such as humans, animals, or plants. They can reproduce only by invading and taking over the host cells. Young children are highly sensitive to viruses; their resistance is low and exposure is high. Viruses are hard to destroy without damaging or killing the living cells they infect. Therefore, drugs are not used to control them. However, many viral diseases can be prevented by immunization, such as measles, rubella, varicella, mumps, and poliomyelitis (see Chapter 9 for more information on immunizations). Viral Exanthems Many viral infections of the skin in childhood are called viral exanthems. Exanthem means rash or skin eruption. Viral exanthems of childhood often present with a distinct rash pattern that assists in the diagnosis of the virus. Table 15.4 discusses common childhood exanthems. Immunizations have led to a decrease in the incidence of certain viral exanthems, such as measles, rubella, and varicella. Typically, children with viral exanthems are cared for at home, but there are times when a child may be hospitalized or may develop the disease while being hospitalized. Appropriate transmission-based precautions must be taken. Therapeutic management of the viral exanthems focuses on fever management and relief of discomfort. Nursing Assessment Obtain the history of the present illness, noting the onset of rash in relation to the onset of fever. Note accompanying symptoms such as respiratory complaints. Document known exposure to childhood diseases. Note immunization status. Inspect the skin for rash, noting the distribution, type, and extent of lesions. Table 15.4 describes the rash as well as accompanying symptoms for each of the viral exanthems. Nursing Management Nursing management of viral exanthems focuses on fever reduction, relief of discomfort, and protection of skin integrity. Encourage hydration. Administer antipyretics and antipruritics as needed (refer to Drug Guide 15.1 ). Nonpharmacologic interventions to reduce fever, such as tepid sponging and cool compresses, may be used. Refer to Nursing Care Plan 15.1 for additional information; care should be individualized based on the child's and family's response to the illness. Take Note! Trim the child's fingernails or cover hands with mitts, gloves, or socks (which work well with younger infants and children) if the rash itches to help prevent breaks in the skin, which can lead to discomfort and infection. Mumps Mumps, a contagious disease caused by Paramyxovirus, is characterized by fever and parotitis (inflammation and swelling of the parotid gland). Mumps is spread via contact with infected droplets. Infected individuals are contagious for 1 to 7 days prior to onset of symptoms and for 7 to 9 days after parotid swelling begins. About 50% of all infected postpubertal boys also develop orchitis (inflammation of the testicle) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011b). Orchitis in prepubertal males is rare (Mason, 2007c). This may lead to some degree of testicular atrophy, but rarely sterility. In about 5% of females oophoritis (ovarian inflammation) occurs with no relationship to infertility (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011b). Complications of mumps include meningitis with or without encephalitis with seizures, pancreatitis, and auditory neuritis, which can result in deafness. Therapeutic management is supportive. Since the recommendation of the two-dose MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine, the incidence of mumps has declined and made mumps a rare disease seen in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011b). The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the ACIP recommends immunization against mumps for all children (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010g). Current recommendations include first mumps immunization between 12 and 15 months of age, followed by a second vaccine between 4 and 6 years of age (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010g). According to the CDC (2010d), one dose of MMR prevents between 73% and 91% of cases and two doses prevent approximately 79% to 95% of cases (see Chapter 9 for information on mumps vaccination).FIGURE 15.3 Parotitis associated with mumps. Nursing Assessment Note history of exposure to infected individuals as well as immunization status. Determine history of low-grade fever and onset and progression of parotid swelling. History may also include malaise, anorexia, headache, and abdominal pain. The parotid swelling is easily observed as swelling of the neck either bilaterally or unilaterally ( Fig. 15.3 ). In boys, note orchitis. The diagnosis is usually based on the history and clinical presentation, but serum may be tested for the presence of mumps IgG or IgM antibody . Nursing Management Nursing management of mumps is primarily supportive. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen is used for fever management, and occasionally narcotic analgesics are required for pain management. Oral fluids are encouraged to prevent dehydration. If orchitis is present, ice packs to the testicles and gentle testicular support may be helpful. Hospitalized children should be confined to respiratory isolation to prevent spread of the disease. Infected children are considered no longer contagious 9 days following onset of parotid swelling (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011b). Take Note! In recent years mumps outbreaks have occurred, mainly in settings where prolonged close contact with other people occurs, such as college campuses and camps. The mumps vaccine is not 100% effective, and mumps infection can occur in vaccinated individuals. During an outbreak it is essential to define the population at risk and transmission setting, identify and isolate suspected cases, and identify and vaccinate susceptible individuals (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010d).ZOONOTIC INFECTIONS Zoonotic infections are diseases caused by infectious agents that are transmitted directly or indirectly from animals to humans. Zoonotic infections are responsible for about 75% of emerging infectious diseases, with approximately 60% of all human pathogens originating from animals (Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, 2011j). Two infections are covered below. Refer to Table 15.5 for other zoonotic infections. Cat Scratch Disease Cat scratch disease is a relatively common and occasionally serious disease caused by the bacteria Bartonella henselae. It occurs in both children and adults but is more common in children (Klein, 2009). Cats can carry the bacteria in their saliva. In 90% of cases the child has had a recent interaction with cats and often kittens (Klein, 2009). No evidence exists to support person-to-person transmission (Klein, 2009). B. henselae is transmitted between cats via the cat flea. The incubation period is 7 to 12 days, with lymphadenopathy appearing in 5 to 50 days. Therapeutic management is supportive and is aimed at management of symptoms. The disease itself is usually self-limited, resolving on its own in 2 to 4 months. If lymphadenopathy persists or if the child is immunocompromised, antibiotics may be needed. Painful, swollen nodes may be treated with needle aspiration to provide symptom relief. Nursing Assessment Note history of headaches, fever, anorexia, and fatigue. The history may also include interaction or rough play with cats or kittens, resulting in a scratch. Document the temperature, noting fever. Palpate for enlarged lymph nodes, noting their location. A skin papule or pustule may be present or reported at this site of the bite or scratch. Diagnostic tests are available to detect serum antibodies to antigens of Bartonella species. Nursing Management Administer antibiotics if ordered. No transmission-based isolation is required; standard precautions are sufficient. Educate the child and family about prevention and control measures. Teach children to avoid rough play with cats and kittens. Teach parents and children to immediately wash any bites or scratches with soap and running water. Explain that cats should never lick open wounds on the child. Control of fleas in cats is important to prevent the spread of B. henselae. Rabies Rabies is a preventable viral infection of the central nervous system. It is transmitted to other animals and humans through close contact with the saliva of a rabid animal, usually by a bite. The number of cases of rabies has steadily declined in the United States (Immunization Action Coalition, 2010). It is rare in the United States and Western Europe due to routine vaccination of domestic animals, such as dogs, and the availability of effective postexposure prophylaxis. Now most cases of rabies in these areas are due to wild animals such as raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes (Immunization Action Coalition, 2010). Rabies continues to be a major health problem in other parts of the world, especially in areas where dogs are not controlled. Most cases of rabies occur in children younger than 15 years of age, and most human deaths occur in Asia and Africa (World Health Organization, 2010). Children have an increased susceptibility to rabies due to their fearlessness around animals, eagerness to play with animals, shorter stature, and inability to protect themselves. The incubation period for rabies is extremely variable. Typically it is several weeks to months but can range from days to years (Immunization Action Coalition, 2010). The incubation period tends to be shorter in children. Once symptoms of rabies have developed, the prognosis is poor. Death usually occurs within days of the onset of symptoms. Prevention is of paramount importance, and eliminating infection in animal vectors is essential. Successful animal vaccination and animal control campaigns in the United States have led to a very low rate of human rabies cases. Rabies among dogs in the United States has been virtually eliminated (Immunization Action Coalition, 2010). Recently, rabies transmitted from other animals, especially raccoons and bats, has become a cause for concern (Immunization Action Coalition, 2010). It is important to contact the local health department whenever there is an exposure, or suspected exposure, to rabies. Several factors need to be considered when deciding to provide postexposure prophylaxis, such as local epidemiology, type of animal involved, availability of the responsible animal for testing or quarantine, and the circumstances of the exposure, such as a provoked versus an unprovoked attack. In a previously unvaccinated child, postexposure prophylaxis should begin with a thorough cleansing of all wounds with soap and water or a virucidal agent, such as povidone-iodine solution. In the United States, concurrent use of passiveand active immunoprophylaxis is then recommended. It consists of a regimen of one dose of immune globulin and four doses of human rabies vaccine. Rabies immune globulin and the first dose of rabies vaccine should be given as soon as possible after exposure, ideally within 24 hours. Additional doses of rabies vaccine should be given on days 3, 7, and 14 after the first vaccination. Rabies immune globulin is infiltrated into and around the wound, with any remaining volume administered intramuscularly at a site distant from the vaccine inoculation. Human rabies vaccine is administered intramuscularly into the anterolateral thigh or deltoid, depending on the age and size of the child. Administration into the gluteus muscle should be avoided, since this site has been associated with vaccine failure (Rupprecht et al., 2010; Toltzis, 2007). Nursing AssessmentNote the history of an animal bite, especially if it was unprovoked, and exposure to bats. Document history of early symptoms of rabies infection, which are nonspecific and flu-like, such as fever, headache, and general malaise. The child may complain of pain, pruritus, and paresthesia at the bite site. As the virus spreads to the central nervous system, encephalitis develops. The disease will have progressive neurologic manifestations, which may include insomnia, confusion, anxiety, changes in behavior, agitation or excitation, hallucinations, hypersalivation, dysphagia, and hydrophobia, which results from aspiration when swallowing liquid or saliva. In some cases progressive paralysis may be present. The child may have periods of lucidity alternating with these neurologic changes. Laboratory testing may include hair and saliva specimens from which the virus may be isolated. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid can be tested for antibodies to the rabies virus. Direct fluorescent antibody testing can be done to diagnose rabies in a suspected animal. The test can only be done postmortem and requires brain tissue from the potentially rabid animal. Nursing Management Few people survive once symptomatic rabies infection develops. Intensive supportive care is required, but recovery is extremely rare. Therefore, it is vital to educate children and families about the importance of seeking medical care after any animal bite to prevent death from rabies infection. Also, teach children to avoid wild animals, stray animals, and any animal with unusual behavior. Teach children not to provoke or attempt to capture wild or stray animals. Regardless of whether immunoprophylaxis is initiated, appropriate wound management is necessary in all victims of a bite from a potentially rabid animal. This includes a thorough cleansing of all wounds with soap and water. Irrigation of wounds for at least 10 minutes with a virucidal agent, such as povidone-iodine solution, is recommended (Toltzis, 2007). When caring for a child requiring postexposure prophylaxis, provide support and education to the child and family. Due to the seriousness and urgency surrounding this disease and treatment, the child and family are often very frightened. Consider comfort measures, such as EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) cream and positioning, when giving immunization.VECTOR-BORNE INFECTIONS Children are at a particular risk for contracting vector-borne diseases, which are diseases transmitted by ticks, mosquitoes, or other insect vectors ( Table 15.5 ). Young children are unaware of the health risks around them and cannot take protective measures. Their immature immune system leads to a decreased capacity to resist vector-borne diseases. These diseases can be severe and even fatal, though most are treatable if identified early. Many times the child presents initially with nonspecific symptoms. Coupled with the fact that there are few definitive diagnostic tests available, this can lead to difficulty in promptly recognizing and treating these diseases. Tick-borne diseases are common vector-borne illnesses in the United States. Two of the most common will be covered below. Lyme Disease Lyme disease, the most common reported vector-borne disease in the United States, is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011e). It is transmitted to humans via the bite of an infected black-legged (deer) tick. Ninety-five percent of reported Lyme disease cases occurred in 12 states, mainly in the northeast (Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maryland, New Hampshire, Delaware, Maine, and Virginia) and the upper Midwest (Minnesota and Wisconsin) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011g). Most cases are seen between June and August (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011e). Lyme disease can affect any age group, but the incidence is highest among children between 5 and 10 years of age (Shapiro, 2007). The prognosis for recovery in children who are treated is excellent. Therapeutic Management In most cases Lyme disease can be cured by antibiotics, especially if they are started early in the illness. Doxycycline is the drug of choice for children older than 8 years (Shapiro, 2007). Because it can cause permanent discoloration of the teeth, children younger than 8 years should be treated with amoxicillin (Shapiro, 2007). For children allergic to penicillin, cefuroxime or erythromycin can be used. Duration of treatment is usually 14 to 28 days, depending on the stage of disease. Nursing Assessment The clinical signs of Lyme disease are divided into three stages\u2014early localized, early disseminated, and late disease. Untreated children may progress through the three stages or may present with early disseminated or late disease without having any symptoms of the earlier stages. If children are treated in the early stage, it is uncommon to see them with late disease. Nursing assessment for Lyme disease includes an accurate health history as well as physical examination. Health History Explore the health history for a tick bite. Document onset of rash. In early localized disease, the rash usually occurs 7 to 14 days after the tick bite (though it can appear 3 to 32 days after the bite). In early disseminated disease, the rash usually begins 3 to 5 weeks after the tick bite. Note complaints of fever, malaise, mild neck stiffness, headache, fatigue, myalgia, and arthralgia or pain in the joints. In late disease, note recurrent arthritis of the large joints, such as the knees, beginning weeks to months after the tick bite. The child with late disease may or may not have a history of earlier stages of the disease, including erythema migrans. Physical Examination Observe for a rash. A ring-like rash at the site of the tick bite (erythema migrans) characterizes early local disease ( Fig. 15.4 ). If untreated, the rash gradually expands and will remain for 1 to 2 weeks. Suspect early disseminated disease if multiple areas of erythema migrans are found. The multiple lesions are usually smaller than the primary lesions. Note cranial nerve palsies (especially cranial nerve VII), conjunctivitis, or signs of meningeal irritation, which occur in early disseminated disease. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Immunoglobulin-specific antibody tests may not be positive in the early stage of the disease but may be useful in the later stages. The CDC recommends a two-step test\u2014a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or immuno-fluorescent assay (IFA), if positive, followed by a Western immunoblot (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011g). If these are negative, no further testing is indicated.FIGURE 15.4 Erythema migrans, a ring-like rash at the site of the tick bite, occurs in Lyme disease. (CDC/James Gathany. [2007]. Obtained at http://phil.cdc.gov/phil/details.asp?pid=9875 ) Nursing Management Administer antibiotics as ordered. In the hospitalized child, no transmission-based precautions are necessary. Educate the child and family on the importance of taking the antibiotic as directed and finishing all the medicine. Another important nursing function is educating the child, family, and community on prevention measures ( Box 15.5 ). For infection to occur, typically the tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011e). Therefore, prompt removal of ticks is essential to the prevention of Lyme disease. Teaching Guidelines 15.2 gives information on tick removal. BOX 15.5 PREVENTION OF TICK-BORNE ILLNESSES Wear appropriate protective clothing when entering tick-infested areas. Clothing should fit tightly around wrists, waists, and ankles. Tuck pants into socks if possible. After leaving the area, check for ticks and remove them promptly. Insect repellent may provide temporary relief but may produce toxicity, especially in children, if used frequently or in large doses. Teaching Guidelines 15.2 TICK REMOVAL Use fine-tipped tweezers. Protect fingers with a tissue, paper towel, or latex gloves. Grasp tick as close to the skin as possible and pull upward with steady, even pressure. Do not twist or jerk the tick. Once the tick is removed, clean site with soap and water and wash your hands. Save the tick for identification in case the child becomes sick. Place in a sealable plastic bag and put it in your freezer. Write date of bite on the bag.Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is the most severe and frequently reported rickettsial illness in the United States (Siberry & Dumler, 2007). RMSF is caused by the bacteria Rickettsia rickettsii. The American dog tick and Rocky Mountain wood tick are the primary vectors, although others have been implicated. RMSF can be fatal without prompt and appropriate treatment (Siberry & Dumler, 2007). Most cases occur between April and September (Siberry & Dumler, 2007). RMSF occurs throughout the United States. Its name is derived from the fact that it was discovered in the Rocky Mountain region, though few cases are found there today. RMSF is more common in the coastal Atlantic states, but the highest incidence has been found in North Carolina and Oklahoma. It occurs in all age groups but most frequently in children, with the peak incidence in children younger than 10 years of age (Siberry & Dumler, 2007). Complications of RMSF include noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, cerebral edema, and multiorgan damage. Long-term neurologic involvement, such as partial paralysis of the lower extremities, hearing loss, loss of bladder and bowel control, movement disorders, and language disorders, may be seen, especially in children with severe illness who require long hospital stays. Therapeutic Management The fatality rate from RMSF has decreased with the widespread use of antimicrobial therapy (Siberry & Dumler, 2007). However, delays in diagnosis and therapy are significant factors associated with severity of disease and death. In most cases RMSF resolves rapidly with appropriate antibiotic therapy, especially if it is started early. Treatments of choice are tetracyclines, such as doxycycline. Doxycycline and other tetracyclines are not normally used in children younger than 8 years due to the risk of teeth staining. However, due to the life-threatening nature of RMSF and the limited course of antibiotic therapy, the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases revised its recommendations and has identified doxycycline as the drug of choice for treating presumed or confirmed RMSF in children of any age (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010n). Length of treatment is 7 to 14 days (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010n). Nursing Assessment Note history of early signs of RMSF, such as sudden onset of fever, headache, malaise, nausea and vomiting, muscle pain, and anorexia. The incubation period varies from 2 to 14 days, with the average being around 7 days after the tick bite. Late signs include a rash, usually seen 2 to 5 days after the onset of the fever, abdominal pain, joint pain, and diarrhea. Inspect the skin for a rash, which starts as small, pink, macular, nonitchy, blanch-able spots on the wrists, forearms, and ankles. The rash then spreads rapidly over the entire body, including the soles and palms. After several days the rash will appear red, spotted, and petechial or hemorrhagic ( Fig. 15.5 ). Approximately 5% of children with RMSF do not have a rash (Siberry & Dumler, 2007). Laboratory findings may include a low leukocyte count, low or decreasing platelet count, and hyponatremia. Biopsy of the rash with immunofluorescent assay and serologic tests may also be used. Nursing Management Nursing management is similar to that for Lyme disease. Educate the family about completing the antibiotic course, preventing tick bites, and appropriate tick removal (refer to Box 15.5 and Teaching Guidelines 15.2 ).FIGURE 15.5 Rash associated with Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Take Note! Many folklore remedies exist for tick removal such as use of petroleum jelly or hot matches. These often do little to get the tick to detach and may actually irritate the tick and stimulate it to release more saliva or gut contents, therefore increasing the chance of disease. The goal of tick removal is to detach it as quickly as possible (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011h).PARASITIC AND HELMINTHIC INFECTIONS Parasites are organisms larger than yeast or bacteria that can cause infection. They live in or on a host. Parasites receive nourishment from the host without benefiting or killing the host. Parasites frequently seen in children are scabies and head lice. A helminth is a parasitic intestinal worm. Helminthic infections seen in children include pinworms, roundworms, and hookworms. Children are at an increased risk for parasitic or helminthic infections due to poor hygiene practices. For example, children typically are more careless about hand washing and they tend to put things in their mouths and share toys and objects with other children. Nursing Assessment and Management Parents are often embarrassed when they find out that their child has a parasitic or helminthic infection. Reassure them that these infections can occur in any child. Tables 15.6 and 15.7 give nursing assessment and management information related to specific common parasitic and helminthic infections in children. Take Note! The head louse is becoming increasingly resistant to pediculicides (Diamantis, Morrell, & Burkhart, 2009). This may lead parents to resort to home remedies, such as covering the head with real mayonnaise or Vaseline. Inform parents that these remedies have not been proven to be effective (Durani, 2011). Consider This! A s the nurse in a pediatric clinic, you receive a call from a frantic mother. She tells you, \"The school sent my daughter home and told me she has lice! We are clean people! I don't understand how this could happen!\" How would you address her concerns? Discuss the plan of care for this child. What education and interventions will be necessary to prevent the spread of pediculosis capitis? SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), commonly called sexually transmitted diseases, are infectious diseases transmitted through sexual contact, including oral, vaginal, or anal intercourse. Certain infections can be transmitted in utero to the fetus or during childbirth to the newborn leading to miscarriage, stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy, pre-term delivery, birth defects, and illness of disease (March of Dimes, 2008). Table 15.8 gives information on specific STIs and their effects on the fetus or newborn. Chapter 26 provides information related to HIV. STIs are a major health concern for adolescents. The rates of many STIs are highest in adolescents (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010h). It is estimated that one in four adolescent women in the United States has an STI (Holland-Hall, 2008). Adolescents are at a greater risk for developing STIs for a variety of reasons, including frequency of unprotected intercourse, being biologically more susceptible to infection, engaging in partnerships of limited duration, and possible difficulty accessing the health care system (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010h). Detection of STIs in infants and children is an important warning sign of potential sexual abuse. Due to the serious implications that a diagnosis of an STI can have in children, only tests that have high specificities and that can isolate an organism should be used. Also, treatment for the child with a suspected STI may be delayed until a definitive diagnosis can be made. Nursing Assessment Many health care providers fail to assess sexual behavior and STI risks, to screen for asymptomatic infection during clinic visits, or to counsel adolescents on STI risk reduction. Nurses need to remember that they play a key role in the detection, prevention, and treatment of STIs in adolescents and children. All states allow adolescents to give consent to confidential STI testing and treatment. Table 15.9 discusses common clinical manifestations of specific STIs in adolescents. Nursing Management Encourage the child or adolescent to complete the antibiotic prescription. Prevention of STIs among children and adolescents is critical. Health care providers have a unique opportunity to provide counseling and education in this setting. Adapt the style, content, and message to the child or adolescent's developmental level. Identify risk factors and risk behaviors and help the adolescent develop specific individualized actions for prevention. This conversation needs to be direct and nonjudgmental. Encourage adolescents to postpone sexual intercourse for as long as possible, but explain the need to use barrier methods, such as male and female condoms, if they choose to have sexual intercourse. For teens who have already had sexual intercourse, encourage abstinence at this point. Also encourage them to minimize their lifetime number of sexual partners, to use barrier methods consistently and correctly, and to be aware of the connection between drug and alcohol use and sexual activity (see Teaching Guideline 15.3 , Table 15.10 , and Healthy People 2020). Teaching Guidelines 15.3 PROPER CONDOM USE Use latex condoms. Use a new condom with each act of sexual intercourse. Never reuse a condom. Handle condoms with care to prevent damage from sharp objects such as fingernails and teeth. Ensure condom has been stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Do not store condoms in wallet or automobile or anywhere they would be exposed to extreme temperatures. Do not use a condom if it appears brittle, sticky, or discolored. These are signs of aging. Put condom on before any genital contact. Put condom on when penis is erect with rolled side out. Ensure it is placed so it will readily unroll. Hold the tip of the condom while unrolling. Ensure there is a space at the tip for semen to collect (about \u00bd inch), but make sure no air is trapped in the tip (air bubbles can cause breakage). Ensure adequate lubrication during intercourse. If external lubricants are used, use only water-based lubricants such as KY Jelly with latex condoms. Oil-based or petroleum-based lubricants, such as body lotion, massage oil, or cooking oil, can weaken latex condoms. If you feel the condom break, stop immediately, withdraw, remove broken condom, and replace. Withdraw while penis is still erect, and hold condom firmly against base of penis. Remove carefully to ensure no semen spills out.Dispose of properly. Adapted from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2010). Male latex condoms and sexually transmitted diseases.

KEY CONCEPTS Infants and young children are more susceptible to infection due to their immature immune system. Young children continue to have an increased risk for infections and communicable disorders because disease protection from immunizations is not complete. Health care providers need to remember to educate parents that fever is a protective mechanism the body uses to fight infection. When obtaining blood cultures, follow aseptic technique and hospital protocol to prevent contamination. Obtain the specimen before administering antibiotics. When administering antipyretics, proper education must be given to caregivers on appropriate dosing, concentration, dosing interval, and use of proper measuring device. Promoting proper fluid balance and reducing temperature in a febrile child are important nursing interventions when caring for a child with an infection or communicable illness. Many childhood infectious and communicable diseases involve a rash. Rashes can be difficult to identify, so a thorough description and history from the caregiver is important. Sepsis, a systemic overresponse to infection resulting from bacteria, fungi, viruses, or parasites, can lead to septic shock. Anyinfant younger than 3 months old with a fever or any child with a fever accompanied by extreme lethargy, unresponsiveness, or lack of facial expressions should be seen by a physician or nurse practitioner. Many bacterial and viral infections, such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, mumps, measles, rubella, varicella, and poliomyelitis, can be prevented by vaccination. Viral exanthems of childhood often present with a distinct rash pattern that assists in the diagnosis of the virus. Common childhood exanthems (fifth disease). Nurses play a key role in educating the public on the importance of immunizations. Zoonotic infections are diseases caused by infectious agents that are transmitted directly or indirectly from animals to humans. Cat scratch disease and rabies are types of zoonotic infections. Children are at a particular risk for contracting vector-borne diseases, which are diseases transmitted by ticks, mosquitoes, or other insect vectors. Two of the most commonly seen are Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Parasites frequently seen in children are scabies and head lice. Helminthic infections seen in children include pinworms, roundworms, and hookworms. STIs are infectious diseases transmitted through sexual contact, including oral, vaginal, or anal intercourse. Certain infections can be transmitted in utero to the fetus or during childbirth to the newborn. STIs are a major health concern for adolescents. Adolescents are at a greater risk for developing STIs for a variety of reasons, including frequency of unprotected intercourse, being biologically more susceptible to infection, engaging in partnerships of limited duration, and possible difficulty accessing the health care system (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010h).

Today he is lethargic with a weak cry and is vomiting his feeds. Neurologic disorders in children often have a devastating and lasting impact. Neurologic disorders can be divided into several categories, including structural disorders, seizure disorders, infectious disorders, trauma to the neurologic system, blood flow disruption disorders, and chronic disorders. Nurses must be familiar with neurologic conditions affecting children in order to provide prevention, prompt treatment, guidance, and support to families. Neurologic disorders require acute interventions, but many times have long-lasting implications on the child's health and development. Due to the potentially devastating effects that neurologic disorders can have on children and their families, nurses need to be skilled in assessment and interventions in this area and must be able to provide support throughout the course of the illness and beyond.VARIATIONS IN PEDIATRIC ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY Neurologic disorders can result from congenital problems as well as from infections or traumas. Certain neurologic conditions occur in children more often than adults and these conditions will affect their growth and development. In addition, children are at an increased risk for different neurologic problems compared to adults due to anatomic and physiologic differences. Brain and Spinal Cord Development The brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system (CNS) . Development of these structures occurs in the first 3 to 4 weeks of gestation from the neural tube . Infection, trauma, teratogens (any environmental substance that can cause physical defects in the developing embryo and fetus), and malnutrition during this period can result in malformations in brain and spinal cord development and may affect normal CNS development. At birth, the cranial bones are not well developed and are not fused. Therefore, there is an increased risk for fracture. The brain is highly vascular, leading to an increased risk for hemorrhage. Premature infants are at greater risk for brain damage; the more premature the infant, the greater the risk. The premature infant has more capillaries in the periventricular area, which is the brain tissue that lines the outside of the lateral ventricles. These capillaries are fragile and at greater risk for rupture, leading to intracranial bleeding. Also, because the cranium is very soft in the preterm infant, external pressure can change its shape and cause increased pressure in areas of the brain and possible hemorrhage. The sutures and fontanels present in the newborn help make the skull more flexible and help to accommodate for brain growth that continues after birth. Closure of the fontanels too early or too late can be indicative of problems with brain growth. The child's spine is very mobile, especially the cervical spine region, resulting in a high risk for cervical spine injury. Nervous System The development of the nervous system is complete but immature at birth. The infant is born with all the nerve cells that he or she will have throughout life. However, myelinization , the formation of myelin, which covers and protects the nerves, is incomplete. The speed and accuracy of nerve impulses increases as myelinization increases. This process accounts for the acquisition of fine and gross motor movements and coordination in early childhood. Myelinization proceeds in the cephalocaudal direction. For example, infants are able to control the head and neck before the trunk and extremities. The immaturity of the CNS in preterm infants can result in delayed development of motor skills. Premature newborns may have difficulty coordinating sucking and swallowing, leading to feeding and growth issues. Also, episodes of apnea can be problematic in the preterm newborn due to the underdevelopment of the nervous system. Head Size The head of the infant and young child is large in proportion to the body. The head of an infant accounts for a quarter of the body height; in adults it accounts for one eighth of the body height ( Fig. 16.1 ). In addition, the infant's and child's neck muscles are not well developed. Both of these differences lead to an increased incidence of head injury from falls. The head is the fastest growing body part during infancy and continues to grow until the child is 5 years old.COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS A variety of interventions, including medical treatments and medications, are used to treat neurologic illness in children. Most of these treatments will require a physician's or nurse practitioner's order when the child is hospitalized. The most common treatments and medications used for neurologic disorders are listed in Common Medical Treatments 16.1 and Drug Guide 16.1 . NURSING PROCESS OVERVIEW FOR THE CHILD WITH A NEUROLOGIC DISORDER Care of the child with a neurologic disorder includes assessment, nursing diagnosis, planning, intervention, and evaluation. There are a number of general concepts related to the nursing process that can be applied to the management of neurologic disorders. From a general understanding of the care involved for a child with neurologic dysfunction, the nurse can then individualize the care based on the particular child's specifics. Remember Antonio, the 3-month-old with lethargy, a weak cry, and vomiting? What additional health history and physical examination assessment information should the nurse obtain? Assessment Assessment of neurologic dysfunction in children includes health history, physical examination, and laboratory and diagnostic testing. Take Note! Neurologic assessment should proceed from least invasive to most invasive. The use of toys and familiar objects, as well as incorporating play, will help promote cooperation from the child. Health History The health history consists of past medical history, including the mother's pregnancy history, family history, and history of present illness (when the symptoms started and how they have progressed) as well as treatments used at home. The past medical history might be significant for prematurity, difficult birth, infection during pregnancy, nausea, vomiting, headaches, changes in gait, falls, visual disturbances, or recent trauma. Family history might be significant for genetic disorders with neurologic manifestations, seizure disorders, or headaches. When eliciting the history of the present illness, inquire about the following: Nausea Vomiting Changes in gait Visual disturbances Complaints of headaches Recent trauma Changes in cognition Change in consciousness, including any loss of consciousness Poor feeding Lethargy Increased irritability Fever Neck pain Altered muscle tonicity Delays in growth and development Ingestion or inhalation of neurotoxic substances or chemicals Physical Examination Physical examination of the nervous system consists of inspection and observation, palpation, and auscultation. INSPECTION AND OBSERVATION Specific areas to inspect and observe include: Level of consciousness (LOC) Vital signs Head, face, and neck Cranial nerve function Motor function Reflexes Sensory function Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) (a rise in the normal pressure within the skull) Level of Consciousness. Begin the physical examination with inspection and observation. Observe the child's LOC, noting a decrease or significant changes. LOC is the earliest indicator of improvement or deterioration of neurologic status. Extreme irritability or lethargy is considered an abnormal finding. Consciousness consists of alertness, which is a wakeful state and includes the ability to respond to stimuli, and cognition, which includes the ability to process stimuli and demonstrate a verbal or motor response. Five different states constitute the levels of consciousness: 1. Full consciousness is defined as a state in which the child is awake and alert; is oriented to time, place, and person; and exhibits age-appropriate behaviors.2. Confusion is defined as a state in which disorientation exists. The child may be alert but responds inappropriately to questions. 3. Obtunded is defined as a state in which the child has limited responses to the environment and falls asleep unless stimulation is provided. 4. Stupor exists when the child only responds to vigorous stimulation. 5. Coma defines a state in which the child cannot be aroused, even with painful stimuli. Take Note! Lack of response to painful stimuli is abnormal and can indicate a life-threatening condition. Report this finding immediately. The Pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale is a popular scale used to standardize degree of consciousness. It consists of three parts: eye opening, verbal response, and motor response ( Fig. 16.2 ). When assessing LOC in children, consider that the infant or child may not respond to unfamiliar voices in an unfamiliar environment. Therefore, it may be helpful to have a parent present to elicit the response. Take Note! Parents will often be the first to notice changes in their child's LOC. Listen to parents and respond to their concerns. Vital Signs. Assessment of vital signs can provide probable underlying causes for altered LOC as well as reveal the adequacy of oxygenation and circulation. Certain neurologic conditions like cerebral infections, increased ICP, coma, brain stem injury, or head injuries can cause alterations in the child's vital signs. Head, Face, and Neck. Inspect and observe the head for size and shape. Abnormal skull shape can result from premature closure or widening of sutures. Inspect and observe the face for symmetry. Asymmetry may occur due to paralysis of certain cranial nerves, position in utero, or swelling caused by trauma. Assess range of motion of the neck. Alterations in range of motion can indicate CNS infections such as meningitis. The most dramatic increase in brain volume occurs during the last 3 months of fetal development and the first 2 years of life. The relationship between head and brain growth explains why head circumference is a standard assessment made in children younger than 3 years of age. All children younger than 3 years old, and any child whose head size is questionable, should have their head circumference measured and plotted on a growth chart (see Appendix A for growth charts). Assessment of the growth trend of the head is important in detecting potential neurologic conditions. Report and investigate any variation in head circumference percentiles over time because variations may indicate abnormal brain or skull growth. A smaller than normal head circumference , which measures around the child's head at the largest area, may indicate microcephaly, and a larger than normal head circumference may indicate hydrocephalus. Take Note! Do not attempt any assessment that involves movement of the head and neck in cases of trauma or suspected trauma until cervical injury is ruled out. Maintain complete immobilization of the cervical spine until that time. Cranial Nerve Function. Techniques of assessment of cranial nerve function are similar to techniques for adult assessment. The method of obtaining responses may vary based on age and developmental level of the child. Certain elements of the adult assessment may be omitted. Alterations in cranial nerve function can be the result of compression of a specific nerve, infection, or trauma leading to brain injury. Refer to Table 16.1 for an explanation of cranial nerve assessment in children. Use the doll's eyes maneuver to evaluate cranial nerves III, IV, and VI. This maneuver can be helpful when assessing an infant, uncooperative child, or comatose child. It examines horizontal and vertical eye movements by turning the head in one direction and assessing if the eyes move symmetrically in the other direction. For example, if you suddenly turn the child's head to the right, the child's eyes should look to the left symmetrically. Assess vertical eye movements in a similar manner by flexing or extending the neck. Absence of expected eye movements may indicate increased ICP. When assessing oculomotor function, be sure to note nystagmus or sunset appearance of the eyes. Observe for nystagmus by looking for involuntary, rapid, rhythmic eye movements that may be present at rest or with eye movement. Horizontal nystagmus may occur with lesions in the brain stem and can be the result of certain medications (phenytoin in particular). Vertical nystagmus indicates brain stem dysfunction. Sunsetting is when the sclera of the eyes is showing over the top of the iris ( Fig. 16.3 ). Sunset eyes may indicate increased ICP as seen in hydrocephalus. Pupillary response is often abnormal when a neurologic disorder is present. Refer to Figure 16.4 for illustrations of varied pupillary responses. Take Note! Immediately report the sudden presence of fixed and dilated pupils. Motor Function. Observe muscle strength, size, and tone in the infant or child. Assess bilaterally and compare. Observe spontaneous activity, posture, and balance and assess for asymmetric movements. In the infant, observe resting posture, which will normally be a slightly flexed posture. The infant should be able to extend extremities to a normal stretch. Alterations in motor function, like changes in gait, muscle tone, or strength, may indicate certain neurologic problems such as increased ICP, head injury, and cerebral infections. Because cortical control of motor function is lost in certain neurologic disorders, postural reflexes reemerge and are directly related to the area of the brain that is damaged. Therefore, it is important to assess for two distinct types of posturing that may occur. Decorticate posturing occurs with damage of the cerebral cortex ( Fig. 16.5A ). Decerebrate posturing occurs with damage at the level of the brain stem ( Fig. 16.5B ). Both types of posturing are characterized by extremely rigid muscle tone. Reflexes. Testing of deep tendon reflexes is part of the neurologic assessment, just as it is in adults. Testing of primitive and protective reflexes in the infant is important because infants cannot perform tasks on command. The Moro, tonic neck, and withdrawal reflexes are important in assessing neurologic health in infants. Refer to Chapter 3 for a further explanation of primitive and protective reflexes in infants (see Chapter 3 , Table 3.2 ). Absence of certain reflexes, persistence of primitive reflexes after age of normal disappearance, or increases in reflexes may be present in specific neurologic conditions.Sensory Function. When assessing the child, use techniques similar to those used in the adult assessment. Make sure to explain what you are doing to the child, especially before the pinprick test, to gain continued cooperation. When assessing sensory function, the child should be able to distinguish between light touch, pain, vibration, heat, and cold. When assessing an infant, limit the examination to responses to touch or pain. The normal response in a 4-month-old infant will be movement away from the stimulus. Alterations in sensory function can result from brain or spinal cord lesions. Increased Intracranial Pressure. Observe for signs and symptoms associated with increased ICP while caring for a child with a potential or suspected neurologic disorder. Refer to Comparison Chart 16.1 for early versus late signs and symptoms of increased ICP. Increased ICP is a sign that may occur with many neurologic disorders. It may result from head trauma, birth trauma, hydrocephalus, infection, and brain tumors. As ICP increases, LOC decreases and the signs and symptoms will become more pronounced. It is essential to recognize early signs and symptoms of increased ICP and intervene immediately to prevent long-term damage and possible death. PALPATION Palpation of the newborn and infant skull and fontanels is an important function of the neurologic examination. Changes in size or fullness of the fontanels may exist in certain neurologic conditions and must be noted. A bulging fontanel can be a sign of increased ICP and is seen in such neurologic disorders as hydrocephalus and head traumas. It is normal for the fontanels to be full or bulging during crying; take this into consideration during assessment. Note any premature closure of fontanels, which can indicate skull deformities such as craniosynostosis. The posterior fontanel normally closes by 2 months of age and the anterior fontanel normally closes by 12 to 18 months of age. In children with hydrocephalus, widening of the fontanels may be noted, along with a tense appearance and a resulting increase in head circumference. AUSCULTATION Physicians or nurse practitioners may perform auscultation of the skull. Soft, symmetric bruits may be found in children younger than 4 years of age or in children with acute febrile illness. A finding of a loud or localized bruit is usually significant and requires immediate further investigation. Increased ICP, resulting from conditions such as hydrocephalus, tumor, or meningitis, frequently produces intracranial bruits. Arterial venous malformations may also produce large bruits. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 16.1 offers an explanation of the most commonly used laboratory and diagnostic tests utilized when considering neurologic disorders. The tests can assist the physician or nurse practitioner in diagnosing the disorder and/or serve as guidelines in determining ongoing treatment. Laboratory or nonnursing personnel obtain some of the tests, while the nurse might obtain others. In either instance, it is important to be familiar with how the tests are obtained, what they are used for, and normal versus abnormal results. This knowledge will also be necessary when providing child and family education related to the testing. Many of these tests, such as lumbar puncture (LP; see Fig. 16.6 ), can be frightening to parents and the child. Prepare the family and the child and provide support and reassurance during and after the test or procedure. After completing an assessment of Antonio, the nurse noted the following: a full anterior fontanel; when being held, Antonio was inconsolable; when lying still, he was calmer and in the opisthotonic position. Nursing Diagnoses and Related Interventions Upon completion of a thorough assessment, the nurse might identify several nursing diagnoses, including: Decreased intracranial adaptive capacity Risk for ineffective tissue perfusion: cerebral Risk for injury Disturbed sensory perception Risk for infection Pain Self-care deficit (specify) Impaired physical mobility Risk for delayed development Imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements Risk for deficient fluid volume Deficient knowledge (specify) Interrupted family processes Nursing goals, interventions, and evaluation for the child with a neurologic disorder are based on the nursing diagnoses. Based on the assessment findings, what would be your top three prioritized nursing diagnoses for Antonio? Nursing Care Plan 16.1 may be used as a guide in planning nursing care for the child with a neurologic disorder. It should be individualized based on the child's symptoms and needs. Additional information will be included later in this chapter related to specific disorders. Based on your top three nursing diagnoses for Antonio, describe appropriate nursing interventions.FIGURE 16.1 Proportion of head to body height in the newborn, child, and adult.

Most seizures are caused by disorders that originate outside of the brain such as a high fever, infection, head trauma, hypoxia, toxins, or cardiac arrhythmias. Less than one third of seizures in children are caused by epilepsy (Johnston, 2007). Seizure disorders discussed below include epilepsy, febrile seizures, and neonatal seizures. Epilepsy Epilepsy is a condition in which seizures are triggered recurrently from within the brain. Epilepsy is a common neurologic disorder discovered in childhood, although brain injury or infection can cause epilepsy at any age. Two or more unprovoked seizures, which occur more than 24 hours apart, is indicative of epilepsy (Cavazos & Spitz, 2009; Johnston, 2007; Zak & Chan, 2010). The prognosis for most children with seizures associated with epilepsy is good. Many children will outgrow epilepsy, but some children will have persistent seizures that are difficult to manage and may be unresponsive to pharmacologic interventions. Living with a seizure disorder may have a devastating impact on the quality of life of the child and family. Pathophysiology Epilepsy is a complex disorder of the CNS in which brain function is affected. Recurrent or unprovoked seizures are the clinical manifestation of epilepsy and result from a disruption of electrical communication among the neurons of the brain. This disruption results from an imbalance between the excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms in the brain, causing the neurons to either fire when they are not supposed to or not fire when they should. Epilepsy has numerous causes. It may be acquired and related to brain injury or it may be a familial tendency, but in many cases the cause is unknown (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010c). There are two major categories of seizures\u2014partial and generalized seizures. In partial seizures only one area of the brain is involved, while general seizures involve the entire brain. Partial seizures account for a large portion of childhood seizures and are classified as simple or complex (Johnston, 2007). Generalized seizures include infantile spasms, absence seizures, tonicclonic seizures, myoclonic seizures, and atonic seizures. There are many different types of seizures, and the classification of the type of seizure is crucial in assisting with the management and control of seizures. Not all cases are easily classified. The most common seizure types are discussed in Table 16.2 . NURSING CARE PLAN 16.1 Overview for the Child with a Neurologic Disorder NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Decreased intracranial adaptive capacity related to compression of brain tissue due to increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or cerebral edema secondary to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) resulting from brain injury, congenital structural defects, brain tumor, decreased reabsorption of CSF, or shunt malfunction as evidenced by vomiting, headache, complaints of visual disturbances, decreased pulse and respirations, elevated blood pressure or pulse pressure, changes in level of consciousness, increased head circumference, or bulging fontanel Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will remain free of signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure as evidenced by remaining free of headache, vomiting, vision disturbances, vital signs within parameters for age, no signs of altered levels of consciousness, able to maintain effective breathing pattern, free of excessive irritability or lethargy, head circumference within parameters for age. Interventions: Promoting Adequate Intracranial Adaptive Capacity Assess neurologic status closely, and monitor for signs and symptoms of increased ICP: changes in level of consciousness, signs of irritability or lethargy, and changes in pupillary reaction can indicate changes in ICP. Monitor vital signs: decreased pulse and respiratory rate and increased blood pressure or pulse pressure can indicate increased ICP. Measure head circumference in children younger than 3 years of age: increases in head circumference outside parameters for age can indicate increased ICP. Elevate head of bed 15-30 degrees to facilitate venous return and help to reduce ICP. Minimize environmental stimuli and noise, and avoid pain-producing procedures if possible: all can increase ICP. Have emergency equipment ready and available: increased ICP can result in respiratory or cardiac failure. Notify physician or nurse practitioner immediately if changes in assessment are noted: early intervention is critical to prevent neurologic damage and death. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for ineffective (cerebral) tissue perfusion related to increased ICP, alteration in blood flow secondary to hemorrhage, vessel malformation, cerebral edema Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will exhibit adequate cerebral tissue perfusion through course of illness and childhood: child will remain alert and oriented with no signs of altered level ofconsciousness; vital signs will be within parameters for age; motor, sensory, and cognitive function will be within parameters for age; head circumference will remain within parameters for age. Interventions: Promoting Adequate Tissue Perfusion Assess neurologic status closely, and monitor for signs and symptoms of increased ICP: changes in level of consciousness, signs of irritability or lethargy, and changes in pupillary reaction can indicate decreased cerebral tissue perfusion. Monitor vital signs: decreased pulse and respiratory rate and increased blood pressure or pulse pressure can indicate increased ICP, which can lead to decreased cerebral perfusion. Have emergency equipment ready and available: decreased cerebral perfusion can result in respiratory or cardiac failure. Notify physician or nurse practitioner immediately if changes in assessment are noted: early intervention is critical to prevent neurologic damage and death. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for injury related to altered level of consciousness, weakness, dizziness, ataxia, loss of muscle coordination secondary to seizure activity Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will remain free of injury as evidenced by no signs of aspiration or traumatic injury. Interventions: Preventing Injury Ensure child has patent airway and adequate oxygenation (have suction, oxygen available at bedside) and place child in side-lying position if possible: a child with altered level of consciousness may not be able to manage his or her secretions and is at risk for aspiration and ineffective airway clearance; providing suction and oxygenation can help ensure an open airway and the side-lying position can help secretions drain and prevent obstruction of airway or aspiration. Protect child from hurting self during seizures or changes in level of consciousness by removing environmental obstacles, easing child to lying position, and padding side rails: helps to keep environment safe. Institute seizure precautions for any child at risk for seizure activity (see Box 16.2 ) to help prevent injury that can result from acute seizure activity. With seizure activity do not insert a tongue blade or restrain child: can lead to injury to caregiver and child. Administer anticonvulsant medications as ordered: will help to promote cessation and prevention of seizure activity. Assist child with ambulation to help prevent injury in child with weakness, dizziness, or ataxia. Allow for periods of rest to prevent fatigue and decrease risk of injury. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Disturbed sensory perception related to presence of neurologic lesion or pressure on sensory or motor nerves secondary to increased ICP, presence of tumor, swelling post-operatively as evidenced by visual disturbances (i.e., reports of double vision), pupillary changes, nystagmus, ataxia, balance disturbances, or loss of response to stimuli Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will be free of changes in sensory perception or will remain at baseline as evidenced by no complaints of double vision, PERRLA, no disturbances of gait or balance noted, and no increase in loss of responses to stimuli. Interventions: Managing Disturbed Sensory Perception Assess for changes in sensory perception: provides baseline data and allows nurse to recognize change in sensory perception early. Monitor child for risk of injury secondary to changes in sensory perception: visual changes and disturbances of gait or balance increase child's risk for injury. Notify physician or nurse practitioner of changes in sensory perception: can indicate increased ICP and medical emergency. Assist child to learn to use adaptive methods to live with permanent changes in sensory perception (i.e., use of eyeglasses) and maximize the use of intact senses: adaptive devices can enhance sensory input and intact senses can often compensate for impaired senses. Provide familiar sounds (voices, music): can help relieve anxiety related to changes in sensory perception, especially visual changes. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for infection related to surgical interventions, presence of foreign body (i.e., shunt), trauma to skull, nutritional deficiencies, stasis of pulmonary secretions and urine, presence of infectious organisms as evidenced by fever, poor feeding, decreased responsiveness, and presence of virus or bacteria on laboratory screening Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will exhibit no signs or symptoms of local or systemic infection and will not spread infection to others: symptoms of infection will decrease over time; others will remain free of infection. Interventions: Preventing Infection Monitor vital signs: elevation in temperature can indicate presence of infection. Monitor incision sites for signs of local infection: redness, warmth, drainage, swelling, and pain at incision site can indicate presence of infection. Maintain aseptic technique\u2014practice good hand washing and use proper technique when managing postoperative incisions and external shunts to prevent introduction of further infectious agents. Administer antibiotics as prescribed to prevent or treat bacterial infection. Encourage nutritious diet and proper hydration according to child's preferences and ability to feed orally to assist body's natural defenses against infection. Isolate the child as required to prevent nosocomial spread of infection. Teach child and family preventive measures such as good hand washing, covering mouth and nose upon cough or sneeze, and adequate disposal of used tissues to prevent nosocomial or community spread of infection. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Self-care deficit (specify) related to neuromuscular impairments; cognitive deficits as evidenced by an inability to perform hygiene care and transfer self independently Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will demonstrate ability to care for self within age parameters and limits of disease: child is able to feed, dress, and manage elimination within limits of diseaseand age. Interventions: Maximizing Self-Care Introduce child and family to self-help methods as soon as possible: promotes independence from the beginning. Encourage family and staff to allow child to do as much as possible: allows child to gain confidence and independence. Teach specific measures for bowel and urinary elimination as needed: promotes independence and increases self-care abilities and self-esteem. Collaborate with physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy departments to provide child and family with appropriate tools to modify environment and methods to promote transferring and self-care: allows for maximum functioning. Praise accomplishments and emphasize child's abilities: helps improve self-esteem and encourages feeling of confidence and competence. Balance activity with periods to rest to reduce fatigue and increase energy for self-care. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Impaired physical mobility related to muscle weakness, hypertonicity, impaired coordination, loss of muscle function or control as evidenced by an inability to move extremities, to ambulate without assistance, to move without limitations Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will be able to engage in activities within age parameters and limits of disease: child is able to move extremities, move about environment, and participate in exercise programs within limits of age and disease. Interventions: Maximizing Physical Mobility Encourage gross and fine motor activities: facilitates motor development. Collaborate with physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy departments to strengthen muscles and promote optimal mobility: facilitates motor development. Utilize passive and active range of motion (ROM) and teach child and family how to perform: prevents contractures and facilitates joint mobility and muscle development (active ROM) to help increase mobility. Praise accomplishments and emphasize child's abilities: helps improve self-esteem and encourages feeling of confidence and competence. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for delayed development related to physical disability, cognitive deficits, activity restrictions Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will demonstrate developmental milestones within age parameters and limits of disease: child expresses interest in the environment and people around him or her, and interacts with environment age appropriately. Interventions: Maximizing Development Use therapeutic play and adaptive toys: helps facilitate developmental functioning. Provide stimulating environment when possible to maximize potential for growth and development. Praise accomplishments and emphasize child's abilities: helps improve self-esteem and encourages feeling of confidence and competence. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Nutrition, imbalanced: less than body requirements related to vomiting and difficulty feeding secondary to increased ICP; difficulty sucking, swallowing, or chewing; surgical incision pain or difficulty assuming normal feeding position; inability to feed self as evidenced by decreased oral intake, impaired swallowing, weight loss Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will exhibit signs of adequate nutrition: weight will remain within parameters for age, skin turgor will be good, intake/output (I/O) will be within normal limits, adequate calories will be ingested, and vomiting will cease or decrease. Interventions: Promoting Adequate Nutrition Monitor height and weight: insufficient intake will lead to impaired growth and weight gain. Monitor hydration status (moist mucous membranes, elastic skin turgor, adequate urine output): insufficient intake can lead to dehydration. Use techniques to promote caloric and nutritional intake and teach family (i.e., positioning, modified utensils, soft or blended foods, allow extra time): these techniques can facilitate intake. Assess respiratory system frequently to assess for aspiration. Monitor for nausea and vomiting and medicate if ordered to help reduce vomiting and increase intake. Monitor for pain and medicate if ordered to help reduce pain related to surgical incisions and trauma, and increase intake. Assist family to assume as normal a feeding position as possible to help increase oral intake. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for deficient fluid volume related to vomiting, altered level of consciousness, poor feeding or intake, insensible loss due to fever, failure of regulatory mechanisms (as in diabetes insipidus) as evidenced by dry oral mucosa, decreased skin turgor, sudden weight loss, hypotension, and tachycardia Outcome Identification and Evaluation Fluid volume will be maintained and balanced: oral mucosa moist and pink, skin turgor elastic, urine output at least 1-2 ml/kg/hour. Interventions: Promoting Adequate Fluid Balance Administer intravenous (IV) fluids if ordered to maintain adequate hydration in children who are nothing by mouth (NPO) or unable to tolerate oral intake. When oral intake is allowed and tolerated, encourage oral (PO) fluids to promote intake and maintain hydration. Strict intake and output monitoring: can help identify fluid imbalance and also detect signs of abnormal pituitary secretions resulting in conditions like syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and diabetes insipidus (DI) (see Chapter 27 for further information). Maintain minimum hydration and avoid overhydration in children where cerebral edema is a concern: fluid overload can contribute to cerebral edema. Urine specific gravity, urine and serum electrolytes (especially serum sodium), blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and osmolality, and daily weights: are reliable indicators of fluid status and can also detect signs of abnormal pituitary secretions resulting in conditions like SIADH and DI.NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Knowledge deficit (specify) related to lack of information regarding complex medical condition, prognosis, and medical needs as evidenced by verbalization, questions, or actions demonstrating lack of understanding regarding child's condition or care Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child and family will verbalize accurate information and understanding about condition, prognosis, and medical needs: child and family demonstrate knowledge of condition and prognosis and medical needs including possible causes, contributing factors, and treatment measures. Interventions: Providing Child and Family Teaching Assess child's and family's willingness to learn: child and family must be willing to learn for teaching to be effective. Provide family with time to adjust to diagnosis: will help facilitate adjustment and ability to learn and participate in child's care. Repeat information: allows family and child time to learn and understand. Teach in short sessions: many short sessions are found to be more helpful than one long session. Gear teaching to a level of understanding of the child and also the family (depends on age of child, physical condition, memory) to ensure understanding. Provide reinforcement and rewards: helps facilitate the teaching-learning process. Use multiple modes of learning involving many senses (provide written, verbal, demonstration, and videos) when possible: child and family more likely to retain information when presented in different ways using many senses. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Family processes, interrupted related to child's illness, hospitalization, diagnosis of chronic illness in child, and potential long-term effects of illness as evidenced by family's presence in hospital, missed work, demonstration of inadequate coping Outcome Identification and Evaluation Family will maintain functional system of support and demonstrate adequate coping, adaptation of roles and functions, and decreased anxiety: parents are involved in child's care, ask appropriate questions, express fears and concerns, and are able to discuss child's care and condition calmly. Interventions: Promoting Adequate Family Processes Encourage parents and family members to verbalize concerns related to child's illness, diagnosis, and prognosis: allows the nurse to identify concerns and areas where further education may be needed; demonstrates family-centered care. Explain therapies, procedures, child's behaviors, and plan of care to parents: understanding the child's current status and plan of care helps decrease anxiety. Encourage parental involvement in care: allows parents to feel needed and valued with a sense of control over their child's health. Identify support system for family and child: helps nurse identify needs and resources available for coping. Educate family and child on additional resources available to help them develop a wide base of support.Therapeutic Management Management of epilepsy focuses on controlling seizures or reducing their frequency. Another focus of epilepsy management involves helping the child who has recurrent seizures and his or her family to learn to live with the seizures. The primary mode of treatment is the use of anticonvulsants. The goal for every child should be the use of the fewest drugs with the fewest possible side effects for the control of seizures. There have been significant advances in the treatment of epilepsy due to the many new anticonvulsant medications that have become available in recent years ( Table 16.3 ). Most anticonvulsants are taken orally and are often used in combination. Different medications control different types of seizures, which may be due to individual variation. It can take time to find the right combination to best control an individual's seizures. If seizures remain uncontrolled, another option for managing them is surgery. Depending on the area of the brain that is affected, it may be possible to remove the area that is responsible for the seizure activity or to interrupt the impulses from spreading and therefore stop or reduce the seizures. The adverse effects of surgery range from mild to severe, depending on the area of the brain that is affected. Other nonpharmacologic treatments that may be considered in children with intractable seizures include a ketogenic diet or placement of a vagal nerve stimulator. Refer to Common Medical Treatments 16.1 . Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 500 . Assessment findings pertinent to epilepsy are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint, which will usually involve a seizure episode. Gain information to help characterize the episode as a seizure or as a nonepileptic event (see Box 16.1 for a list of non-epileptic events). It is rare to actually observe the child having a seizure; therefore, a complete, accurate, and detailed history from a reliable source is essential. Questions should include: Where did the event occur\u2014while sleeping, eating, playing, or just after waking? Description of child's behavior during the event\u2014what types of movements, progression, length, respiratory status, apnea? How did the child act after the event? BOX 16.1 NONEPILEPTIC EVENTS Syncope Breath holding Jitteriness reflux Cardiac conduction abnormalities Migraines Tics Night terrors Benign sleep movements Have the episodes been recurrent? If so, how frequent? Any precipitating factors such as a fever, fall, activity, anxiety, infection, or exposure to strong stimuli such as flashing lights or loud noises?Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as: Family history of seizures or epilepsy Any complications during the prenatal, perinatal, or postnatal periods Changes in developmental status or delays in developmental milestones Any recent illness, fever, trauma, or toxin exposure Children known to have epilepsy are often admitted to the hospital for other health-related issues or complications and treatment of their seizure disorder. The health history should include questions related to: Age of onset of seizures Seizure control\u2014what medications is the child taking and has he or she been able to take them; when was his or her last seizure? Description and classification of seizures\u2014does the child lose consciousness; does the child become apneic? Precipitating factors that may contribute to onset of seizures Adverse effects related to anticonvulsant medications Compliance with medication regimen Physical Examination Perform a complete neurologic examination. Careful assessment of the child's mental status, language, learning, behavior, and motor abilities can help provide information about any neurologic deficits. If you observe seizure activity directly, provide a thorough and accurate description of the event. This description needs to include: Time of onset and length of seizure activity Alterations in behavior such as a cry or changes in facial expression, motor abilities, or sensory alterations before the seizure that may indicate an aura Precipitating factors such as fever, anxiety, just waking, or eating Description of movements and any progression Description of respiratory effort and any apnea noted Changes in color (pallor or cyanosis) noted Position of mouth, any injury to mouth or tongue, inability to swallow, or excessive salivation Loss of bladder or bowel control State of consciousness during seizure and postictal (after seizure) state\u2014during the seizure the nurse may ask the child to remember a word; after the seizure, assess if child is able to recall it, to help accurately establish current mental state Assess orientation to person, place, and time; motor abilities; speech; behavior; alterations in sensation postictally Duration of postictal state Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Laboratory and diagnostic tests are used to evaluate the cause of, and also aid in identifying the type of, seizure activity (refer to Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 16.1 ). Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the diagnosis and assessment of epilepsy include: Serum glucose, electrolytes, and calcium\u2014to rule out metabolic as hypoglycemia and hypocalcemia Lumbar puncture\u2014to analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to rule out meningitis or encephalitis Skull x-ray examinations\u2014to evaluate for the presence of fracture or trauma Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies\u2014to identify abnormalities and intracranial bleeds and rule out tumors Electroencephalographs (EEGs)\u2014EEG findings may be noted with certain seizure types, but a normal EEG does not rule out epilepsy because seizure activity rarely occurs during the actual testing time. EEGs are useful in evaluating seizure type and assisting in medication selection. They can be useful in differentiating seizures from nonepileptic activity. Video EEGs\u2014provide the opportunity to see the child's actual behavior on video, accompanied with EEG changes; can improve the chance of catching a seizure because the monitoring is done over a period of time Nursing Management Nursing management focuses on preventing injury during seizures, administering appropriate medication and treatments to prevent or reduce seizures, and providing education and support to the child and family to help them cope with the challenges of living with achronic seizure disorder. See Box 16.2 for a list of basic seizure precautions. In addition to the nursing diagnoses and related interventions discussed in Nursing Care Plan 16.1 , interventions common to epilepsy follow. BOX 16.2 SEIZURE PRECAUTIONS Padding of side rails and other hard objects Side rails raised on bed at all times when child is in bed Oxygen and suction at bedside Supervision, especially during bathing, ambulation, or other potentially hazardous activities Use of a protective helmet during activity may be appropriate. Child should wear a medical alert bracelet. Relieving Anxiety Seizures produce fear and anxiety due to their unpredictable nature along with their uncontrolled, forceful, and, at times, violent appearance. Instruct parents and family members, along with those in the community who may care for the child, on how to respond in case of a seizure (see Teaching Guidelines 16.1 ). This will help to empower the parents, family, and other caregivers, and in turn alleviate some of the anxiety that they may feel. Teaching Guidelines 16.1 HOW TO RESPOND WHEN YOUR CHILD HAS A SEIZURE Instruct parents and caregivers: Remain calm. Time seizure episode. If child is standing or sitting, ease child to the ground if possible. Tight clothing and jewelry around the neck should be loosened if possible. Place child on one side and open airway if possible. Do not restrain the child. Remove hazards in the area. Do not forcibly open jaw with a tongue blade or fingers. Document length of seizure and movements noted, also cyanosis or loss of bladder or bowel control and any other characteristics. Remain with child until fully conscious. Call emergency medical services (EMS) if: The child stops breathing Any injury has occurred Seizure lasts for more than 5 minutes This is the child's first seizure Child is unresponsive to painful stimuli after seizure Managing Treatment Provide child and family teaching and instruction regarding the administration of anticonvulsant therapy and its importance. Included in this discussion should be common adverse effects, the need to continue the medication unless instructed otherwise by the physician or nurse practitioner, and the need to call the physician or nurse practitioner if the child is ill and vomiting and unable to take his or her medication. Encourage parents to discuss unwanted adverse effects with the physician or nurse practitioner so that they can be addressed and noncompliance with the medication regimen can be reduced. A common cause of breakthrough seizures is medication noncompliance.Providing Family Support and Education Having a child with a chronic seizure disorder can place stress and anxiety on the family. This stress and anxiety is often due to fears and misconceptions they may have. An important nursing function is to educate not only the child and family but also the community, including the child's teachers and caregivers, on the reality and facts of the disorder. Encourage parents to be involved in the management of their child's seizures, but to allow the child to learn about the disorder and its management as soon as he or she is old enough. Encourage parents to treat the child with epilepsy just as they would a child without this disorder. Children who are brought up no differently than children without epilepsy will be more likely to develop a positive self-image and have increased self-esteem. Any activity restrictions, such as limiting swimming or participation in sports, will be based on the type, frequency, and severity of the seizures the child has. Educate parents and children on any restrictions and encourage parents to place only the necessary restrictions on the child. The needs of the child and family will change as the child grows and develops. The nurse needs to recognize these changes and provide appropriate education and support. Referral to support groups is appropriate. Links to helpful information about epilepsy including foundation information can be found on . Febrile Seizures Febrile seizures are the most common type of seizure seen during childhood (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2008; Johnston, 2007). They usually affect children who are younger than 5 years of age, with the peak incidence occurring in children between 14 and 18 months old. It is rare to see febrile seizures in children younger than 6 months and older than 5 years of age. Febrile seizures are more commonly seen in boys and there is an increased risk for children who have a family history of febrile seizures. Febrile seizures are associated with a fever, usually related to a viral illness. These seizures are usually benign but can be very frightening for both the child and family. In most cases the prognosis is excellent. However, febrile seizures may be a sign of a dangerous underlying infection, such as meningitis or sepsis. Though rare, complications associated with febrile seizures include status epilepticus , motor coordination deficits, intellectual disability, and behavioral problems. Therapeutic Management Therapeutic management includes determination and treatment of the cause of the fever and interventions to control the fever. The American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend long-term or intermittent anticonvulsant therapy for the child who has suffered one or more simple febrile seizures (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2008). Rectal diazepam has been shown to be safe and effective in terminating febrile seizures and may be used in children at high risk for febrile seizures or in children whose parents are extremely anxious. Nursing Assessment A febrile seizure is usually associated with a rapid rise in core temperature to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F) or higher. A simple febrile seizure is defined as a generalized seizure lasting less than 15 minutes (usually a few seconds to 10 minutes) that occurs once in a 24-hour period and is accompanied by a fever without any central nervous system infection present (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2008; Johnston, 2007). A brief postictal period is often seen where the child appears drowsy. The seizure is likely to have stopped by the time a child receives medical attention. Diagnosis is made based on a thorough history and physical examination, accompanied by a determination of the source of the fever. In some cases an LP may be performed to rule out meningitis or encephalitis. This will be based on the age and the clinical presentation of the child. Risk factors for recurrence of a febrile seizure include young age at first febrile seizure and family history of febrile seizures and high fever. Children who experience one or more simple febrile seizures have a slightly greater risk of developing epilepsy than the general population (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2008; Johnston, 2007). No evidence exists that febrile seizures cause structural damage or cognitive declines (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2008; Johnston, 2007). Nursing Management Provide parental support and education regarding febrile seizures. Reassure parents of the benign nature of febrile seizures. Counsel parents on controlling fever, discuss how to keep a child safe during a seizure, and provide instruction and demonstration in the administration of rectal diazepam at the onset of a seizure (if applicable). Instruct parents when to call their physician or nurse practitioner and when to take their child to the emergency room. Reinforce that any recurrent seizure activity will require prompt medical attention.Neonatal Seizures There is a high incidence of seizures during the neonatal period. The immature brain is more prone to seizure activity and metabolic, infectious, structural, and toxic diseases are more likely to be seen in this age group (Johnston, 2007). Neonatal seizures are seizures that occur within the first 4 weeks of life and are most commonly seen within the first 10 days. They are different from those in the child or adult because generalized tonicclonic seizures tend not to occur during the first month of life (Johnston, 2007). Seizures in newborns are associated with underlying conditions such as hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, metabolic disorders encephalitis), and intracranial hemorrhage. The prognosis depends mainly on the underlying cause of the seizures and the severity of the insult. There is increasing evidence that neonatal seizures have an adverse effect on neurodevelopment and may predispose the infant to cognitive, behavioral, or epileptic complications later in life. Therapeutic Management Acute neonatal seizures should be treated aggressively because repeated seizure activity may result in injury to the brain. Treatment focuses on ensuring adequate ventilation; correcting any underlying metabolic disturbance that may exist, such as hypoglycemia; and possibly administering anticonvulsant therapy. Phenobarbital is often used in the initial management of neonatal seizures but efficacy remains uncertain. The dosage of anticonvulsants may be higher in the neonate because neonates metabolize drugs more rapidly than older infants. Nursing Assessment Neonatal seizures may be hard to recognize clinically and may be accompanied by a normal EEG (Johnston, 2007). Certain clinical features are often seen in neonates experiencing seizures, such as tachycardia and hypertension. These symptoms can help distinguish seizures from nonepileptic movements in neonates. Nonepileptic movements, such as tremors or jitters, are often caused by sensory stimulation such as loud noises and can be diminished or stopped by holding the limb to limit movement; in true seizures this is not the case (Johnston, 2007). Ocular deviation may be seen with seizure activity but will not be present with nonepileptic activity. The characteristics of seizures seen in the neonatal period differ from those seen in older children. Five major seizure types have been recognized in the neonatal period. See Table 16.4 for information on types of seizures seen in newborn infants. Laboratory and diagnostic tests including serum testing (e.g., serum glucose, electrolytes, calcium), LP (to analyze CSF), cranial ultrasound, CT, and MRI may be performed to help determine the cause of the seizures. EEGs and video EEGs may assist in the characterization of neonatal seizures and their medical management. Nursing Management Nursing management will focus on carrying out interventions to cease seizure activity, monitoring neurologic status closely, recognizing the seizures, preventing injury during seizure activity, and providing support and education to the parents and family.STRUCTURAL DEFECTS Due to the sensitivity of the development of the neurologic system in the first weeks of embryonic life, there exists a potential for defects to occur. These structural defects include neural tube defects, tube defects (NTDs) account for the majority of congenital anomalies of the CNS (Kinsman & Johnston, 2007). They are one of the most common birth defects contributing to infant mortality and disability. NTDs affect 1 per 1,000 live births in the United States, with approximately 4,000 pregnancies affected annually (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007; Becske & Jallo, 2007). They are serious birth defects of the spine and the brain and include disorders such as spina bifida occulta, myelomeningocele, meningocele, anencephaly, and encephalocele. The neural tube closes between the third and fourth week in utero. The cause of neural tube defects is not known, but many factors such as drugs, malnutrition, chemicals, and genetics can adversely affect normal CNS development. Strong evidence exists that maternal preconception supplementation of folic acid can decrease the incidence of neural tube defects in pregnancies at risk by 50% (Kinsman & Johnston, 2007). In 1992, the U.S. Public Health Service recommended that all women of childbearing age who are capable of becoming pregnant take 0.4 mg (400 mcg) of folic acid daily. Pregnant women with a history of pregnancies affected by NTDs are recommended to take a higher dosage. Prenatal screening of maternal serum for - fetoprotein (AFP) and ultrasound examination at 16 to 18 weeks' gestation can help identify fetuses at risk. Anencephaly and encephalocele are discussed below. Refer to Chapter 22 for information on spina bifida occulta, meningocele, and myelomeningocele. Anencephaly Anencephaly is a defect in brain development resulting in small or missing brain hemispheres, skull, and scalp. It occurs when the cephalic or upper end of the neural tube fails to close during the third to fourth week of gestation. These infants are born without both a forebrain and a cerebrum and the remaining brain tissue may be exposed. The condition is incompatible with life. The incidence of anencephaly is 1 in 1,000 live births (Kinsman & Johnston, 2007). FIGURE 16.7 Anencephalic infant. Nursing AssessmentAnencephalic infants have a distinctive appearance, with a large defect noted in the vault of the skull ( Fig. 16.7 ). The mother may have had a difficult labor due to the malformation of the head not allowing it to engage in the cervix. The majority of infants will be stillborn. If not, most anencephalic infants die within hours to several days of birth (Kinsman & Johnston, 2007). There have been a few cases in which the infant has lived for several months. The infant is usually blind, deaf, unconscious, and unable to feel pain. Some infants born with anencephaly may be born with a brain stem, but due to the lack of a cerebrum there is no possibility of gaining consciousness. Reflex actions such as respirations, reactions to sound and touch, and ability to suck may be present. Nursing Management The prognosis is extremely poor. Nursing management is supportive in nature and focuses on comfort measures for the dying infant. Some parents may have been aware of the diagnosis prenatally due to screening tests such as AFP and ultrasounds. Parents and family will need support and understanding from all health care professionals during this difficult time. Fear of what the child will look like may be overwhelming. Use of an infant cap can be helpful and allow parents to feel more comfortable holding and comforting their infant. Assisting with anticipatory grieving and decision making related to end-of-life care will also be key nursing interventions. Encephalocele Encephalocele is a protrusion of the brain and meninges through a skull defect. It results from failure of the anterior portion of the neural tube to close. The prognosis, including the extent of complications and cognitive deficits, will depend on the size and location of the encephalocele and involvement of other brain structures. Encephaloceles are often accompanied by craniofacial and other abnormalities such as hydrocephalus, microcephaly, spastic quadriplegia, ataxia, visual problems, developmental delay, mental and growth retardation, and seizures. Some children who are affected may display normal intelligence. Therapeutic management consists of surgical repair, including placement of tissues back into the skull and removal of the sac; possible shunt placement to correct associated hydrocephalus; and corrective repair of any craniofacial abnormalities. Nursing Assessment Initial assessment after delivery will reveal a visible external sac protruding from the skull area. It occurs most commonly in the occipital region but can occur elsewhere, such as frontally or nasofrontally. Generally the lesion is covered by skin, but it may also be open. Therefore, assessment to ensure that the sac covering is intact remains important. Assess neurologic status carefully. Before surgical correction, the infant will be examined thoroughly to determine brain tissue involvement or associated anomalies. Diagnostic procedures such as CT, MRI, and ultrasound may be performed. Nursing Management Nursing management will consist of preoperative and postoperative care, along with symptomatic and supportive care. Preoperative and postoperative care will be similar to that for the child with myelomeningocele, with a focus on preventing rupture of the sac, preventing infection, and providing adequate nutrition and hydration. Infants with an encephalocele are at an increased risk for developing hydrocephalus. Therefore, monitor for signs and symptoms of increased ICP and head circumference. Microcephaly Microcephaly is defined as a head circumference that is more than three standard deviations below the mean for the age and sex of the infant (Kinsman & Johnston, 2007). It may be congenital or it may be acquired and develop in the first few years of life. It generally results in intellectual disability due to the lack of functioning brain tissue. There are many causes. Microcephaly can be caused by abnormal development during gestation or follow intrauterine infections such as rubella, toxoplasmosis, and cytomegalovirus. It can also be caused by chromosomal abnormalities or be associated with other syndromes. Acquired microcephaly may occur due to severe malnutrition, perinatal infections, or anoxia in early infancy. Nursing Assessment Microcephalic infants will present at birth with a normal or reduced head size. As the child ages, head growth will fail while the face will continue to grow at a normal rate. This results in a small head, a large face, and a loose, often wrinkled, scalp. As the child grows older, this smallness of the skull becomes more pronounced. Development of motor functions and speech may be delayed. The degree of intellectual disability varies, but it is a common occurrence. Convulsions may be present, and motor deficit ranges from clumsiness to spastic quadriplegia.Nursing Management There is no treatment. Nursing care will be supportive and focus on determining the extent of neurologic and cognitive deficits, as well as teaching parents how to care for a child with such impairments. Arnold-Chiari Malformation Arnold-Chiari malformation consists of two major subgroups\u2014type I and type II. In type I, symptoms are typically seen in adolescence and adulthood. This type is usually not associated with hydrocephalus and is the more benign form. The deformity is a result of the cerebellar tonsils displacing into the upper cervical canal. The client will usually complain of neck pain, recurrent headaches, lower extremity spasticity, and urinary frequency. Type II is the most common and is usually associated with hydrocephalus and myelomeningocele. The deformity results from the cerebellum, the medulla oblongata, and the fourth ventricle displacing into the cervical canal, resulting in an obstruction of the CSF and causing hydrocephalus. The prognosis depends on the extent of the defect. Therapeutic management of the type II Chiari malformation includes surgical decompression. Nursing Assessment Approximately 10% of type II Arnold-Chiari malformations result in symptoms in infancy, such as a weak cry, stridor, and apnea (Kinsman & Johnston, 2007). These symptoms require prompt medical treatment to reduce mortality. Gastrointestinal disturbances along with a history of chronic aspiration, choking, gagging, prolonged feeding times, and weight loss may also be present. Physical signs include coarse upper airway sounds heard on auscultation and diminished or absent gag reflex. In the older child, signs and symptoms seen are subtler and less frequently life threatening. Upper extremity weakness, spasticity, ataxia, and headaches are frequent signs found. Assessment of shunt function is extremely important in the infant and older child presenting with type II Chiari malformation and associated hydrocephalus (refer to Hydrocephalus section). An MRI may be performed to help evaluate and diagnose Chiari malformations. Nursing Management Nursing management will focus on preoperative and postoperative care, prevention of infection, monitoring of blood loss, improvement of preoperative symptoms in the postoperative period, identification of any signs and symptoms of increased ICP, and identification of any resultant CNS injury. Hydrocephalus Hydrocephalus is not a specific illness, but results from underlying brain disorders. It is a frequently seen disorder of the nervous system occurring in 0.5 to 4 per 1,000 live births (Zak & Chan, 2010). It results from an imbalance in the production and absorption of CSF. In hydrocephalus, CSF accumulates within the ventricular system and causes the ventricles to enlarge and increases in ICP to occur. Hydrocephalus may be congenital or acquired. Congenital hydrocephalus is present at birth and is often due to a genetic disposition or environmental influences during fetal development. Causes of congenital hydrocephalus include abnormal intrauterine development, as is the case with myelomeningocele or other NTDs or intrauterine infections. Acquired hydrocephalus develops at the time of birth or at some point after. It can occur at any age and can result from injury or disease. Acquired hydrocephalus can result from intentional or nonintentional trauma, intraventricular hemorrhage in premature infants, neoplasms (e.g., posterior infections (e.g., meningitis), or malformations (e.g., Chiari malformations). Hydrocephalus is also classified as obstructive or non-communicating versus nonobstructive or communicating. Obstructive or noncommunicating hydrocephalus occurs when the flow of CSF is blocked within the ventricular system. NTDs, neonatal meningitis, trauma, tumors, or Chiari malformations usually result in this type of hydrocephalus. One of the most common causes of obstructive or noncommunicating hydrocephalus in children is aqueductal stenosis, which results from the narrowing of the aqueduct of Sylvius (a passageway between the third and fourth ventricles in the middle brain) (Kinsman & Johnston, 2007). Nonobstructive or communicating hydrocephalus occurs when the flow of CSF is blocked after it exits from the ventricles. This form of hydrocephalus, in which the CSF can still flow between the ventricles, is most often caused by defective absorption of CSF. Examples include hydrocephalus that results from subarachnoid hemorrhage and intrauterine infections. Prognosis for the child with hydrocephalus depends mainly on the cause and whether or not brain damage has occurred prior to recognition and treatment. Children with hydrocephalus are at increased risk for developmental disabilities, visual problems,abnormalities in memory, and reduced intelligence. Long-term follow-up and multidisciplinary care are necessary. Pathophysiology CSF is formed primarily in the ventricular system by the choroid plexus. It flows as a result of the pressure gradient that exists between the ventricular system and the venous channels. CSF is absorbed primarily by the arachnoid villi. Hydrocephalus results when there is an obstruction in the ventricular system or obliteration or malfunction of the arachnoid villi. This results in impaired absorption or circulation of the CSF. In rare cases, hydrocephalus can be caused by an overproduction of CSF by the choroid plexus (Porth & Matfin, 2009). Therapeutic Management Hydrocephalus must be identified early. Treatment needs to be initiated in order to prevent brain tissue damage that can result from the increased ICP that hydrocephalus creates. Specific treatment will depend on the underlying etiology. The goals of treatment include relieving hydrocephalus and managing complications associated with the disorder, such as growth and developmental delay. Most cases of hydrocephalus are treated with the surgical placement of an extracranial shunt. Most often a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VP shunt) is placed. See Figure 16.8 for an illustration of a shunt. The shunt will need to be replaced as the child grows. Therefore, the child will undergo shunt revision surgery at various times during his or her life. It is important for health care professionals and parents to be able to recognize when a shunt needs replacing or when complications are occurring, to decrease the possibility of death or disability that may occur due to increased ICP. Though shunts have been the mainstay of treatment for hydrocephalus, they are not without complications such as infection, obstruction, and need for revision as the child grows. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy is an alternative to shunt placement to treat obstructive hydrocephalus in select children. A small perforation is made in the thinned floor of the third ventricle, which allows for egress of CSF from the ventricle to the sub-arachnoid space. No permanently implanted hardware is needed. Clinical trials are under way evaluating the use of endoscopic third ventriculostomy versus ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2009). FIGURE 16.8 To treat hydrocephalus, a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt catheter is placed in an enlarged ventricle. The shunt diverts the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the central nervous system to the peritoneum, where CSF is now absorbed across the peritoneal membrane into the body's circulation.Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 500 . Assessment findings pertinent to hydrocephalus are discussed below. Health History Explore the pregnancy history and past medical history for: Intrauterine infections Prematurity with intracranial hemorrhage Meningitis Mumps encephalitis Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history of the undiagnosed child might include: Irritability Lethargy Poor feeding Vomiting Complaints of headache in older children Altered, diminished, or changes in LOC Children known to have hydrocephalus are often admitted to the hospital for shunt malfunctions or other complications of the disease. The health history should include questions related to: Neurologic status\u2014have there been changes or decreases in LOC, changes in personality, or deterioration in school performance? Complaints of headache Vomiting Visual disturbances Any other changes in physical or cognitive state Physical Examination Physical examination of the infant or child with hydrocephalus will include inspection and observation; palpation; and percussion. INSPECTION AND OBSERVATION Observe general appearance and affect. Pay particular attention to the size of the skull and note any asymmetry. Note LOC and motor function. Changes or decreases in LOC may be noted along with brisk reflexes and spasticity of the lower extremities. Symptoms seen vary by age, primarily due to the fact that the infant's skull is able to accommodate the buildup of CSF because the sutures have not closed. In the infant, the most obvious indication is often a rapid increase in head circumference ( Fig. 16.9 ). In the older child, loss of development and changes in personality may be seen. Signs and symptoms associated with increased ICP may be seen (refer to Comparison Chart 16.1 ). PALPATION In the infant, palpation of the fontanels may reveal wide-open, bulging fontanels. They will be nonpulsatile and feel tense and very full. PERCUSSION Upon percussion of the skull, by physicians or nurse practitioners, a positive Macewen sign may be noted. This is when a \"cracked pot\" sound is heard during percussion and can indicate separation of the sutures. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Common laboratory and diagnostic tests ordered for the diagnosis and assessment of hydrocephalus include: Skull x-ray studies (may reveal separation of sutures) CT MRI CT and MRI are used to evaluate for the presence of hydrocephalus and can also aid in identifying the cause of hydrocephalus.Refer to Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 16.1 . Consider This Sandra and Michael Graham have brought their 6-month-old son, Thomas, to the pediatric unit for observation. Thomas's head circumference has increased from the 25th percentile at the 4-month check-up to the 75th percentile at the 6-month check-up. Upon assessment, the nurse notes a bulging anterior fontanel and persistent primitive reflexes. What do you think is going on? Identify early signs. Identify late signs. Describe nursing care for Thomas. What teaching will the nurse do with Sandra and Michael? FIGURE 16.9 (A) Infant without hydrocephalus. (B) Infant with hydrocephalus. Note broadening of the forehead and large head size. Nursing Management Nursing management of the child with hydrocephalus will focus on maintaining cerebral perfusion, minimizing neurologic complications, maintaining adequate nutrition, promoting growth and development, and supporting and educating the child and family. In addition to the nursing diagnoses and related interventions discussed in Nursing Care Plan 16.1 , interventions common to hydrocephalus are discussed below. Preventing and Recognizing Shunt Infection and Malfunction The major complications associated with shunts are infection and malfunction. Due to the serious nature and potentially devastating effects of shunt infection or malfunction, parents and health professionals need to be aware of the signs and symptoms to provide early recognition and prompt treatment. Signs and symptoms of a shunt infection include elevated vital signs, poor feeding, vomiting, decreased responsiveness, seizure activity, and signs of local inflammation along the shunt tract. Signs and symptoms of shunt malfunction include vomiting, drowsiness, and headache. Signs and symptoms of increased ICP, as listed in Comparison Chart 16.1 , can also be indicative of shunt complications. Infection can occur at any time but is more common 1 to 2 months after placement. Infection is treated with intravenous antibiotics and, if the infection is persistent, the shunt will be removed and an external ventricular drainage (EVD) system will be put into place until the CSF is sterile (refer to Common Medical Treatments 16.1 and Box 16.3 ). Take Note! Rapid drainage of CSF, which may occur if the child sits up without the EVD system being clamped, will decrease ICP and can lead to extreme headache, collapse of the ventricles, formation of subdural hematomas, and neurologic deterioration. A new shunt will be placed after the infection has cleared. Intrathecal administration of antibiotics may be performed by the physician or nurse practitioner. Keeping the peritoneal surgical incision free of feces and urine can help prevent infection. Additionally, inspect surgical incisions after shunt placement for signs and symptoms of infection and any signs of leaking CSF. Malfunction of the shunt can occur due to kinking, clogging, or separation of the tubing. Blockage is the most common reportedcomplication. A shunt that has been placed within the past year is at higher risk of malfunction. Early recognition and operative intervention are essential to prevent neurologic deficits or possible death from occurring. BOX 16.3 NURSING MANAGEMENT OF EXTERNAL VENTRICULAR DRAINAGE (EVD) DEVICE Ensure all connections are secure and label line as EVD. Regularly check that drip chamber of manometer is set at the height prescribed in relation to the child (i.e., zero at clavicle). Clamp the drain in the event of child movement or movement anticipated with care. Rezero and open clamps when done. Accurately document volume and color of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) every hour (CSF is normally clear and colorless; cloudiness indicates infection). Notify physician, nurse practitioner, or charge nurse of any significant increase in amount of drainage (if exceeds 10 mL more than previous volumes). If minimal or no drainage, check tubing for kinks, blockage, or closed clamps. Check to see if CSF is oscillating in tubing. If blockage is suspected, notify neurosurgery department immediately. Dress the entry site into the skull with a sterile occlusive dressing; change the dressing if it is soiled or nonocclusive. Routine CSF samples may be sent for culture and analysis. Child may be taking prophylactic antibiotics due to increased risk of infection from the drain. Supporting and Educating the Child and Family Hydrocephalus is a serious and chronic illness. It will require lifelong follow-up and regular evaluations. It requires early recognition of complications to prevent neurologic damage. Children will require future surgeries and hospitalizations, which can place a strain on the family and its finances. Potential growth and developmental disabilities are an additional strain. The support of the family in establishing realistic goals and helping the child to achieve his or her developmental and educational potential is important. The family should be involved in the child's care from the time of diagnosis. Initially parents may be frightened because shunt placement involves entering the brain. Provide parents with accurate information regarding the procedure, and be available to listen to parents' concerns and to answer questions that arise. Ongoing education about the illness and its treatment are important, including signs and symptoms of shunt complications. As the family becomes more comfortable with the diagnosis, treatment, and signs and symptoms of complications, they will become experts on the child's care and will often recognize subtle changes in him or her that may be indicative of shunt complications. Referral to support groups can be helpful for both the family and the child. Links for helpful information about hydrocephalus are provided on . Intracranial congenital disorder. It is caused by an abnormal development of blood vessels and can occur in the brain, brain stem, or spinal cord. AVMs that hemorrhage can lead to serious neurologic deficits and even death. However, some cases of AVMs never cause problems. Therapeutic Management More aggressive treatment strategies are used in children. Treatment options used include surgical excision; endovascular embolization, which involves closing off the vessels of the AVM by injecting glue into them; and radiosurgery, which involves focusing radiation on the AVM. The therapeutic management approach will be based on the age of the child and size and location of the malformation in the brain. The child will usually require at least 24 hours of intensive care monitoring following surgery. Nursing Assessment The most common symptoms seen include intracranial hemorrhage (children are more likely to present with hemorrhage than adults), seizures, headaches, and progressive neurologic deficits such as vision problems, loss of speech, problems with memory, and paralysis. In children younger than 2 years of age, presentation may include cardiac failure due to arteriovenous shunting in neonates and infants; a large head secondary to hydrocephalus; and seizure activity. Diagnosis is made using diagnostic imaging procedures such as MRI, CT, and arteriography. Nursing ManagementNursing management for these children is aimed at supportive care. Monitor for changes in neurologic status, noting any seizure activity, signs or symptoms of increased ICP, or signs and symptoms of intracranial hemorrhage. Hydrocephalus may occur as a result of intracranial hemorrhage secondary to the AVM. An EVD and eventual shunt placement may be necessary (refer to Hydrocephalus section). FIGURE 16.10 Skull sutures in the infant. Craniosynostosis Craniosynostosis is premature closure of the cranial sutures ( Fig. 16.10 ). Complete closure of all sutures does not normally occur until late in childhood. Premature closure can inhibit brain growth and a distorted skull appearance will be evident. In cases where only one suture is fused, neurologic impairments are rarely seen. When two or more sutures are fused, neurologic complications such as hydrocephalus with increased ICP are more likely to occur. The incidence of craniosynostosis is approximately 1 in 2,000 births (Kinsman & Johnston, 2007). The cause is unknown, but in 10% to 20% of cases a genetic disorder such as Carpenter syndrome or Apert, Crouzon, or Pfeiffer disease is present (Kinsman & Johnston, 2007). There are numerous different types of craniosynostosis; they are listed and illustrated in Table 16.5 . The prognosis is good for the majority of infants presenting with craniosynostosis, and normal brain development will occur. Exceptions to this are the infant or child who has associated genetic disorders that involve brain function and development. Surgical correction may be done and allows for normal expansion of the brain and acceptable appearance of the head and skull. If one suture is fused, the surgical intervention is done mainly for cosmetic reasons. If more than one suture is fused, operative intervention is essential to prevent neurologic complications. Nursing Assessment Most cases of craniosynostosis are present at birth. Skull deformity is evident as well as a prominent bony ridge that can be palpated. X-ray studies can confirm fusion of the sutures. It is important that craniosynostosis be detected early if it is not evident at birth because premature closure of the suture lines will inhibit brain development. Therefore, measure head circumference in all children younger than 3 years old and compare findings with normal head circumference parameters as well as past measurements of the infant or child.Nursing Management Nursing management focuses on postoperative care. This includes observing hemoglobin and hematocrit levels due to large volumes of blood loss that can occur, and observing for pain, hemorrhage, fever, infection, and swelling. Due to the location of the surgery and incision line, large amounts of facial swelling may be present. This can result in an inability of the child to open his or her eyes for a few days postoperatively. Make sure that parents are aware of this. Encourage the parents to talk to, hold, and comfort their child during this time. Provide support and education to the parents before, during, and after the procedure. Positional Plagiocephaly Since the inception of the \"back to sleep\" program, which recommends placing all infants supine to sleep to decrease the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), there has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of positional plagiocephaly (Dowshen, 2008b). Positional plagiocephaly refers to asymmetry in head shape without fused sutures. It results from gravitational force exertion on the developing cranium. Torticollis, which is when the neck muscles are too tight, have inadequate tone, or are shorter on one side, can contribute to plagiocephaly. Each condition, plagiocephaly and torticollis, exacerbates the other. Refer to Chapter 23 for further information on torticollis. Therapeutic management for positional plagiocephaly is generally conservative, such as changing the infant's position, encouraging \"tummy time,\" and avoiding excessive use of the car seat for infant seating outside of the automobile. Some infants may benefit from the use of a molding helmet ( Fig. 16.11 ). Nursing Assessment View the infant's head from the top, noting asymmetry ranging from flattening on one side posteriorly to posterior flattening associated with anterior bulging ( Fig. 16.12 ). Assess neck range of motion to determine if torticollis is also present. Palpate the cranial sutures, which will not feel overlapped as they do when they are fused. Skull x-ray examination or head CT scan will rule out craniosynostosis by demonstrating evidence of open sutures.FIGURE 16.11 Molding helmet for positional plagiocephaly. Nursing Management Nursing management is directed toward repositioning the infant to decrease time spent with the flattened area in the dependent position. Position the infant so that turning away from the affected side is necessary for him or her to view objects of interest. Place the infant on the abdomen when awake and supervised. Discourage use of the car seat outside of the automobile. Place a rolled washcloth along the affected side of the head to discourage turning the head in that direction. Following these recommendations may prevent positional plagiocephaly in the infant without congenital torticollis. FIGURE 16.12 Note flattening of the right posterior parietal and occipital regions of the skull in this infant with positional plagiocephaly.INFECTIOUS DISORDERS Infectious disorders of the neurologic system include bacterial meningitis, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and Reye syndrome. Bacterial Meningitis Bacterial meningitis is an infection of the meninges, the lining that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. It is a serious illness in children and can lead to brain damage, nerve damage, deafness, stroke, and even death. It requires rapid assessment and treatment. The leading cause of bacterial meningitis in newborns is group B streptococcus, gram-negative as Escherichia coli , monocytogenes (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009b). In children, the leading causative agents are Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010a). See Table 16.6 for types of meningitis seen in different age groups. In developed countries, disease resulting from Haemophilus influenzae type B, once the most common cause of meningitis in children, has decreased dramatically since the introduction of the Hib vaccine. In less developed countries, infection with H. influenzae type B still remains a concern. Pathophysiology Bacterial meningitis causes inflammation, swelling, purulent exudates, and tissue damage to the brain. It can occur as a secondary infection to upper respiratory infections, sinus infections, or ear infections, and can also be the result of direct introduction through LP; skull fracture or severe head injury; neurosurgical intervention; congenital structural abnormalities, such as spina bifida; or the presence of foreign bodies, such as a ventricular shunt or cochlear implants. Therapeutic Management Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency and requires prompt hospitalization and treatment. Deterioration may be rapid and occur in less than 24 hours, leading to long-term neurologic damage and even death. Intravenous antibiotics will be started immediately after the LP and blood cultures have been obtained if bacterial meningitis is suspected. The length of therapy and specific antibiotic will be determined based on the analysis and the culture and sensitivity of the CSF. Corticosteroids may be ordered to help reduce the inflammatory process. Specific medical treatment varies based on the suspected causative organism and will be determined by the physician or nurse practitioner. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 500 . Assessment findings pertinent to bacterial meningitis are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Sudden onset of symptoms Preceding respiratory illness or sore throat Presence of fever, chills Headache Vomiting Photophobia Stiff neck Rash Irritability Drowsiness Lethargy Muscle rigidity Seizures Symptoms in infants can be more subtle and atypical, but the history may reveal: Poor sucking and feeding Weak cry Lethargy Vomiting Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as: Young age: 1 month to 5 years, with most cases in children younger than 1 year of age and young adults 15 to 24 years of age Any fever or illness during pregnancy or around delivery (for infants younger than 3 months of age) Exposure to ill persons Exposure to tuberculosis Travel history History of maternal illness Recent neurosurgical procedure or head trauma Presence of a foreign body, such as a shunt or a cochlear implant Immunocompromised status Close-contact living spaces such as dormitories or military bases Day care attendance Physical Examination Observe the general appearance of the child. The infant with bacterial meningitis may rest in the opisthotonic position ( Fig. 16.13 ), and the older child may complain of neck pain. In the infant a bulging fontanel may be present, which is often a late sign, and the infant may be consolable when lying still as opposed to being held. Presence of positive Kernig and Brudzinski signs can indicate irritation of the meninges ( Fig. 16.14 ). Inspect the child for presence of a rash; a petechial, vesicular, or macular rash may be seen. FIGURE 16.13 Infant in opisthotonic position: head and neck are hyperextended to relieve discomfort. Take Note! Abrupt eruption of a petechial or purplish rash can be indicative of meningococcemia (infection with N. meningitidis). Immediate medical attention is warranted.Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of bacterial meningitis include: LP\u2014Fluid pressure will be measured and a sample is obtained for analysis and culture. CSF will reveal increased white blood cells (WBCs) and protein and low glucose (the bacteria present feed on the glucose). Complete blood count (CBC)\u2014WBCs will be elevated. Blood culture\u2014Performed to rule out sepsis. Blood culture will be positive in cases of septicemia. Nursing Management Quickly initiate supportive measures to ensure proper ventilation, reduce the inflammatory response, and help prevent injury to the brain. Interventions are aimed at reducing ICP and maintaining cerebral perfusion along with treating fluid volume deficit, controlling seizures, and preventing injury that may result from altered LOC or seizure activity. Initiate appropriate isolation precautions. In addition to standard precautions, infants and children diagnosed with bacterial meningitis will be placed on droplet isolation until 24 hours of antibiotics have been received to help prevent transmission to others. Refer to Nursing Care Plan 16.1 for nursing diagnoses and related interventions. In addition to those diagnoses and interventions, note any measures taken to reduce fever and prevent bacterial meningitis. Reducing Fever Hyperthermia related to infectious process, increased metabolic rate, and dehydration as evidenced by increased body temperature; warm, flushed skin; and tachycardia may be present. Reducing fever is important to help maintain optimal cerebral perfusion by reducing the metabolic needs of the brain. Administer antipyretics such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen, per order. Institute nonpharmacologic measures if needed. Reduce environmental temperature and use cooling blankets, fans, cold compresses, and tepid baths to help reduce fever. Avoid measures that cause shivering because it increases heat production and is therefore counterproductive as well as uncomfortable for the child. FIGURE 16.14 (A) Kernig sign is tested by flexing legs at the hip and knee (A1), then extending the knee (A2). A positive report of pain along the vertebral column is a positive sign and indicates irritation of meninges. (B) Brudzinski sign is tested by the child lying supine with the neck flexed (B1). A positive sign occurs if resistance or pain is met. The child may also passively flex hip and knees in reaction, indicating meningeal irritation (B2). Preventing Bacterial Meningitis Bacterial meningitis is a serious illness and prevention is important. It is transmitted by direct close contact with respiratory droplets from the nose or throat. Most at risk are those living with the child or anyone with whom the child played or was in close contact. Postexposure prophylaxis and postexposure immunization may be effective. Control measures should be initiated in environments where risk exists. Disinfect toys and other shared objects to decrease transmission of the microorganisms to others. To reduce group B streptococcus infection in neonates, screen pregnant women. If the screening results are positive, administerintrapartal antibiotics. Vaccines are available for some specific causative organisms, but complete vaccination prevention is not possible at this time. The Hib vaccine is routine starting at 2 months of age and all children should be immunized to continue the reduction of bacterial meningitis caused by H. influenzae type B. The pneumococcal vaccine is also routine for all children starting at 2 months of age and should be considered for preschoolers who are at risk. Children at risk include those with immune deficiency; sickle cell disease; asplenia; chronic pulmonary, diabetes mellitus; cochlear implants; cerebrospinal leaks; and organ transplants. During the 1990s, a dramatic increase in the incidence of meningococcal meningitis (and the often fatal blood infection meningococcemia) among adolescents and young adults occurred and N. meningitidis became one of the leading causes of bacterial meningitis (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010a; MMWR, 2000). Living in close quarters, sleeping less than usual, and sharing personal items such as drinking glasses and lip balm contribute to the increase in disease. For these reasons, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations advise meningococcal vaccination for all children 11 to 12 years of age; adolescents at high school entry or age 15 (whichever comes first) who have not been previously vaccinated; all college freshmen living in dormitories; and children who are at high risk, such as children with chronic conditions or immune suppression or those who travel to high-risk areas or live in crowded conditions (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2010a). Further information and a resource for families are provided on . (See Healthy People 2020.) HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Aseptic Meningitis Aseptic meningitis is the most common type of meningitis, and the majority of children affected are younger than 5 years of age (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010a). If the causative organism can be identified, it is usually a virus. Enteroviruses, such as echovirus and coxsackievirus, account for many cases of aseptic meningitis. Less common causes include mumps, herpesvirus, HIV, measles, varicella, and polio. Therapeutic Management Prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential to improve outcomes. The child is treated aggressively as if he or she has bacterial meningitis until the diagnosis is confirmed. Antibiotics are administered and continued until the causative organism is recognized. If the cause is viral, antibiotics may be discontinued and antiviral agents may be started at this time. After diagnosis is confirmed, treatment is mainly supportive in nature and the illness is usually self-limiting, lasting 3 to 10 days. Nursing Assessment Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Fever General malaise Headache Photophobia Poor feeding Nausea Vomiting Irritability Lethargy Neck pain Positive Kernig and Brudzinski signs The onset of symptoms may be abrupt or gradual. Assessment is similar to that of the child with bacterial meningitis. Signs and symptoms are similar to those seen in bacterial meningitis, but the child is usually less ill. Nursing Management Nursing management is similar to the nursing care of the child with bacterial meningitis and will focus on comfort measures to reduce pain and fever. Aseptic meningitis can be managed successfully at home if the child's neurologic status is stable and he or she is tolerating oral intake. Encephalitis Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain that may also include an inflammation of the meninges. It is a rare complication and can be caused by protozoan, bacterial, fungal, or viral invasion. In children it is most often associated with a viral illness. Most cases of viral encephalitis in children are of unknown cause. In the United States, common causative organisms include the herpes simplex virus; and coxsackievirus; and arthropod-borne viruses. Arthropod-borne viruses (e.g., West Nile and St. Louis encephalitis) are spread by the bites of insects, especially mosquitoes and ticks. Enteroviral infections are usually seen in the late summer and early fall, and arthropod-borne viruses are seen in the summer months (Abzug, 2007; Halstead, 2007). Recovery from encephalitis can occur in a few days or may be complicated and involve severe neurologic damage with residual effects. Prognosis depends on the age of the child and the causative organism. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential. The child suspected of having encephalitis should be hospitalized. Therapeutic management is mainly supportive in nature and focuses on maintaining optimal cerebral perfusion; hydration and nutrition; and injury prevention. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 500 . Assessment findings pertinent to encephalitis are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Fever Flu-like symptoms Altered LOC Headache Lethargy Drowsiness Generalized weakness Seizure activity Explore the child's current history for risk factors such as: Recent travel Recreational activities, such as hiking and camping Animal contacts Physical Examination Perform a neurologic examination to distinguish between encephalitis and viral meningitis. In encephalitis, a neurologic examination will reveal changes in sensorium and focal neurologic changes. Neurologic findings vary and reflect the areas of the brain that are involved. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests An LP may be done and the CSF may show an elevated leukocyte count and elevated protein and glucose levels. However, in some cases, levels may be normal. MRI, CT, and EEG procedures may be performed to help identify early changes and provide usefulclues in developing a diagnosis. Nursing Management Nursing management is similar to nursing care for the child with meningitis. Teach children and their families how to prevent encephalitis. Encephalitis can result from complications of childhood illnesses such as measles, mumps, or chickenpox. Explain the importance of keeping children up to date in their immunizations. Effective vaccines are available for a few viral pathogens that cause encephalitis (such as rabies virus and Japanese encephalitis virus), but these vaccines are not routine; they are recommended for those at high risk. For example, postex-posure rabies vaccines can be administered to a child who was bitten by a suspected rabid animal. Also, those traveling to areas where Japanese encephalitis is endemic, such as India and China, and planning a prolonged stay or extreme outdoor activity should receive the appropriate vaccine. Vector control and avoiding mosquito and tick bites are the best prevention of arthropod-borne infection. Preventative measures include: Using insect repellent (repellents containing DEET should be used cautiously in children younger than 12 years of age and not at all in children younger than 1 year of age) Wearing clothing that covers the arms and legs Controlling mosquito populations by eliminating areas of standing water where mosquitoes can breed Using insect traps and public measures such as sprayed insecticides to reduce the mosquito population Specific antiviral therapy may be used for diseases caused by the herpes simplex virus. Reye Syndrome Reye syndrome is a disease that primarily affects children younger than 15 years of age who are recovering from a viral illness. The exact cause of Reye syndrome is unknown. It has been found that Reye syndrome is a reaction that is triggered by the use of salicylates or salicylate-containing products to treat a viral infection. This reaction causes brain swelling, liver failure, and death in hours if treatment in not initiated. In the 1980s, the adverse effects of salicylates used to treat viral illnesses began to be publicized and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required warning labels to be placed on all salicylate-containing products, such as aspirin. Since then there has been a dramatic decrease in the occurrence of Reye syndrome. Nursing Assessment Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Severe and continual vomiting Changes in mental status Lethargy Irritability Confusion Hyperreflexia Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as: A prodromal viral illness, like chickenpox, croup, flu, or an upper respiratory infection Ingestion of salicylate-containing products within 3 weeks of the start of the viral illness Elevated liver function tests and elevated serum ammonia levels can confirm diagnosis. Nursing Management Early recognition and treatment are the most important aspects of managing this illness. Nursing management is aimed at maintaining cerebral perfusion, managing and preventing increased ICP, providing safety measures due to changes in LOC and risk for seizures, and monitoring fluid status to prevent dehydration and overhydration. Education is an important aspect of preventing this disease. Salicylates are found in many products, including many over-the- counter products such as Alka-Seltzer and Pepto-Bismol. A complete list can be found on . Recovery from Reye syndrome is dependent on the severity of swelling of the brain. Some children will make a full recovery, while others may suffer long-termneurologic damage.TRAUMA Trauma or injury is a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in the United States, with the highest rates among minority populations (Bernard, Pailozzi, & Wallace, 2007). The child faces significant risk of trauma to his or her developing neurologic system, often leading to neurologic disorders with life-threatening and lasting effects. Neurologic trauma may include head trauma, nonaccidental head trauma, birth injuries, and near drowning. Head Trauma In the United States, injury causes more death in children than disease (Center s for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009a). Of these injuries, head injury is a frequent cause of death and disability in childhood. Common causes of head trauma in children include falls, motor vehicle accidents, pedestrian and bicycle accidents, and child abuse (see next section, Nonaccidental Head Trauma). Many factors make children more susceptible to head trauma than adults. Larger head size in relation to the body, coupled with a higher center of gravity, causes the child to hit his or her head more readily when involved in motor vehicle accidents, bicycle accidents, and falls. Children are also at risk for injury related to psychosocial factors such as their high activity level, curiosity, incomplete motor development, and lack of knowledge and judgment skills. Head trauma is a broad term that can include specific patterns of injury. See Table 16.7 for descriptions of common head injuries seen in children. Head trauma in children is serious because it can cause an immediate threat to the child's life as well as a number of complications that can lead to lifelong impairment of an individual's physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning. Prognosis for the child who has suffered a head trauma depends on the extent and severity of the injury as well as any complications (see Healthy People 2020). HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 500 . Assessment findings pertinent to head trauma are discussed below. Health History Take a detailed history, including past medical history along with details of the events surrounding the injury such as mental status at the time of the injury, any loss of consciousness, irritability, lethargy, abnormal behavior, vomiting (if so, how many times), any seizure activity, and any complaints of headache, visual changes, or neck pain. Physical Examination Perform a thorough physical examination. Initial physical assessment will focus on the ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation) (refer to Chapter 31 for further information on emergency management). All children who experience head trauma need an assessment oftheir neurologic function as soon as they are seen. This includes LOC, pupillary response, and any seizure activity. Fixed and dilated pupils, fixed and constricted pupils, or sluggish pupillary reaction to light will warrant prompt intervention. Take Note! A child's spine must remain stabilized after a head injury until spinal cord injury is ruled out. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Diagnostic tests that may be utilized include x-ray examinations of the head and neck and CT and MRI scans. These procedures can assist in providing a more definitive diagnosis of the severity and type of trauma. Take Note! If clear liquid fluid is noted draining from the ears or nose, notify the physician or nurse practitioner. If the fluid tests positive for glucose, this is indicative of leaking CSF. Nursing Management Nursing management of the child with head trauma depends on the seriousness of the injury. For all head trauma, however, the nurse provides support and education to the family and provides teaching on ways to prevent future head injuries. Caring for the Child With Mild to Moderate Head Injury Mild to moderate closed head injury is defined as brain injury without any penetrating injury to the brain, no loss of consciousness, no other injury to the head or body, normal behavior after the injury, and healthy status before the injury. Most children with this type of injury can be cared for and observed at home. Provide parents and caregivers with clear instructions regarding the care of their child at home. Explain that they must seek medical attention if the child's condition worsens at any time during the first several days after injury. See Teaching Guidelines 16.2 . Teaching Guidelines 16.2 MONITORING THE CHILD WITH CLOSED HEAD INJURY AT HOME Instruct parents and caregivers: Stay with the child for the first 24 hours and be ready to take the child to the hospital if necessary. Wake the child every 2 hours to ensure that he or she moves normally, wakes enough to recognize the caregiver, and responds to the caregiver appropriately. Closely observe the child for a few days. Call the medical provider or bring child to the emergency room if the child exhibits any of the following: Constant headache that gets worse Slurred speech Dizziness that does not go away or happens repeatedly Extreme irritability or other abnormal behavior Vomiting more than two times Clumsiness or difficulty walking Oozing blood or watery fluid from ears or nose Difficulty waking up Unequal-sized pupils Unusual paleness that lasts longer than 1 hour Seizures Review signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure and provide parents with a number they can call if they have questions or concerns. Children with mild closed head injury may exhibit some cognitive and behavioral symptoms, such as difficulty paying attention, problems making sense of what has been seen or heard, and forgetting things, in the early days after the injury. The majority make a full recovery. However, some may experience ongoing cognitive and behavioral difficulties, including slow information processing and attention difficulties. Caring for the Child With Severe Head Injury Severe head injuries can range from a temporary unconsciousness that resolves quickly to children who may remain in a comatose state for a prolonged time. Nursing management of the comatose child is similar to nursing care of the comatose adult. Children with more severe head injury may require intensive care initially until stabilized. Focus will be on maintaining the child's airway; monitoring breathing, circulation, and neurologic status closely; preventing and ceasing any seizure activity; and treating any other injuries that may have occurred as a result of the trauma. Nursing management will continue to focus on evaluation of neurologic status and assessing for changes in LOC and signs and symptoms of increased ICP. Initiate seizure precautions as ordered. Individualize care to the specific needs of the child. Maintain a quiet environment to help reduce restlessness and irritability. Manage pain and administer sedation as ordered. Observe the level of sedation closely to ensure that LOC will not become altered, which would hinder the ability to assess adequately for neurologic changes. Monitor for the development of complications, which include hemorrhage, infection, cerebral edema, and herniation. Take Note! Parents are extremely helpful resources in evaluating a child's behavior for changes or abnormalities. They can provide insight into whether a behavior seen is normal or abnormal for this child. Examples include the ease at which a child is normally aroused, how much the child normally sleeps during the day, and what is the child's normal visual and hearing acuity. Providing Support and Education Provide support and education for the family of a child who has suffered a head trauma. Encourage involvement in the child's care. The extent of residual neurologic damage and recovery may be unclear for the child with a head injury. This can be frustrating and stressful for parents and family. Encourage verbalization of their feelings and concerns. Rehabilitation of the child with permanent brain damage is an essential component of his or her care. It should begin as soon as possible in the hospital setting and may continue for months to years. This can place a strain on the family and its finances. Families need to be involved in the rehabilitation process. The nurse will be a key member in ensuring the parents and family are involved with the interdisciplinary team. Preventing Head Injuries Prevention of head injuries provides the greatest benefit to children and the community. Nurses play a key role in educating the public on topics such as helmet use with certain sports; bicycle and motorcycle safety; seat belt use; and providing adequate supervision of children to help prevent injuries and accidents\u2014and resultant head trauma\u2014from occurring (see Healthy People 2020). HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Nonaccidental Head Trauma In the United States, inflicted or nonaccidental head trauma is the leading cause of traumatic death and morbidity during infancy (Hymel, Markoroff, Laskey, Con-away, & Blackman, 2007). Children's dependence on others to care for them places them at a high risk for injuries caused by child abuse. The infant's large head size and weak neck muscles place him or her at an increased risk for head trauma due to violent shaking or cranial impacts compared to adults. In addition, children younger than 3 years of age have a very mobile spine, especially in the cervical region, along with immature neck muscles. This places them at a higher risk for injury from acceleration/deceleration injuries, which occur when the head receives a blow or is shaken. The sudden acceleration causes deformation of the skull and movement of the brain, allowing brain contents to strike parts of the skull. Bruising of the brain can occur at the point of impact or at that point distant from the impact where the brain collides with the skull. Another result of brain movement is hemorrhages in the brain, which are caused by the shearing forces that may tear small arteries. The child's thin skull places him or her at increased risk for skull fractures and penetrating injuries resulting from head trauma. Causes of nonaccidental head trauma include violent shaking, referred to as shaken baby syndrome (SBS); blows to the head; and intentional cranial impacts against the wall, furniture, or the floor. The average victim is younger than 9 months of age. SBS is a form of child abuse and a significant number of head traumas result from it. However, it differs from many other forms of child abuse in that frequently there was no intent to harm the child. Shaking happens when the parent or caregiver becomes frustrated or angry because he or she cannot get the baby to stop crying. The full appearance of neurologic deficits resulting from nonaccidental head trauma may take several years to be identified and recovery can be very slow. Long-term outcomes are not known, but many of these infants and children have poor outcomes and may suffer neurologic defects such as profound intellectual disability, spastic quadriplegia, severe motor dysfunction, and blindness. The majority of children with inflicted head injuries have some impairment of motor and cognitive abilities, language, vision, and behavior. These injuries may also contribute to later problems with education and social attainment. Nursing Assessment The infant who has been a victim of nonaccidental trauma can present in many ways. Symptoms and physical findings may be similar to those seen in children with accidental head trauma or increased ICP related to infection. Therefore, many nonaccidental traumas remain unidentified. Nurses are mandatory reporters of abuse (for further information on this, see Chapter 30 ). Early recognition of suspected child abuse is essential to prevent death and disability from repetitive inflicted head trauma. Health History It is important to review the child's history closely and pay particular attention to the caregivers' explanation of the child's injury. Be alert to any discrepancies between the physical injuries and the history of injury given by the parent, especially if the stories are conflicting, or if the caregivers are unable to give an explanation for the injury. Also, note any previous intracranial or skeletal injuries that cannot be explained. In less severe cases, common signs and symptoms may include: Poor feeding or sucking Vomiting Lethargy or irritability Failure to thrive Increased sleeping Difficulty arousingIn more severe cases, the symptoms will be more acute and may consist of: Seizure activity Apnea Bradycardia Decreased LOC Bulging fontanel Physical Examination External bruising of the head and face may be evident in some inflicted head traumas. However, no evidence of external trauma, but the presence of intracranial or intraocular hemorrhages, is the classic presentation of SBS. Retinal hemorrhages are seen in the majority of cases, which is a rare finding in accidental or nontraumatic events. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Diagnostic tests including CT, MRI, ophthalmologic examination to rule out retinal hemorrhages, and skeletal survey radiographs to rule out or confirm other injuries may be performed to help determine the extent and type of injury. Nursing Management Treatment and nursing management will be similar to that for the child with accidental head trauma (see earlier section, Head Trauma). Prevention of nonaccidental head trauma, including SBS, is a major concern for all health care professionals. Be aware of risk factors related to the potential for SBS to occur. Recognizing these risk factors will allow appropriate intervention and protection of the child to take place. See Box 16.4 for risk factors related to SBS. Educating parents and caregivers on appropriate ways to handle stress and ways to cope with a crying infant can help to prevent nonaccidental head trauma (see Teaching Guidelines 16.3 and Evidence-Based Practice 16.1 ). Many parents and caregivers may perceive shaking a child as a less violent way to react than other means of enforcing discipline. They need to be aware that shaking a baby, even for only a few seconds, can cause serious brain damage and death. Decreasing mortality and morbidity associated with SBS and nonaccidental injury through early preventive education is an essential nursing concern. Information about the dangers of shaking a baby should be a part of prenatal care and standard discharge teaching on postpartum units. In addition, this information should be provided to the community and in health education classes to reach young potential child care providers. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 16.1 DO EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS CHANGE KNOWLEDGE AND BEHAVIOR ABOUT CRYING AND SHAKEN BABY SYNDROME? Shaken baby syndrome is caused by violent shaking often in response to infant crying and can result in significant head trauma and neurologic deficits. It is inflicted by a caregiver of the infant and may be attributed to lack of knowledge regarding the effects of shaking and therefore may be preventable. Crying, especially inconsolable and cluster crying, in the newborn infant is often the stimulus for shaking due to anger and frustration that the caregiver feels. Anticipatory guidance about crying may also be helpful in preventing shaken baby syndrome. STUDY A randomized controlled trial was performed with 1,279 mothers who had an uneventful pregnancy, a healthy singleton birth, and access to a DVD player and who were fluent in English. The participants either received the Period of PURPLE Crying materials, an 11-page booklet and DVD developed by the National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome, or the control injury prevention material, two brochures and a DVD about infant safety, during a routine public health nurse visit within 2 weeks after discharge. Participants completed a Baby's Day Diary and a 20-minute questionnaire over the phone. Findings Mothers who received the PURPLE materials scored higher on the scales that measured knowledge about crying and more often shared descriptions of crying, advice about walking away if frustrated, and warnings about the danger of shaking to other caregivers. Walkaway behavior when faced with inconsolable crying was more frequent among mothers who received thePURPLE materials. Nursing Implications Nurses need to recognize the importance of providing education regarding the frustration of caring for a crying child, the dangers of shaking, and the recommended responses to a crying baby (refer to Teaching Guideline 16.3 ) shortly before or after birth. It is also important to emphasize that sharing this information with all caregivers of the child is imperative. Increases in knowledge and changes in behavior may lead to a reduction in the incidence of shaken baby syndrome. Further research is warranted in this area to determine if the incidence of inflicted trauma to infants is decreased when education programs are implemented in clinical practice. Adapted from Barr, R. G., Barr, M., Fujiwara, T., Conway, J., Catherine, N., & Brant, R. (2009). Do educational materials change knowledge and behaviour about crying and shaken baby syndrome? A randomized controlled trial. Canadian Medical Association Journal, 180(7) , 727-734. BOX 16.4 RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH SHAKEN BABY SYNDROME Single parent Young parent Substance abuse by a parent Any external factors present such as financial, social, or physical burdens that place stress on the parent Premature or sick infant Infant with colic Teaching Guidelines 16.3 TIPS TO CALM A CRYING BABY Instruct parents and caregivers: Try to figure out what is upsetting the baby. Is the baby hungry? Is the baby's diaper dry? Is the baby cold or hot? Is the baby overtired or overstimulated? Is the baby in pain? Is the baby sick or running a fever? Try to help the baby relax. Turn down the lights. Swaddle the baby. Walk the baby. Rock the baby. Give the baby a breast, bottle, or pacifier. Shhh, talk to, or sing to the baby. Talk the baby for a stroller or car ride. Sometimes the baby may continue to cry after all your efforts. If you feel overwhelmed, frustrated, or angry, focus on keeping the baby safe. Stop what you are doing, take a deep breath, and count to 10. Place the baby in a safe place, such as the crib or playpen. Leave the room and shut the door, and find a quiet place for yourself. Check on the baby every 5-15 minutes. Do not be afraid to call for help; call a friend, relative, or neighbor.Birth Trauma Birth traumas are injuries sustained by the newborn during the birthing process. They may result from the pressure of birth, especially from a prolonged or abrupt labor, an abnormal or difficult presentation, cephalopelvic disproportion, or the use of mechanical forces such as forceps or vacuum during delivery. Newborns at risk include multiple deliveries, large-for-date infants, and those with extreme prematurity, a large fetal head, or congenital anomalies. Most injuries are minor and resolve without treatment. Nursing Assessment Inspect the head for lumps, bumps, or bruises. Note if swelling or bruising crosses the suture line. See Comparison Chart 16.2 and Figure 16.15 for a comparison of caput succedaneum and cephalhematoma (common types of head trauma resulting from the birth process). Nursing Management Nursing management will be mainly supportive and will focus on assessing for resolution of the trauma or any associated complications, along with providing support and education to the parents. Provide parents with explanation and reassurance that these injuries are harmless. It can be very alarming and concerning to parents to see swelling or bruising on their child's head. Provide parents with education regarding the length of time until resolution and when and if they need to seek further medical attention for the condition. Near Drowning Drowning is the second leading cause of unintentional injury-related death in children between the ages of 1 and 14 years (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010b). Drowning is a preventable problem that is far too common, especially in children. Those at greatest risk of drowning are toddlers and adolescent males (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2010b). Near drowning is described as an incident in which a child has suffered a submersion injury and has survived for at least 24 hours. Near-drowning events result in a significant number of injured children and can result in long-term neurologic deficits. Children younger than 1 year old most often drown in bathtubs, buckets, or toilets. Children between the ages of 1 and 4 years are more likely to drown or have a near-drowning incident in residential swimming pools (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010b). In children older than 15 years of age, most drownings occur in natural water settings, such as oceans or lakes (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010b). Most incidents are accidental and result from inadequately supervising children who are in or near water, lack of use of personal flotation devices while on recreational water apparatus such as boats, and diving accidents. COMPARISON CHART 16.2 CAPUT SUCCEDANEUM VS. CEPHALOHEMATOMA FIGURE 16.15 (A) Infant with caput succedaneum. Edema is noted at birth and crosses the suture line. (B) Infant with cephalohematoma. Bleeding appears within the first 2 to 3 days of birth and does not cross the suture line. Nursing Assessment Hypoxia is the primary problem resulting from near drowning. Nursing assessment needs to begin with resuscitative measures. The child may be comatose, be hypothermic, lack spontaneous respirations, and present with hypoxia and hypercapnia. Gain information about the site of submersion (was it fresh or salt water?), the water temperature, the time of submersion, and how long it was until the child received interventions such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and emergency medical services (EMS). Nursing Management Resuscitative measures should be started as soon as the child is pulled from the water, and the child should be transported to a hospital immediately. Management will be based on the degree of cerebral insult that has occurred. The child who has been successfully resuscitated will usually require intensive nursing care and monitoring. Promotion of oxygenation and monitoring for infection related to aspiration of water are primary nursing concerns. Chronic neurologic damage occurs in many near drownings secondary to hypoxia. The child may need rehabilitation and long-term follow-up. Provide parents with support and education relating to their child's condition. Educating children, families, and the community is an important nursing intervention to help prevent drowning (see Teaching Guidelines 16.4 ). Teaching Guidelines 16.4 TEACHING TO PREVENT DROWNING Instruct parents and caregivers: Install proper pool fencing. Start water safety training at a young age. Never leave an infant or young child without adult supervision in or near water (this includes bathtubs). Empty water from all containers, such as 5-gallon buckets, immediately after use. Use proper-fitting, Coast Guard-approved personal flotation devices at all times when near water Never allow children to walk, skate, or ride on thinning or thawing ice. Learn cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and keep emergency numbers handy (make sure babysitters are CPR qualified). Know the depth of water before permitting a child to jump or dive.BLOOD FLOW DISRUPTION Pediatric cerebral vascular disorders occur less often than in adults, but they are still an important cause of mortality and chronic morbidity in children (Roach, deVeber, Riela, & Wiznitzer, 2008). Many children will develop lifelong cognitive and motor impairments. Improvements in imaging techniques have led to an increase in the reported incidence and prevalence of cerebral vascular disorders in children in recent years (Roach et al., 2008). Childhood cerebral vascular disorders (stroke) are usually seen after the first month of life. Periventricular/intraventricular hemorrhage is seen in preterm infants and in infants up to 1 month of age. Cerebral Vascular Disorders (Stroke) A cerebral vascular disorder is a sudden disruption of the blood supply to the brain. It affects neurologic functioning, such as movement and speech. Two major types of adult cerebral vascular disorders are seen in children\u2014ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. Ischemic stroke is more common than hemorrhagic stroke in children. In children, there is a wide array of risk factors and causes as compared to adults (see Comparison Chart 16.3 ), but in many cases the cause remains unidentified. The outcomes reported for cerebral vascular disorders in children vary, but many children will develop some neurologic or cognitive deficit. Historically, children have been excluded from adult stroke studies. Therefore, many treatments used in children have had to be adapted from adult studies. Acute treatment is supportive and requires intensive care. The exact treatment will depend on the underlying cause. Nursing Assessment The clinical presentation will vary according to age, the underlying cause, and the location of the stroke. Signs and symptoms of acute stroke are similar to those seen in the adult and depend on the area of the brain that has been affected. Common signs include: Weakness on one side or hemiplegia Facial droop Slurred speech Speech deficits Strokes in children are diagnosed in the same manner as strokes in adults. However, further tests may need to be run in the child, such as metabolic studies, coagulation tests, echocardiogram, and LP to help identify the cause of the stroke. COMPARISON CHART 16.3 RISK FACTORS AND CAUSES OF STROKE IN CHILDREN AND ADULTS Nursing Management Nursing management will be similar to that for the adult patient who has suffered a stroke. Care will focus on assessing neurologic status, increasing mobility, providing adequate nutrition and hydration, and encouraging self-care. Rehabilitative care may be initiated, depending on the long-term deficits, to help the child attain optimal function. Parental support and education will be essential in helpingthem care for a child who has new disabilities. Periventricular/Intraventricular Hemorrhage Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), which is bleeding into the ventricles, is most commonly seen in preterm infants, especially very low-birthweight infants (<1,500 g) (Adams-Chapman & Stoll, 2007). Due to the preterm infant's fragile capillaries in the periventricular area, immature cerebral vascular development, and poorly supported vascular bed, these infants are at an increased risk for intracranial bleeds. Causes of rupture of the capillaries leading to IVH vary and include fluctuations in systemic and cerebral blood flow, increases in cerebral blood flow from hypertension, intravenous infusion, seizure activity, increases in cerebral venous pressure due to vaginal delivery, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The smaller the newborn is, and the more premature, the higher the risk of developing IVH. Complications of IVH include development of hydrocephalus, periventricular leukomalacia (an ischemic injury resulting from inadequate perfusion of the white matter adjacent to the ventricles), cerebral palsy, and intellectual disability. The size and severity of the IVH is measured using a grading system. The system goes from grade I (mild) to grade IV (severe). In some settings, sub- categories may be used to further distinguish the severity and extent of bleeding. Infants who experience mild IVH usually suffer no ill effects. Those with more severe grades of IVH are more likely to demonstrate neurologic and cognitive deficits. Infants with a documented IVH will receive follow-up with scans to monitor the lesion for evidence of progression or resolution. Supportive care includes the correction of underlying medical disturbances that might be related to the development of IVH as well as cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurologic support. Correction of anemia, hypotension, and acidosis along with ventilatory support may be necessary in some cases. If hydrocephalus results, placement of a shunt may be necessary (see Hydrocephalus section). Nursing Assessment The signs and symptoms seen with IVH vary significantly and there may be no clinical signs evident. Closely monitor newborns who are at an increased risk, such as premature and low-birthweight newborns. Some symptoms that may be seen include: Apnea Bradycardia Cyanosis Weak suck Seizure activity High-pitched cry Bulging fontanel Anemia Premature and low-birthweight newborns may have a head ultrasound in the first 10 days of life to assess for the presence of an IVH. Diagnostic tests such as CT and MRI scans also may be performed to document the presence of an IVH and provide more accurate assessment of the severity and size of the bleed. Nursing Management Nursing management will include monitoring for signs and symptoms of increased ICP, rapid increases in head circumference, neurologic changes, and delays in attainment of developmental milestones. In addition, provide education and support to the parents.CHRONIC DISORDERS Chronic disorders in children necessitate multidisciplinary care. Parents and children are in need of a large amount of education and support from the health care team. Chronic neurologic disorders commonly seen in children include headaches and breath holding. Headaches Acute and chronic headaches, including migraines, are common reasons why children miss school, visit their physician or nurse practitioner, and receive subsequent referrals to neurologists. Children with reports or symptoms of headaches need to be examined thoroughly. Headaches may result from sinusitis or eye-strain or can be indicative of more serious conditions such as brain tumors, acute meningitis, or increased ICP. Migraines are a specific type of headache. They are benign, recurrent, throbbing headaches often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and photophobia. Acute migraines can occur in children as young as 3 to 4 years old. The cause of migraine headaches is not well understood. After other acute or chronic conditions are ruled out, management will focus on treating the child's pain. Pharmacologic measures may be utilized in the treatment of chronic headaches and migraines. Medications used in children to treat and prevent headaches are similar to the medications used to treat adults. Recent attention has been paid to headaches caused by medication overuse. The child may have a primary headache disorder that is exacerbated by the frequent use of medications. Although medication overuse headaches are common in children, they are frequently underrecognized and under-diagnosed. Nursing Assessment Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Important health history information to obtain is onset of the pain, aggravating and alleviating factors, frequency and duration of the pain, time of day the pain usually occurs, location of the pain, and quality and intensity of the pain. In young children, symptoms of headache may be hard to recognize. However, common signs and symptoms may include: Irritability Lethargy Head holding Head banging Sensitivity to sound or light Assessment also includes a thorough physical examination to rule out any life-threatening illness, such as a brain tumor or increased ICP. A detailed neurologic examination is warranted. Neuroimaging may be performed based on the child's history and physical examination, if needed, to rule out a brain tumor or mass as the cause of the headaches. Nursing Management Nursing measures will focus on support and education. After serious illness has been ruled out, reassure the child and family that no serious medical or neurologic disease is present. Because headaches are recurring and the cause may be unknown, pain management can be difficult. Provide education to help the child and parents gain control over the headaches. Teach the child and family to a keep very accurate record of headaches and activities surrounding the headaches to help establish a pattern of occurrence and identify triggering factors. Encourage parents and the child to recognize the triggering factors and to avoid them ( Box 16.5 ). Teach the child and family about pain medications and how to use them. Teach other management techniques, which may include exercise, sleep regulation, proper diet with regularly spaced meals, avoiding caffeine, avoiding inadequate hydration, regular attendance at school, use of bio-feedback, stress reduction techniques, and possible psychiatric assessment. BOX 16.5 POTENTIAL HEADACHE TRIGGERS Foods, such as chocolate, caffeine, or monosodium glutamate (MSG)-containing foods Changes in hormone levels, around menses and ovulation Changes in: Weather SeasonSleep patterns Meal schedule Stress Intense activity Bright or flickering lights Odors, such as strong perfumes Breath Holding Breath holding is a benign behavior of childhood, although it is extremely frightening for parents. It is normally seen in children 1 to 3 years old and typically is outgrown by 5 years of age. It is usually triggered by the child becoming angry or stressed after not getting his or her way. It can also occur as a reflexive response to fear, pain, or being startled. The child stops inhaling and exhaling or hyperventilates, the brain becomes anoxic, and the child becomes cyanotic and may pass out. In some cases a change in muscle tone, seizure-like activity, or hypoxic convulsions may be observed. This does not mean the child has a seizure disorder, but it must be ruled out. The spell usually resolves spontaneously. With the loss of consciousness the child will begin breathing on his or her own and will often begin crying, screaming, and trying to catch his or her breath. The spells usually only last 30 to 60 seconds and, as long as the child does not sustain an injury while falling, have no consequences. If no underlying condition is found, the child needs no therapy. The condition is self-limiting and the child will outgrow it. Iron deficiency may play a role; therefore, iron supplementation may be prescribed (Allsman, 2008). Nursing Assessment The first time a spell occurs, a primary care provider should evaluate the child because the event could indicate a seizure. Breath holding also has been shown to be aggravated by iron-deficiency anemia and, in rare cases, it could indicate a more serious neurologic condition and therefore warrant a full evaluation. Elicit a full description of the episode and events leading up to it. Also, collect a thorough past medical history and perform a complete physical examination. Nursing Management Nursing management should focus on educating and supporting the parents. Breath holding is a scary event and parents will want information on the effects of the behavior and how to prevent the behavior from recurring. Reinforce that the spells are involuntary and that they should not intervene to stop them. Encourage parents to maintain a safe environment when an episode is occurring, such as holding the child or placing him or her in the side-lying position. Reassure parents that the child will suffer no ill effects from breath holding and that they should not reinforce the breath-holding behavior or give in to the child. Children with breath-holding spells may benefit from structure and consistency to avoid unnecessary frustration and overtiredness. KEY CONCEPTS Development of the brain and spinal cord occurs early in gestation, in the first 3 to 4 weeks. Infection, trauma, teratogens, and malnutrition during this period can result in malformations and may affect normal CNS development. The brain of the newborn is highly vascular, leading to an increased risk for hemorrhage. The head of the infant and young child is large in proportion to the body and the neck muscles are not well developed, which places the infant at an increased risk of head injury from falls and accidents. Neurologic disorders in children can result from congenital problems as well as infections or trauma. LP and CSF analysis can be useful in the diagnosis of hemorrhage, infection, or obstruction. CT and MRI studies can be useful in diagnosing congenital abnormalities such as neural tube defects, hemorrhage, tumors, fractures, demyelination, or inflammation. EEGs measure the electrical activity of the brain and can be used in diagnosing seizures or brain death. Antibiotics are utilized in the treatment of bacterial meningitis and shunt infections. Anticonvulsants are used in the treatment and prevention of seizures and are often used in combination. Corticosteroids are used to reduce cerebral edema and must be tapered before discontinuing. Risk factors associated with neurologic disorders include prematurity, difficult birth, infection during pregnancy, family history of genetic disorders with a neurologic manifestation, seizure disorders, and headaches. Alterations in motor function, such as changes in gait or muscle tone or strength, may indicate certain neurologic problems such asincreased ICP, head injury, and cerebral infections. Increased ICP is a sign that may occur with many neurologic disorders. It may result from head trauma, birth trauma, hydrocephalus, infection, and brain tumors. It is essential that the nurse observes for signs and symptoms associated with increased ICP while caring for a child with a potential or suspected neurologic disorder. Sunset eyes may indicate increased ICP as seen in hydrocephalus. A bulging fontanel can be a sign of increased ICP and is seen in such neurologic disorders as hydrocephalus and head traumas. Cortical control of motor function is lost in certain neurologic disorders; postural reflexes reemerge and are directly related to the area of the brain that is damaged. Decorticate posturing occurs with damage of the cerebral cortex. Decerebrate posturing occurs with damage at the level of the brain stem. Hydrocephalus results from an imbalance in the production and absorption of CSF. Key assessment findings include a rapid increase in head circumference seen in the infant, or loss of development and changes in personality in the older child. Signs and symptoms associated with increased ICP may be seen. Bacterial meningitis requires rapid assessment and treatment. On assessment, the nurse may find the infant with bacterial meningitis resting in the opisthotonic position, and the older child may complain of neck pain. Nursing management of seizures focuses on preventing injury during seizures, instituting seizure precautions, maintaining a patent airway, administering appropriate medication and treatments to prevent or reduce seizures, and providing education and support to the child and family to help them cope with the challenges of living with a chronic seizure disorder. Nursing management of the child with hydrocephalus will focus on maintaining cerebral perfusion, minimizing neurologic complications, recognizing and preventing shunt infection and malfunction, maintaining adequate nutrition, promoting growth and development, and supporting and educating the child and family. Nursing management of the child with bacterial meningitis will include administration of intravenous antibiotics, reducing ICP, and maintaining cerebral perfusion along with treating fluid volume deficit, controlling seizures, and preventing injury that may result from altered LOC or seizure activity. Nurses play a key role in educating the public on topics such as helmet use with certain sports, bicycle and motorcycle safety, seat belt use, and providing adequate supervision of children to help prevent injuries and accidents and resultant head trauma from occurring. Many neurologic disorders affect multiple body systems with lifelong deficits that require long-term rehabilitation. Adjusting to the demands this condition places on the child and family is difficult. Parents may need time to accept their child's condition but as soon as possible they should be involved in the child's care. Children with neurologic disorders and their families often need large amounts of education and support throughout the child's lifetime. As the child grows, the needs of the family and child will change. The nurse needs to provide ongoing education and support. Some neurologic disorders require complete intensive daily care. Adjusting to these demands can be difficult for the family. Encourage respite care and provide meaningful education programs that emphasize independence for the child in the least restrictive educational environment. Refer caregivers to local resources, including education services and support groups. REFERENCES Abzug, M. J. (2007). Nonpolio enteroviruses. In R. M. Kliegman, R. E. Behrman, H. B. Jenson, & B. F.

When compared with adults, why are infants and children at an increased risk of head trauma? a. The head of the infant and young child is large in proportion to the body and the neck muscles are not well developed. b. The development of the nervous system is complete at birth but remains immature. c. The spine is very immobile in infants and young children. d. The skull is more flexible due to the presence of sutures and fontanels. 2. At a well-child visit, hydrocephalus may be suspected in an infant if upon assessment the nurse finds: a. Narrow sutures b. Sunken fontanels c. A rapid increase in head circumference d. Increase in weight since last visit 3. A 10-year-old child is admitted to the hospital due to history of seizure activity. As his nurse, you are called into the room by his mother, who states he is having a seizure. What would be the priority nursing intervention? a. Prevention of injury by removing the child from his bed b. Prevention of injury by placing a tongue blade in the child's mouth c. Prevention of injury by restraining the child d. Prevention of injury by placing the child on his side and opening his airway 4. A 6-month-old infant is admitted to the hospital with suspected bacterial meningitis. She is crying, irritable, and lying in the opisthotonic position. The priority nursing intervention would be: a. Educate the family on ways to prevent bacterial meningitis. b. Initiate appropriate isolation precautions and begin intravenous antibiotics. c. Assess the infant's fontanels. d. Encourage the mother to hold the infant and feed her. CRITICAL THINKING EXERCISES 1. A child is seen in the doctor's office after hitting his head while skateboarding. The child suffered no loss of consciousness, and has no external injuries and no significant past medical history. He is acting appropriately at this time. His only complaint is a dull headache. What instructions would you give the parents regarding his care at home? Include when they should seek further medical care. 2. A 10-year-old child is admitted to the pediatric unit after experiencing a seizure. A complete, accurate, and detailed history from a reliable source is essential. What information would you ask for while obtaining the history? 3. A 6-year-old child is admitted to the hospital because of a possible seizure. The child's mother calls the nurse to the room because the child is \"jerking all over\" and won't respond when she calls the child's name. List appropriate nursing interventions for this child. Prioritize the list of interventions. 4. Describe the impact of a cerebral vascular accident in the child as compared with the adult. How does it affect the child's future? How will the nurse provide care differently for the child stroke victim as compared with the adult? STUDY ACTIVITIES 1. A 4-month-old child with a history of hydrocephalus has undergone surgery for placement of a VP shunt. What information would you include in the teaching plan? 2. Develop an example of a \"headache log\" that could be used by the family for chronicling the child's headaches, including triggers,relieving factors, and precipitating events. Ensure that the log is developed at a 6th-grade reading level to make it practical for low- literacy parents. 3. In the clinical setting, interview the parent of a child who has suffered significant brain trauma or injury (such as head trauma, IVH, or stroke). Talk with the family about the types of care the child requires. Reflect upon this interview in your clinical journal, and compare how the ongoing care for this child compares with that for a typical child.17 Nursing Care of the Child With a Disorder of the Eyes or Ears Words of Wisdom With the help of a nurse's care and healing, the child's senses provide him or her with an antenna to the universe.

Enrique Baxter, a 9-month-old, is brought to the clinic by his mother. His mother tells you, \"Enrique has been fussy and not eating or sleeping well for the past 2 days.\" Children commonly suffer from disorders related to the eyes and ears. Conjunctivitis and otitis media are two very common infectious and inflammatory disorders that affect the child's eyes or ears. Various alterations such as refractive error, strabismus, and amblyopia affect the development of visual acuity in children. Any alteration in the ear that contributes to hearing loss may have a significant impact on the child's language acquisition. It is important for the nurse to understand the impact of eye and ear disorders on the child's development. Some children may be born with anomalies of the eyes or ears that will have a significant impact on vision and hearing, as well as psychomotor development. On the other hand, disorders affecting the eyes or ears, particularly if chronic or recurrent, can have a significant impact on the development of visual acuity or may cause hearing impairment . In addition, the nurse may be caring for a child with another problem who is also either visually or hearing impaired. The nurse must take these developmental differences into account when planning care for these children.VARIATIONS IN PEDIATRIC ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY The anatomy of children's eyes and ears differs somewhat from that of adults. Additionally, visual acuity develops from birth throughout early childhood. Hearing is intact at birth, but recurrent ear disorders may adversely affect the child's hearing. Eyes Light-skinned children are often born with blue eyes. The iris becomes pigmented over time and eye color is determined by 6 to 12 months of age. The newborn's sclera may be slightly bluish tinged but becomes white within weeks. The eyeball of the infant and young child occupies a relatively larger space within the orbit than the adult's does, making it more susceptible to injury ( Fig. 17.1 ). The spherical shape of the newborn's lens does not allow for distance accommodation, so the newborn sees best at a distance of about 8 to 10 inches (Graven & Browne, 2008). The optic nerve is not completely myelinated, so color discrimination is incomplete. Visual acuity develops over the first few years of the child's life. At birth, acuity ranges from 20/100 to 20/400. Visual acuity improves over the first few years of the child's life, with 20/20 achieved by age 6 to 7 years (Weber & Kelley, 2010). The rectus muscles are uncoordinated at birth and mature over time so that binocular vision (the ability to focus with both eyes simultaneously) may be achieved by 4 months of age (Weber & Kelley, 2010). In the very preterm infant, retinal vascularization is incomplete, so visual acuity may be affected (American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP], 2006). Ears Congenital deformities of the ear are often associated with other body system anomalies and genetic syndromes. The presence of ear anomalies may lead to the search for, and subsequent diagnosis of, the other anomalies or syndromes. The infant's relatively short, wide, and horizontally placed Eustachian tubes allow bacteria and viruses to gain access to the middle ear easily, resulting in increased numbers of ear infections as compared to the adult (Yoon, Kelley, & Friedman, 2011). As the child matures, the tubes assume a more slanted position. Therefore, older children and adults generally have fewer cases of middle ear effusion and infection ( Fig. 17.2 ). Sometimes enlargement of the adenoids contributes to obstruction of the Eustachian tubes, leading to infection.COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS A variety of interventions are used to treat disorders of the eyes and ears in children. The treatments listed in Common Medical Treatments 17.1 and Drug Guide 17.1 usually require a physician's order when a child is hospitalized. FIGURE 17.1 The relatively larger space that the infant's and young child's eyeball occupies within the orbit makes it more susceptible to injury as compared with the adult's eye. FIGURE 17.2 Note the child's relatively shorter, wider Eustachian tubes and their horizontal positioning (B) as compared with the adult's (A).NURSING PROCESS OVERVIEW FOR THE CHILD WITH A DISORDER OF THE EYES OR EARS Care of the child with a disorder of the eyes and ears includes assessment, nursing diagnosis, planning, interventions, and evaluation. There are a number of general concepts related to the nursing process that can be applied to disorders of the eyes and ears. From a general understanding of the care involved for a child with alterations in the eyes or ears, the nurse can then individualize the care based on child specifics. Assessment Assessment of disorders of the eyes and ears in children includes health history, physical assessment, and laboratory or diagnostic testing. Remember Enrique, the 9-month-old with fussiness and poor feeding who was not sleeping well? What additional health history and physical examination assessment information should you obtain? Health History The health history consists of past medical history, family history, history of present illness, and treatments used at home. The past medical history may be significant for prematurity, genetic defect, eye or ear deformities, visual acuity deficit or blindness, hearing impairment or deafness , recurrent ear infections, or ear surgeries. Family history might be significant for eye or ear deformities or vision or hearing impairment or may reveal contacts for infectious exposure. When eliciting the history of the present illness, inquire about its onset and progression and the presence of fever, nasal congestion, eye or ear pain, eye rubbing, ear pulling, headache, lethargy, or behavioral changes. Document if the child has corrective lenses or hearing aids prescribed and to what extent these devices are actually used. Physical Examination When assessing the eyes and ears, begin with inspection and observation. Additionally, testing of visual activity and hearing may be performed. INSPECTION AND OBSERVATION Begin the physical examination with inspection and observation. Note whether the child uses eyeglasses, corrective lenses, or a hearing aid. Observe the eyes: note their positioning and symmetry and the presence of strabismus, nystagmus, and squinting. The eyelids should open equally (failure to open fully is termed ptosis ). Note variations in eye slant and the presence of epicanthal folds. Assess the eyes for the presence of eyelid edema, sclera color, discharge, tearing, and pupillary equality, as well as the size and shape of the pupils. Take Note! Though the sclerae are bluish in newborns, they become white in the first few weeks of life. Blue sclerae that persist beyond a few weeks of life may be an indicator of osteogenesis imperfecta type I, an inherited connective tissue disorder (Weber & Kelley, 2010). Evert the eyelid to inspect the palpebral conjunctivae for redness. Test for extraocular movements and pupillary light response and accommodation. Note the symmetry of the corneal light reflex. Note the presence of the red reflex with an ophthalmoscope. Perform an age-appropriate visual acuity test. Refer to Chapter 9 for more detailed information related to visual acuity testing. Take Note! Attempts to inspect the palpebral conjunctivae may be frightening to children. Ask the older, cooperative child to evert the eyelid himself or herself while the nurse inspects the conjunctivae. Inspect the ears: note their size and shape, position, and the presence of skin tags, dimples, or other anomalies ( Fig. 17.3 ). Upon otoscopic examination, note the presence of cerumen, discharge, inflammation, or a foreign body in the ear canal. Visualize the tympanic membrane and observe its color, landmarks, and light reflex, as well as the presence of perforation, scars, bulging, or retraction. Tympanic membrane mobility may be tested with pneumatic otoscopy. Auditory acuity is tested via the whisper test, audiometry, or other age-appropriate test (refer to Chapter 9 for a more detailed explanation of hearing testing). PALPATION Usually, the eyes are not palpated. In the case of injury the upper eyelid may be everted for examination purposes. Palpate the ear for tenderness over the tragus or pinna. Note the presence of tenderness over the mastoid area (tenderness may be present when otitis media progresses to mastoiditis). Palpate for enlarged cervical lymph nodes (this occurs when the eyes or ears are infected). Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 17.1 offers an explanation of the laboratory and diagnostic tests most commonly used for disorders of the eyes and ears. These tests can assist the physician or nurse practitioner in diagnosing the disorder and/or can be used as guidelines in determining ongoing treatment. Laboratory or nonnursing personnel obtain some of the tests, while the nurse may obtain others. In either instance be familiar with how the tests are obtained, what they are used for, and normal versus abnormal results. This knowledge will also be necessary when providing child and family education related to the testing. Nursing Diagnoses and Related Interventions Upon completion of a thorough assessment, the nurse might identify several nursing diagnoses, including: Disturbed sensory perception Risk for infection Pain Delayed growth and development Impaired verbal communication Deficient knowledge Interrupted family processes Risk for injury After completing an assessment of Enrique, the nurse noted the following: fever, tugging at his ears, and increased crying when lying down. Based on the assessment findings, what would your top three nursing diagnoses be for Enrique? Nursing goals, interventions, and evaluation for the child with an eye or ear disorder are based on the nursing diagnoses. Nursing Care Plan 17.1 may be used as a guide in planning nursing care for the child with an eye or ear disorder, but it should be individualized based on the child's symptoms and needs. Refer to Chapter 14 for the nursing care plan for pain management. Additional information will be included later in the chapter as it relates to specific disorders. Based on your top three nursing diagnoses for Enrique, describe appropriate nursing interventions.

It can be infectious, allergic, or chemical in nature. Viruses or bacteria may cause infectious conjunctivitis. Adenoviruses and influenza account for the bulk of cases of viral conjunctivitis. The most common bacterial cause is Staphylococcus aureus, but many cases are also caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and other bacteria (Yoon et al., 2011). In the newborn, Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are more common causes. Infectious conjunctivitis is very contagious, so epidemics are common, particularly in young children. Risk factors for acute infectious conjunctivitis include age younger than 2 weeks; day care, preschool, or school attendance; concomitant viral upper respiratory infection; pharyngitis; or otitis media. Concurrent acute otitis media may occur depending on the bacterial cause. Complications from simple infectious conjunctivitis are uncommon. Neonates with chlamydial conjunctivitis may be at risk for the development of chlamydial pneumonia. Allergic conjunctivitis results from exposure to particular allergens. Allergic conjunctivitis may be a seasonal or year-round complaint. A genetic predisposition to allergic conjunctivitis exists, just as it does for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. Allergic conjunctivitis occurs more frequently in school-age children and adolescents than it does in infants and young children because of repeat exposure to allergens over time. In the case of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, the severity of symptoms and the number of children affected are directly related to the pollen count in the area. Pathophysiology When bacteria or viruses come in contact with the bulbar or palpebral conjunctiva, they are recognized as foreign antigens and an antigen-antibody immune reaction occurs, resulting in inflammation. Allergic conjunctivitis occurs through a different mechanism. Contact with the allergen results in an allergic response (overreaction of the immune response). The mast cell and histamine mediators are then activated, resulting in inflammation. NURSING CARE PLAN 17.1 Overview for the Child With a Disorder of Eyes or Ears NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Sensory perception, disturbed (visual) related to visual impairment or blindness as evidenced by lack of reaction to visual stimuli, squinting, holding items close Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will reach maximal vision potential: child uses corrective lenses appropriately and is able to participate in play and schoolwork. Intervention: Improving Vision Encourage corrective lens use for enhancement of vision. For the severely impaired or blind child, identify yourself via voice and name items in environment for the child so that the child is aware of his or her surroundings. Support the family's efforts at vision therapy and other habilitation programs to promote vision enhancement. Engage the parents in bedside caregiving because the parents' voice and presence are reassuring to the child. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Sensory perception, disturbed (auditory) related to hearing loss as evidenced by lack of reaction to verbal stimuli, delayed attainment of language milestones Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will reach maximal hearing and speech potential: child uses aids appropriately and communicates effectively. Intervention: Improving Hearing Assess hearing ability frequently because early detection of hearing loss allows for earlier intervention and correction. Assess language development at each visit to allow for early detection of hearing loss (earlier intervention and correction). Encourage hearing aid use for amplification of sound. Teach about hearing aid battery safety to avoid aspiration of battery. Assist child with focusing on sounds in the environment to encourage listening skills. Refer for and encourage attendance at communication habilitation program to maximize communication potential.NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Risk for infection related to presence of infectious organisms as evidenced by fever, presence of virus or bacteria on laboratory screening. Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will exhibit no signs of secondary infection and will not spread infection to others: symptoms of infection decrease over time, and others remain free from infection. Intervention: Reducing Infection Risk Maintain aseptic technique and practice good hand washing to prevent introduction of further infectious agents. Limit number of visitors, and screen for recent illness, to prevent further infection. Administer antibiotics if prescribed to prevent or treat bacterial infection. Encourage nutritious diet according to child's preferences to assist body's natural infection-fighting mechanisms. Isolate the child as required to prevent nosocomial spread of infection. Teach child and family preventive measures such as good hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and adequate disposal of used tissues to prevent nosocomial or community spread of infection. NURSING DIAGNOSIS Growth and development delay, related to sensory impairment as evidenced by delay in attainment of developmental milestones Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will achieve optimum independence for age: child participates in age-appropriate developmental activities. Intervention: Encouraging Growth and Development Encourage attainment of developmental milestones with use of assistive devices as needed for timely developmental achievements. Foster independence in activities of daily living (ADLs) to promote sense of accomplishment. Encourage participation in play with another child or within a group to promote socialization. Assist family to set limits and apply discipline because structure and routine provide a secure environment in which the developing child can grow. Encourage friendships with other children with a sensory impairment to promote socialization and let the child know that he or she is not the only one with these challenges. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Impaired verbal communication related to hearing loss as evidenced by lack of or inarticulate speech, lack of alternate communication channel Outcome Identification and Evaluation The child will communicate effectively with the method chosen by the family (this may be sign language, oral/deaf speech, cued speech, or augmentative alternative communication device). Intervention: Improving Communication Encourage choice of and attendance at communication habilitation program to promote continued learning. Provide consistency between home and hospital in regard to communication style/devices to promote continued learning. Support the child's efforts at correct speech to promote speech development through reinforcement and praise. Encourage family to use spoken language and read books at home to continue to promote appropriate language development. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Deficient knowledge related to sensory impairment (vision or hearing) as evidenced by new diagnosis and parents' questions Outcome Identification and Evaluation Parents express understanding of diagnosis and care of child: parents verbalize understanding, demonstrate use of assistive devices, or independently perform medical treatments. Intervention: Educating the Family Review diagnosis and plan of care with the parents to promote understanding of the disease process. Refer family to resources available for sensory-impaired children to provide further education and support to the parents. Demonstrate medical treatments prescribed or use of assistive devices, requiring a return demonstration, which shows the parents' ability to provide the prescribed care for the child. Encourage exploration of different communication and learning modes available for the sensory-impaired child to allow the child and family to find the right educational and communication style fit. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Family processes, interrupted, related to child's sensory impairment as evidenced by parent verbalization, nonverbal communication, altered coping Outcome Identification and Evaluation Parents demonstrate adequate coping and decreased anxiety: parents are involved in child's care, ask appropriate questions, and are able to discuss child's care and condition calmly. Intervention: Encouraging Appropriate Family Interactions Encourage parents' verbalization of grief if child is hearing or vision impaired. Parents must deal with their own feelings of loss to successfully care for the child with an impairment. Encourage parents' verbalization of concerns related to child's illness: allows for identification of concerns and demonstrates to the family that the nurse also cares about them, not just the child. Explain therapy, procedures, and child's behavior to parents: developing an understanding of the child's current status helps decrease anxiety. Encourage parental involvement in care so that parents may continue to feel needed and valued.NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Risk for injury related to vision loss as evidenced by difficulty navigating surroundings Outcome Identification and Evaluation The infant or child will remain free from injury. Intervention: Preventing Injury Orient the child to hospital surroundings because awareness is the first step to preventing injury. Encourage parent to be at bedside so that the child feels more comfortable. Encourage use of assistive devise to promote safety. Therapeutic Management Therapeutic management of conjunctivitis is prescribed depending on the cause. Bacterial conjunctivitis is generally treated with an ophthalmic antibiotic preparation (drops or ointment). Viral conjunctivitis is a self-limiting disease and does not require topical medication. Eye drops with an antihistamine or mast cell stabilization effect may be helpful in alleviating symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. If other allergy signs and symptoms are also present, an oral antihistamine may also be prescribed. Table 17.1 compares bacterial, viral, and allergic conjunctivitis. Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment of the child with conjunctivitis, regardless of the cause, is similar. It includes health history, physical examination, and, in rare instances, laboratory testing. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Redness Edema Tearing Discharge Eye pain Itching of the eyes (usually with allergic conjunctivitis) Determine the onset of symptoms and their progression as well as response to treatments used at home. Assess for risk factors for infectious conjunctivitis, such as day care or school attendance. Note any history of an upper respiratory infection, sore throat, or earache. Question parents about possible infectious exposure. Review the health history for risk factors for allergic conjunctivitis, such as a family history and a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis. Determine seasonality related to the symptoms and whether the symptoms occur after exposure to particular allergens, such as pollen, hay, or animals. FIGURE 17.4 Note redness of conjunctiva. Physical Examination Observe for eyelid swelling or redness. Inspect the conjunctivae for redness ( Fig. 17.4 ). Note quantity, color, and consistency of discharge. Bacterial infections generally result in a thick, colored discharge, whereas a clear or white discharge is generally seen with viral conjunctivitis. Allergic conjunctivitis often results in a watery discharge, sometimes profuse, which is usually present bilaterally. Contact with an allergen rubbed into one of the eyes may result in unilateral symptoms. Observe the child for other signs of allergic or atopic disease, and document the presence of a runny nose or cough as well. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Cases of bacterial, viral, and allergic conjunctivitis are generally diagnosed based on history and clinical presentation. Cases of viral and allergic conjunctivitis do not warrant laboratory testing. If bacterial conjunctivitis is suspected, then a bacterial culture of the eye drainage may be performed to determine the exact causative organism, thus allowing the most appropriate antibiotic to be prescribed. Nursing Management Nursing management of the various types of conjunctivitis focuses on alleviating symptoms and, for infectious causes, preventing spread. Alleviating Symptoms Teach parents how to apply eye drops or ointment (antibiotic for bacterial causes and antihistamine or mast cell stabilizer for allergic). Warm compresses may be used to help loosen the crust that accumulates on the eyelids overnight when drainage is copious, particularly with bacterial conjunctivitis. The child with allergic conjunctivitis may experience perennial or seasonal allergies (or both). Encourage the child to avoid perennial allergens once the offending allergen is determined (refer to Chapter 18 for additional information related to education about perennial allergen avoidance). Seasonal allergies may include tree pollen in the winter or spring, grass pollen in the summer, and ragweed or flower pollen in the fall. It is impossible to completely eliminate seasonal allergic responses, partly because it is important for children to participate in physical activity outdoors. Teach families to minimize seasonal allergens on the child's skin and hair. Educate families to: Encourage the child not to rub or touch the eyes. Rinse the child's eyelids periodically with a clean washcloth and cool water. When the child comes in from outdoors, wash the child's face and hands. Ensure that the child showers and shampoos before bedtime. Take Note! The itching of allergic conjunctivitis may be relieved with cool compresses. An easy way to accomplish this is to have the child hold a tube of yogurt over the affected eye. Preventing Infectious Spread Because infectious conjunctivitis is extremely contagious, the parent must wash hands diligently after caring for the child. Teach parents and children about appropriate hand washing and discourage them from sharing towels and washcloths. Children with viral conjunctivitis may return to school or day care when symptoms lessen. When mucopurulent drainage is no longer present (usually after 24 to 48 hours of treatment with a topical antibiotic), the child with bacterial conjunctivitis may safely return to day care or school (Ohnsman, 2007). Take Note! Avoid the use of vasoconstricting eye drops such as Visine to rid the eyes of redness. Rebound vasodilation may occur, and with it the redness returns. This leads to repeated frequent use of the drops to keep the eyes from being red but does not treat the actual cause of the redness (Taketokmo, Hodding, & Kraus, 2010). Consider This B ryn Carle, a 6-year-old, is brought to the clinic by her mother. She presents with redness of the left eye, edema, and drainage. What other assessment information would be helpful? Based on the history and clinical presentation, Bryn is diagnosed with conjunctivitis. What education will be necessary for the family to assist in alleviating symptoms and preventing infectious spread? Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction Stenosis or simple obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct is a common disorder of infancy, occurring in about 6% to 20% of the general population (Casady, Meyer, Simon, Stasior, & Zobal-Ratner, 2006). It is unilateral in about 65% of cases. Chronic tearing occurs and build-up in the lacrimal sac causes a mucoid or mucopurulent drainage. Over 90% of all cases resolve spontaneously by 1 year of age (American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus [AAPOS], 2011). No apparent risk factors exist for the development of nasolacrimal duct obstruction or stenosis. Therapeutic management involves a \"wait and see\" approach. Massage may be prescribed, and if secondary bacterial infection is suspected or confirmed, antibiotic ointment or drops may be ordered. If the obstruction does not resolve by 12 months of age, then the pediatric ophthalmologist may probe the duct to relieve the obstruction (a brief outpatient procedure) (Casady et al., 2006). Nursing Assessment Tearing or discharge from one or both eyes is often first noted at the 2-week checkup. Obtain a thorough history about the eye drainage to distinguish it from neonatal conjunctivitis. Determine the onset and progression of symptoms, as well as the newborn's response to any interventions attempted so far. Upon physical examination, note redness of the lower lid of the affected eye. If drainage is present, note its consistency, color, and quantity. Nasolacrimal duct obstruction is usually a diagnosis based on clinical presentation, but culture of the eye drainage may be used to rule out conjunctivitis or secondary bacterial infection ( Fig. 17.5 ). Nursing Management As previously stated, the majority of cases of nasolacrimal duct stenosis resolve spontaneously by 12 months of age (AAPOS, 2011). Nevertheless, the continual tearing and discharge is quite upsetting to the parents. Teach parents to clean the eye area frequently with a moist cloth. In addition, teach parents to massage the nasolacrimal duct, which may change the pressure and cause it to open, allowing drainage to occur. Refer to Teaching Guidelines 17.1 for appropriate nasolacrimal duct massage technique. Ensure that parents are educated about when and how to administer antibiotic eye drops if ordered.FIGURE 17.5 Mild eyelid redness and crusting are present in the infant with nasolacrimal duct stenosis. Disorders chalazion, and blepharitis. Hordeolum is the sebaceous gland of the eyelid follicle, usually caused by bacterial invasion. Chalazion is a chronic painless infection of the meibomian gland. Blepharitis refers to chronic scaling and discharge along the eyelid margin. Chalazion may resolve spontaneously. Therapeutic management of hordeolum and blepharitis usually involves the use of antibiotic ointment. Nursing Assessment Determine the child's health history, noting onset of symptoms, extent and character of eye discharge, and presence of pain (hordeolum is usually painful). Inspect the eyelids, noting redness along the eyelid margin and presence of eyelid edema (hordeolum, blepharitis). Hordeolum may also be quite visible as an enlarged lesion along the lid margin, with purulent drainage present ( Fig. 17.6 ). Chalazion may be visible as a small nodule on the lid margin. The conjunctivae remain clear with all three of these disorders. Teaching Guidelines 17.1 NASOLACRIMAL DUCT MASSAGE Using the forefinger or little finger, push on top of the bone (the puncta must be blocked). Gently push in and up. Then gently push downward along the side of the nose.Adapted from American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus (AAPOS). (2011). Nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Retrieved September 26, 2011, from http://www.aapos.org/terms/conditions/72 FIGURE 17.6 Hordeolum. Nursing Management For hordeolum and blepharitis, instruct parents how to administer antibiotic ointment. Encourage the use of hot, moist compresses. Inform parents that the stye may require several weeks to resolve completely. Also inform parents that chalazion will usually resolve spontaneously; if it does not, it may require minor surgical drainage. Periorbital Cellulitis Periorbital cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the eyelids and tissue surrounding the eye. The bacteria may gain entry to the skin via an abrasion, laceration, insect bite, foreign body, or impetiginous lesion. Periorbital cellulitis may also result from a nearby bacterial infection, such as sinusitis. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the most commonly implicated bacteria. The bacteria produce either an enzyme or endotoxins that initiate the inflammatory response. Redness, swelling, and infiltration of the skin by the inflammatory mediators occur. Therapeutic management of periorbital cellulitis focuses on intravenous antibiotic administration during the acute phase followed by completion of the course with oral antibiotics. Complications of periorbital cellulitis include bacteremia and progression to orbital cellulitis, which is a more extensive infection involving the orbit of the eye. Nursing AssessmentNote the onset and duration of symptoms, as well as any treatment used so far. Document any history of fever. The child may complain of pain around the eye as well as restricted movement of the eye area. Inspect the eye, noting marked eyelid edema as well as a purplish or red color of the eyelid ( Fig. 17.7 ). Usually the conjunctivae are clear and no discharge is present. If the extent of the edema allows the child to open the eye, assess visual acuity, which should be normal. FIGURE 17.7 Periorbital cellulitis. Take Note! Notify the physician or nurse practitioner immediately if any of these signs of progression to orbital cellulitis occur: conjunctival redness, change in vision, pain with eye movement, eye muscle weakness or paralysis, or proptosis. Nursing Management Apply warm soaks to the eye area for 20 minutes every 2 to 4 hours. Administer intravenous antibiotics as prescribed. Teach families the importance of completing the entire course of oral antibiotic treatment at home. Instruct parents to call the physician or nurse practitioner or have the child evaluated again if: The child is not improving. The child reports inability to move the eye. Visual acuity changes. Proptosis occurs.EYE INJURIES As mentioned earlier, infants and young children are more susceptible to eye injuries than adults since the eyeball is relatively larger in relation to the space within the orbit. Developmental maturity may also play a part in eye injuries. For example, as infants and toddlers learn to walk and run, they do not have the awareness and maturity to avert disaster. Older children involved in sports and school science experiments are also at risk for eye injuries. A few of the more common eye injuries are eyelid injuries, contusion, scleral hemorrhage, corneal abrasion, a foreign body in the eye, and chemical injury (Braverman, 2011). Therapeutic management depends on the type of injury. Eyelid lacerations may require suturing. Deep lacerations may result in ptosis at a later date, so these children should be referred to an ophthalmologist. Simple contusions (black eye) usually need only observation, ice, and analgesics. Scleral hemorrhages resolve gradually without intervention over a few weeks. Corneal abrasions may be allowed to self-heal, or antibiotic ointment may be prescribed. Foreign bodies in the eye require removal to prevent further irritation or abrasion. Chemical injuries require irrigation and vision evaluation. Nursing Assessment When a child presents with an eye injury, it is very important to obtain an accurate history related to the injury. Follow the history by performing a focused physical examination, which consists mostly of inspection and observation. It is important to determine whether an eye injury is nonemergent or emergent in order to provide rapid and appropriate treatment in the case of an emergency so that vision may be preserved. Health History Obtain an accurate history. Determine the mechanism of injury and obtain as much detail about the injury as possible. Questions to ask during the health history include: When did the injury occur? What exactly happened? Was an object involved? If so, what type of object, and how fast was it going? Was it a splash injury? Was the child wearing eye protective gear or eyeglasses when the injury occurred? Determine the extent of pain if present. Document photosensitivity, sensation of a foreign body in the eye, and blurry or lost vision. Inquire about past medical history, including previous eye injury or surgery or vision problems. Determine the child's immunization status. Physical Examination Regardless of the type of eye injury, the examination of the child's eye can be quite difficult. The nurse plays an important role in assisting the child and family to cope with the examination. Children with an eye injury often are in acute pain. The area surrounding the eye swells quickly after blunt trauma. Edema and tearing make the eye examination more difficult. Children are very frightened because of the pain and difficulty seeing. Approach the child in a calm and gentle manner. Soothe and coax the child as the eye is examined. Younger children may need to be restrained briefly in order for the examination to proceed safely. Note the eyelid placement and look for signs of trauma such as bleeding, edema, and eyelid malformation. Evaluate the child's ability to open the eyes. Use a penlight to evaluate the pupils' response to light and accommodation (in the case of nonemergent eye trauma, the pupils should remain equally round and reactive to light and accommodation [PERRLA]). Note redness or irritation of the sclerae and/or conjunctivae. Observe for excessive tearing. Figure 17.8 shows the appropriate technique for eversion and examination of the interior of the eyelid.FIGURE 17.8 Eversion of the eyelid for examination. Place a cotton-tipped applicator over the eyelid. Pull the eyelid outward and up over the applicator. In a nonemergent situation, evaluate visual acuity via the use of an age-appropriate vision-screening tool (refer to Chapter 9 for additional information related to visual acuity screening). Generally, radiologic testing is used only in emergency situations (Augsburger & Asbury, 2008). Table 17.2 provides assessment information specific to eyelid laceration, simple contusion, scleral hemorrhage, corneal abrasion, and foreign body in the eye. Take Note! If pupillary reaction is abnormal, vision is affected (decreased acuity from the child's norm, diplopia, or blurriness), or extraocular movements are affected, the child should be immediately referred to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation (Braverman, 2011). Nursing Management Children with urgent or emergent conditions must be referred to an ophthalmologist immediately to preserve vision. Urgent and emergent conditions include: Traumatic hyphema Blowout fracture Ruptured globe Thermal/chemical injury Extensive animal bite Lid laceration with underlying structural involvement Corneal abrasion in which corneal penetration is suspected Foreign body embedded in the globe (Augsburger & Asbury, 2008; Braverman, 2011) Managing Nonemergent Eye Injuries Nonemergent eye injuries usually need only simple management. Assist the physician or nurse practitioner with positioning and distraction of the child for eyelid laceration suturing. The child may require sedation or pain medication for this procedure. To decrease edema in the child with a black eye (simple contusion), instruct the parent to apply an ice pack to the area for 20 minutes, then remove it for 20 minutes, and continue to repeat the cycle as often as possible during the first 24 hours. Tell the parents and child that bruising of the surrounding eye area may take up to 3 weeks to resolve. The appearance of a scleral hemorrhage may be frightening. Instruct the parents and child about the benign nature of the hemorrhage and its natural history of resolution without intervention over a period of a few weeks.If the child with a corneal abrasion has pain, analgesics may be helpful. Tell parents that most corneal abrasions heal on their own. If an antibiotic ointment is prescribed, instruct the parents how to administer the ointment appropriately. Take Note! Patching of the eye with a corneal abrasion is no longer recommended, as children are often able to open the eye under the patch, which causes drying of the eye and further irritation, possibly contributing to prolonged recovery from the abrasion (Turner & Rabiu, 2007). Foreign bodies may be removed from the eye by gently everting the eyelid and wiping the foreign body away with a sterile cotton- tipped applicator. Irrigation with normal saline may also wash the foreign body away. For chemical injury, irrigate the eye with copious amounts of water. Consult ophthalmology for further evaluation and management. Take Note! Refer the child with a large foreign body in the eye or one that is embedded in the globe of the eye to the ophthalmologist for appropriate, safe removal. Eye injuries can be prevented, and nurses play a vital role in educating the public about prevention of eye injuries and use of appropriate safety equipment. See Healthy People 2020 and Evidence-Based Practice 17.1 . HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 17.1 THE EFFECT OF PATCHING FOR CORNEAL ABRASION ON HEALING AND DECREASED PAIN STUDY Simple corneal abrasions are a common eye complaint. Eye patching with or without antibiotic ointment has often been used despite a lack of evidence for its use. Additionally, patches are difficult to keep on young children and may be associated with corneal erosion. The authors included quasi-randomized and randomized studies evaluating patching versus no patching for treatment of simple corneal abrasion. Eleven trials with a total of 1,014 participants were included in the review. Findings The authors found that patching for simple corneal abrasions did not improve healing on day 1, nor did it decrease the amount of pain experienced. Additionally, binocular vision is lost when one eye is patched. Based on these results, it is not recommended that patching be used for treatment of simple corneal abrasions. Nursing Implications Parents worry significantly when their child experiences even a very mild eye injury. Teach parents about the ability of the cornea to heal quickly from a minor abrasion. Emphasize that nonpatched corneal abrasions have been shown to heal more rapidly than those that are patched. Adapted from Turner, A., & Rabiu, M. (2007). Patching for corneal abrasion. The Cochrane Library 2007, 4.VISUAL DISORDERS Adequate visual development requires appropriate sensory stimulation to both eyes over the first few years of life (Graven & Browne, 2008). When one or both eyes are deprived of this stimulation, visual development does not progress appropriately, and visual impairment or blindness may result. This may occur when the eyes are not aligned properly, visual acuity between the eyes is disparate, or other problems with the eyes exist (Graven & Browne, 2008). If vision disorders are diagnosed at an early age and treatment is begun, then vision may progress normally. However, when these disorders go untreated, the young child's developing vision may be reduced significantly. Therefore, it is important to appropriately screen children for these disorders. Common visual disorders in childhood include refractive errors, astigmatism, strabismus, amblyopia, nystagmus, glaucoma, and cataracts. Refractive Errors The most common cause of visual difficulties in children is refractive errors. When the light that enters the lens does not bend appropriately to allow it to fall directly on the retina, then a refractive error occurs. Young children naturally have hyperopia (farsightedness) because the depth of the eye globe is not fully developed until about 5 years of age (Braverman, 2011). These children may have blurriness at close range, but by school age this blurriness usually resolves. When the light entering the eye focuses in front of the retina, it results in myopia (nearsightedness). Children who are nearsighted may see well at close range but have difficulty focusing on the blackboard or other objects at a distance. Therapeutic management for both hyperopia and myopia is prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses. Generally, a child 12 years of age can demonstrate the responsibility necessary to wear and care for contact lenses. Contact lenses may be used in younger children but are lost or damaged more readily. Because of the continuing refractive development in the child's vision through adolescence, laser surgery for vision correction is not recommended by the American Academy of Ophthalmology [AAO] until 21 years of age, though it may be done experimentally in some children (AAO, 2011). Nursing Assessment Elicit the health history, noting blurred vision, complaints of eye fatigue with reading, or complaints of eye strain (headache, pulling sensation, or eye burning). Note complaints of difficulty concentrating on or maintaining a clear focus on objects up close, avoidance of up-close work, or poor work performance (hyperopia). Note the risk factor of family history of myopia. Observe for squinting when the child looks at objects at a distance. Observe the hyperopic child for the presence of esotropia. Readily observable physical findings are not noted in the myopic child. Test visual acuity using an age-appropriate screening tool (for more information related to visual acuity screening, refer to Chapter 9 ). Hyperopia is usually not identified with visual acuity screening alone; it usually requires a retinal examination by an ophthalmologist. Nursing Management Nursing management of the child with a refractive error focuses on providing education about corrective lens use and monitoring for the need for new eyeglasses or contact lenses. Educating About Eyeglass Use Children may or may not be compliant with wearing eyeglasses. Glasses may carry a stigma, and the child may be teased or bullied. However, many children enjoy the improved vision they achieve when wearing their eyeglasses and this can help them overcome the teasing they might suffer. Encourage the child with newly prescribed eyeglasses to wear them by having the parent spend \"special time\" with the child doing an activity that requires the glasses (such as reading or drawing). Teach the parent and child to remove eyeglasses with both hands and to lay them on their side (not directly on the lens on any surface). Instruct the child and family about cleaning the glasses daily with mild soap and water or a commercial cleansing agent provided by the optometrist. Use a soft cloth to clean the glasses, not paper towels, tissues, or toilet paper. Educating About Contact Lens Use Teach the older child or adolescent how to care for the contact lenses properly, including lens hygiene and lens insertion and removal. Inform the child and parents that protective eyewear should be worn when the child is participating in contact sports. If the eye becomes inflamed, remove the contact lens and wear eyeglasses until the eye is improved. Consult with the child's eye care providerto determine if medications prescribed for an eye problem can be used while the contact lens is in. Monitoring for Fit and Visual Correction Encourage the family to complete visual assessments as scheduled. Since the child's vision is continuing to develop and refraction is not stable, the corrective lens prescription may change more frequently than it does in an adult (AAO, 2011). As the young child in particular is continuing to grow at a rapid rate, the head size is also changing. Eyeglass frames may hurt or pinch the child as the child's head becomes larger. Teach families to check the fit of the glasses monthly. Monitor for signs of ill fit, such as constant removal of the glasses in an older child or rubbing at the glasses or eyes in the very young child. Monitor for squinting, eye fatigue or strain, and complaints of headache or dizziness, which may indicate the need for a change in the lens prescription. See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Astigmatism In astigmatism the cornea's curvature is uneven, which results in an irregular quality of vision because the light rays are refracted unevenly. Sometimes the lens is irregularly shaped, having the same result. Nursing Assessment Explore the health history for symptoms of astigmatism. Children with astigmatism often have blurry vision and difficulty seeing letters as a whole, so their ability to read is affected. They may have headaches or dizziness. Older children may complain of eye fatigue or strain. Children with astigmatism often learn to tilt their heads slightly so that they can focus more effectively. This may lead to\"normal\" vision screenings, but the headache and dizziness still warrant further examination by an eye specialist (Braverman, 2011). The diagnosis of astigmatism requires not only a visual acuity test but also a refractive error evaluation by an optometrist or ophthalmologist. Nursing Management Corrective lenses can help to, in effect, smooth out the curvature of the cornea, making the light ray refraction occur smoothly. As with refractive errors, encourage the child who requires corrective lenses for astigmatism to wear the eyeglasses or contact lenses regularly. Strabismus Strabismus refers to misalignment of the eyes. It is common and occurs in up to 7% of all children (Nield, Mangano, & Kamat, 2008). The most common types of strabismus are exotropia and esotropia. In exotropia the eyes turn outward; in esotropia they turn inward. Because of this unequal alignment, visual development in each eye may proceed at different rates. Diplopia (double vision) may result, so vision in one eye may be \"turned off\" by the brain to avoid diplopia. Many infants have strabismus intermittently, but this usually resolves by 3 to 6 months of age. Intermittent strabismus that persists past 6 months of age or constant strabismus at any age warrants referral to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation (Burns, Dunn, Brady, Starr, & Blosser, 2009). Therapeutic management of strabismus may include patching of the stronger eye or eye muscle surgery. Corrective lenses are also used for strabismus. Complications of strabismus include amblyopia and visual deficits. Nursing Assessment Parents may be the first persons to notice that the child's eyes do not face in the same direction. Question parents about the onset of the problem and whether it is continuous or intermittent. If intermittent, does it occur more often when the child is tired? Elicit the health history, noting complaints of blurred vision, tired eyes, squinting or closing one eye in bright sunlight, tilting the head to focus on an object, or a history of bumping into objects (depth perception may be limited). Observe the child's eyes for obvious exotropia or esotropia. In the absence of an obvious finding, assessment of the symmetry of the corneal light reflex is extremely helpful ( Fig. 17.9 ). The \"cover test\" is also a useful tool for the identification of strabismus. FIGURE 17.9 Esotropia. Test for strabismus by observing symmetry of the corneal light reflex. The reflex falls to the left of one pupil and to the right of the other. True strabismus should not be confused with pseudostrabismus. In pseudostrabismus, the eyes may appear slightly crossed (as in the child with a wide nasal bridge and epicanthal folds), but the corneal light reflex remains symmetric (Weber & Kelley, 2010). Nursing Management It is extremely important to treat strabismus appropriately in the developing years so that equal visual acuity may be achieved in both eyes. When patching is prescribed, encourage the family to comply with this modality. Encourage eyeglass wearing if prescribed. Provide appropriate postoperative care by protecting the operative site with eye patching.Amblyopia Amblyopia refers to poor visual development in the otherwise structurally normal eye. It develops within the first decade of life and, if left untreated, is the most common cause of vision loss in children and young adults (Doshi & Rodriguez, 2007). Amblyopia occurs in about 1% to 4% of children (Doshi & Rodriguez, 2007). The vision in one eye is reduced because the eye and the brain are not working together properly. While the eyes are fighting to focus differently because of their differences in visual acuity, one eye is stronger than the other. This is why amblyopia is often referred to as \"lazy eye.\" Amblyopia may be caused by any disorder that affects normal visual development, including strabismus and differences in visual acuity or astigmatism between the two eyes. It may also result from eye trauma, ptosis, or cataract. If untreated, children with amblyopia will have worsening acuity of the poorer eye and strain in the better eye, which may also lead to worsening of acuity in that eye. Eventually blindness will result in one or both eyes. Therapeutic management of amblyopia focuses on strengthening the weaker eye. This may be achieved through patching for several hours per day, using atropine drops in the better eye (once daily), vision therapy, or eye muscle surgery if the cause is strabismus. Nursing Assessment One of the most important functions of the nurse is to identify on screening the preschool child with amblyopia. Begin visual acuity testing using an age-appropriate tool by 3 years of age. Observe for asymmetry of the corneal light reflex in the child of any age. This may be the only sign in the preverbal child. Nursing Management It is very important for children with amblyopia to receive appropriate treatment during the early years of visual development. Patching the better eye for several hours each day encourages the eye with poorer vision to be used appropriately and promotes visual development in that eye. The once-daily use of atropine drops in the better eye results in blurring in that eye, similarly encouraging use and development of the weaker eye (Doshi & Rodriguez, 2007). Support and encourage children and parents to comply with the patching protocol or atropine drop use. Promoting eye safety is extremely important for the child with amblyopia; if the better eye suffers a serious injury, both eyes may become blind. Nystagmus Nystagmus refers to a very rapid, irregular eye movement. It is described by some as \"bouncing\" of the eyes. It may occur in children with congenital cataracts, but the most common cause is a neurologic problem. It is difficult for the brain and eyes to communicate when the eyes are in continuous motion; thus, visual development may be affected. Children with nystagmus must receive further evaluation by an ophthalmologist and possibly a neurologist. Infantile Glaucoma Infantile glaucoma is an autosomal recessive disorder that is more common in interrelated marriages or relationships. It is often associated with other genetic disorders. It occurs in about 1 of 10,000 live births (Lighthouse International, 2011). Infantile glaucoma is characterized by obstruction of aqueous humor flow and increased intraocular pressure that results in large, prominent eyes. Vision loss may occur as a result of corneal scarring, optic nerve damage, or, most commonly, amblyopia. Unlike adult glaucoma, in which medical management is the first step, therapeutic management of infantile glaucoma is focused on surgical intervention. Infantile glaucoma is treated surgically via goniotomy (removal of obstruction of the aqueous humor). Laser surgery is being used as well. Sometimes several surgeries may be necessary to correct the problem. Ongoing medication therapy may also be required. Nursing Assessment Note any family history of infantile glaucoma or other genetic disorders. Elicit the health history, noting history of the infant keeping the eyes closed most of the time or rubbing the eyes. Observe the eye for corneal enlargement and clouding; the eye may appear enlarged. Photophobia may occur, so bright light may bother the infant. Tearing or conjunctivitis and eyelid squeezing or spasm may also occur. The pediatric ophthalmologist may use a tonometer to measure the intraocular pressure during the diagnostic phase.Nursing Management The main goal of nursing care for the infant with glaucoma is postoperative care. Family education will also be important. Providing Postoperative Care Postoperatively the eye will be patched and the child should be maintained on bed rest. Nursing care focuses on protection of the surgical site. Infants and toddlers may require elbow restraints to prevent them from rubbing the affected eye. These children may be quite anxious with one or both eyes patched, since their ability to see will be affected. Use a calm and soothing approach with these children, as well as distraction and developmentally appropriate play activities. Educating the Family Instruct parents and children to make sure the child avoids roughhousing and contact sports for at least 2 weeks after surgery (Ho & Walton, 2004). Before the first surgery occurs, prepare parents for the possibility that three or four operations may be necessary. Teach families how to administer postoperative medications. Encourage parents to comply with ongoing recommended visual assessments. Congenital Cataract A congenital cataract is an opacity of the lens of the eye that is present at birth. Sensory amblyopia will result if the infant goes untreated. Complications include visual developmental delay related to amblyopia. In children younger than 5 years of age, congenital cataract causes 16% of the cases of legal blindness (Lighthouse International, 2011). Bilateral cataracts may be associated with metabolic or genetic syndromes. Surgery to remove the opaque lens can be done as early as 2 weeks of age. The infant is then fitted with a contact lens. Intraocular lens implants are also being used (Lin & Buckley, 2010). The best visual outcomes occur when cataracts are removed prior to 3 months of age. Glaucoma may occur as a complication after cataract surgery. Nursing Assessment Note history of lack of visual awareness. Observe the eyes for apparent cloudiness of the cornea (not always visible). Upon ophthalmoscopic examination, the red reflex will not be observed in the affected eye. Nursing Management Postoperative care focuses on protecting the operative site and providing developmentally appropriate activities. Ensure that the protective eye patch is secure. Elbow restraints may be necessary in the older infant to prevent accidental injury to the operative site. Teach families how to administer antibiotic or corticosteroid ophthalmic drops if prescribed for postoperative use. Once the surgical site is healed, the \"good\" eye may be patched for several hours a day to promote visual development in the eye with the contact or intraocular lens. Regular visual assessments are critical for determining the adequacy of visual development after cataract removal. Instruct parents about the importance of using sunglasses that block ultraviolet rays in the child who has had a lens removed. See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov .Retinopathy of Prematurity Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a disorder characterized by rapid growth of retinal blood vessels in the premature infant. In the fetus, retinal vascularization begins at 4 months and progresses until completion at 9 months or shortly after birth. The premature infant is born with incomplete retinal vascularization, yet new vessels continue to grow between the vascularized and nonvascularized retina. Risk factors include low birthweight, early gestational age, sepsis, high light intensity, and hypothermia. Changes in oxygen tension resulting from hypoxia, oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve changes that occur when adult blood is transfused to the premature infant, and the duration/concentration of supplemental oxygen are thought to play an important role in the development of ROP. Premature infants should have serial examinations by an ophthalmologist until the ROP has regressed and normal vascularization is seen. If ROP continues to progress, laser surgery may be necessary to prevent blindness. Complications of ROP include myopia, glaucoma, and blindness. Strabismus may occur even in cases of regressed (resolved) ROP. Refractive errors and amblyopia may occur as early as 3 months corrected age. In the first year of life, ophthalmologic examinations should occur frequently so that if corrective lenses are needed, they may be prescribed at the earliest possible time. After 1 year corrected age, former premature infants should continue to have yearly ophthalmologic examinations to detect and treat visual deficits early (AAP, 2006). Nursing Assessment Ensure that all former premature infants are routinely screened for visual deficits. Discuss developmental progress with the parents. Observe for the development of strabismus, manifested by an asymmetric corneal light reflex. Nursing Management Nursing management of infants with ROP mainly focuses on ensuring that the family is compliant with the ophthalmologist's follow-up recommendations. Recurrent illness or rehospitalization of premature infants may interfere with scheduled eye follow-up appointments. Ensure that these appointments are rescheduled and that the family understands the importance of them. Many children who have regressed ROP or who require cryotherapy have refractive errors, so even when the ROP is considered resolved, these children should still maintain appropriate ophthalmology follow-up. Visual Impairment Vision impairment in children refers to acuity between 20/60 and 20/200 in the better eye on examination. \"Legal blindness\" is a term used to refer to vision of less than 20/200 or peripheral vision less than 20 degrees. In most cases, vision may be augmented with corrective lenses. Some blind children can differentiate light versus dark, while others live in total darkness. Visual impairment in children may result from a number of different causes. In the United States, visual impairment and blindness are most often caused by refractive error, astigmatism, of prematurity, and retinoblastoma (Lighthouse International, 2011). Factors that increase the risk for developing visual impairment include prematurity, developmental delay, genetic syndrome, family history of eye disease, African American heritage, previous serious eye injury, diabetes, HIV, and chronic corticosteroid use. Trauma is also an important cause of blindness in children. Visual impairments are associated with many other syndromes. For example, many children with genetic syndromes have visual impairments, and albinism is associated with blindness (Lighthouse International, 2011). Children with visual impairments often exhibit motor and cognitive delays as well (Carter, 2011). With one less sense with which to experience their environment, these children may lag behind in developmental milestones. Take Note! Laser pointers pose a risk of retinal damage in infants and young children. Damage occurs if the child stares at the red light for longer than 10 seconds. They should not be used as toys (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2010). Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment for visual impairment includes a careful health history, physical examination, and visual acuity testing. Health History Parents and nurses alike should be alert to signs of potential visual impairment. One of the most important functions of the nurse is to recognize signs of visual impairment as early as possible. These signs may include: At any age: Dull, vacant stare Infants: Do not \"fix and follow\" Do not make eye contact Unaffected by bright light Do not imitate facial expression Toddlers and older children: Rub, shut, and cover eyes Squinting Frequent blinking Hold objects close or sit close to television Bumping into objects Head tilt or forward thrust Physical Examination Assess for symmetry or asymmetry of the corneal light reflex. Perform the \"cover test.\" Use an age-appropriate visual acuity screening tool (refer to Chapter 9 for additional information on visual acuity screening). Nursing Management Important nursing functions in relation to visual impairment and blindness are supporting the child and family and promoting socialization, development, and education. In addition, when the child with a visual impairment is hospitalized for any reason, the nurse must plan appropriate care for that child, taking into consideration the child's level of disability. Box 17.1 provides tips on working with the visually impaired child. It is important to teach these tips to families. BOX 17.1 TIPS FOR INTERACTING WITH THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED CHILD Use the child's name to gain attention. Identify yourself and let the child know you are there before you touch the child. Encourage the child to be independent while maintaining safety. Name and describe people/objects to make the child more aware of what is happening. Discuss upcoming activities with the child. Explain what other children or individuals are doing. Make directions simple and specific. Allow the child additional time to think about the response to a question or statement. Use touch and tone of voice appropriate to the situation. Use parts of the child's body as reference points for the location of items. Encourage exploration of objects through touch. Describe unfamiliar environments and provide reference points. Use the sighted-guide technique when walking with a visually impaired child. Adapted from Delta Gamma Center for Children with Visual Impairments. (2011). Interacting with visually impaired. Retrieved April 4, 2011, from http://dgckids.org/resources/interacting-with-visually-impaired/ Supporting the Child and Family Provide emotional support to the family with a visually impaired child. Ensure that the child's environment provides familiarity and security. Encourage activities that stimulate development; these activities will vary from child to child depending on whether the child also demonstrates impairment in other areas, such as hearing or motor skills. The blind infant will not provide the eye contact that parents are looking for, so educate the parents about other indicators that the infant is acknowledging the parents' presence, such as: Increased motor activity Eyelid movement Changes in breathing pattern Making sounds Encourage the family of a visually impaired child to display affection through touch and tone of voice. Refer families to support networks and other resources for the blind and visually impaired. Several online resources for families of children who are visually impaired or blind can be found on . Promoting Socialization, Development, and Education Blind children, since they lack the visual stimulation that children usually receive, may develop self-stimulatory actions in compensation, often called blindisms. Examples of blindisms are eye pressing, rocking, spinning, bouncing, and head banging. These repetitive behaviors may indicate an effort to communicate or alternatively they may interfere with the child's ability to socialize (Hammer, 2011). Work with the parents to determine whether a strategy for the development of alternative behaviors specific to the individual child would be helpful. Refer the blind or visually impaired child who is younger than 3 years of age to the local district of Early Intervention to establish case management services for the child's developmental needs. After age 3, state laws provide for public education and related services for children with disabilities. An individualized education plan (IEP) should be developed to maximize the child's learning ability. Nurses may be one of the professionals involved in the development of the IEP. The severely visually impaired or blind child will need to learn to read Braille and will also need to learn to navigate the environment with the use of a cane or via another method.INFECTIOUS AND INFLAMMATORY DISORDERS OF THE EARS Infectious and inflammatory disorders of the ears include several different types of otitis media. Otitis media is defined as inflammation of the middle ear with the presence of fluid. It can be subdivided into two categories: acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion. Acute otitis media (AOM) refers to an acute infectious process of the middle ear that may produce a rapid onset of ear pain and possibly fever. Otitis media with effusion (OME) refers to a collection of fluid in the middle ear space without signs and symptoms of infection. Chronic otitis media with effusion is defined as OME lasting longer than 3 months. Otitis externa refers to inflammation of the external ear canal. Acute Otitis Media AOM is a common illness in children, resulting from infection (bacterial or viral) of fluid in the middle ear. Increased susceptibility in infants and young children may be partly explained by the short length and horizontal positioning of the Eustachian tube, limited response to antigens, and lack of previous exposure to common pathogens (Yoon et al., 2011). AOM occurs mostly in the fall through spring, with the highest incidence in the winter. AOM often recurs in infants and young children when the fluid in the middle ear becomes reinfected. The most significant risk factors for otitis media are Eustachian tube dysfunction and susceptibility to recurrent upper respiratory infections. Pathophysiology An upper respiratory infection frequently precedes AOM. Fluid and pathogens travel upward from the nasopharyngeal area, invading the middle ear space. Fluid behind the eardrum has difficulty draining back out toward the nasopharyngeal area because of the horizontal positioning of the Eustachian tube. A viral upper respiratory infection may cause AOM or may place the child at risk for bacterial invasion. Pathogens gain access to the Eustachian tube, where they proliferate and invade the mucosa. Fever and pain occur acutely. Increased pressure behind the tympanic membrane may result in perforation. This may result in decreased pain and yield drainage in the ear canal. Most perforations heal spontaneously and are completely benign. AOM is most commonly caused by viral pathogens, Streptococcus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Viral causes of AOM resolve spontaneously. After clearance of the infection, fluid remains in the middle ear space behind the tympanic membrane, sometimes for several months (otitis media with effusion). This may occur because of the positioning of the Eustachian tubes, resulting in difficulty in draining fluid back to the nasopharyngeal area. OME may also occur because of the high frequency of upper respiratory infections in infants and young children, which again result in back-up of fluid from the nasopharyngeal area. The most common complications of AOM include: Hearing loss Expressive speech delay Tympanosclerosis (scarring of the tympanic membrane; usually has no effect on hearing) Tympanic membrane perforation (acute with resolution or chronic) Chronic suppurative otitis media (chronic drainage via perforation or tympanostomy tubes) Acute mastoiditis (infection of the mastoid process) Intracranial infections, including bacterial meningitis and abscesses Therapeutic Management Viral causes of AOM usually resolve spontaneously, but bacterial causes may require treatment with an antibiotic. It is unreasonable to obtain a culture of middle ear fluid with every episode of AOM to determine the specific cause. Scientific studies of fluid obtained via tympanostomy in children with AOM have been performed, and clinical decision making is based on this research. There is great concern in the health care community about the development of antibiotic resistance due to the overuse of antibiotics (Sheppard, 2008). For this reason, clinical practice guidelines have been developed for a number of disorders based on large quantities of research. Certain diagnosis of AOM is based on rapid onset of symptoms, signs of fluid in the middle ear, and signs or symptoms of inflammation in the middle ear (complaint of ear pain or visible erythema of the tympanic membrane) (American Academy of Pediatrics & American Academy of Family Physicians [AAFP], 2004). The choice of antibiotic will depend on the timing, the child's age, and whether the episode is a first or subsequent infection. The current recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians allow for a period of observation or \"watchful waiting\" in certain children. This allowsfor natural resolution of AOM related to viral causes and decreases the overuse of antibiotics in the pediatric population (AAP & AAFP, 2004). Recommendations for AOM treatment in previously healthy children are found in Table 17.3 . Pain management is also an important component of AOM treatment, as is appropriate follow-up to ensure disease resolution. Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment of the child with AOM consists of health history and physical examination. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Note acute, abrupt onset of signs and symptoms. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Fever (may be low grade or higher) Complaints of otalgia (ear pain) Fussiness or irritability Crying inconsolably, particularly when lying down Batting or tugging at the ears (may also occur with teething or OME, or may be a habit) Rolling the head from side to side Poor feeding or loss of appetite Lethargy Difficulty sleeping or awakening crying in the night Fluid draining from the ear Determine the child's response to any treatments used thus far. Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as: Young age Day care attendance Previous history of AOM or OME Antecedent or concurrent upper respiratory infection Other risk factors ( Box 17.2 ) BOX 17.2 RISK FACTORS FOR ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA Eustachian tube dysfunction Recurrent upper respiratory infection First episode of acute otitis media (AOM) before 3 months of age Day care attendance (increases exposure to viruses causing upper respiratory infections) Previous episodes of AOM Family history Passive smoking Crowding in the home or large family size Native American, Inuit, or Australian aborigine ethnicity Absence of infant breastfeeding Immunocompromise Poor nutrition Craniofacial anomalies Presence of allergies (possibly) Adapted from American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians.

Deterding (Eds.), Current pediatric diagnosis and treatment (20th ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill. Physical Examination and Diagnostic Testing The child may complain of pain when the ear is examined. On otoscopic examination, the tympanic membrane will have a dull or opaque appearance and is bulging and/or red ( Fig. 17.10 ). Sometimes pus (greenish or yellowish) may be visible behind the eardrum. Upon pneumatic otoscopy, the eardrum will be immobile. (A physician or nurse practitioner usually performs the otoscopic examination.) If the tympanic membrane has become perforated, drainage may be present in the ear canal, but the canal will otherwise appear normal. Palpate for possible cervical lymphadenopathy. Tympanometry is not as useful in the diagnosis of AOM as it is with OME. Nursing Management Nursing management of the child with acute otitis media is mainly supportive in nature. It focuses on pain management, family education, and prevention of AOM. Managing Pain Associated With Acute Otitis Media Analgesics such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen have been shown to be effective at managing mild to moderate pain associated with AOM. They have the added benefit of reducing fever. Narcotic analgesics such as codeine may be prescribed for severe pain. Application of heat or a cool compress may also be helpful. Instruct the family to have the child lie on the affected side with the heating pad or covered ice pack in place to that ear. Numbing eardrops such as benzocaine (Auralgan) may be helpful in the event of acute, severe pain. They should be used in conjunction with analgesics, though, because of the short duration of action (AAP & AAFP, 2004). Educating the Family If the treatment selected for AOM is observation or watchful waiting, explain the rationale for this to the family. Ensure that the family understands the importance of returning for reevaluation if the child is not improving or if the AOM progresses to severe illness. When antibiotics are prescribed, the family must understand the importance of completing the entire course of antibiotics. Families are tempted to stop giving the antibiotic because the child is usually vastly improved after taking the medication for 24 to 48 hours. Follow-up for resolution of AOM is necessary for all children and the physician or nurse practitioner will determine the timing of that follow-up. Emphasize the importance of follow-up to the parents, educating them about OME and its potential impact on hearing and speech. See Healthy People 2020.FIGURE 17.10 (A) Normal tympanic membrane. (B) Acute otitis media: note opacity of the tympanic membrane. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Preventing Acute Otitis Media Breastfed infants have a lower incidence of AOM than formula-fed infants, and breast milk's immunologic benefits are well known (Yoon et al., 2011). Therefore, encourage mothers to breastfeed for at least 6 to 12 months. Instruct families to avoid excess exposure to individuals with upper respiratory infections to decrease the incidence of these infections in their child. Infants and children should not be exposed to second-hand smoke. Encourage parents to stop smoking. If quitting smoking is not possible, then instruct parents not to smoke inside the house or automobile. Encourage the parents to have the child immunized with Prevnar and the influenza vaccine. Xylitol syrup, a sucrose substitute, may also be protective (Klein & Pelton, 2011). Children who are old enough may chew xylitol- containing gum. Younger children and infants may be given xylitol syrup. Clinical studies are under way to validate the protective effects of xylitol. Care should be taken to avoid excessive dosing, as xylitol can cause diarrhea. Otitis Media With Effusion Otitis media with effusion refers to the presence of fluid within the middle ear space, without signs or symptoms of infection. It may occur independent of AOM or may persist after the infectious process of AOM has resolved. Risk factors for OME include passive smoking, absence of breastfeeding, frequent viral upper respiratory infections, allergy, young age, male sex, adenoid hypertrophy,Eustachian tube dysfunction, and certain congenital disorders (Yoon et al., 2011). Complications of OME include AOM, hearing loss, and deafness. Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment of the child with OME includes health history, physical examination, and diagnostic testing. Health History Determine the extent of symptoms. Children may be asymptomatic or may experience a popping sensation or fullness behind the eardrum. Explore the health history for risk factors such as passive smoking, absence of breastfeeding, frequent viral upper respiratory infections, allergy, or recent history of AOM. Physical Examination Otoscopic examination may reveal a dull, opaque tympanic membrane that may be white, gray, or bluish ( Fig. 17.11 ). If the tympanic membrane is not opaque, a fluid level or air bubble may be visualized. Mobility may be absent or diminished upon pneumatic otoscopy. Tympanometry may be used to confirm the diagnosis of OME. FIGURE 17.11 Otitis media with effusion; note dull white tympanic membrane. Nursing Management OME may take several months to resolve. Nursing management during the resolution phase focuses on education and monitoring for hearing loss. Educating the Family Educate the family about the natural history of OME and the anatomic differences in young children that contribute to OME. Inform parents that antihistamines, decongestants, antibiotics, and corticosteroids have not been proven to hasten the resolution of OME and thus are not recommended. OME usually resolves spontaneously, but children should be rechecked every 4 weeks while this resolution is occurring. Teach parents not to feed infants in a supine position and to avoid bottle propping. Monitoring for Hearing Loss When OME persists, the primary concern is its effect on hearing. In the infant or toddler who should be experiencing rapid language development, impaired hearing can depress language acquisition significantly (AAP, 2004). Children with OME who are at risk for speech, language, or learning problems may be referred for evaluation of hearing earlier than a child with OME who is not at risk ( Box17.3 ). Children with chronic OME (persistent OME of 3 months' duration or longer) should be referred to a specialist for hearing evaluation (AAP, 2004). Children who are not already at risk for speech concerns and are not experiencing difficulty with language acquisition may be reassessed every 3 to 6 months as long as hearing loss is not identified. At-risk children may require treatment earlier. BOX 17.3 CHILDREN AT RISK FOR SPEECH, LANGUAGE, OR LEARNING DIFFICULTIES Permanent hearing loss (without otitis media with effusion) Speech/language delay (suspected or diagnosed) Craniofacial disorder that may interfere with speech Any pervasive developmental disorder Genetic disorders or syndromes associated with speech or learning problems Cleft palate Blindness or significant visual impairment Adapted from American Academy of Pediatrics. (2004). Clinical practice guideline: Otitis media with effusion. Pediatrics, 113, 1412-1429. To communicate more effectively with children with OME who have hearing loss: Turn off music or television. Position yourself within 3 feet of the child before speaking. Face the child while speaking. Use visual cues. Increase the volume of your speech only slightly. Speak clearly. Request preferential classroom seating. Take Note! Evaluation of hearing is recommended when OME lasts 3 months or more if language delay, hearing loss, or a learning problem is suspected (AAP, 2004). Providing Postoperative Care for the Child With Pressure-Equalizing Tubes The standard treatment for persistent or problematic OME is surgical insertion of pressure-equalizing (PE) tubes into the tympanic membrane (via myringotomy). The tubes stay in place for at least several months and generally fall out on their own ( Fig. 17.12 ). The procedure is usually done as an outpatient surgery and the child returns home in the evening. Teach the parents to administer ear drops postoperatively if prescribed. After PE tube placement, the surgeon may recommend avoiding water entry into the ears. If recommended, advise parents to have the child wear earplugs in the bathtub or while swimming. Placement of the PE tubes allows for adequate hearing, which in turn encourages appropriate speech development. Placement of PE tubes does not prevent middle ear infection. If the middle ear becomes infected with PE tubes in place, the tubes allow infected fluid to drain from the ear. Tell parents to contact their physician or nurse practitioner if drainage from the ear is noted. After PE tubes are placed, young children often have rapid increases in language acquisition, and parents should observe for this (O'Reilly, 2009).FIGURE 17.12 Pressure-equalizing tubes in place in the tympanic membrane. Take Note! Children with PE tubes who swim in a lake must wear earplugs, as lake water is contaminated with bacteria and entry of that water into the middle ear should be avoided (Cincinnati Children's, 2009). Otitis Externa Otitis externa is defined as an infection and inflammation of the skin of the external ear canal. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are typical causative agents, though fungi such as Aspergillus and other bacteria also may be implicated. Moisture in the canal contributes to pathogen growth (Yoon et al., 2011). Otitis externa is commonly known as \"swimmer's ear\" since it occurs more frequently in those who swim often (and thus have wet ear canals). Changing the pH in the ear canal contributes to the inflammatory process. Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment of the child with otitis externa focuses on the health history and physical examination. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Note history of ear itching or pain, ear drainage, or a feeling of fullness in the ear canal, with possible difficulty hearing. Note onset and progression of symptoms, as well as the child's response to treatments. Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as previous episodes of otitis externa or history of recent swimming in a pool, lake, or ocean. Take Note! The child with otitis externa usually has significant ear pain. Pressure on the tragus should be avoided, as it can worsen the pain. Physical ExaminationTypically a white or colored discharge can be seen in the ear canal or running from the ear. On otoscopy, the canal is red and edematous, often too swollen for insertion of the speculum and viewing of the tympanic membrane ( Fig. 17.13 ). Diagnosis is based on clinical findings. Occasionally the ear drainage is cultured for bacteria or fungus, particularly if otitis externa is not improving with treatment. FIGURE 17.13 Note edema and erythema of the ear canal as well as purulent discharge in the child with otitis externa. Nursing Management The primary goals of nursing management are pain relief, treatment of the infection, and prevention of recurrence. Managing Pain Analgesics (often narcotics) may be administered to manage the pain. A warm compress or heating pad to the affected ear is helpful in some children. Treating the Infection Administer antibiotic or antifungal eardrops as prescribed. In some cases a wick is placed in the ear canal. The wick keeps the antibiotic drops in contact with the skin of the ear canal and promotes healing. Wick insertion can be extremely painful, and younger children will need to be restrained during insertion for their safety. Preventing Reinfection Teach children and their parents about prevention of further episodes once the infection has resolved. Since moisture contributes to otitis externa, explain the importance of keeping the ear canals dry. Encourage the child and parents to use one of the methods described in Teaching Guidelines 17.2 after swimming or showering.HEARING LOSS AND DEAFNESS Infants are ordinarily born with the sense of hearing fully developed. Language development in infancy and early childhood is dependent upon adequate hearing, and even the fluctuating hearing loss associated with intermittent bouts of AOM can hinder language development (AAP, 2004). Hearing loss may be unilateral (involving one ear) or bilateral (involving both ears). The extent of hearing loss is defined based on the softest intensity of sound that is perceived, described in decibels (dB). Levels of hearing loss are: Teaching Guidelines 17.2 PREVENTING OTITIS EXTERNA 1. Avoid the use of cotton swabs, headphones, and earphones. 2. Wear earplugs when swimming. 3. Promote ear canal dryness and alternate pH. Use one or more of the following methods: Dry the ear canals using a hair dryer set on a lower setting. Administer solutions that have a drying effect on the auditory canal skin and change the pH of the canal to discourage organism growth in susceptible children. The following solutions can be used: A few drops of Domeboro solution can be placed in the canal, and then allowed to run out. A mixture of half rubbing alcohol and half vinegar (squirted into the canal and then allowed to run out). The alcohol solution should be used only when the ear canals are healthy. Using it while the canals are inflamed will cause stinging and increased pain. Adapted from Cook, S. P. (2009). Swimmer's ear. Retrieved April 4, 2011, from http://kidshealth.org/parent/infections/ear/swimmer_ear.html 0 to 20 dB: normal 20 to 40 dB: mild loss 40 to 60 dB: moderate loss 60 to 80 dB: severe loss Greater than 80 dB: profound loss (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association [ASHA], 2011c) Hearing loss may be congenital or acquired. Congenital hearing loss affects 1 to 6 infants per 1,000 live births in the United States (ASHA, 2011b). Most congenital hearing loss is inherited through a recessive gene, with only about 22% of cases resulting from an autosomal dominant trait (Kaye and the Committee on Genetics, 2006). Congenital hearing loss accounts for about one half of all the cases of hearing impairment; the remainder are acquired. Premature infants and those with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn are at increased risk for hearing loss compared with other infants. Hearing loss commonly occurs with a large number of congenital or genetic syndromes, as well as in association with anomalies of the head and face. A variety of newborn universal hearing screening mandates have been passed by legislation in 37 states, thus allowing for earlier identification of infants with congenital hearing loss (NCHAM, 2010a). See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Delayed-onset (acquired) hearing loss may be conductive, sensorineural, or mixed. Conductive hearing loss results when transmission of sound through the middle ear is disrupted, as in the case of OME. When fluid fills the middle ear, the tympanic membrane is unable to move properly, and partial or complete hearing loss occurs. Sensorineural hearing loss is caused by damage to the hair cells in the cochlea or along the auditory pathway. This may result from kernicterus, use of ototoxic medication, intrauterine infection with cytomegalovirus or rubella, neonatal or postnatal infection such as meningitis, severe neonatal respiratory depression, or exposure to excess noise. Mixed hearing loss occurs when the cause may be attributed to both conductive and sensorineural problems. See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Regardless of the cause of hearing loss, early intervention can make a difference in the child's ability to communicate. Once the hearing loss has been determined, intervention can begin. Hearing aids, cochlear implants, communication devices, and speech education may enable these children to communicate verbally. Improved communication beginning in infancy and early childhood may also improve the child's school achievement. Take Note! Earplugs or covers used to block ambient noise in premature infants in the neonatal intensive care unit may decrease the preemie's risk for hearing loss and improve development outcomes (Turk, Williams, & Lasky, 2009). Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment of the child with hearing loss or impairment focuses on the health history, physical examination, and diagnostic hearing testing. Health History Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Infant: Wakes only to touch, not environmental noises Does not startle to loud noises Does not turn to sound by 4 months of age Does not babble at 6 months of age Does not progress with speech development Young child: Does not speak by 2 years of age Communicates needs through gestures Does not speak distinctly, as appropriate for his or her age Displays developmental (cognitive) delays Prefers solitary play Displays immature emotional behavior Does not respond to ringing of the telephone or doorbell Focuses on facial expressions when communicating Older child: Often asks for statements to be repeated Is inattentive or daydreams Performs poorly at school Displays monotone or other abnormal speech Gives inappropriate answers to questions except when able to view face of speaker At any age: Speaks loudly Sits very close to the TV or radio or turns volume up too loud Responds only to moderate or loud voices Investigate signs of hearing loss as early as possible in order for appropriate intervention to begin. Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as congenital anomalies, genetic syndrome, infection, family history, kernicterus, neonatal ventilator use, ototoxic medication, or exposure to excess noise. Note whether newborn hearing screening was done and, if so, what the results were. Physical Examination and Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Determine the child's level of interaction with the environment. For preschoolers and older children, administer the whisper test, keeping in mind that this is a gross screening test only. Perform the Weber and Rinne tests (refer to Chapter 9 for further explanation). If further evaluation is needed, the nurse may be responsible for administering an otoacoustic emissions test or auditory brain stem evoked response test, either in the hospital or outpatient office. Nursing Management The primary goal of nursing care for the child with a hearing impairment is to provide education and support to the family and child. Individualize care for the child with a hearing impairment and the family based on their specific responses to the hearing impairment.Augmenting Hearing Compliance with hearing aids and communication curriculums is critical so that the child can develop hearing and speech. Teach the child and family that hearing aids should be cleaned daily with a damp cloth. In addition, it is important to change batteries weekly. When inserting the aid, the volume should be turned down, then adjusted to the appropriate level after insertion. As the infant or child grows, the hearing aid will need to be reassessed for proper fit. Many deaf schools and other organizations provide loaner hearing aids so that the best fit and amplification may be determined prior to purchase. Assist the family to explore this type of option in the local community. See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . When cochlear implants are used, the nurse focuses on postoperative care of the incision site and pain management. Promoting Communication and Education Families and children need to learn how to communicate effectively with one another. If the child learns American Sign Language, for instance, the parents and siblings should as well. Table 17.4 provides information on communication options for hearing-impaired children and their families. Communication may also be enhanced by the use of text telephone service in the home and closed-caption television. Bells and alarms in the home may use lights rather than sound to alert the child. Provide a sign language interpreter for the child at health care visits if the parent is not present for interpretation.Encouraging Education Refer the child younger than 3 years of age to the local district of Early Intervention for case management of developmental needs. At 3 years of age and beyond, state laws provide for public education and related services for children with disabilities. An IEP should be developed to maximize the child's learning ability. Nurses may be involved in the development of the IEP. Some children attend schools specifically geared toward deaf students. The choice of school will depend on the family's preferences and resources. Providing Support The diagnosis of a significant disability can be extremely stressful for the family. Encourage families to express their feelings and provide emotional support. Ensure that the needs of any siblings are also attended to. When the family is ready, encourage them to network with other families who have children with similar needs. Educate the family about the child's prescribed plan of care. Refer families to resources and support groups. Several helpful resources are listed on . KEY CONCEPTS Though hearing is fully developed at birth, visual development continues to progress until about age 7 years. Binocular vision develops by age 4 months; visual acuity progresses to 20/50 by age 3 years and usually reaches 20/20 by age 7 years. The relatively short and horizontally positioned Eustachian tubes of infants and young children make them more susceptible to otitis media than adults. To maximize speech and language development, hearing loss should be identified early and intervention begun immediately. Children with genetic syndromes or family history are at increased risk of visual and hearing impairments. The corneal light reflex test and cover test are useful tools for identifying strabismus and amblyopia. Tympanometry is used to determine the presence of fluid behind the eardrum (such as with otitis media with effusion). Topical ophthalmic medications are used to treat certain infectious eye disorders. Appropriate hand washing is the single most important factor to reduce the spread of acute viral or bacterial conjunctivitis. Systemic antibiotics are used for the treatment of periorbital cellulitis. Strabismus, glaucoma, and cataracts may all lead to visual impairment if left untreated. Asymmetry of the corneal light reflex occurs with true strabismus. Amblyopia must be identified early and treated with patching, corrective lenses, or surgery to prevent visual deterioration and promote appropriate vision development. A cloudy cornea indicates the presence of cataract. Very premature infants are at high risk of developing visual deficits related to retinopathy of prematurity and are also at increased risk of hearing impairment compared to other infants. Eye strain, eye rubbing, and headaches may indicate a visual deficit. Children with visual disorders should be encouraged to use prescribed corrective lenses. Recurrent episodes of acute otitis media may negatively affect the child's hearing. Recurrent or constant nasal congestion contributes to otitis media with effusion. Otitis externa can be prevented by keeping the ear canal dry and altering canal pH. The fluctuating hearing loss associated with recurrent otitis media and the hearing loss associated with chronic otitis media with effusion can both significantly hinder language development in the infant and toddler. The child with hearing loss should receive early intervention with hearing aids or other augmentative devices. REFERENCES American Academy of Ophthalmology. (2011). Glasses, contacts & LASIK.

KEY wheezing work of breathing Learning Objectives Upon completion of the chapter, you will be able to: 1. Distinguish differences between the anatomy and physiology of the respiratory system in children versus adults. 2. Identify various factors associated with respiratory illness in infants and children.3. Discuss common laboratory and other diagnostic tests useful in the diagnosis of respiratory conditions. 4. Describe nursing care related to common medications and other treatments used for management and palliation of respiratory conditions. 5. Recognize risk factors associated with various respiratory disorders. 6. Distinguish different respiratory disorders based on their signs and symptoms. 7. Discuss nursing interventions commonly used for respiratory illnesses. 8. Devise an individualized nursing care plan for the child with a respiratory disorder. 9. Develop child/family teaching plans for the child with a respiratory disorder. 10. Describe the psychosocial impact of chronic respiratory disorders on children. Alexander Roberts, 4 months old, is brought to the clinic by his mother. He has a cold and has been coughing a great deal for 2 days. Today he has had difficulty taking his bottle and is breathing very quickly. Mrs. Roberts says he seems tired. Respiratory disorders are the most common causes of illness and hospitalization in children. These illnesses range from mild, nonacute disorders (such as the common cold or sore throat) to serious life-threatening conditions (such as epiglottitis). Chronic disorders, such as allergic rhinitis or asthma, can affect quality of life, but frequent acute or recurrent infections also can interfere significantly with the well-being of some children. Respiratory infections account for the majority of acute illnesses in children (Brady, 2009). The child's age, socioeconomic status, and general health status can influence both the development of respiratory disorders and the course of the illness. For example, low- income children have a higher risk for increased severity or increased frequency of respiratory disease (Quinn, Kaufman, Siddiqi, & Yeats, 2010). Infants and younger children are more likely to deteriorate quickly from a respiratory illness, and children with chronic disorders such as diabetes, congenital heart disease, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, and cerebral palsy tend to be more severely affected with respiratory disorders. In addition, the season of the year can influence the development of respiratory disorders and the course of the illness. For example, certain viruses are more prevalent in the winter, whereas allergen-related respiratory diseases are more prevalent in the spring and fall. Parents may have difficulty determining the severity of their child's condition and might either seek care very early in the course of the illness (when it is still very mild) or wait, presenting to the health care setting when the child is very ill. Nurses must be familiar with respiratory conditions affecting children so that they can provide guidance and support to families. Difficulty with breathing can be very frightening for both the child and parents. Nurses must be able to ask questions that can help establish the severity of the child's illness and determine whether the family should seek care at a health care facility. Since respiratory illnesses account for the majority of pediatric admissions to general hospitals, nurses caring for children need to have expert assessment and intervention skills in this area. Detection of worsening respiratory status early in the course of deterioration allows for timely treatment and the chance to prevent a minor problem from becoming a critical illness. Nurses are also in a unique position to provide education about respiratory illnesses and to promote efforts to prevent these illnesses.VARIATIONS IN PEDIATRIC ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY Respiratory conditions often affect both the upper and lower respiratory tract, though some affect primarily one or the other. Respiratory dysfunction in children tends to be more severe than in adults, and several differences in the infant's or child's respiratory system account for this increased severity. Nose Newborns are obligatory nose breathers until at least 4 weeks of age. The young infant cannot automatically open his or her mouth to breathe if the nose is obstructed. The nares must be patent for breathing to be successful while feeding. Newborns breathe through their mouths only while crying. The upper respiratory mucus serves as a cleansing agent, yet newborns produce very little mucus, making them more susceptible to infection. However, the newborn and young infant may have very small nasal passages, so when excess mucus is present, airway obstruction is more likely. Infants are born with maxillary and ethmoid sinuses present. The frontal sinuses (most often associated with sinus infection) and the sphenoid sinuses develop by age 6 to 8 years. Therefore, younger children are less apt to acquire sinus infections compared to adults. Throat The tongue of the infant relative to the oropharynx is larger than in adults. Posterior displacement of the tongue can quickly lead to severe airway obstruction. Through early school age, children tend to have enlarged tonsillar and adenoidal tissue even in the absence of illness. This can contribute to an increased incidence of airway obstruction. Trachea The airway lumen is smaller in infants and children than in adults. The infant's trachea is approximately 4 mm wide compared with the adult width of 20 mm. When edema, mucus, or bronchospasm is present, the capacity for air passage is greatly diminished. A small reduction in the diameter of a child's airway (resulting from the presence of edema or mucus) will result in an exponential increase in resistance to airflow ( Fig. 18.1 ). Increased work of breathing (effort or labor associated with respiration) then occurs. In teenagers and adults the larynx is cylindrical and fairly uniform in width. In infants and children younger than 10 years old, the cricoid cartilage is underdeveloped, resulting in laryngeal narrowing (American Heart Association [AHA], 2007). Thus, in infants and children, the larynx is funnel shaped. Additionally, the larynx and glottis are located higher in the neck, increasing the chance of aspiration of foreign material into the lower airways. Congenital laryngomalacia occurs in some infants and results in the laryngeal structure being weaker than normal, yielding greater collapse on inspiration. Box 18.1 discusses congenital laryngomalacia. The child's airway is highly compliant, making it quite susceptible to dynamic collapse in the presence of airway obstruction (AHA, 2007). The muscles supporting the airway are less functional than those in the adult. Children have a large amount of soft tissue surrounding the trachea, and the mucous membranes lining the airway are less securely attached as compared with adults. This increases the risk for airway edema and obstruction. Upper airway obstruction resulting from a foreign body, croup, or epiglottitis can result in tracheal collapse during inspiration.FIGURE 18.1 (A) Note the smaller diameter of the child's airway under normal circumstances. (B) With 1 mm of edema present, note the exponential decrease in airway lumen diameter as compared with the adult. Lower Respiratory Structures The bifurcation of the trachea occurs at the level of the third thoracic vertebra in children, compared to the level of the sixth thoracic vertebra in adults. This anatomic difference is important when suctioning children and when endotracheal intubation is required (see Chapter 31 for further discussion) (AHA, 2007). This difference in placement also contributes to risk for foreign material aspiration. The bronchi and bronchioles of infants and children are narrower in diameter than the adult's, placing them at increased risk for lower airway obstruction (see Fig. 18.1 ). Lower airway obstruction during exhalation often results from bronchiolitis or asthma or is caused by foreign body aspiration into the lower airway. BOX 18.1 CONGENITAL LARYNGOMALACIA Inspiratory stridor is present and is intensified with certain positions. Suprasternal retractions may be present, but the infant exhibits no other signs of respiratory distress. Congenital laryngomalacia is generally a benign condition that improves as the cartilage in the larynx matures. It usually disappears by age 1 year. The crowing noise heard with breathing can make parents very anxious. Reassure parents that the condition will improve with time. Parents become very familiar with the \"normal\" sound their infant makes and are often able to identify intensification or change in the stridor. Airway obstruction may occur earlier in infants with this condition, so intensification of stridor or symptoms of respiratory illness should be evaluated early by the physician or nurse practitioner. Alveoli develop at approximately 24 weeks' gestation. Term infants are born with about 50 million alveoli. After birth, alveolar growth slows until 3 months of age and then progresses until the child reaches 7 or 8 years of age, at which time the alveoli reach the adult number of around 300 million. Alveoli make up most of the lung tissue and are the major sites for gas exchange. Oxygen moves from the alveolar air to the blood, while carbon dioxide moves from the blood into the alveolar air. Smaller numbers of alveoli, particularly in the premature and/or young infant, place the child at a higher risk of hypoxemia (deficiency in the concentration of oxygen in arterial blood) and carbon dioxide retention.Chest Wall In older children and adults, the ribs and sternum support the lungs and help keep them well expanded. The movement of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles alters volume and pressure within the chest cavity, resulting in air movement into the lungs. Infants' chest walls are highly compliant (pliable) and fail to support the lungs adequately. Functional residual capacity can be greatly reduced if respiratory effort is diminished. This lack of lung support also makes the tidal volume of infants and toddlers almost completely dependent upon movement of the diaphragm. If diaphragm movement is impaired (as in states of hyperinflation, such as asthma), the intercostal muscles cannot lift the chest wall and respiration is further compromised. Metabolic Rate and Oxygen Need Children have a significantly higher metabolic rate than adults. Their resting respiratory rates are faster and their demand for oxygen is higher. Adult oxygen consumption is 3 to 4 liters per minute, while infants consume 6 to 8 liters per minute. In any situation of respiratory distress, infants and children will develop hypoxemia more rapidly than adults (AHA, 2007). This may be attributed not only to the child's increased oxygen requirement but also to the effect that certain conditions have on the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. Normal oxygen transport relies on binding of oxygen to hemoglobin in areas of high partial pressure of oxygen (pO 2 ) (pulmonary arterial beds) and release of oxygen from hemoglobin when the pO 2 is low (peripheral tissues). Normally, a pO 2 of 95 mm Hg results in an oxygen saturation of 97%. A decrease in oxygen saturation results in a disproportionate (much larger) decrease in pO 2 ( Fig. 18.2 ). Thus, a small decrease in oxygen saturation reflects a larger decrease in pO 2 . Conditions such as alkalosis, hypothermia, hypocarbia, anemia, and fetal hemoglobin cause oxygen to become more tightly bound to hemoglobin, resulting in the curve shifting to the left. Common pediatric conditions such as acidosis, hyperthermia, and hypercarbia cause hemoglobin to decrease its affinity for oxygen, further shifting the curve to the right. FIGURE 18.2 Normal hemoglobin dissociation curve (green), shift to the right (red), and shift to the left (blue).COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS A variety of interventions are used to treat respiratory illness in children. The treatments listed in Common Medical Treatments 18.1 and Drug Guide 18.1 usually require a physician's order when a child is hospitalized. COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS 18.1 RESPIRATORY DISORDERS DRUG GUIDE 18.1 COMMON DRUGS FOR RESPIRATORY DISORDERS NURSING PROCESS OVERVIEW FOR THE CHILD WITH A RESPIRATORY DISORDER Care of the child with a respiratory disorder includes assessment, nursing diagnosis, planning, interventions, and evaluation. There are a number of general concepts related to the nursing process that can be applied to respiratory disorders. From a general understanding of the care involved for a child with respiratory dysfunction, the nurse can then individualize the care based on specifics for the particular child. Assessment Assessment of respiratory dysfunction in children includes health history, physical examination, and laboratory or diagnostic testing. Remember Alexander, the 4-month-old with the cold, cough, fatigue, feeding difficulty, and fast breathing? What additional health history and physical examination assessment information should the nurse obtain? Health History The health history consists of the past medical history, family history, and history of present illness (when the symptoms started and how they have progressed), as well as treatments used at home. The past medical history might be significant for recurrent colds or sore throats, atopy (such as asthma or atopic dermatitis), prematurity, respiratory dysfunction at birth, poor weight gain, or history of recurrent respiratory illnesses or chronic lung disease. Family history might be significant for chronic respiratory disorders such as asthma or might reveal contacts for infectious exposure. When eliciting the history of the present illness, inquire about onset and progression; fever; nasal congestion; noisy breathing; presence and description of cough; rapid respirations; increased work of breathing; ear, nose, sinus, or throat pain; ear pulling; headache; vomiting with coughing; poor feeding; and lethargy. Also inquire about exposure to second-hand smoke. Children exposed to environmental smoke have an increased incidence of respiratory illnesses such as asthma, bronchitis, and pneumonia (World Health Organization, 2011). See Healthy People 2020. Physical Examination Physical examination of the respiratory system includes inspection and observation, auscultation, percussion, and palpation. INSPECTION AND OBSERVATION Color. Observe the child's skin color, noting pallor or cyanosis (circumoral or central). Pallor (pale appearance) occurs as a result of peripheral vasoconstriction in an effort to conserve oxygen for vital functions. Cyanosis (a bluish tinge to the skin and mucous membranes) occurs as a result of hypoxia (oxygen deficiency). It might first present circumorally (just around the mouth) and progress to central cyanosis. Newborns might have blue hands and feet (acrocyanosis), a normal finding. The infant might have pale hands and feet when cold or when ill, as peripheral circulation is not well developed in early infancy. It is important, then, to note if the cyanosis is central (involving the midline), as this is a true sign of hypoxia. Children with low red blood cell counts might not demonstrate cyanosis as early in the course of hypoxemia as children with normal hemoglobin levels. Therefore, absence of cyanosis or the degree of cyanosis present is not always an accurate indication of the severity of respiratory involvement. Note the rate and depth of respiration as well as work of breathing. Often the first sign of respiratory illness in infants and children is tachypnea (increased respiratory rate). Take Note! A slow or irregular respiratory rate in an acutely ill infant or child is an ominous sign (AHA, 2007). See Chapter 31 . Nose and Oral Cavity. Inspect the nose and oral cavity. Note nasal drainage and redness or swelling in the nose. Note the color of the pharynx, presence of exudate, tonsil size, and status and presence of lesions anywhere in the oral cavity. Cough and Other Airway Noises. Note the sound of the cough (Is it wet, productive, dry and hacking, tight? When does the cough occur? Is it only or mainly at night?). Also note if noises associated with breathing are present (e.g., grunting, stridor, or audible wheeze). Grunting occurs on expiration and is produced by premature glottic closure. It is an attempt to preserve or increase functional residual capacity. Grunting might occur with alveolar collapse or loss of lung volume, such as in atelectasis (a collapsed or airless portion of the lung), pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. Stridor , a high-pitched, readily audible inspiratory noise, is a sign of upper airway obstruction. Sometimes wheezes can be heard with the naked ear; these are referred to as audible wheezes. Respiratory Effort. Assess respiratory effort for depth and quality. Is breathing labored? Infants and children with significant nasal congestion may have tachypnea, which usually resolves when the nose is cleared of mucus. Mouth breathing may occur when a large amount of nasal congestion is present. Increased work of breathing, particularly if associated with restlessness and anxiety, usually indicates lower respiratory involvement. Assess for the presence of nasal flaring, retractions, or bobbing of the head with each breath. Nasal flaring can occur early in the course of respiratory illness and is an effort to inhale greater amounts of oxygen. Retractions (the inward pulling of soft tissues with respiration) can occur in the intercostal, subcostal, substernal, supraclavicular, or suprasternal regions ( Fig. 18.3 ). Document the severity of the retractions: mild, moderate, or severe. Also note the use of accessory neck muscles. Note the presence of paradoxical breathing (lack of simultaneous chest and abdominal rise with the inspiratory phase; see Fig. 18.4 ). Take Note! Seesaw (or paradoxical) respirations are very ineffective for ventilation and oxygenation (binding of oxygen). The chest falls on inspiration and rises on expiration. Anxiety and Restlessness. Is the child anxious or restless? Restlessness, irritability, and anxiety result from difficulty in securing adequate oxygen. These might be very early signs of respiratory distress, especially if accompanied by tachypnea. Restlessness might progress to listlessness and lethargy if the respiratory dysfunction is not corrected. Clubbing. Inspect the fingertips for the presence of clubbing , an enlargement of the terminal phalanx of the finger, resulting in a change in the angle of the nail to the fingertip ( Fig. 18.5 ). Clubbing might occur in children with a chronic respiratory illness. It is the result of increased capillary growth as the body attempts to supply more oxygen to distal body cells. Hydration Status. Note the child's hydration status. Assess the oral mucosa for color and moisture. Note skin turgor, presence of tears, and adequacy of urine output. The child with a respiratory illness is at risk for dehydration. Pain related to sore throat or mouth lesions may prevent the child from drinking properly. Nasal congestion interferes with the infant's ability to suck effectively at the breast or bottle. Tachypnea and increased work of breathing interfere with the ability to safely ingest fluids. Auscultation Assess lung sounds via auscultation. Evaluate breath sounds over the anterior and posterior chest, as well as in the axillary areas. Note the adequacy of aeration. Breath sounds should be equal bilaterally. The intensity and pitch should be equal throughout the lungs; document diminished breath sounds. In the absence of concurrent lower respiratory illness, the breath sounds should be clear throughout all lung fields. During normal respiration, the inspiratory phase is usually softer and longer than the expiratory phase. Prolonged expiration is a sign of bronchial or bronchiolar obstruction. Bronchiolitis, asthma, pulmonary edema, and an intrathoracic foreign body can cause prolonged expiratory phases. Infants and young children have thin chest walls. When the upper airway is congested (as in a severe cold), the noise produced in the upper airway might be transmitted throughout the lung fields. When upper airway congestion is transmitted to the lung fields, the congested-sounding noise heard over the trachea is the same type of noise heard over the lungs but is much louder and more intense. To ascertain if these sounds are truly adventitious lung sounds or if they are transmitted from the upper airway, auscultate again after the child coughs or his or her nose has been suctioned. Another way to discern the difference is to compare auscultatory findings over the trachea to the lung fields to determine if the abnormal sound is truly from within the lung or is actually a sound transmitted from the upper airway. Note adventitious sounds heard on auscultation. Wheezing , a high-pitched sound that usually occurs on expiration, results from obstruction in the lower trachea or bronchioles. Wheezing that clears with coughing is most likely a result of secretions in the lower trachea. Wheezing resulting from obstruction of the bronchioles, as in bronchiolitis, asthma, chronic lung disease, or cystic fibrosis, does not clear with coughing. Rales (crackling sounds) result when the alveoli become fluid filled, such as in pneumonia. Note the location of the adventitious sounds as well as the timing (on inspiration, expiration, or both). Tachycardia might also be present. An increase in heart rate often initially accompanies hypoxemia. Percussion When percussing, note sounds that are not resonant in nature. Flat or dull sounds might be percussed over partially consolidated lung tissue, as in pneumonia. Tympany might be percussed with a pneumothorax. Note the presence of hyperresonance (as might be apparent with asthma). Palpation Palpate the sinuses for tenderness in the older child. Assess for enlargement or tenderness of the lymph nodes of the head and neck. Document alterations in tactile fremitus detected on palpation. Increased tactile fremitus might occur in a case of pneumonia or pleural effusion. Fremitus might be decreased in the case of barrel chest, as with cystic fibrosis. Absent fremitus might be noted with pneumothorax or atelectasis. Compare central and peripheral pulses. Note the quality of the pulse as well as the rate. With significant respiratory distress, perfusion often becomes compromised. Poor perfusion might be reflected in weaker peripheral pulses (radial, pedal) when compared to central pulses.Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 18.1 explains the laboratory and diagnostic tests most commonly used for a child with a respiratory disorder. The tests can assist the physician or nurse practitioner in diagnosing the disorder and/or be used as guidelines in determining ongoing treatment. Laboratory or nonnursing personnel obtain some of the tests, while the nurse might obtain others. In either instance it is important for the nurse to be familiar with how the tests are obtained, what they are used for, and normal versus abnormal results. This knowledge will also be necessary when providing child and family education related to the testing. Take Note! Ambient light may interfere with pulse oximetry readings. When the pulse oximeter probe is placed on the infant's foot or the young child's toe, covering the probe and foot with a sock may help to ensure an accurate measurement (DeMeulenaere, 2007). Nursing Diagnoses, Goals, Interventions, and Evaluation Upon completion of a thorough assessment, the nurse might identify several nursing diagnoses, including: Ineffective airway clearance Ineffective breathing pattern Impaired gas exchange Risk for infection Pain Risk for fluid volume deficit Altered nutrition, less than body requirements Activity intolerance Fear Altered family processes After completing an assessment of Alexander, the nurse notes the following: lots of clear secretions in the airway, child appears pale, respiratory rate 68, retractions, nasal faring, wheezing, and diminished breath sounds. Based on these assessment findings, what would your top three nursing diagnoses be for Alexander? Nursing goals, interventions, and evaluation for the child with a respiratory disorder are based on the nursing diagnoses. Nursing Care Plan 18.1 can be used as a guide in planning nursing care for the child with a respiratory disorder. The nursing care plan should be individualized based on the child's symptoms and needs; refer to Chapter 14 for detailed information on pain management. Additional information will be included later in the chapter as it relates to specific disorders. Based on your top three nursing diagnoses for Alexander, describe appropriate nursing interventions. Providing Oxygen Supplementation Oxygen may be delivered to the child by a variety of methods ( Fig. 18.6 ). Since oxygen administration is considered a drug, it requires a physician's or nurse practitioner's order, except when following emergency protocols outlined in a health care facility's policies and procedures. Many health care settings develop specific guidelines for oxygen administration that are often coordinated by respiratory therapists, yet the nurse still remains responsible for ensuring that oxygen is administered properly. Oxygen sources include wall-mounted systems as well as cylinders. The supply of oxygen available from a wall-mounted source is limitless, but use of a wall- mounted source restricts the child to the hospital room. Cylinders are portable oxygen tanks; the D-cylinder holds a little less than 400 liters of oxygen and the E- cylinder holds about 650 liters of oxygen. Cylinders turn on with a gauge attached to the top of the tank. The cylinder is useful for the child on low-flow oxygen because it allows for mobility. The tank empties relatively quickly if the child requires a high flow of oxygen, so this is not the best oxygen source in an emergency. Respiratory therapists usually maintain the respiratory equipment that is found in the emergency room or hospital. However, in an outpatient setting the nurse may be responsible for maintaining respiratory equipment and checking the level of oxygen in the office's oxygen tanks each day. Take Note! Oxygen is highly flammable, so use safety precautions. Post signs (\"Oxygen in Use\"); inform the family to avoid matches, lighters, and flammable or volatile materials; and use only facility-approved equipment. The efficiency of oxygen delivery systems is affected by several variables, including the child's respiratory effort, the liter flow of oxygen delivered, and whether the equipment is being used appropriately. In general, oxygen facemasks come in infant, child, and adult sizes. Select the mask that best fits the child. In addition, ensure that the mask is sealed properly to decrease the amount of oxygen that escapes from the mask. Ensure that the liter flow is set according to the manufacturer's recommendations for use with that particular delivery method. The oxygen flow rate or concentration is usually determined by the physician's or nurse practitioner's order. Whichever method of delivery is used, provide humidification during oxygen delivery to prevent drying of nasal passages and to assist with liquefying secretions. Table 18.1 provides details on oxygen delivery methods. Take Note! Monitor vital signs, color, respiratory effort, pulse oximetry, and level of consciousness before, during, and after oxygen therapy to evaluate its effectiveness.HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov .

NURSING CARE PLAN 18.1 Overview for the Child With a Respiratory Disorder NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Ineffective airway clearance related to inflammation, increased secretions, mechanical obstruction, or pain as evidenced by presence of secretions, productive cough, tachypnea, and increased work of breathing Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will maintain patent airway, free from secretions or obstruction, easy work of breathing, respiratory rate within parameters for age. Interventions: Maintaining a Patent Airway Position with airway open (sniffing position if supine) to allow adequate ventilation. Humidify oxygen or room air and ensure adequate fluid intake (intravenous or oral) to liquefy secretions for ease in clearance. Suction with bulb syringe or via nasopharyngeal catheter as needed, particularly prior to bottle-feeding, to promote clearance of secretions. If tachypneic, maintain nothing by mouth (NPO) status to avoid aspiration. In older child, encourage expectoration of sputum with coughing to promote airway clearance. Perform chest physiotherapy if ordered to mobilize secretions. Ensure emergency equipment is readily available to avoid delay should airway become unmaintainable. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Ineffective breathing pattern related to inflammatory or infectious process as evidenced by tachypnea, increased work of breathing, nasal flaring, retractions, diminished breath sounds Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will exhibit adequate ventilation: respiratory rate within parameters for age, easy work of breathing (absence of retractions, accessory muscle use, grunting), clear breath sounds with adequate aeration, oxygen saturation >94% or within prescribed parameters. Interventions: Promoting Effective Breathing Patterns Assess respiratory rate, breath sounds, and work of breathing frequently to ensure progress with treatment and so that deterioration can be noted early. Use pulse oximetry to monitor oxygen saturation in the least invasive manner to note adequacy of oxygenation and ensure early detection of hypoxemia. Position for comfort with open airway and room for lung expansion. Use pillows or padding if necessary to maintain position to ensure optimal ventilation via maximum lung expansion. Administer supplemental oxygen and/or humidity as ordered to improve oxygenation. Allow for adequate sleep and rest periods to conserve energy. Administer antibiotics as ordered: may be indicated in the case of bacterial respiratory infection. Encourage incentive spirometry and coughing with deep breathing (can be accomplished through play) to maximize ventilation (play enhances the child's participation). NURSING DIAGNOSIS Gas exchange, impaired, related to airway plugging, hyperinflation, atelectasis, as evidenced by cyanosis, decreased oxygen saturation, and alterations in arterial blood gases Outcome Identification and Evaluation Gas exchange will be adequate: pulse oximetry reading on room air is within normal parameters for age, blood gases within normal limits, absence of cyanosis. Interventions: Promoting Adequate Gas Exchange Administer oxygen as ordered to improve oxygenation. Monitor oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry to detect alterations in oxygenation. Encourage clearance of secretions via coughing, expectoration, chest physiotherapy, and suctioning to improve gas exchange. Administer bronchodilators if ordered (albuterol, levalbuterol, and racemic epinephrine) to treat bronchospasm and improve gas exchange. Provide frequent contact and support to the child and family to decrease anxiety, which increases the child's oxygen demands. Assess and monitor mental status (confusion, lethargy, restlessness, combativeness): hypoxemia can lead to changes in mental status. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Risk for infection related to presence of infectious organisms as evidenced by fever or presence of virus or bacteria on laboratory screening Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will exhibit no signs of secondary infection and will not spread infection to others: symptoms of infection decrease over time; others remain free from infection. Interventions: Preventing Infection Maintain aseptic technique, practice good hand washing, and use disposable suction catheters to prevent introduction of further infectious agents. Limit number of visitors and screen them for recent illness to prevent further infection. Administer antibiotics if prescribed to prevent or treat bacterial infection. Encourage nutritious diet according to child's preferences and ability to feed orally to assist body's natural infection-fighting mechanisms. Isolate the child as required to prevent nosocomial spread of infection. Teach child and family preventive measures such as good hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and proper disposal of used tissues to prevent nosocomial or community spread of infection. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Fluid volume deficit, risk for, related to decreased oral intake, insensible losses via fever, tachypnea, or diaphoresis Outcome Identification and Evaluation Fluid volume will be maintained: oral mucosa moist and pink, skin turgor elastic, urine output at least 1 to 2 mL/kg/hour. Interventions: Maintaining Adequate Fluid Volume Administer intravenous fluids if ordered to maintain adequate hydration in NPO state. When allowed oral intake, encourage oral fluids. Popsicles, favorite fluids, and games can be used to promote intake. Assess for signs of adequate hydration (elastic skin turgor, moist mucosa, adequate urine output). Monitor intake and output to identify fluid imbalance. Monitor urine specific gravity, urine and serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and osmolality to determine fluid status. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Nutrition, altered: less than body requirements related to difficulty feeding as evidenced by poor oral intake, tiring with feeding Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will maintain adequate nutritional intake: weight is gained or maintained. Child consumes adequate diet for age. Interventions: Promoting Adequate Nutritional Intake Weigh on same scale at same time daily so that measurements are consistent. Perform calorie counts over a 3-day period to determine whether caloric intake is sufficient. Encourage child to choose higher-calorie, protein-rich foods to optimize growth potential. Coax young children to eat better by playing games and offering favorite foods to improve intake. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Activity intolerance related to high respiratory demand as evidenced by increased work of breathing and need for frequent rest when playing Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will resume normal activity level: activity is tolerated without difficulty breathing. Pulse oximetry readings and vital signs are within parameters for age and activity level. Interventions: Increasing Activity Tolerance Provide rest periods balanced with periods of activity, and group nursing activities and visits to allow for sufficient rest. Provide small, frequent meals to prevent overtiring (energy is expended while eating). Encourage quiet activities that do not require exertion to prevent boredom. Allow gradual increase in activity as tolerated, keeping pulse oximetry reading within normal parameters, to minimize risk for further respiratory compromise. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Fear related to difficulty breathing, unfamiliar personnel, procedures, and environment (hospital), as evidenced by clinging, crying, fussing, verbalization, or lack of cooperation Outcome Identification and Evaluation Fear/anxiety will be reduced: decreased episodes of crying or fussing, happy and playful at times. Interventions: Relieving Fear Establish trusting relationship with child and family to decrease anxiety and fear. Explain procedures to child at developmentally appropriate level to decrease fear of unknown. Provide favorite blanket or bear as well as comfort measures preferred by child such as rocking or music for added security. Involve parents in care to give child reassurance and decrease fear. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Family processes, altered, related to child's illness or hospitalization as evidenced by family's presence in hospital, missed work,demonstration of inadequate coping Outcome Identification and Evaluation Parents demonstrate adequate coping and decreased anxiety: parents are involved in child's care, ask appropriate questions, and are able to discuss child's care and condition calmly. Interventions: Promoting Adequate Family Processes Encourage parents to discuss their concerns related to child's illness to identify concerns and show parents that the nurse also cares about them, not just the child. Explain therapy, procedures, and child's behavior to parents to decrease their anxiety. Encourage parents to be involved in care so they feel needed and valued. ACUTE INFECTIOUS DISORDERS Acute infectious disorders include the common cold, sinusitis, influenza, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, pneumonia, and bronchitis. Common Cold The common cold is also referred to as a viral upper respiratory infection CURT) or nasopharyngitis. Colds can be caused by rhinoviruses, parainfluenza, RSV, enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and human meta-pneumovirus. Viral particles spread through the air or from person-to-person contact. Colds occur more frequently in the winter. They affect children of all ages and have a higher incidence among children who attend day care and school-age children (Yoon, Kelley, & Friedman, 2011). It is not unusual for a child to have six to nine colds per year. Spontaneous resolution of the common cold occurs after about 7 to 10 days. Potential complications include secondary bacterial infections of the ears, throat, sinuses, or lungs. Therapeutic management of the common cold is directed toward symptom relief. Nasal congestion may be relieved via humidity and use of normal saline nasal wash or spray followed by suctioning. Antihistamines are not indicated, as they dry secretions further. Over-the-counter cold preparations are available singly and in combinations. These preparations have not been proven to reduce the length or severity of the cold but may offer symptomatic relief in some children older than 6 years of age (they are not recommended in children younger than the age of 4 due to side effects) (Yoon et al., 2011). See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Take Note! In 2007, over-the-counter cold preparations containing decongestants intended for use in infants and toddlers were removed from the market. Several research studies have not shown the preparations to be effective and they are known to have potentially serious side effects (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2007). Safety of these products in children 2 to 11 years of age remains under review by the Food and Drug Administration. Nursing Assessment The child may have either a stuffy or runny nose. Nasal discharge is usually thin and watery at first but may become thicker and discolored. The color of nasal discharge is not an accurate indicator of viral versus bacterial infection. The child may be hoarse and complain of a sore throat. Cough usually produces very little sputum. Fever, fatigue, watery eyes, and appetite loss may also occur. Symptoms are generally at their worst over the first few days and then decrease over the course of the illness. Assess for risk factors such as day care or school attendance. Inspect for edema and vasodilation of the mucosa. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation rather than laboratory or x-ray studies. Comparison Chart 18.1 differentiates causes of nasal congestion.Nursing Management Nursing management of the child with a common cold consists of promoting comfort, providing family education, and preventing spread of the cold. Promoting Comfort Nursing care of the common cold is aimed at supportive measures. Nasal congestion may be relieved with the use of normal saline nose drops, followed by bulb syringe suctioning in infants and toddlers. Older children may use a normal saline nose spray to mobilize secretions. A cool mist humidifier also helps with nasal congestion. Generally, other over-the-counter nose sprays are not recommended for use in children, but they are sometimes prescribed for very short-term use. Promotion of adequate oral fluid intake is important to liquefy secretions. Educate parents about the use of cold and cough medications. Although they may offer some symptomatic relief, they have not been proven to shorten the length of cold symptoms. Counsel parents to use the appropriate product depending on the symptom relief desired, rather than a combination product. Products containing acetaminophen combined with other \"cold symptom\" medications may mask a fever in the child who is developing a secondary bacterial infection. As with all viral infections in children, teach parents that aspirin use should be avoided because of its association with Reye syndrome (Ben-Joseph, 2008). COMPARISON CHART 18.1 CAUSES OF NASAL CONGESTION Providing Family Education Currently there are no medications available to treat the viruses that cause the common cold, so symptomatic treatment is all that is necessary. Antibiotics are not indicated unless the child also has a bacterial infection. Explain to parents the importance of reserving antibiotic use for appropriate illnesses. Provide education about the use of normal saline nose drops and bulb suctioning to clear the infant's nose of secretions. Normal saline nasal wash using a bulb syringe to instill the solution is also helpful for children of all ages with nasal congestion. Though normal saline for nasal administration is available commercially, parents can also make it at home ( Box 18.2 ). Teaching Guidelines 18.1 gives instructions on use of the bulb syringe. Counsel parents about how to recognize complications of the common cold, which include: Prolonged fever Increased throat pain or enlarged, painful lymph nodes Increased or worsening cough, cough lasting longer than 10 days, chest pain, difficulty breathing Earache, headache, tooth or sinus pain BOX 18.2 HOMEMADE SALT WATER NOSE DROPS Mix 8 oz distilled water, a half-teaspoon sea salt, and a quarter-teaspoon baking soda. Keeps for 24 hours in the refrigerator, but should be allowed to come to room temperature prior to use. Unusual irritability or lethargy Skin rash If complications do occur, tell parents to notify the physician or nurse practitioner for further instructions or reassessment. Preventing the Common ColdTeaching about ways to prevent the common cold is a vital nursing intervention. Explain that frequent hand washing helps to decrease the spread of viruses that cause the common cold. Teach parents and family to avoid second-hand smoke as well as crowded places, especially during the winter. Avoid close contact with individuals known to have a cold. Encourage parents and families to consume a healthy diet and get enough rest. Consider This C orey Davis, a 3-year-old, is brought to the clinic by her mother. She presents with a runny nose, congestion, and a nonproductive cough. Her mother says, \"She's miserable.\" What other assessment information would be helpful? Based on the history and clinical presentation, Corey is diagnosed with a common cold. What education would be helpful for this family? Include ways to improve Corey's comfort and ways to prevent the common cold. Teaching Guidelines 18.1 USING THE BULB SYRINGE TO SUCTION NASAL SECRETIONS 1. Hold the infant on your lap or on the bed with the head tilted slightly back. 2. If using saline, instill several drops of saline solution in one of the infant's nostrils. 3. Compress the sides of the bulb syringe completely. Use only a rubber-tipped bulb syringe. Place the rubber tip in the infant's nose.4. Release pressure on the bulb. 5. Remove the syringe and squeeze bulb over tissue or the sink to empty it of secretions.6. Repeat on other nostril if necessary. Using a bulb syringe prior to bottle-feeding or breastfeeding may relieve congestion enough to allow the infant to suck more efficiently. 7. Clean the bulb syringe thoroughly with warm water after each use and allow to air dry. Sinusitis Sinusitis (also called rhinosinusitis) generally refers to a bacterial infection of the paranasal sinuses. The disease may be either acute or chronic in nature. Approximately 5% of upper respiratory infections are complicated with acute sinusitis (DeMuri & Wald, 2010). In young children the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses are the main sites of infection. After age 10 years, the frontal sinuses may be more commonly involved (Yoon et al., 2011). Mucosal swelling, decreased ciliary movement, and thickened nasal discharge all contribute to bacterial invasion of the nose. Nasal polyps also place the child at risk for bacterial sinusitis. Complications include orbital cellulitis and intracranial infections, such as subdural empyemas. Symptoms lasting less than 30 days generally indicate acute sinusitis, whereas symptoms persisting longer than 4 to 6 weeks usually indicate chronic sinusitis. Sinusitis is managed with antibiotic treatment. The therapeutic management approach varies with chronicity. The course of treatment is usually 14 days. Naturally, chronic sinusitis requires a longer course of treatment than acute sinusitis. Surgical therapy may be indicated for children with chronic sinusitis, particularly if it is recurrent or if nasal polyps are present. Nursing Assessment The most common presentation of sinusitis is persistent signs and symptoms of a cold. Rather than improving after 7 to 10 days, nasal discharge persists. Explore the history for: Cough Fever In preschoolers or older children, halitosis (bad breath) Facial pain may or may not be present, so is not a reliable indicator of disease Eyelid edema (in the case of ethmoid sinus involvement) Irritability Poor appetite Assess for risk factors such as a history of recurrent cold symptoms or a history of nasal polyps. On physical examination, note eyelid swelling, extent of nasal drainage, and halitosis. Inspect the throat for postnasal drainage. Inspect the nasal mucosa for erythema. Palpate the sinuses, noting pain with mild pressure. The diagnosis may be made based on the history and clinical presentation, augmented by x-ray, computed tomography scan, or magnetic resonance imaging findings in some cases. (Refer to Comparison Chart 18.1 , which differentiates the causes of nasal congestion.) Nursing Management Normal saline nose drops or spray, cool mist humidifiers, and adequate oral fluid intake are recommended for children with sinusitis.Teach families the importance of continuing the full course of antibiotics to eradicate the cause of infection. Also educate the family that using decongestants, antihistamines, and intranasal steroids as adjuncts in the treatment of sinusitis has not been shown to be beneficial (DeMuri & Wald, 2010). Normal saline nose spray or nasal washes may promote drainage. Influenza Influenza viral infection (known commonly as the \"flu\") occurs primarily during the winter. It is spread through inhalation of droplets or contact with fine-particle aerosols. Infected children shed the virus for 1 to 2 days before symptoms begin and may continue shedding the virus in increased amounts (as compared to adults) for as long as 2 weeks. Average annual infection rates in children range from 20% to 50% (Iskander, Booy, & Lambert, 2007). Influenza viruses primarily affect the upper respiratory epithelium but can cause systemic effects as well. Children with chronic heart or lung conditions, diabetes, chronic renal disease, or immune deficiency are at higher risk for more severe influenza infection compared to other children. Bacterial infections of the respiratory system commonly occur as complications of influenza infection, severe pneumococcal pneumonia in particular. Otitis media occurs in 18% to 40% of all influenza cases (Iskander et al., 2007). Less common complications include Reye syndrome and acute myositis. Reye syndrome is an acute encephalopathy that has been associated with aspirin use in the influenza-infected child (Ben-Joseph, 2008). Acute myositis is particular to children. A sudden onset of severe pain and tenderness in both calves causes the child to refuse to walk. Due to the potential for complications, a prolonged fever or a fever that returns during convalescence should be investigated. Take Note! Current recommendations are for all children older than 6 months of age to be immunized yearly against influenza (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2010). Nursing Assessment Children who attend day care or school are at higher risk for influenza infection than those who are routinely at home. Note the presence of risk factors for severe disease, such as chronic heart or lung disease (such as asthma), diabetes, chronic renal disease, or immune deficiency or children with cancer receiving chemotherapy. School-age children and adolescents experience the illness similarly to adults. Abrupt onset of fever, facial flushing, chills, headache, myalgia, and malaise are accompanied by cough and coryza (nasal discharge). About half of infected individuals have a dry or sore throat. Ocular symptoms such as photophobia, tearing, burning, and eye pain are common. Infants and young children exhibit symptoms similar to other respiratory illnesses. Fever greater than 39.5\u00b0C is common. Infants may be mildly toxic in appearance and irritable and have a cough, coryza, and pharyngitis. Wheezing may occur, as influenza also can cause bronchiolitis. An erythematous rash may be present and diarrhea may also occur. The diagnosis may be confirmed by a rapid assay test. Nursing Management Nursing management of influenza is mainly supportive. Symptomatic treatment of cough and fever and maintenance of hydration are the focus of care. Antiviral drugs can reduce the symptoms associated with influenza if they are started within the first 24 to 48 hours of the illness (Iskander et al., 2007). Pharyngitis Inflammation of the throat mucosa (pharynx) is referred to as pharyngitis. A sore throat may accompany nasal congestion and is often viral in nature. A bacterial sore throat most often occurs without nasal symptoms. Group A streptococci account for 15% to 25% of cases, with the remainder being caused by other viruses or bacteria (Martin, 2010). Suppurative complications of group A streptococcal infection include peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess. Peritonsillar abscess may be noted by asymmetric swelling of the tonsils, shifting of the uvula to one side, and palatal edema. Retropharyngeal abscess may progress to the point of airway obstruction, hence requiring careful evaluation and appropriate treatment. Additional complications include acute rheumatic fever (see Chapter 19 ) and acute glomerulonephritis (see Chapter 21 ). Viral pharyngitis is usually self-limited and does not require therapy beyond symptomatic relief. Group A streptococcal pharyngitis requires antibiotic therapy. If either the rapid diagnostic test or throat culture (described below) is positive for group A streptococci, penicillin is generally prescribed. Appropriate alternative antibiotics include amoxicillin and, for those allergic to penicillin, macrolidesand cephalosporins. Take Note! A \"strep carrier\" is a child who has a positive throat culture for streptococci when asymptomatic. Strep carriers are not at risk for complications from streptococci, as are those who are acutely infected with streptococci and are symptomatic (Martin, 2010). Nursing Assessment Onset of pharyngitis is often quite abrupt. The history may include a fever, sore throat and difficulty swallowing, headache, and abdominal pain. Inquire about recent incidence of viral or strep throat in the family, day care center, or school. Inspect the pharynx and tonsils, which may demonstrate varying degrees of inflammation ( Fig. 18.7 ). Exudate may be present but is not diagnostic of bacterial infection. Note the presence of petechiae on the palate. Inspect the tongue for a strawberry appearance. Palpate for enlargement and tenderness of the anterior cervical nodes. Inspect the skin for a fine, red, sandpaper-like rash (called scarlatiniform), particularly on the trunk or abdomen, a common finding with streptococcus A infection. The nurse may obtain a throat swab for rapid diagnostic testing and throat culture. The rapid strep test is a sensitive and reliable measure, rarely resulting in false-positive readings (Blosser, Brady, & Mueller, 2009). If the rapid strep test is negative, the second swab may be sent for a throat culture. FIGURE 18.7 Note the redness of the pharynx, tonsillar exudate, and white strawberry tongue coating. Atraumatic Care When obtaining two swabs for rapid strep testing and throat culture, swab the applicators simultaneously to decrease perceived trauma to the child. Nursing Management Nursing management of the child with pharyngitis focuses on promoting comfort and providing family education. Promoting ComfortSaline gargles (made with 8 oz of warm water and a half-teaspoon of table salt) are soothing for children old enough to cooperate. Analgesics such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen may ease fever and pain. Sucking on throat lozenges or hard candy may also ease pain. Cool mist humidity helps to keep the mucosa moist in the event of mouth breathing. Encourage the child to ingest popsicles, cool liquids, and ice chips to maintain hydration. Providing Family Education Parents may be accustomed to \"sore throats\" being treated with antibiotics. However, in the case of a viral cause antibiotics will not be necessary and the pharyngitis will resolve in a few days. For the child with streptococcal pharyngitis, urge parents to have the child complete the entire prescribed course of antibiotics. After 24 hours of antibiotic therapy, instruct the parents to discard the child's toothbrush to avoid reinfection. Children may return to day care or school after they have been receiving antibiotics for 24 hours; they are considered noncontagious at that point. Tonsillitis Inflammation of the tonsils often occurs with pharyngitis and, thus, may also be viral or bacterial in nature. Viral infections require only symptomatic treatment. Treatment for bacterial tonsillitis is the same as for bacterial pharyngitis. Occasionally surgical intervention is warranted. Tonsillectomy (surgical removal of the palatine tonsils) may be indicated for the child with recurrent streptococcal tonsillitis or massive tonsillar hypertrophy or for other reasons. When hypertrophied adenoids obstruct breathing, then adenoidectomy (surgical removal of the adenoids) may be indicated. Nursing Assessment Note whether fever is present currently or by history. Inquire about the history of recurrent pharyngitis or tonsillitis. Note if the child's voice sounds muffled or hoarse. Inspect the pharynx for redness and enlargement of the tonsils. As the tonsils enlarge, the child may experience difficulty breathing and swallowing. When tonsils touch at the midline (\"kissing tonsils\" or 4+ in size), the airway may become obstructed. Also, if the adenoids are enlarged, the posterior nares become obstructed. The child may breathe through the mouth and may snore. Palpate the anterior cervical nodes for enlargement and tenderness. Rapid test or culture may be positive for streptococcus A. Nursing Management Tonsillitis that is medically treated requires the same nursing management as pharyngitis. Nursing care for the child after tonsillectomy is described below. Promoting Airway Clearance Until fully awake, place the child in a side-lying or prone position to facilitate safe drainage of secretions. Once alert, the child may prefer to sit up or have the head of the bed elevated. Suctioning, if necessary, should be done carefully to avoid trauma to the surgical site. Dried blood may be present on the teeth and the nares, with old blood present in emesis. Since the presence of blood can be very frightening to parents, alert them to this possibility. Maintaining Fluid Volume Hemorrhage is unusual postoperatively but may occur any time from the immediate postoperative period to as late as 10 days after surgery. Inspect the throat for bleeding. Mucus tinged with blood may be expected, but fresh blood in the secretions indicates bleeding. Early bleeding may be identified by continuous swallowing of small amounts of blood while awake or sleeping. Other signs of hemorrhage include tachycardia, pallor, restlessness, frequent throat clearing, and emesis of bright red blood. To avoid trauma to the surgical site, discourage the child from coughing, clearing the throat, blowing the nose, and using straws. Upon discharge, instruct the parents to immediately report any sign of bleeding to the physician or nurse practitioner. To maintain fluid volume postoperatively, encourage children to take any fluids they desire; popsicles and ice chips are particularly soothing. Citrus juice and brown or red fluids should be avoided: the acid in citrus juice may irritate the throat, and red or brown fluids may be confused with blood if vomiting occurs. Relieving Pain For the first 24 hours after surgery, the throat is very sore. Adequate pain relief is essential to establish adequate oral fluid intake. Anice collar may be prescribed, as well as analgesics with or without narcotics. Counsel parents to maintain pain control upon discharge from the facility, not only for the child's sake, but also to enable the child to continue to drink fluids. Infectious Mononucleosis Infectious mononucleosis is a self-limited illness caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. It is characterized by fever, malaise, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy. Mononucleosis is commonly called the \"kissing disease\" since it is transmitted by oropharyngeal secretions. It can occur at any age but is most often diagnosed in adolescents and young adults (Blosser et al., 2009). Some infected individuals may have concomitant streptococcal pharyngitis. Complications include splenic rupture, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and aseptic meningitis. Nursing Assessment Note any history of exposure to infected individuals. Determine history of fever and onset and progression of sore throat, malaise, and other complaints. Observe for periorbital edema. Inspect the pharynx and tonsils for inflammation and patches of gray exudate. Petechiae may be present on the palate. Palpate for bilateral nontender enlargement of the posterior cervical lymph nodes. After 3 to 5 days of illness, the pharynx may become edematous and the tonsillar exudate more extensive. Lymphadenopathy may progress to include the anterior cervical nodes, which may become tender. Palpate the abdomen for splenomegaly or hepatomegaly. An erythematous maculopapular rash may appear as the illness progresses. Definitive diagnosis may be made by Monospot or Epstein- Barr virus titers. Take Note! The Monospot is usually negative if obtained within the first 7 to 10 days of illness with infectious mononucleosis. Epstein-Barr virus titer is reliable at any point in the illness (Blosser et al., 2009). Nursing Management Nursing management of mononucleosis is primarily symptomatic. The throat may be very sore, so analgesics and salt-water gargles are recommended. Bed rest should be encouraged while the child is febrile. Frequent rest periods may be necessary for several weeks after the onset of illness, as fatigue may persist as long as 6 weeks. During the acute phase, if tonsillar or pharyngeal edema threatens to obstruct the airway, then corticosteroids may be given to decrease the inflammation. In the presence of splenomegaly or hepatomegaly, strenuous activity and contact sports should be avoided. Appearance of rash or jaundice should be reported to the physician or nurse practitioner. Laryngitis Inflammation of the larynx is termed laryngitis. It may occur alone or in conjunction with other respiratory symptoms. It is characterized by a hoarse voice or loss of the voice (so soft as to make it difficult to hear). Oral fluids might offer relief, but resting the voice for 24 hours will allow the inflammation to subside. Laryngitis alone requires no further intervention. Croup Children between 3 months and 3 years of age are the most frequently affected with croup, though croup may affect any child (Cronan, 2009). Croup is also referred to as laryngotracheobronchitis because inflammation and edema of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi occur as a result of viral infection. Parainfluenza is responsible for the majority of cases of croup (Wald, 2010). Other causes include adenovirus, influenza virus A and B, RSV, and rarely measles virus or Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The inflammation and edema obstruct the airway, resulting in symptoms. Mucus production also occurs, further contributing to obstruction of the airway. Narrowing of the subglottic area of the trachea results in audible inspiratory stridor. Edema of the larynx causes hoarseness. Inflammation in the larynx and trachea causes the characteristic barking cough of croup. Symptoms occur most often at night, presenting suddenly, with resolution of symptoms in the morning. Croup is usually self-limited, lasting only about 3 to 5 days. Complications of croup are rare but may include worsening respiratory distress, hypoxia, or bacterial superinfection (as in the case of bacterial tracheitis). Croup is usually managed on an outpatient basis, with affected children rarely requiring hospitalization. Corticosteroids (usually a single dose) are used to decrease inflammation, and racemic epinephrine aerosols demonstrate the a -adrenergic effect of mucosalvasoconstriction, helping to decrease edema. Children with croup may be hospitalized if they have significant stridor at rest or severe retractions after a several-hour period of observation. Comparison Chart 18.2 compares croup to epiglottitis. COMPARISON CHART 18.2 CROUP VS. EPIGLOTTITIS Nursing Assessment Note the age of the child; children between 3 months and 3 years of age are most likely to present with viral croup (laryngotracheobronchitis). History may reveal a cough that developed during the night (most common presentation) and that sounds like barking (or a seal). Inspect for the presence of mild URI symptoms. Temperature may be normal or elevated mildly. Listen for inspiratory stridor and observe for suprasternal retractions. Auscultate the lungs for adequacy of breath sounds. Croup is usually diagnosed based on history and clinical presentation, but a lateral neck radiograph may be obtained to rule out epiglottitis. Take Note! The child with fever, a toxic appearance, and increasing respiratory distress despite appropriate croup treatment may have bacterial tracheitis. Notify the physician or nurse practitioner of these findings in a child with croup (Rajan, Emery, & Sood, 2010). Nursing Management If the child's care is being managed at home, advise parents about the symptoms of respiratory distress and instruct them to seek treatment if the child's respiratory condition worsens. Teach parents to expose their child to humidified air (via a cool mist humidifier or steamy bathroom). Though never clinically proven, use of humidified air has long been recommended for alleviating coughing jags and anecdotally has been reported as helpful. Administer dexamethasone if ordered or teach parents about home administration. Explain to parents that the effects of racemic epinephrine last about 2 hours and the child must be observed closely as occasionally a child will worsen again, requiring another aerosol. Teaching Guidelines 18.2 provides information about home care of croup. Teaching Guidelines 18.2 HOME CARE OF CROUP Keep the child quiet and discourage crying. Allow the child to sit up (in your arms). Encourage rest and fluid intake. If stridor occurs, take the child into a steamy bathroom for 10 minutes. Administer medication (corticosteroid) as directed. Watch the child closely. Call the physician if: The child breathes faster, has retractions, or has any other difficulty breathing The nostrils flare or the lips or nails have a bluish tint The cough or stridor does not improve with exposure to moist air Restlessness increases or the child is confused The child begins to drool or cannot swallow Adapted from Cronan, K. C. (2009). About croup. Retrieved April 17, 2011, from http://kidshealth.org/parent/infections/lung/croup.htmlEpiglottitis Epiglottitis (inflammation and swelling of the epiglottis) is most often caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b. Extensive use of the Hib vaccine since the 1980s has resulted in a significant decrease in the incidence of epiglottitis (Brady, 2009). Though now rare, epiglottitis most often occurs in children between the ages of 2 and 7 years and can be life-threatening (Brady, 2009). Respiratory arrest and death may occur if the airway becomes completely occluded. Additional complications include pneumothorax and pulmonary edema. Therapeutic management focuses on airway maintenance and support. Intravenous antibiotic therapy is necessary. The child will be managed in the intensive care unit. See Comparison Chart 18.2 for information comparing croup to epiglottitis. Nursing Assessment Carefully assess the child with suspected epiglottitis. Note sudden onset of symptoms and high fever. The child has an overall toxic appearance. He or she may refuse to speak or may speak only with a very soft voice. The child may refuse to lie down and may assume the characteristic position: sitting forward with the neck extended. Drooling may be present. Note anxiety or a frightened appearance. Note the child's color. Cough is usually absent. A lateral neck radiograph may be performed to determine whether epiglottitis is present. This is done cautiously, so as not to induce airway obstruction with changes in position of the child's neck. Take Note! Do not under any circumstance attempt to visualize the throat: reflex laryngospasm may occur, precipitating immediate airway occlusion (Brady, 2009). Nursing Management Do not leave the child unattended. Keep the child and parents as calm as possible. Allow the child to assume a position of comfort. Do not place the child in a supine position, as airway occlusion may occur. Provide 100% oxygen in the least invasive manner that is acceptable to the child. If the child with epiglottitis experiences complete airway occlusion, an emergency tracheostomy may be necessary. Ensure that emergency equipment is available and that personnel trained in intubation of the pediatric occluded airway and percutaneous tracheostomy are notified of the child's presence in the facility. Take Note! Epiglottitis is characterized by dysphagia, drooling, anxiety, irritability, and significant respiratory distress. Prepare for the event of sudden airway occlusion. Bronchiolitis (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) Bronchiolitis is an acute inflammatory process of the bronchioles and small bronchi. Nearly always caused by a viral pathogen, RSV accounts for the majority of cases of bronchiolitis, with adenovirus, parainfluenza, and human meta-pneumovirus also being important causative agents. This discussion will focus on RSV bronchiolitis. The peak incidence of bronchiolitis is in the winter and spring, coinciding with RSV season. RSV season in the United States and Canada generally begins in September or October and continues through April or May. Virtually all children will contract RSV infection within the first few years of life. RSV bronchiolitis occurs most often in infants and toddlers, with a peak incidence around 6 months of age (Goodman, 2011). The severity of disease is related inversely to the age of the child. The frequency and severity of RSV infection decrease with age. Repeated RSV infections occur throughout life but are usually localized to the upper respiratory tract after toddlerhood. Pathophysiology RSV is a highly contagious virus and may be contracted through direct contact with respiratory secretions or from particles on objects contaminated with the virus. RSV invades the nasopharynx, where it replicates and then spreads down to the lower airway via aspiration of upper airway secretions. RSV infection causes necrosis of the respiratory epithelium of the small airways, peribronchiolar mononuclear infiltration, and plugging of the lumens with mucus and exudate. The small airways become variably obstructed; this allows adequate inspiratory volume but prevents full expiration. This leads to hyperinflation and atelectasis. Serious alterations in gas exchange occur, with arterial hypoxemia and carbon dioxide retention resulting from mismatching of pulmonary ventilation (gas exchange within the lungs) and perfusion. Hypoventilation occurs secondary to markedly increased work of breathing.Therapeutic Management Management of RSV focuses on supportive treatment. Supplemental oxygen, nasal and/or nasopharyngeal suctioning, oral or intravenous hydration, and inhaled bronchodilator therapy are used. Many infants are managed at home with close observation and adequate hydration. Hospitalization is required for children with more severe disease. The infant with tachypnea, significant retractions, poor oral intake, or lethargy can deteriorate quickly, to the point of requiring ventilatory support, and thus warrants hospital admission. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 592 . Assessment findings pertinent to RSV bronchiolitis are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Onset of illness with a clear runny nose (sometimes profuse) Pharyngitis Low-grade fever Development of cough 1 to 3 days into the illness, followed by a wheeze shortly thereafter Poor feeding Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as: Young age (younger than 2 years old), more severe disease in a child younger than 6 months old Prematurity Multiple births Birth during April to September History of chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary disease) Cyanotic or complicated congenital heart disease Immunocompromise Male gender Exposure to passive tobacco smoke Crowded living conditions Day care attendance School-age siblings Low socioeconomic status Lack of breastfeeding Physical Examination Examination of the child with RSV involves inspection, observation, and auscultation. INSPECTION AND OBSERVATION Observe the child's general appearance and color (centrally and peripherally). The infant with RSV bronchiolitis might appear air- hungry, exhibiting various degrees of cyanosis and respiratory distress, including tachypnea, retractions, accessory muscle use, grunting, and periods of apnea. Cough and audible wheeze might be heard. The infant might appear listless and uninterested in feeding, surroundings, or parents. AUSCULTATION Auscultate the lungs, noting adventitious sounds and determining the quality of aeration of the lung fields. Earlier in the illness, wheezes might be heard scattered throughout the lung fields. In more serious cases, the chest might sound quiet and without wheeze. This is due to significant hyperexpansion with very poor air exchange. Laboratory and Diagnostic TestsCommon laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of RSV bronchiolitis include: Pulse oximetry: oxygen saturation might be decreased significantly Chest radiograph: might reveal hyperinflation and patchy areas of atelectasis or infiltration Blood gases: might show carbon dioxide retention and hypoxemia Nasal-pharyngeal washings: positive identification of RSV can be made via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) testing Nursing Management RSV infection is usually self-limited, and nursing diagnoses, goals, and interventions for the child with bronchiolitis are aimed at supportive care. Children with less severe disease might require only antipyretics, adequate hydration, and close observation. They can often be successfully managed at home, provided the primary caregiver is reliable and comfortable with close observation. Teach parents or caregivers to watch for signs of worsening and to seek care quickly should the child's condition deteriorate. Hospitalization is required for children with more severe disease, and children admitted with RSV bronchiolitis warrant close observation. In addition to the nursing diagnoses and related interventions discussed in Nursing Care Plan 18.1 for respiratory disorders, interventions common to bronchiolitis follow. Take Note! Currently no safe and effective antiviral drug is available for definitive treatment of RSV Aerosolized ribavirin is recommended only for the highest-risk, most severely ill children. Routine antibiotic use is discouraged in RSV bronchiolitis treatment because the secondary bacterial infection rate of the lower airway is very low (Checchia, 2011). Maintaining Patent Airway Infants and young children with RSV tend to have copious secretions. Position the child with the head of the bed elevated to facilitate an open airway. These children often require frequent assessment and suctioning to maintain a patent airway. Use a Yankauer or tonsil-tip suction catheter to suction the mouth or pharynx of older infants or children, rinsing the catheter after each suctioning. Nasal bulb suctioning may be sufficient to clear the airway in some infants, while others will require nasopharyngeal suctioning with a suction catheter. Nursing Procedure 18.1 gives further information. Adjust the pressure ranges for suctioning infants and children between 60 and 100 mm Hg (40 and 60 mm Hg for premature infants). NURSING PROCEDURE 18.1 Nasopharyngeal or Artificial Airway Suction Technique 1. Make sure the suction equipment works properly before starting. 2. After washing your hands, assemble the equipment needed: Appropriate-size sterile suction catheter Sterile gloves Supplemental oxygen Sterile water-based lubricant Sterile normal saline if indicated 3. Don sterile gloves, keeping dominant hand sterile and nondominant hand clean. 4. Preoxygenate the infant or child if indicated. 5. Apply lubricant to the end of the suction catheter. 6. If indicated for loosening of secretions, instill sterile saline. 7. Maintaining sterile technique, insert the suction catheter into the child's nostril or airway. Insert only to the point of gagging if inserting via the nostril. Insert only 0.5 cm further than the length of the artificial airway. 8. Intermittently apply suction for no longer than 10 seconds while twisting and removing the catheter. 9. Supplement with oxygen after suctioning. Promoting Adequate Gas Exchange Infants and children with RSV bronchiolitis might deteriorate quickly as the disease progresses. In the child ill enough to require oxygen, the risk is even greater. Assessment should include work of breathing, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The percentage of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) should be adjusted as needed to maintain oxygen saturation within the desired range. Positioning the infant with the head of the bed elevated may also improve gas exchange. Frequent assessment is necessary for the hospitalized child with bronchiolitis. Take Note! In the tachypneic infant, slowing of the respiratory rate does not necessarily indicate improvement: often, a slower respiratory rate is an indication of tiring, and carbon dioxide retention may soon be followed by apnea (AHA, 2007). Reducing Risk for Infection Since RSV is easily spread through contact with droplets, isolate inpatients according to hospital policy to decrease the risk of nosocomial spread to other children. Children with RSV can be safely cohorted. Attention to hand washing is necessary, as droplets might enter the eyes, nose, or mouth via the hands. Providing Family Education Educate parents so they can recognize signs of worsening distress. Tell parents to call the physician or nurse practitioner if the child's breathing becomes rapid or more difficult or if the child cannot eat secondary to tachypnea. Children who are younger than 1 year of age or who are at higher risk (those who were born prematurely or who have chronic heart or lung conditions) might have a longer course of illness. Instruct parents that cough can persist for several days to weeks after resolution of the disease, but infants usually act well otherwise. Preventing Respiratory Syncytial Virus Disease Strict adherence to hand washing policies in day care centers and when exposed to individuals with cold symptoms is important for all age groups. Though generally benign in healthy older children, RSV can be devastating in young infants or children with preexisting risk factors. Palivizumab (Synagis) is a monoclonal antibody that can prevent severe RSV disease in those who are most susceptible (Checchia, 2011). It is given as an intramuscular injection once a month throughout the RSV season. Though quite costly, it is covered by most insurance policies and Medicaid for those who qualify. It is generally indicated for use in certain qualifying children younger than 2 years of age. Qualifying factors include: Prematurity Chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) requiring medication or oxygen Certain congenital heart diseases Immunocompromise (Checchia, 2010) Links to additional information related to Synagis are located on . Pneumonia Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lung parenchyma. It can be caused by a virus, bacteria, Mycoplasma, or a fungus. Respiratory viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in younger children and the least common cause in older children. Viral pneumonia is usually better tolerated in children of all ages. Children with bacterial pneumonia are more apt to present with a toxic appearance, but they generally recover rapidly if appropriate antibiotic treatment is instituted early. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of bacterial pneumonia in all ages of children, and M. pneumoniae is a common causative agent in the school-age child and adolescent. Fungal infection may also result in pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia may result from aspiration of foreign material into the lower respiratory tract. Pneumonia occurs more often in winter and early spring. It is common in children but is seen most frequently in infants and young toddlers. Take Note! Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) refers to pneumonia in a previously healthy person that is contracted outside of the hospital setting. CAP is a common causeof lower respiratory infection in North America (Don, Canciani, & Korppi, 2010). Pneumonia is usually a self-limited disease. A child who presents with recurrent pneumonia should be evaluated for chronic lung disease such as asthma or cystic fibrosis. Potential complications of pneumonia include lung abscess, and pneumothorax. Excluding bacteremia, these complications are often treated with thoracentesis and/or chest tubes as well as antibiotics if appropriate. Pneumatoceles (thin-walled cavities developing in the lung) might occur with certain bacterial pneumonias and usually resolve spontaneously over time. Therapeutic management of children with less severe disease includes antipyretics, adequate hydration, and close observation. Even bacterial pneumonia can be successfully managed at home if the work of breathing is not severe and oxygen saturation is within normal limits. However, hospitalization is required for children with more severe disease. The child with tachypnea, significant retractions, poor oral intake, or lethargy might require hospital admission for the administration of supplemental oxygen, intravenous hydration, and antibiotics. See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 592 . Assessment findings pertinent to pneumonia are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Note onset and progression of symptoms. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history include: Antecedent viral URI Fever Cough (note type and whether productive or not) Increased respiratory rate History of lethargy, poor feeding, vomiting, or diarrhea in infants Chills, headache, dyspnea, chest pain, abdominal pain, and nausea or vomiting in older children Explore the child's past and current medical history for risk factors known to be associated with an increase in the severity of pneumonia, such as: Prematurity Malnutrition Passive smoke exposure Low socioeconomic status Day care attendance Underlying cardiopulmonary, immune, or nervous system disease (Brady, 2009) Physical Examination Physical examination consists of inspection, auscultation, percussion, and palpation.INSPECTION Observe the child's general appearance and color (centrally and peripherally). Cyanosis might accompany coughing spells. The child with bacterial pneumonia may appear ill. Assess work of breathing. Children with pneumonia might exhibit substernal, subcostal, or intercostal retractions. Tachypnea and nasal flaring may be present. Describe cough and quality of sputum if produced. AUSCULTATION Auscultation of the lungs might reveal wheezes or rales in the younger child. Local or diffuse rales may be present in the older child. Document diminished breath sounds. PERCUSSION AND PALPATION In the older child, percussion might yield local dullness over a consolidated area. Percussion is much less valuable in the infant or younger child. Tactile fremitus felt upon palpation may be increased with pneumonia. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of pneumonia include: Pulse oximetry: oxygen saturation might be decreased significantly or within normal range Chest radiograph: varies according to child age and causative agent. In infants and young children, bilateral air trapping and perihilar infiltrates (collection of inflammatory cells, cellular debris, and foreign organisms) are the most common findings. Patchy areas of consolidation might also be present. In older children, lobar consolidation is seen more frequently Sputum culture: may be useful in determining causative bacteria in older children and adolescents White blood cell count: might be elevated in the case of bacterial pneumonia Nursing Management Nursing diagnoses, goals, and interventions for the child with pneumonia are primarily aimed at providing supportive care and education about the illness and its treatment. Prevention of pneumococcal infection is also important. Children with more severe disease will require hospitalization. Refer to Nursing Care Plan 18.1 for nursing diagnoses and related interventions. In addition to the interventions listed there, the following should be noted. Providing Supportive Care Ensure adequate hydration and assist in thinning of secretions by encouraging oral fluid intake in the child whose respiratory status is stable. In children with increased work of breathing, intravenous fluids may be necessary to maintain hydration. Allow and encourage the child to assume a position of comfort, usually with the head of the bed elevated to promote aeration of the lungs. If pain due to coughing or pneumonia itself is severe, administer analgesics as prescribed. Provide supplemental oxygen to the child with respiratory distress or hypoxia as needed. Providing Family Education Educate the family about the importance of adhering to the prescribed antibiotic regimen. Antibiotics may be given intravenously if the child is hospitalized. Oral antibiotics are used upon discharge or if the child is managed on an outpatient basis. Teach the parents of a child with bacterial pneumonia to expect that following resolution of the acute illness. For 1 to 2 weeks the child might continue to tire easily and the infant might continue to need small, frequent feedings. Cough may also persist after the acute recovery period but should lessen over time. If the child is diagnosed with viral pneumonia, parents might not understand that their child does not require an antibiotic. Pneumonia is often perceived by the public as a bacterial infection, so most parents will need an explanation related to treatment of viral infections. As with bacterial pneumonia, the child may experience a week or two of weakness or fatigue following resolution of the acute illness. The young child is at risk for the development of aspiration pneumonia. Parents need to understand that the child might be at risk for injury related to his or her age and developmental stage. To prevent recurrent or further aspiration, teach the parents the safety measures in Teaching Guidelines 18.3 . Teaching Guidelines 18.3 PREVENTING ASPIRATION Keep toxic substances such as lighter fluid, solvents, and hydrocarbons out of reach of young children. Toddlers and preschoolers cannot distinguish safe from unsafe fluids due to their developmental stage. Avoid oily nose drops and oil-based vitamins or home remedies to avoid lipid aspiration into the lungs. Avoid oral feedings if the infant's respiratory rate is 60 or greater to minimize the risk of aspiration of the feeding. Discourage parents from \"force-feeding\" in the event of poor oral intake or severe illness to minimize the risk of aspiration of the feeding. Position infants and ill children on their right side after feeding to minimize the risk of aspirating emesis or regurgitated feeding. Preventing Pneumococcal Infection Children at high risk for severe pneumococcal infection should be immunized against it. This includes all children between 0 and 23 months of age, as well as children between 24 and 59 months of age who either never received the vaccine before age 2 or did not receive a booster dose between 12 and 23 months of age. Additionally, children between 24 and 59 months of age with certain conditions such as immune deficiency, sickle cell disease, asplenia, chronic cardiac conditions, chronic lung problems, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and organ transplants should receive the vaccine (CDC, 2011). For additional information on immunization, refer to Chapter 9 . Bronchitis Bronchitis is an inflammation of the trachea and major bronchi. It is often associated with a URI. Bronchitis is usually viral in nature, though M. pneumoniae and other bacterial organisms are causative in about 10% of cases (Carolan, 2011). Recovery usually occurs within 5 to 10 days. Therapeutic management involves mainly supportive care. Expectorant administration and adequate hydration are important. If bacterial infection is the cause, antibiotics are indicated. Nursing Assessment The illness might begin with a mild URI. Fever develops, followed by a dry, hacking cough that might become productive in older children. The cough might wake the child at night. Auscultation of the lungs might reveal coarse rales. Respirations remain unlabored. The chest radiograph might show diffuse alveolar hyperinflation and perihilar markings. Nursing Management Nursing management is aimed at providing supportive care. Teach parents that expectorants will help loosen secretions and antipyretics will help reduce the fever, making the child more comfortable. Encourage adequate hydration. Antibiotics are prescribed only in cases believed to be bacterial in nature. Discourage the use of cough suppressants: it is important for accumulated sputum to be raised. Tuberculosis Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly contagious disease caused by inhalation of droplets of Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Mycobacterium bovis. Children usually contract the disease from an immediate household member. Homeless and impoverished children are at higher risk, as are those exposed to an adult with TB infection (Federico, 2011). After exposure to an infected individual, the incubation period is 2 to 10 weeks. The inhaled tubercle bacilli multiply in the alveoli and alveolar ducts, forming an inflammatory exudate. The bacilli are spread by the bloodstream and lymphatic system to various parts of the body. Though pulmonary tuberculosis is the most common, children may also have infection in other parts of the body, such as the gastrointestinal tract or central nervous system. In the case of drug-sensitive tuberculosis, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a 6-month course of oral therapy. The first 2 months consist of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide given daily. This is followed by twice-weekly isoniazid and rifampin; administration must be observed directly (usually by a public health nurse). In the case of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, ethambutol or streptomycin is given via intramuscular injection (Pickering, 2009). See Healthy People 2020.HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Nursing Assessment Routine screening for tuberculosis infection is not recommended for low-risk individuals, but children considered to be at high risk for contracting tuberculosis should be screened using the Mantoux test. Children considered to be at high risk are those who: Are infected with HIV Are incarcerated or institutionalized Have a positive recent history of latent tuberculosis infection Are immigrants from or have a history of travel to endemic countries Are exposed at home to HIV-infected or homeless persons, illicit drug users, persons recently incarcerated, migrant farm workers, or nursing home residents (Federico, 2011) The presentation of tuberculosis in children is quite varied. Children can be asymptomatic or exhibit a broad range of symptoms. Symptoms may include fever, malaise, weight loss, anorexia, pain and tightness in the chest, and rarely hemoptysis. Cough may or may not be present and usually progresses slowly over several weeks to months. As tuberculosis progresses, the respiratory rate increases and the lung on the affected side is poorly expanded. Dullness to percussion might be present, as well as diminished breath sounds and crackles. Fever persists and pallor, anemia, weakness, and weight loss are present. Diagnosis is confirmed with a positive Mantoux test, positive gastric washings for acid-fast bacillus, and/or a chest radiograph consistent with tuberculosis. Nursing Management Hospitalization of children with tuberculosis is necessary only for the most serious cases. Nursing management is aimed at providing supportive care and encouraging adherence to the treatment regimen. Most nursing care for childhood tuberculosis is provided in outpatient clinics, schools, or a public health setting. Supportive care includes ensuring adequate nutrition and adequate rest, providing comfort measures such as fever reduction, preventing exposure to other infectious diseases, and preventing reinfection. Providing Care for the Child With Latent Tuberculosis Infection Children who test positive for tuberculosis but who do not have symptoms or radiographic/laboratory evidence of disease areconsidered to have latent infection. These children should be treated with isoniazid for 9 months to prevent progression to active disease. Follow-up and appropriate monitoring can be achieved via the child's physician or nurse practitioner or local health department. Preventing Infection Tuberculosis infection is prevented by avoiding contact with the tubercle bacillus. Thus, hospitalized children with tuberculosis must be isolated according to hospital policy to prevent nosocomial spread of tuberculosis infection. Promotion of natural resistance through nutrition, rest, and avoidance of serious infections does not prevent infection. Pasteurization of milk has helped to decrease the transmission of M. bovis. Administration of bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine can provide incomplete protection against tuberculosis, and it is not widely used in the United States (Pickering, 2009).ACUTE NONINFECTIOUS DISORDERS Acute noninfectious disorders include epistaxis, foreign body aspiration, respiratory distress syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pneumothorax. Epistaxis Epistaxis (a nosebleed) occurs most frequently in children before adolescence. Bleeding of the nasal mucosa occurs most often from the anterior portion of the septum. Epistaxis may be recurrent and idiopathic (meaning there is no cause). The majority of cases are benign, but in children with bleeding disorders or other hematologic concerns, epistaxis should be further investigated and treated. Take Note! The child with recurrent epistaxis or epistaxis that is difficult to control should be further evaluated for underlying bleeding or platelet concerns. Nursing Assessment Explore the child's history for initiating factors such as local inflammation, mucosal drying, or local trauma (usually nose picking). Inspect the nasal cavity for blood. Nursing Management The presence of blood often frightens children and their parents. The nurse and parents should remain calm. The child should sit up and lean forward (lying down may allow aspiration of the blood). Apply continuous pressure to the anterior portion of the nose by pinching it closed. Encourage the child to breathe through the mouth during this portion of the treatment. Ice or a cold cloth applied to the bridge of the nose may also be helpful. The bleeding usually stops within 10 to 15 minutes. Apply petroleum jelly or water-soluble gel to the nasal mucosa with a cotton-tipped applicator to moisten the mucosa and prevent recurrence. Foreign Body Aspiration Foreign body aspiration occurs when any solid or liquid substance is inhaled into the respiratory tract. It is common in infants and young children and can present in a life-threatening manner. The object may lodge in the upper or lower airway, causing varying degrees of respiratory difficulty. Small, smooth objects such as peanuts are the most frequently aspirated, but any small toy, article, or piece of food smaller than the diameter of the young child's airway can be aspirated. Take Note! Items smaller than 1.25 inches (3.2 cm) can be aspirated easily. A simple way for parents to estimate the safe size of a small item or toy piece is to gauge its size against a standard toilet paper roll, which is generally about 1.5 inches in diameter (Safe Kids, 2009). Foreign body aspiration occurs most frequently in children between 6 months and 4 years of age (Federico, 2011). Children this age are growing and developing rapidly. They tend to explore things with their mouths and can easily aspirate small items. The child often coughs out foreign bodies from the upper airway. If the foreign body reaches the bronchus, then it may need to be surgically removed via bronchoscopy. Postoperative antibiotics are used if an infection is also present. Complications of foreign body aspiration include pneumonia or abscess formation, hypoxia, respiratory failure, and death. Nursing Assessment The infant or young child might present with a history of sudden onset of cough, wheeze, or stridor. Stridor suggests that the foreign body is lodged in the upper airway. Sometimes the onset of respiratory symptoms is much more gradual. When the item has traveled down one of the bronchi, then wheezing, rhonchi, and decreased aeration can be heard on the affected side. A chest radiograph will demonstrate the foreign body only if it is radiopaque ( Fig. 18.8 ). Nursing Management The most important nursing intervention related to foreign body aspiration is prevention. Anticipatory guidance for families with 6- month-olds should include a discussion of aspiration avoidance. Repeat this information at each subsequent well-child visit through age5. Tell parents to avoid letting their child play with toys with small parts and to keep coins and other small objects out of the reach of children. Teach parents not to feed peanuts and popcorn to their child until he or she is at least 3 years old (Federico, 2011). When children progress to table food, teach parents to chop all foods so that they are small enough to pass down the trachea should the child neglect to chew them up thoroughly. Carrots, grapes, and hot dogs should be cut into small pieces. Harmful liquids should be kept out of the reach of children. FIGURE 18.8 Foreign body is noted in the bronchus on a chest radiograph. Take Note! Prevent young children from playing with latex balloons. When popped, small pieces pose an aspiration danger (Cronan, 2010). Respiratory Distress Syndrome Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a respiratory disorder that is specific to neonates. It results from lung immaturity and a deficiency in surfactant, so it is seen most often in premature infants. Other infants who might experience RDS include infants of diabetic mothers, those delivered via cesarean section without preceding labor, and those experiencing perinatal asphyxia (Thilo & Rosenberg, 2011). It is believed that each of these conditions has an impact on surfactant production, thus resulting in RDS in the term infant. Pathophysiology The lack of surfactant in the affected newborn's lungs results in stiff, poorly compliant lungs with poor gas exchange. Right-to-left shunting and hypoxemia result. As the disease progresses, fluid and fibrin leak from the pulmonary capillaries, causing a hyaline membrane to form in the bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli. Presence of the membrane further decreases gas exchange. Complications of RDS include air leak syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, patent ductus arteriosus enterocolitis, complications resulting from intravenous catheter use (infection, thrombus formation), and developmental delay or disability. Therapeutic ManagementThe administration of surfactant via an endotracheal tube shortly after delivery helps to decrease the incidence and severity of RDS. Therapeutic management of RDS focuses on intensive respiratory care, usually with mechanical ventilation. Newer techniques for ventilatory support are also available ( Table 18.2 ). Nursing Assessment The onset of RDS is usually within several hours of birth. The newborn exhibits signs of respiratory distress, including tachypnea, retractions, nasal flaring, grunting, and varying degrees of cyanosis. Auscultation reveals fine rales and diminished breath sounds. If untreated, RDS progresses to seesaw respirations, respiratory failure, and shock. Nursing Management Rarely, mucus plugging can occur in the neonate placed on a ventilator after surfactant administration. Therefore, close observation and assessment for adequate lung expansion are critical. In addition to expert respiratory intervention, other crucial nursing goals include maintenance of normothermia, prevention of infection, maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance, and promotion of adequate nutrition (parenterally or via gavage feeding). Nursing care of the infant with RDS generally occurs in the intensive care unit. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs following a primary insult such as sepsis, viral pneumonia, smoke inhalation, or near drowning. Respiratory distress and hypoxemia occur acutely within 72 hours of the insult in infants and children with previously healthy lungs (Thilo & Rosenberg, 2011). The alveolar-capillary membrane becomes more permeable and pulmonary edema develops. Hyaline membrane formation over the alveolar surfaces and decreased surfactant production cause lung stiffness. Mucosal swelling and cellular debris lead to atelectasis. Gas diffusion is impaired significantly. Some children have residual lung disease and some recover completely. However, ARDS can progress to respiratory failure and death. Therapeutic management is aimed at improving oxygenation and ventilation. Mechanical ventilation is used, with special attention to lung volumes and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Newer treatment modalities show promise for improving outcomes of ARDS. Nursing Assessment Tachycardia and tachypnea occur over the first few hours of the illness. Significantly increased work of breathing with nasal flaring and retractions develops. Auscultate the breath sounds, which might range from normal to high-pitched crackles throughout the lung fields. Hypoxemia develops. Bilateral infiltrates can be seen on a chest radiograph. Nursing Management Nursing care of the child with ARDS is mainly supportive and occurs in the intensive care unit. Closely monitor respiratory and cardiovascular status. Comfort measures such as hygiene and positioning as well as pain and anxiety management, maintenance ofnutrition, and prevention of infection are also key nursing interventions. (See Evidence-Based Practice 18-1 .) The acute phase of worsening respiratory distress can be frightening for a child of any age, and the nurse can be instrumental in soothing the child's fears. As the disease worsens and progresses, especially when ventilatory support is required, it is especially important to provide psychological support of the family as well as education about the intensive care unit procedures. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 18.1 VARIOUS BODY POSITIONS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON HOSPITALIZED INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN WITH ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS STUDY Prone positioning has been found to improve ventilation in some adults with acute respiratory distress and in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome, but due to the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), infants are generally positioned supine. The authors reviewed 21 studies that evaluated the effect of positioning (supine, prone, lateral, elevated, and flat positions) on respiratory function (oxygen saturation, partial pressure of arterial oxygen, oxygenation index, thoracoabdominal synchrony, and episodes of oxygen desaturation) in infants and young children with acute respiratory distress. Findings The only position found to produce a statistically significant improvement in respiratory function was the prone position. The prone position was better in terms of improving ventilation and oxygenation. The other positions did not demonstrate statistically significant differences. Nursing Implications Nurses should critically consider the result of this review. Certainly, if an alternate position is used, the infant must be closely monitored and the position changed should any level of deterioration occur. If hospitalized infants with acute respiratory distress are placed in the prone position, continuous cardiopulmonary and oxygenation saturation monitoring must be provided because of the risk of SIDS in this age group. Do not encourage families to use the prone position at home when an infant is ill with a respiratory condition. Adapted from Wells, D. A., Gillies, D., & Fitzgerald, D. A. (2007). Positioning for acute respiratory distress in hospitalised infants and children. The Cochrane Library 2007, 4. Indianapolis: John Wiley & Sons. Pneumothorax A collection of air in the pleural space is called a pneumothorax. It can occur spontaneously in an otherwise healthy child or as a result of chronic lung disease, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, surgery, or trauma. Trapped air consumes space within the pleural cavity, and the affected lung suffers at least partial collapse. Needle aspiration and/or placement of a chest tube are used to evacuate the air from the chest. Some small pneumothoraces resolve independently, without intervention. Nursing Assessment Primary pneumothorax (spontaneous) occurs most often in adolescence (Gluckman & Forti, 2011). The infant or child with a pneumothorax might have a sudden or gradual onset of symptoms. Chest pain might be present as well as signs of respiratory distress such as tachypnea, retractions, nasal flaring, or grunting. Assess risk factors for acquiring a pneumothorax, including chest trauma or surgery, intubation and mechanical ventilation, or a history of chronic lung disease such as cystic fibrosis. Inspect the child for a pale or cyanotic appearance. Auscultate for increased heart rate (tachycardia) and absent or diminished breath sounds on the affected side. The radiograph reveals air within the thoracic cavity ( Fig. 18.9 ). Nursing Management The child with a pneumothorax requires frequent respiratory assessments. Pulse oximetry might be used as an adjunct, but clinical evaluation of respiratory status is most useful. In some cases, administration of 100% oxygen hastens the reabsorption of air, but it is generally used only for a few hours (Gluckman & Forti, 2011). If a chest tube is connected to a dry suction or water seal apparatus, provide care of the drainage apparatus as appropriate ( Fig. 18.10 ). A pair of hemostats should be kept at the bedside to clamp thetube should it become dislodged from the drainage container. The dressing around the chest tube is occlusive and is not routinely changed. If the tube becomes dislodged from the child's chest, apply Vaseline gauze and an occlusive dressing, immediately perform appropriate respiratory assessment, and notify the physician or nurse practitioner. FIGURE 18.9 (A) Pneumothorax. (B) Note reinflation of the lung when the chest tube is present.CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISORDERS Chronic respiratory disorders include allergic rhinitis, asthma, chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia), cystic fibrosis, and apnea. Allergic Rhinitis Allergic rhinitis is a common chronic condition in childhood, affecting a significant number of children. Allergic rhinitis is associated with atopic dermatitis and asthma. Perennial allergic rhinitis occurs year-round and is associated with indoor environments. Allergens commonly implicated in perennial allergic rhinitis include dust mites, pet dander, cockroach antigens, and molds. Seasonal allergic rhinitis is caused by elevations in outdoor levels of allergens. It is typically caused by certain pollens, trees, weeds, fungi, and molds. Complications from allergic rhinitis include exacerbation of asthma symptoms, recurrent sinusitis and otitis media, and dental malocclusion. FIGURE 18.10 The chest tube is connected to a suction or water seal via a drainage container. Pathophysiology Allergic rhinitis is an intermittent or persistent inflammatory state that is mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE). In response to contact with an airborne allergen protein, the nasal mucosa mounts an immune response. The antigen (from the allergen) binds to a specific IgE on the surface of mast cells, releasing the chemical mediators of histamine and leukotrienes. The release of mediators results in acute tissue edema and mucus production. Late-phase mediators are released and more inflammation results. IgE binds to receptors on the surfaces of mast cells and basophils, creating the sensitization memory that causes the reaction with subsequent allergen exposures. Allergen exposure then results in mast cell degranulation and release of histamine and other chemotactic factors. Histamine and other factors cause nasal vasodilation, watery rhinorrhea (runny nose), and nasal congestion. Irritation of local nerve endings by histamine produces pruritus and sneezing. Treatment of allergic rhinitis is aimed at decreasing response to these allergic mediators as well as treating inflammation. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 592 . Assessment findings pertinent to allergic rhinitis are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Mild, intermittent to chronic nasal stuffiness Thin, runny nasal discharge Sneezing Itching of nose, eyes, palate Mouth breathing and snoring Determine the seasonality of symptoms. Are they perennial (year-round) or do they occur during certain seasons only? What types of medications or other treatments have been used, and what was the child's response? Explore the history for the presence of risk factors such as: Family history of atopic disease (asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis) Known allergy to dust mites, pet dander, cockroach antigens, pollens, or molds Early childhood exposure to indoor allergens Early introduction to foods or formula in infancy Exposure to tobacco smoke Environmental air pollution Recurrent viral infections (Sheikh & Najib, 2011) Nonwhite race and higher socioeconomic status have also been noted as risk factors. Physical Examination Physical examination of the child with allergic rhinitis includes inspection, observation, and auscultation. INSPECTION AND OBSERVATION Observe the child's facies for red-rimmed eyes or tearing, mild eyelid edema, \"allergic shiners\" (bluish or grayish \"allergic salute\" (a transverse nasal crease between the lower and middle thirds of the nose that results from repeated nose rubbing) ( Fig. 18.11 ). Inspect the nasal cavity. The turbinates may be swollen and gray/blue. Clear mucoid nasal drainage may be observed. Inspect the skin for rash. Listen for nasal phonation with speech. AUSCULTATION Auscultate the lungs for adequate aeration and clarity of breath sounds. In the child who also has asthma, exacerbation with wheezing often occurs with allergic rhinitis. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests The initial diagnosis is often made based on the history and clinical findings. Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of allergic rhinitis may include:FIGURE 18.11 Allergic shiners beneath the eyes and allergic salute across the nose. Nasal smear (positive for eosinophilia) Positive allergy skin test Positive radioallergosorbent test (RAST) To distinguish between the causes of nasal congestion, refer to Comparison Chart 18.1 . Nursing Management In addition to the nursing diagnoses and related interventions discussed in Nursing Care Plan 18.1 for disorders of the nose, mouth, and throat, interventions common to allergic rhinitis follow. Maintaining Patent Airway The constant nasal obstruction that occurs with allergic rhinitis can be very problematic for some children. Performing nasal washes with normal saline may keep the nasal mucus from becoming thickened. Thickened, immobile secretions often lead to a secondary bacterial infection. The nasal wash also decongests the nose, allowing for improved nasal airflow. Anti-inflammatory (corticosteroid) nasal sprays can decrease the inflammatory response to allergens. A mast cell stabilizing nasal spray such as cromolyn sodium may decrease the intensity and frequency of allergic responses. Oral antihistamines are now available in once-daily dosing, providing convenience for the family. Some children may benefit from a combined antihistamine/nasal decongestant if nasal congestion is significant. Leukotriene modifiers such as montelukast may also be beneficial for some children. Providing Family Education One of the most important tools in the treatment of allergic rhinitis is learning to avoid known allergens. Teaching Guidelines 18.4 gives information on educating families about avoidance of allergens. Children may be referred to a specialist for allergen desensitization (allergy shots). Products helpful with control of allergies are available from a number of vendors. Links to such vendors can be found on . Teaching Guidelines 18.4 CONTROLLING EXPOSURE TO ALLERGENS Tobacco Avoid all exposure to tobacco smoke. If parents cannot quit, they must not smoke inside the home or car. Dust Mites Use pillow and mattress covers. Wash sheets, pillowcases, and comforters once a week in 130\u00b0F water. Use blinds rather than curtains in bedroom. Remove stuffed animals from bedroom. Reduce indoor humidity to <50%. Remove carpet from bedroom. Clean solid-surface floors with wet mop each week. Pet Dander Remove pets from home permanently. If unable to remove them, keep them out of bedroom and off carpet and upholstered furniture. Cockroaches Keep kitchen very clean. Avoiding leaving food or drinks out. Use pesticides if necessary, but ensure that the asthmatic child is not inside the home when the pesticide is sprayed. Indoor Molds Repair water leaks. Use dehumidifier to keep basement dry. Reduce indoor humidity to <50%. Outdoor Molds, Pollen, and Air Pollution Avoid going outdoors when mold and pollen counts are high. Avoid outdoor activity when pollution levels are high.

Schapiro (Eds.), Primary care of the child with a chronic condition (5th ed.). St. Louis: Mosby. Asthma Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disorder characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness, airway edema, and mucus production. Airway obstruction resulting from asthma might be partially or completely reversed. Severity ranges from long periods of control with infrequent acute exacerbations in some children to the presence of persistent daily symptoms in others. It is the most common chronic illness of childhood and affects over 6 million American children (Tippets & Guilbert, 2009). A small percentage of children with asthma account for a large percentage of health care use and expense. Asthma accounts for almost 13 million lost school days per year and 14.5 million lost workdays on the part of parents (Tippets & Guilbert, 2009). The incidence and severity of asthma are increasing; this might be attributed to increased urbanization, increased air pollution, and more accurate diagnosis. See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Severity ranges from symptoms associated only with vigorous activity (exercise-induced bronchospasm) to daily symptoms that interfere with quality of life. Table 18.3 discusses classification of asthma severity. Though uncommon, childhood death related to asthma is also on the rise worldwide. Air pollution, allergens, family history, and viral infections might all play a role in asthma (Ratcliffe & Kieckhefer, 2010). Many children with asthma also have gastroesophageal disease, though the relationship between the two diseases is not clearly understood. A significant long-term complication, chronic airway remodeling, may result from recurrent asthma exacerbation and inflammation. Children with asthma are more susceptible to serious bacterial and viral respiratory infections (Ratcliffe & Kieckhefer, 2010). Acute complications also include status asthmaticus and respiratory failure. Pathophysiology In asthma, the inflammatory process contributes to increased airway activity. Thus, control or prevention of inflammation is the core of asthma management. Asthma results from a complex variety of responses in relation to a trigger. When the process begins, mast cells, T lymphocytes, macrophages, and epithelial cells are involved in the release of inflammatory mediators. Eosinophils and neutrophils migrate to the airway, causing injury. Chemical mediators such as leukotrienes, bradykinin, histamine, and platelet-activating factor also contribute to the inflammatory response. The presence of leukotrienes contributes to prolonged airway constriction. Autonomic neural control of airway tone is affected, airway mucus secretion is increased, mucociliary function changes, and airway smoothmuscle responsiveness increases. As a result, acute bronchoconstriction, airway edema, and mucus plugging occur ( Fig. 18.12 ). In most children, this process is considered reversible and until recently it was not considered to have long-standing effects on lung function. Current research and scientific thought, however, recognize the concept of airway remodeling (Ratcliffe & Kieckhefer, 2010). Airway remodeling occurs as a result of chronic inflammation of the airway. Following the acute response to a trigger, continued allergen response results in a chronic phase. During this phase, the epithelial cells are denuded and the influx of inflammatory cells into the airway continues. This results in structural changes of the airway that are irreversible, and further loss of pulmonary function might occur. The irreversible changes include thickening of the sub-basement membrane, subepithelial fibrosis, airway smooth muscle hypertrophy and and dilation, and mucous gland hyperplasia and hypersecretion (National Asthma Education and Prevention Program [NAEPP], 2007). In some individuals with poorly controlled asthma, these changes may be permanent, resulting in decreased responsiveness to therapy. Therapeutic Management Current goals of medical therapy are avoidance of asthma triggers and reduction or control of inflammatory episodes. The most recent recommendations by the NAEPP (2007) suggest a stepwise approach to medication management as well as control of environmental factors (allergens) and comorbid conditions that affect asthma. The NAEPP guidelines stress periodic assessment of asthma control. Treatment decisions may then be made based on the individual's level of asthma control, rather than on the severity at diagnosis. See Healthy People 2020. FIGURE 18.12 Note airway edema, mucus production, and bronchospasm occurring with asthma. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . The stepwise approach to asthma treatment involves increasing medications as the child's condition worsens, then backing off treatment as he or she improves ( Box 18.3 ). Short-acting bronchodilators may be used in the acute treatment of bronchoconstriction and long-acting forms may be used to prevent bronchospasm. Exercise-induced bronchospasm may occur in any child with asthma or as the only symptom in the child with mild intermittent asthma. Most children may avoid exercise-induced bronchospasm by using a longer warm-up period prior to vigorous exercise and, if necessary, inhaling a short-acting bronchodilator just prior to exercise. Long-term prevention usually involves inhaled steroids. Leukotriene modifiers may be used as an alternative but are not preferred for mild persistent asthma (NAEPP, 2007). BOX 18.3 STEPWISE APPROACH TO ASTHMA MANAGEMENT All children: child education, environmental control, and management of comorbidities at each step. Consider referral to asthma specialist at step 3. (Step 2 and above are persistent asthma.) Step 1 (intermittent asthma) Preferred: short-acting 2 low-dose inhaled corticosteroid and leukotriene modifier or long- acting 2 -agonist (children older than 4 years) Step 4 Preferred: medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting 2 -agonist (can use leukotriene modifier in children younger than 4 years) Step 5 Preferred: high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and -agonist, and oral systemic corticosteroids Adapted from National Asthma Education and Prevention Program. (2007). Expert panel report 3: Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma (NIH Publication No. 07-4051). Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. These recommendations are intended to be used as a guide in individualized asthma care. Take Note! Metered-dose inhalers using chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) as the propellant are no longer on the market. Environmentally friendly formulations of hydrofluo-roalkane (HFA) are now used in all metered-dose inhalers (Ratcliffe & Kieckhefer, 2010). Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 592 . Assessment findings pertinent to asthma are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Cough, particularly at night: hacking cough that is initially nonproductive, becoming productive of frothy sputum Difficulty breathing: shortness of breath, chest tightness or pain, dyspnea with exercise Wheezing Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as: History of allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis Family history of atopy (asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis) Recurrent episodes diagnosed as wheezing, bronchiolitis, or bronchitis Known allergies Seasonal response to environmental pollen Tobacco smoke exposure Poverty Physical Examination Physical examination of the child with asthma includes inspection, auscultation, and percussion. INSPECTION Observe the child's general appearance and color. During mild exacerbations, the child's color might remain pink, but as the child worsens, cyanosis might result. Work of breathing is variable. Some children present with mild retractions, while others demonstrate significant accessory muscle use and eventually head bobbing if not treated effectively. The child may appear anxious and fearful or may be lethargic and irritable. An audible wheeze might be present. Children with persistent severe asthma may have a barrel chest and routinely demonstrate mildly increased work of breathing. AUSCULTATION AND PERCUSSION A thorough assessment of lung fields is necessary. Wheezing is the hallmark of airway obstruction and might vary throughout the lung fields. Coarseness might also be present. Assess the adequacy of aeration. Breath sounds might be diminished in the bases or throughout. A quiet chest in an asthmatic child can be an ominous sign. With severe airway obstruction, air movement can be so poor that wheezes might not be heard upon auscultation. Percussion may yield hyperresonance. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Laboratory and diagnostic studies commonly ordered for the assessment of asthma include: Pulse oximetry: oxygen saturation may be decreased significantly or normal during a mild exacerbation Chest radiograph: usually reveals hyperinflation Blood gases: might show carbon dioxide retention and hypoxemia Pulmonary function tests (PFTs): can be very useful in determining the degree of disease but are not useful during an acute attack. Children as young as 5 or 6 years might be able to comply with spirometry. Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR): is decreased during an exacerbation Allergy testing: skin test or RAST can determine allergic triggers for the asthmatic child Nursing Management Initial nursing management of the child with an acute exacerbation of asthma is aimed at restoring a clear airway and effective breathing pattern as well as promoting adequate oxygenation and ventilation (gas exchange). Refer to Nursing Care Plan 18.1 . Additional considerations are reviewed below. Educating the Child and Family Asthma is a chronic illness and needs to be understood as such. Teach families of children with asthma, and the children themselves, how to care for the disease. Symptom-free periods (often very long) are interspersed with episodes of exacerbation. Parents and children often do not understand the importance of maintenance medications for long-term control. They may view the episodes of exacerbation (sometimes requiring hospitalization or emergency room visits) as an acute illness and are simply relieved when they are over. Frequently during the periods between acute episodes, children are viewed as disease-free and long-term maintenance schedules are abandoned. The prolonged inflammatory process occurring in the absence of symptoms, primarily in children with moderate to severe asthma, can lead to airway remodeling and eventual irreversible disease. FIGURE 18.13 Asthma action plan. (Used with permission from American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, http://www.aaaai.org/professionals/asthma- action-plan.pdf .) Each child should have a management plan in place to determine when to step up or step down treatment. Figure 18.13 provides an example of an action plan that may be helpful to families in the management of asthma. The action plan should also be kept on file at the child's school, and relief medication should be available to the child at all times. Children who experience exercise-induced bronchospasm may still participate in physical education or athletics, but may need to be allowed to use their medicine before the activity. Provide appropriate education to the child and family based on the child's individualized stepwise treatment plan. Stress the concept of maintenance medications for the prevention of future serious disease in addition to controlling or preventing currentsymptoms. Educate families and children on the appropriate use of nebulizers, metered-dose inhalers, spacers, dry-powder inhalers, and Diskus, as well as the purposes, functions, and side effects of the medications they deliver. Require return demonstrations of equipment use to ensure that children and families can use the equipment properly ( Teaching Guidelines 18.5 ). Take Note! The NAEPP (2007) recommends use of a spacer or holding chamber with metered-dose inhalers to increase the bioavailability of medication in the lungs. In children who have more severe asthma, the NAEPP (2007) recommends the use of the PEFR to determine daily control. PEFR measurements obtained via a home peak flow meter can be very helpful as long as the meter is used appropriately; Teaching Guidelines 18.6 gives instructions on peak flow meter use. The child's \"personal best\" is determined collaboratively with the physician or nurse practitioner during a symptom-free period. PEFR is measured daily at home using the peak flow meter. The asthma management plan then gives specific instructions based on the PEFR measurement ( Table 18.4 ). Teaching Guidelines 18.5 USING ASTHMA MEDICATION DELIVERY Si DEVICES Nebulizer Metered-Dose InhalerDiskus Turbuhaler Teaching Guidelines 18.6 USING A PEAK FLOW METER Slide the arrow down to \"zero.\" Stand up straight. Take a deep breath and close the lips tightly around the mouthpiece. Blow out hard and fast. Note the number the arrow moves to. Repeat three times and record the highest reading. Keep a record of daily readings, being sure to measure peak flow at the same time each day. Adapted from Ratcliffe, M. M., & Kieckhefer, G. M. (2010). Asthma. In P. J. Allen, J. A. Vessey, & N. A. Schapiro (Eds.), Primary care of the child with a chronic condition (5th ed.). St. Louis: Mosby. Take Note! Young children with asthma receiving inhaled medications via a nebulizer should use a snugly fitting mask to ensure accurate deposition of medication to the lungs. Discourage \"blow-by\" via nebulizer, as medication delivery is variable and unreliable (NAEPP, 2007). Avoidance of allergens is another key component of asthma management. Avoiding known triggers helps to prevent exacerbations as well as long-term inflammatory changes. This can be a difficult task for most families, particularly if the affected child suffers from several allergies. Refer to Teaching Guidelines 18.4 for strategies of allergen avoidance. Take Note! Teach the child and family that exposure to cigarette smoke increases the need for medications in children with asthma as well as the frequency of asthma exacerbations. Both indoor air quality and environmental pollution contribute to asthma in children (NAEPP, 2007). Asthma education is a critical component for ensuring optimal health in children with asthma. This education is not limited to the hospital or clinic setting. Nurses can become involved in community asthma education: community-centered education in schools, churches, and day care centers or through peer educators has been shown to be effective. Education should include pathophysiology, asthma triggers, and prevention and treatment strategies. With such a large number of children affected with this chronic disease, community education has the potential to make a broad impact. School nurses must also become experts in asthma management as well as being committed to ongoing education of the child and family. Resources for schools include: Open Airways for Schools: an educational program presented by the American Lung Association or its local chapter, focusing on increasing asthma awareness and compliance with asthma action plans and decreasing asthma emergencies. Contact the local lung association or call 1-800-LUNG-USA. Indoor Air Repair at School: a kit available from Allergy and Asthma Network Mothers of Asthmatics (AANMA); and Healthy School Environments Assessment Tool. Links to these and other helpful resources are provided on . Promoting the Child's Self-Esteem Fear of an exacerbation and feeling \"different\" from other children can harm a child's self-esteem. In qualitative research studies,children have made such statements as \"my body shuts down\" and \"I feel like I'm going to die\" (Yoos et al., 2005). The fatigue and fear associated with chronic asthma may reduce the child's confidence and sense of control over his or her body and life. In addition to coping with a chronic illness, the asthmatic child often also has to cope with school-related issues. Moodiness, acting out, and withdrawal correlate with increases in school absence, which can contribute to poor school performance. To live in fear of an exacerbation or to be unable to participate in activities affects the child's self-esteem (Yoos et al., 2005). Through education and support, the child can gain a sense of control. Children need to learn to master their disease. Accurate evaluation of asthma symptoms and improvement of self-esteem may help the child to experience less panic with an acute episode. Improved self-esteem might also help the child cope with the disease in general and with being different from his or her peers. The school-age child has the cognitive ability to begin taking responsibility for asthma management, with continued involvement on the part of the parents. Transferring control of asthma care to the child is an important developmental process that will increase the child's feeling of control over the illness. Promoting Family Coping Parent denial is an issue in many families. The family, through education and encouragement, can become the experts on the child's illness as well as advocates for the child's well-being. The resilient child is better able to cope with the challenges facing him or her, including asthma. Cohesiveness and warmth in the family environment can improve a child's resiliency as well as contribute to family hardiness. Parents need to be allowed to ask questions and voice their concerns. A nurse who understands the family's issues and concerns is better able to plan for support and education. Provide culturally sensitive education and interventions that focus on increasing the family's commitment to, and control of, asthma management. As the child and parents become confident in their ability to recognize asthma symptoms and cope with asthma and its periodic episodes, the family's ability to cope will improve. Thinking About Development R yan Jennings is a 13-year-old male with a history of moderate asthma. He has been prescribed a preventer medication to be taken routinely and a rescue medicine to be used as needed and before exercise. He is a talented pitcher and would like to participate with his school's baseball team. How will Ryan's developmental stage affect self-care related to his asthma? What is the most appropriate approach for the nurse to take to educate Ryan about his medications and disease process? How will the nurse foster compliance in Ryan? Chronic Lung Disease Chronic lung disease (formerly termed bronchopulmonary dysplasia) is often diagnosed in infants who have experienced RDS and continue to require oxygen at 28 days of age. It is a chronic respiratory condition seen most commonly in premature infants. It results from a variety of factors, including pulmonary immaturity, acute lung injury, barotrauma, inflammatory mediators, and volutrauma. Epithelial stretching, macrophage and polymorphonuclear cell invasion, and airway edema affect the growth and development of lung structures. Cilia loss and airway lining denudation reduce the normal cleansing abilities of the lung. The number of normal alveoli is reduced by one third to one half. Lower birthweights, white race, and male gender pose increased risk for development of chronic lung disease. Complications include pulmonary artery hypertension, cor pulmonale, congestive heart failure, and severe bacterial or viral pneumonia. Anti-inflammatory inhaled medications are used for maintenance, and short-acting bronchodilators are used as needed for wheezing episodes. Supplemental long-term oxygen therapy may be required in some infants. Nursing Assessment Tachypnea and increased work of breathing are characteristic of chronic lung disease. After discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), these symptoms can continue. Exertion such as activity or oral feeding can cause dyspnea to worsen. Failure to thrive might also be evident. Auscultation might reveal breath sounds that are diminished in the bases. These infants have reactive airway episodes, so wheezing might be present during times of exacerbation. If fluid overload develops, rales may be heard. Nursing Management If the infant is oxygen dependent, provide education to the parents about oxygen tanks, nasal cannula use, pulse oximetry use, and nebulizer treatments. Often these children require increased-calorie formulas to grow adequately. Fluid restrictions and/or diuretics arenecessary in some infants. Follow-up echocardiograms might be used to determine resolution of pulmonary artery hypertension prior to weaning from oxygen. Encourage developmentally appropriate activities. It might be difficult for the oxygen-dependent infant or toddler to reach gross motor milestones or explore the environment because the length of the oxygen tubing limits him or her. Parental support is also a key nursing intervention. After a long and trying period of ups and downs with their newborn in the intensive care unit, parents find themselves exhausted caring for their medically fragile infant at home. Cystic Fibrosis Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects 30,000 children and adults in the United States (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation [CFF], 2011). A deletion occurring on the long arm of chromosome 7 at the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) is the responsible gene mutation. DNA testing can be used prenatally and in newborns to identify the presence of the mutation. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology currently recommends screening for cystic fibrosis to any person seeking preconception or prenatal care. At present, all states include testing for cystic fibrosis as part of newborn screening (CFF, 2011). Cystic fibrosis is the most common debilitating disease of childhood among those of European descent. Medical advances in recent years have greatly increased the length and quality of life for affected children, with median age for survival being the late 30s (CFF, 2011). Complications include hemoptysis, pneumothorax, bacterial colonization, cor pulmonale, volvulus, intussusception, intestinal obstruction, rectal prolapse, gastroesophageal reflux disease, diabetes, portal hypertension, liver failure, gallstones, and decreased fertility. Pathophysiology In cystic fibrosis, the CFTR mutation causes alterations in epithelial ion transport on mucosal surfaces, resulting in generalized dysfunction of the exocrine glands. The epithelial cells fail to conduct chloride, and water transport abnormalities occur. This results in thickened, tenacious secretions in the sweat glands, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, respiratory tract, and other exocrine tissues. The increased viscosity of these secretions makes them difficult to clear. The sweat glands produce a larger amount of chloride, leading to a salty taste of the skin and alterations in electrolyte balance and dehydration. The pancreas, intrahepatic bile ducts, intestinal glands, gallbladder, and submaxillary glands become obstructed by viscous mucus and eosinophilic material. Pancreatic enzyme activity is lost and malabsorption of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates occurs, resulting in poor growth and large, malodorous stools. Excess mucus is produced by the tracheobronchial glands. Abnormally thick mucus plugs the small airways, and then bronchiolitis and further plugging of the airways occur. Secondary bacterial infection with Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Burkholderia cepacia often occurs. This contributes to obstruction and inflammation, leading to chronic infection, tissue damage, and respiratory failure. Nasal polyps and recurrent sinusitis are common. Boys have tenacious seminal fluid and experience blocking of the vas deferens, often making them infertile (Hazle, 2010). In girls, thick cervical secretions might limit penetration of sperm. Table 18.5 gives further details of the pathophysiology and resulting respiratory and gastrointestinal clinical manifestations of cystic fibrosis. Therapeutic Management Therapeutic management of cystic fibrosis is aimed toward minimizing pulmonary complications, maximizing lung function, preventing infection, and facilitating growth. All children with cystic fibrosis who have pulmonary involvement require chest physiotherapy with postural drainage several times daily to mobilize secretions from the lungs. Physical exercise is encouraged. Recombinant human DNase (Pulmozyme) is given daily using a nebulizer to decrease sputum viscosity and help clear secretions. Inhaled bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents are prescribed for some children. Aerosolized antibiotics are often prescribed and may be given at home as well as in the hospital. Choice of antibiotic is determined by sputum culture and sensitivity results. Pancreatic enzymes and supplemental fat-soluble vitamins are prescribed to promote adequate digestion and absorption of nutrients and optimize nutritional status. Increased-calorie, high-protein diets are recommended, and sometimes supplemental high-calorie formula, either orally or via feeding tube, is needed. Some children require total parenteral nutrition to maintain or gain weight. Lung transplantation has been successful in some children with cystic fibrosis.Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 592 . Assessment findings pertinent to cystic fibrosis are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history in the undiagnosed child might include: A salty taste to the child's skin (resulting from excess chloride loss via perspiration) Meconium ileus or late, difficult passage of meconium stool in the newborn period Abdominal pain or difficulty passing stool (infants or toddlers might present with intestinal obstruction or intussusception at the time of diagnosis) Bulky, greasy stools Poor weight gain and growth despite good appetite Chronic or recurrent cough and/or upper or lower respiratory infections Children known to have cystic fibrosis are often admitted to the hospital for pulmonary exacerbations or other complications of the disease. The health history should include questions related to: Respiratory status: has cough, sputum production, or work of breathing increased? Appetite and weight gain Activity tolerance Increased need for pulmonary or pancreatic medications Presence of fever Presence of bone pain Any other changes in physical state or medication regimen Physical Examination The physical examination includes inspection, auscultation, percussion, and palpation. INSPECTION Observe the child's general appearance and color. Check the nasal passages for polyps. Note respiratory rate, work of breathing, use of accessory muscles, position of comfort, frequency and severity of cough, and quality and quantity of sputum produced. The child with cystic fibrosis often has a barrel chest (anterior-posterior diameter approximates transverse diameter) ( Fig. 18.14 ). Clubbing of the nail beds might also be present. Note whether rectal prolapse is present. Does the child appear small or thin for his or her age? The child might have a protuberant abdomen and thin extremities, with decreased amounts of subcutaneous fat. Observe for the presence of edema (sign of cardiac or liver failure). Note distended neck veins or the presence of a heave (signs of cor pulmonale). FIGURE 18.14 (A) Normal chest shape\u2014transverse diameter is greater than anterior-posterior diameter. (B) Barrel chest\u2014transverse diameter equals anterior- posterior diameter. AUSCULTATION Auscultation may reveal a variety of adventitious breath sounds. Fine or coarse crackles and scattered or localized wheezing might be present. With progressive obstructive pulmonary involvement, breath sounds might be diminished. Tachycardia might be present.Note the presence of a gallop (might occur with cor pulmonale). Note the adequacy of bowel sounds. PERCUSSION Percussion over the lung fields usually yields hyperresonance due to air trapping. Diaphragmatic excursion might be decreased. Percussion of the abdomen might reveal dullness over an enlarged liver or mass related to intestinal obstruction. PALPATION Palpation might yield a finding of asymmetric chest excursion if atelectasis is present. Tactile fremitus may be decreased over areas of atelectasis. Note if tenderness is present over the liver (might be an early sign of cor pulmonale). Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the diagnosis and assessment of cystic fibrosis include: Sweat chloride test: considered suspicious if the level of chloride in collected sweat is above 50 mEq/L and diagnostic if the level is above 60 mEq/L Pulse oximetry: oxygen saturation might be decreased, particularly during a pulmonary exacerbation Chest radiograph: may reveal hyperinflation, bronchial wall thickening, atelectasis, or infiltration Pulmonary function tests: might reveal a decrease in forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume, with increases in residual volume Nursing Management Management of cystic fibrosis focuses on minimizing pulmonary complications, promoting growth and development, and facilitating coping and adjustment by the child and family. In addition to the nursing diagnoses and related interventions discussed in Nursing Care Plan 18.1 for respiratory disorders, interventions common to cystic fibrosis follow. Maintaining Patent Airway Chest physiotherapy is often used as an adjunct therapy in respiratory illnesses, but for children with cystic fibrosis it is a critical intervention. Chest physiotherapy involves percussion, vibration, and postural drainage, and either it or another bronchial hygiene therapy must be performed several times a day to assist with mobilization of secretions. Nursing Procedure 18.2 gives instructions on the chest physiotherapy technique. For older children and adolescents, the flutter-valve device, positive expiratory pressure therapy, or a high-frequency chest compression vest may also be used. The flutter valve device provides high-frequency oscillation to the airway as the child exhales into a mouthpiece that contains a steel ball. Positive expiratory pressure therapy involves exhaling through a flow resistor, which creates positive expiratory pressure. The cycles of exhalation are repeated until coughing yields expectoration of secretions. The vest airway clearance system provides high-frequency chest wall oscillation to increase airflow velocity to create repetitive cough-like shear forces and to decrease the viscosity of secretions. Breathing exercises are also helpful in promoting mucus clearance. Encourage physical exercise, as it helps to promote mucus secretion as well as provides cardiopulmonary conditioning. Ensure that Pulmozyme is administered, as well as inhaled bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents if prescribed. Preventing Infection Vigorous pulmonary hygiene for mobilization of secretions is critical to prevent infection. Aerosolized antibiotics can be given at home as well as in the hospital. Children with frequent or severe respiratory exacerbations might require lengthy courses of intravenous antibiotics. Maintaining Growth Pancreatic enzymes must be administered with all meals and snacks to promote adequate digestion and absorption of nutrients. The number of capsules required depends on the extent of pancreatic insufficiency and the amount of food being ingested. The dosage can be adjusted until an adequate growth pattern is established and the number of stools is consistent at one or two per day. Children will need additional enzyme capsules when high-fat foods are being eaten. In the infant or young child, the enzyme capsule can be opened and sprinkled on cereal or applesauce. A well-balanced, high-calorie, high-protein diet is necessary to ensure adequate growth. Some children require up to 1.5 times the recommended daily allowance of calories for children their age. A number of commercially available nutritional formulas and shakes are available for diet supplementation.In infants, breastfeeding should be continued with enzyme administration. Some infants will require fortification of breast milk or supplementation with high-calorie formulas. Commercially available infant formulas can continue to be used for the formula-fed infant and can be mixed to provide a larger amount of calories if necessary. Supplementation with vitamins A, D, E, and K is necessary. Administer gavage feedings or total parenteral nutrition as prescribed to provide for adequate growth. Promoting Family Coping Cystic fibrosis is a serious chronic illness that requires daily interventions. It can be hard to maintain a schedule that requires pulmonary hygiene several times daily as well as close attention to appropriate diet and enzyme supplementation. Adjusting to the demands that the illness places on the child and family is difficult. Continual adjustments within the family must occur. Children are frequently hospitalized, and this may place an additional strain on the family and its finances. Children with cystic fibrosis may express fear or feelings of isolation, and siblings may be worried or jealous. Encourage the family to lead a normal life through involvement in activities and school attendance during periods of wellness. NURSING PROCEDURE 18.2 Performing Chest Physiotherapy 1. Provide percussion via a cupped hand or an infant percussion device. Appropriate percussion yields a hollow sound, not a slapping sound. 2. Percuss each segment of the lung for 1 to 2 minutes. 3. Place the ball of the hand on the lung segment, keeping the arm and shoulder straight. Vibrate by tensing and relaxing your arms during the child's exhalation. Vibrate each lung segment for at least five exhalations. 4. Encourage the child to deep breathe and cough. 5. Change drainage positions and repeat percussion and vibration. Take Note! Massage therapy performed by the parent, nurse, or licensed massage therapist may help to improve mood or relieve pain in the child with cystic fibrosis. It may have the added benefit of improving respiratory status, but it does not replace chest physiotherapy (Lee, Holdsworth, Holland, & Button, 2009). Starting at the time of diagnosis, families often demonstrate significant stress as the severity of the diagnosis and the significance of disease chronicity become real for them. The family should be involved in the child's care from the time of diagnosis, whether in the outpatient setting or in the hospital. Ongoing education about the illness and its treatments is necessary. Once the initial shock of diagnosis has passed and the family has adjusted to initial care, the family usually learns how to manage the requirements of care. Powerlessness gives way to adaptation. As family members become more comfortable with their understanding of the illness and the required treatments, they will eventually become the experts on the child's care. It is important for the nurse to recognize and respect the family's changing needs over time. Providing daily intense care can be tiring, and noncompliance on the part of the family or child might occur as a result of this fatigue. Overvigilance may also occur as parents attempt to control the difficult situation and protect the child. Families welcome support and encouragement. Most families eventually progress past the stages of fear, guilt, and powerlessness to a way of living that is different than what they anticipated but is something that they can manage. Refer parents to a local support group for families of children with cystic fibrosis. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation has chapters throughout the United States. Links to The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and other helpful resources can be found on . Parents of children with a terminal illness might face the death of their child at an earlier age than expected. Assisting with anticipatory grieving and making decisions related to end-of-life care are other important nursing interventions. Preparing the Child and Family for Adulthood With Cystic FibrosisWith current technological and medication advances, many more children with cystic fibrosis are surviving to adulthood and into their 30s and 40s (CFF, 2011). Lung transplantation is now being used in some children with success, thus prolonging life expectancy (barring transplant complications) (Hazle, 2010). Children with cystic fibrosis should have the goal of independent living as an adult, as other children do. Making the transition from a pediatric medical home to an adult medical home should be viewed as a normal part of growing up, similar to completing school or finding a first job. Pediatric clinics are focused on family-centered care that heavily involves the child's parents, but adults with cystic fibrosis need a different focus, one that views them as independent adults. Those with cystic fibrosis can make the transition from pediatric to adult care with thoughtful preparation and coordination. They desire and deserve a smooth transition in care that will result in appropriate ongoing medical management of cystic fibrosis in an environment that is geared toward adults rather than children. Adults with cystic fibrosis are able to find rewarding work and pursue relationships. Most men with cystic fibrosis are capable of sexual intercourse, though unable to reproduce. Females might have difficulty conceiving, and when they do they should be cautioned about the additional respiratory strain that pregnancy causes. All children of parents with cystic fibrosis will be carriers of the gene. Apnea Apnea is defined as absence of breathing for longer than 20 seconds; it might be accompanied by bradycardia. Sometimes apnea presents in the form of an acute life-threatening event (ALTE), an event in which the infant or child exhibits some combination of apnea, color change, muscle tone alteration, coughing, or gagging. Apnea may also occur acutely at any age as a result of respiratory distress. This discussion will focus on apnea that is chronic or recurrent in nature or that occurs as part of an ALTE. Apnea in infants may be central (unrelated to any other cause) or may occur with other illnesses such as sepsis and respiratory infection. Apnea in newborns might be associated with hypothermia, hypoglycemia, infection, or hyperbilirubinemia. Apnea of prematurity occurs secondary to an immature respiratory system. Apnea should not be considered a predecessor to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Current research has not proven this theory, and SIDS generally occurs in otherwise healthy young infants (American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP], 2009). Box 18.4 gives more information about SIDS and its prevention. Therapeutic management of apnea varies depending on the cause. When apnea occurs as a result of another disorder or infection, treatment is directed toward that cause. In the event of apnea, stimulation may trigger the infant to take a breath. If breathing does not resume, rescue breathing or bag-valve-mask ventilation is necessary. Infants and children who have experienced an ALTE or who have chronic apnea may require ongoing cardiac/apnea monitoring. Caffeine or theophylline is sometimes administered, primarily in premature infants, to stimulate respirations (Kelly, 2010). BOX 18.4 SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME (SIDS) Definition Sudden death of a previously healthy infant younger than 1 year of age Prevention Place all infants in the supine position to sleep (even side-lying is not as safe and is not recommended by the AAP). Provide a firm sleep surface and avoid soft bedding, excess covers, pillows, and stuffed animals in the crib. Avoid maternal prenatal smoking and exposure of the infant to second-hand smoke. Ensure the infant sleeps separately from the parents. Avoid overbundling or overdressing the infant. Encourage pacifier use during naps and at bedtime if the infant is receptive to it (AAP, 2009). Support and Information Association for SIDS and Infant Mortality Program: www.asip1.org National Sudden Infant Death Resource Center: www.sidscenter.org www.sidsalliance.org Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Network, Inc.: http://sids-network.org/ Nursing Assessment Question the parents about the infant's position and activities preceding the apneic episode. Did the infant experience a color change?Did the infant self-stimulate (breathe again on his or her own), or did he or she require stimulation from the caretaker? Assess risk factors for apnea, which may include prematurity, anemia, and history of metabolic disorders. Apnea may occur in association with cardiac or neurologic disturbances, respiratory infection, sepsis, child abuse, or poisoning. In the hospitalized infant, note absence of respiration, position, color, and other associated findings, such as emesis on the bedclothes. If an infant who is apneic fails to be stimulated and does not breathe again, pulselessness will result. Nursing Management When an infant is noted to be apneic, gently stimulate him or her to take a breath again. If gentle stimulation is unsuccessful, then rescue breathing or bag-valve-mask ventilation must be started. To avoid apnea in the newborn, maintain a neutral thermal environment. Avoid excessive vagal stimulation and taking rectal temperatures (the vagal response can cause bradycardia, resulting in apnea) (Jarvis, 2008). Administer caffeine or theophylline if prescribed and teach families about the use of these medications. FIGURE 18.15 The home apnea monitor uses a soft belt with a Velcro attachment to hold two leads in the appropriate position on the chest. Infants with recurrent apnea or ALTE may be discharged on a home apnea monitor ( Fig. 18.15 ). Provide education on use of the monitor, guidance about when to notify the physician or monitor service about alarms, and training in infant cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The monitor is usually discontinued after 3 months without a significant event of apnea or bradycardia. In some ways the monitor gives parents peace of mind, but in others it can make them more nervous about the well-being of their child. Parents often experience disrupted sleep and some may display negative coping patterns (Scollan-Koliopoulos & Koliopoulos, 2010). Providing appropriate education to the parents about the nature of the child's disorder as well as action to take in the event of apnea may give the family a sense of mastery over the situation, thus decreasing their anxiety. Refer families to local support groups such as those offered by Parent to Parent and Parents Helping Parents.TRACHEOSTOMY A tracheostomy is an artificial opening in the airway; usually a plastic tracheostomy tube is in place to form a patent airway. Tracheostomies are performed to relieve airway obstruction, such as with subglottic stenosis (narrowing of the airway sometimes resulting from long-term intubation). They are also used for pulmonary toilet and in the child who requires chronic mechanical ventilation. The tracheostomy facilitates secretion removal, reduces work of breathing, and increases the child's comfort. In some cases the tracheostomy facilitates mechanical ventilation weaning. It may be permanent or temporary, depending on the indication. The tracheostomy tube varies in size and type depending on the child's airway size and health and the length of time the child will require the tracheostomy. Silastic tracheostomy tubes are soft and flexible; they are available with a single lumen or may have an outer and inner lumen. Both types have an obturator (the guide used during tube changes). Uncuffed tubes are used more often in the pediatric population (Deutsch, 2010). Figure 18.16 shows various types of tracheostomy tubes. FIGURE 18.16 Note smaller size and absence of inner cannula on particular brands of pediatric tracheostomy tubes. Complications immediately after surgery include hemorrhage, air entry, pulmonary edema, anatomic damage, and respiratory arrest. At any point in time the tracheostomy tube may become occluded, which compromises ventilation. Complications of chronic tracheostomy include infection, cellulitis, and formation of granulation tissue around the insertion site. Nursing Assessment When obtaining the history for a child with a tracheostomy, note the reason for the tracheostomy, as well as the size and type of tracheostomy tube. Inspect the site. The stoma should appear pink and without bleeding or drainage. The tube itself should be clean and free from secretions. The tracheostomy ties should fit securely, allowing one finger to slide beneath the ties ( Fig. 18.17 ). Inspect the skin under the ties for rash or redness. Observe work of breathing.FIGURE 18.17 Properly fitting trach ties. One fingerwidth fits between the ties and the child's neck. When caring for the infant or child with a tracheostomy, whether in the hospital, home, or community setting, a thorough respiratory assessment is necessary. Note presence of secretions and their color, thickness, and amount. Auscultate for breath sounds, which should be clear and equal throughout all lung fields. Measure pulse oximetry. When infection is suspected or secretions are discolored or have a foul odor, a sputum culture may be obtained. Take Note! Keep small toys (risk of aspiration), plastic bibs or bedding (risk of airway occlusion), and talcum powder (risk of inhalation injury) out of reach of the child with a tracheostomy. Nursing Management In the immediate postoperative period the infant or child may require restraints to avoid accidental dislodgment of the tracheostomy tube. Infants and children who have had a tracheostomy for a period of time become accustomed to it and usually do not attempt to remove the tube. Since air inspired via the tracheostomy tube bypasses the upper airway, it lacks humidification, and this lack of humidity can lead to a mucous plug in the tracheostomy and resultant hypoxia. Provide humidity to either room air or oxygen via a tracheostomy collar or ventilator, depending on the child's need ( Fig. 18.18 ). Box 18.5 lists the equipment that should be available at the bedside of any child who has a tracheostomy. Tracheostomies require frequent suctioning to maintain patency. The appropriate length for insertion of the suction catheter depends on the size of the tracheostomy and the child's needs. Place a sign at the head of the child's bed indicating the suction catheter size and the length (in centimeters) that it should be inserted for suctioning. Keep an extra tracheostomy tube of the same size and one size smaller at the bedside in the event of an emergency.FIGURE 18.18 The trach collar allows for humidification of inspired air or supplemental oxygen. BOX 18.5 EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT (AVAILABLE AT BEDSIDE) Two spare tracheostomy tubes (one the same size and one a size smaller) Suction equipment Stitch cutter (new tracheostomy) Spare tracheostomy ties Lubricating jelly Bag-valve-mask device Call bell within child's/parent's reach Many pediatric tracheostomy tubes do not have an inner cannula that requires periodic removal and cleaning, so periodic removal and replacement of the chronic tracheostomy tube is required. Clean the removed tracheostomy tube with half-strength hydrogen peroxide and pipe cleaners. Rinse with distilled water and allow it to dry. The tracheostomy tube can be reused many times if adequately cleaned between uses. NURSING PROCEDURE 18.3 Tracheostomy Care 1. Gather the necessary equipment: Cleaning solution Gloves Precut gauze pad Cotton-tipped applicators Clean tracheostomy ties Scissors Extra tracheostomy tube in case of accidental dislodgement 2. Position the infant/child supine with a blanket or towel roll to extend the neck. 3. Open all packaging and cut tracheostomy ties to appropriate length if necessary. 4. Cleanse around the tracheostomy site with prescribed solution (half-strength hydrogen peroxide or acetic acid, normal saline or soap and water if at home) and cotton-tipped applicators, working from just around the tracheostomy tube outward.5. Rinse with sterile water and cotton-tipped applicator in similar fashion. 6. Place the precut sterile gauze under the tracheostomy tube. 7. With the assistant holding the tube in place, cut the ties and remove from the tube. 8. Attach the clean ties to the tube and tie or secure in place with Velcro. Perform tracheostomy care every 8 hours or per institution protocol. Change the tracheostomy tube only as needed or per institution protocol. Nursing Procedure 18.3 gives information about tracheostomy care. Always change tracheostomy ties with an assistant to avoid accidental dislodgement of the tube. If the older child or teen has a tracheostomy tube with an inner cannula, care of the inner cannula is similar to that of an adult. Involve parents in care of the tracheostomy and begin education about caring for the tracheostomy tube at home as soon as the child is stable. The child with a tracheostomy often qualifies for a Medicaid waiver that will provide a certain amount of home nursing care. Refer the family to local support groups. Links for additional helpful resources can be found on . KEY CONCEPTS Respiratory infections account for the majority of acute illnesses in children. The upper and lower airways are smaller in children than adults, making them more susceptible to obstruction in the presence of mucus, debris, or edema. Newborns are obligatory nose breathers. The child's highly compliant airway is quite susceptible to dynamic collapse in the presence of airway obstruction. Because they have fewer alveoli, children have a higher risk for hypoxemia than adults. Generally, disorders of the nose and throat do not result in increased work of breathing or affect the lungs. Thus, if the lungs are involved, lower respiratory disease must be considered. Wheezing may be associated with a variety of lower respiratory disorders, such as asthma, bronchiolitis, and cystic fibrosis. Pulse oximetry is a useful tool for determining the extent of hypoxia. Findings should be correlated with the child's clinical presentation. Rapid streptococcus and rapid influenza tests are very useful for the quick diagnosis of strep throat or influenza so that appropriate treatment may be instituted early in the illness. Supplemental oxygen is often necessary in the child who is hospitalized (particularly with lower respiratory disease). Oxygen should be humidified to prevent drying of secretions. Suctioning, whether with a bulb syringe or suction catheter, is very effective at maintaining airway patency, especially in the younger child or infant. Normal saline nasal wash is an inexpensive, simple, and safe method for decongesting the nose in the case of the common cold, allergic rhinitis, and sinusitis. Infants who were born prematurely; children with a chronic illness such as diabetes, congenital heart disease, sickle cell anemia, or cystic fibrosis; and children with developmental disorders such as cerebral palsy tend to be more severely affected with respiratory disorders. Passive cigarette smoke exposure increases the infant's and child's risk for respiratory disease. Continual swallowing while awake or asleep is an indication of bleeding in the postoperative tonsillectomy child. Positioning to ease work of breathing and maintaining a patent airway are priorities for the child with a respiratory disorder. To avoid Reye syndrome, aspirin should not be given to treat fever or pain in the infant or child with a viral infection. Infants and children at high risk for serious RSV disease should be immunized with Synagis each RSV season. Children older than 6 months of age should be immunized against influenza yearly. Children at high risk for exposure to tuberculosis should be screened for infection. Promoting airway clearance and maintenance, effective breathing patterns, and adequate gas exchange is the priority focus of nursing intervention in pediatric respiratory disease. Children with any degree of respiratory distress require frequent assessment and early intervention to prevent progression to respiratory failure. Avoidance of allergens is critical in the treatment plan for the child with allergic rhinitis. Avoidance of allergic triggers, control of the inflammatory process, and education of the child and family are the focus of asthma management. Chest physiotherapy is extremely useful for mobilizing secretions in any condition resulting in an increase in mucus production andis required in children with cystic fibrosis. Children with chronic respiratory disorders and their families often need large amounts of education and psychosocial support: children often experience fear and isolation, while families must learn to balance care of the chronically ill child with other family life.

A 10-month-old girl is admitted to the pediatric unit with a history of recurrent pneumonia and failure to thrive. Her sweat chloride test confirms the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. She is a frail-appearing infant with thin extremities and a slightly protuberant abdomen. She is tachypneic, has retractions, and coughs frequently. Based on the limited information given here and your knowledge of cystic fibrosis, choose three of the categories below as priorities to focus on when planning her care: a. Prevention of bronchospasm b. Promotion of adequate nutrition c. Education of the child and family d. Prevention of pulmonary infection e. Balancing fluid and electrolytes f. Management of excess weight gain g. Prevention of spread of infection h. Promoting adequate sleep and rest2. A boy with asthma is admitted to the pediatric unit for the fourth time this year. The mother expresses frustration that he is getting sick so often. Besides information about onset of symptoms and events leading up to this present episode, what other types of information would you ask for while obtaining the history? 3. The mother of the boy in the previous question tells you that she smokes (but never around the boy), the family has a cat that comes inside sometimes, and she always gives her son the medication prescribed. She gives salmeterol and budesonide as soon as he starts to cough. When he is not having an episode, she gives him albuterol before his baseball games. Diphenhydramine helps his runny nose in the springtime. Based on this new information, what advice/instructions would you give the mother? 4. A 7-year-old presents with a history of recurrent nasal discharge. He sneezes every time he visits his cousins, who have pets. He lives in an older home that is carpeted. Tobacco smokers live in the home. His mother reports that he snores and is a mouth breather. She says he has symptoms nearly year-round, but they are worse in the fall and the spring. She reports that diphenhydramine is somewhat helpful with his symptoms, but she doesn't like to give it to him on school days because it makes him drowsy. Based on the history above, develop a teaching plan for this child. 5. The nurse is caring for a 4-year-old girl who returned from the recovery room after a tonsillectomy 3 hours ago. She has cried off and on over the past 2 hours and is now sleeping. What areas should the nurse assess and focus on for this child? STUDY ACTIVITIES 1. While caring for children in the pediatric setting, compare the signs and symptoms of a child with asthma to those of an infant with bronchiolitis. What are the most notable differences? How does the history of the two children differ? 2. A child with asthma has been prescribed Advair (fluticasone and salmeterol), albuterol, and prednisone. Develop a sample teaching plan for the child and family. Include appropriate use of the devices used to deliver the medications, as well as important information about the medications (uses and adverse effects). 3. While caring for children in the pediatric setting, compare the signs and symptoms and presentation of a child with the common cold to those of a child with either sinusitis or allergic rhinitis. 4. While caring for children in the pediatric setting, review the census of children and identify those at risk for severe influenza and thus those who would benefit from annual influenza vaccination. 5. Compare the differences in oxygen administration between a young infant and an older child.19 Nursing Care of the Child With a Cardiovascular Disorder Words of Wisdom The heart of the matter is healing the child's heart so he or she can embrace life to its fullest.

Logan Bernstein, 6 weeks old, is brought to the clinic by his mother. He presents with poor feeding. His mother states, \"Logan falls asleep while feeding, and he's always very sweaty during feedings.\" Cardiovascular disease is a significant cause of chronic illness and death in children. Typically cardiovascular disorders in childrenare divided into two major categories\u2014congenital heart disease (CHD) and acquired heart disease. Congenital heart disease is defined as structural anomalies that are present at birth, though they are often not diagnosed until later in life. CHD accounts for the largest percentage of all birth defects. About 36,000 babies are born annually with a congenital heart defect (American Heart Association [AHA], 2011b). Acquired heart disease includes disorders that occur after birth. These disorders develop from a wide range of causes, or they can occur as a complication or long-term effect of CHD. Over 100 genes have been identified that may be involved in the development of CHD (Cunningham et al., 2010). Additional noncardiac anomalies occur in about 28% of children with CHD. CHD is also commonly associated with chromosomal abnormalities (Marian, Brugada, & Roberts, 2008). Many congenital heart defects result in heart failure and chronic cyanosis, leading to failure to thrive. The diagnosis of a cardiovascular disorder in any person can be extremely frightening and overwhelming. Early on, children learn that the heart is necessary for life, so knowing that there is a heart problem can promote feelings of dread. These feelings are compounded by the child's age, the view of the child as being vulnerable and defenseless, and the stressors associated with the disorder itself. The child and parents need much support and reassurance (Cook & Higgins, 2010). Nurses need to have a sound knowledge base about cardiovascular conditions affecting children so that they can provide appropriate assessment, intervention, guidance, and support to the child and family. Cardiovascular disorders require acute interventions that often have long-term implications for the child's health and growth and development. Due to the potentially overwhelming and devastating effects that cardiovascular disorders can have on children and their families, nurses need to be skilled in assessment and interventions in this area and able to provide support throughout the course of the illness and beyond.VARIATIONS IN PEDIATRIC ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY The cardiovascular system undergoes numerous changes at birth. Structures that were vital to the fetus are no longer needed. Circulation via the umbilical arteries and vein is replaced with the child's own closed independent circulation. Changes in the size of the heart, pulse rate, and blood pressure also occur. Circulatory Changes From Gestation to Birth The fetal heart rate is present on about postconceptual day 17. The four chambers of the heart and arteries are formed during gestational weeks 2 through 8, with maturation of the structures occurring throughout the remainder of gestation. During fetal development, oxygenation of the fetus occurs via the placenta; the lungs, though perfused, do not perform oxygenation and ventilation. The foramen ovale, an opening between the atria, allows blood flow from the right to the left atrium. The ductus arteriosus allows blood flow between the pulmonary artery and the aorta, shunting blood away from the pulmonary circulation (Cunningham et al., 2010). Figure 19.1 illustrates fetal circulation. With the newborn's first breath, several changes occur in the cardiopulmonary system that enable the newborn to make the transition from fetal circulation to normal circulation. As the newborn breathes for the first time, the lungs inflate, reducing pulmonary vascular resistance to blood flow. As a result, pulmonary artery pressure drops. Subsequently, pressure in the right atrium decreases. Blood flow to the left side of the heart increases the pressure in the left atrium. This change in pressure leads to closure of the foramen ovale. The drop in pressure of the pulmonary artery promotes closure of the ductus arteriosus, which is located between the aorta and pulmonary artery. The ductus venosus, located between the left umbilical vein and the inferior vena cava, closes because of a lack of blood flow and vasoconstriction. The closed ductus arteriosus and ductus venosus eventually become ligaments. With the lack of blood flow to the umbilical arteries and vein, these structures atrophy (Cunningham et al., 2010). Structural and Functional Differences The structure and function of the infant's and child's cardiovascular system differ from those of adults, depending on age. In infants and children younger than 7 years of age, the heart lies more horizontally, resulting in the apex lying higher in the chest, below the fourth intercostal space. As the lungs grow over time, the heart is displaced downward. Between ages 1 and 6 years, the heart is four times the birth size. Between 6 and 12 years of age, the child's heart is 10 times the size it was at birth. However, the heart is smaller proportionally at this time than at any other stage in life. During the school-age years, the heart grows more vertically within the thoracic cavity. During adolescence, the heart continues to grow in relation to the teen's rapid growth. At birth, the ventricle walls are similar in thickness, but with time the left ventricular wall thickens. The immature myocytes of the infant's heart are thinner and less compliant than those of the adult. Right ventricular function dominates at birth, and over the first few months of life, left ventricular function becomes dominant. The infant's heart at rest exhibits a greater resting tension than the adult's, so volume loading or increased stretch may actually lead to decreased cardiac output. The infant's sarcoplasmic reticulum is less well organized than the adult's, making the infant dependent on serum calcium for contraction. Inotropic response to calcium in the actin and myosin (contractile proteins) increases with age.FIGURE 19.1 Fetal and newborn circulation. The normal heart rate is higher in infancy than in adulthood, limiting the infant's ability to increase cardiac output by increasing the heart rate. The heart's efficiency increases as the child ages and the heart rate drops over time. The normal infant heart rate ranges from 90 to 160 beats per minute (bpm), the toddler's or preschooler's is 80 to 125 bpm, the school-age child's is 70 to 100 bpm, and the adolescent's ranges from 60 to 100 bpm. Innocent murmurs and physiologic splitting of heart sounds may be noted in infancy or childhood. These findings are related to the change in the size of the heart in relation to the thoracic cavity. The infant's and child's blood vessels widen and increase in length over time. The normal infant's blood pressure (BP) is about 80/40 mm Hg. The BP increases over time to the adult level. The toddler or preschooler's BP averages 80 to 100/64 mm Hg, the school-age child's 94 to 112/56 to 60 mm Hg, and the adolescent's 100 to 120/50 to 70 mm Hg (National Institutes of Health, 2008).COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS A variety of medications as well as other medical treatments and surgical procedures are used to treat cardiovascular problems in children. Most of these treatments will require a physician's order when the child is in the hospital. The most common treatments and medications are listed in Common Medical Treatments 19.1 and Drug Guide 19.1 . The nurse caring for the child with a cardiovascular disorder should be familiar with what the procedures and medications are and how they work as well as common nursing implications related to use of these modalities. Take Note! Give digoxin at regular intervals, every 12 hours, such as at 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., 1 hour before or 2 hours after a feeding. If a digoxin dose is missed and more than 4 hours have elapsed, withhold the dose and give the dose at the regular time; if less than 4 hours have elapsed, give the missed dose. If the child vomits digoxin, do not give a second dose. Monitor potassium levels, as a decrease enhances the effects of digitalis, causing toxicity (Taketokmo, Hodding, & Kraus, 2010). COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS 19.1 DRUG GUIDE 19.1 NURSING PROCESS OVERVIEW FOR THE CHILD WITH A CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDER Care of the child with a cardiovascular disorder includes all steps of the nursing process: assessment, nursing diagnosis, planning, interventions, and evaluation. There are a number of general concepts related to the nursing process that may be applied to any child with a cardiovascular disorder. The nurse should be knowledgeable about the procedures, treatments, and medications as well as familiar with the nursing implications related to these interventions. With an understanding of these concepts, the nurse can individualize the care based on the child's and family's needs. Remember Logan, the 6-week-old with poor feeding? What additional health history and physical examination assessment information should the nurse obtain? Assessment When assessing a child with a cardiovascular disorder, expect to obtain a health history, perform a physical examination, and prepare the child for laboratory and diagnostic testing. Health History The health history consists of a history of the present illness, past medical history, and family history. Depending on his or her age, the child should be included in the health history interview; the child's age will determine the degree of involvement and the terminology used. Table 19.1 gives examples of typical questions that can be used when obtaining the child's health history. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Elicit the history of the present illness, which addresses when the symptoms started and how they have progressed. Inquire about any treatments and medications used at home. Ask parents about history of orthopnea, dyspnea, easy fatigability, growth delays, squatting, edema, dizziness, and/or frequent occurrences of pneumonia, which can be significant signs of pediatric heart disease. The history of present illness may reveal a history of poor feeding, including fatigue, lethargy, and/or vomiting, or failure to thrive, even with adequate caloric intake. The parents may report diaphoresis, which is often seen in early heart failure. The parent or caregiver may also report delays in gross motor development, cyanosis (possibly reported by the parents as more of a gray color than blue), and tachypnea (indicative of heart failure). PAST MEDICAL HISTORY The past medical history includes information about the child as well as the mother's pregnancy history. Assess the child's past medical history for: Problems occurring after birth (history of the child's condition after birth may reveal evidence of an associated congenital malformation or other disorder) Frequent infections Chromosomal abnormalities Prematurity Autoimmune disorders Use of medications, such as corticosteroids Assess the mother's pregnancy, labor, and delivery history. Be sure to include information about the status of the neonate at birth. Also inquire about maternal use of medications, including illicit or over-the-counter drugs and alcohol; exposure to radiation; presence of hypertension; and maternal viral illnesses such as coxsackievirus, cytomegalovirus, influenza, mumps, or rubella. A history of significant problems related to labor and delivery is also important: stress or asphyxia at birth may be related to cardiac dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension in the newborn. Assess for additional risk factors such as: Family history of heart disease or CHD (investigate the history further if heart disease occurred in a first-degree relative) Hyperlipidemia Diabetes mellitus Obesity Inactivity Stress High-cholesterol diet Physical Examination Physical examination of the child with a cardiovascular condition consists of inspection, palpation, and auscultation. In addition, obtain the child's vital signs and measure the child's height and weight. Plot this information on a standard growth chart to evaluate nutritional status and growth. If the child is younger than 3 years of age, measure and plot the head circumference also. INSPECTION Assess the child's overall appearance. Inspect the color of the skin, noting cyanosis. Inspect the skin for edema. In infants, peripheral edema occurs first in the face, then the presacral region, and then the extremities. Edema of the lower extremities is characteristic of right ventricular heart failure in older children. Take Note! Suspect CHD in the cyanotic newborn who does not improve with oxygen administration (American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP] and American Heart Association [AHA], 2006). Inspect the fingers and toes for clubbing . Clubbing (which usually does not appear until after 1 year of age) implies chronic hypoxia due to severe congenital heart disease. The first sign of clubbing is softening of the nail beds, followed by rounding of the fingernails, followed by shininess and thickening of the nail ends (see Fig. 18.5 in Chapter 18 ).Obtain the child's temperature; fever would suggest infection. Assess respirations, including rate, rhythm, and effort. Note location and severity of retractions if present. Inspect the chest configuration, noting any prominence of the precordial chest wall, which is often seen in infants and children with cardiomegaly (abnormal heart enlargement). Note visible pulsations, which may indicate increased heart activity. Also inspect the neck veins for engorgement or abnormal pulsations. Note abdominal distention. Take Note! Children with cardiac conditions resulting in cyanosis will often have baseline oxygen saturations that are relatively low because of the mixing of oxygenated with deoxygenated blood. PALPATION Palpate the right and left radial or brachial pulse to assess cardiac rate and rhythm. Throughout infancy and childhood, the rate may vary. Palpate the femoral pulse; it should be readily palpable and equal in amplitude and strength to the brachial or radial pulse. A femoral pulse that is weak or absent in comparison to the brachial pulse is associated with coarctation of the aorta. Significant variations in pulse occur with activity, so the most accurate heart rate may be determined during sleep. In older children, exercise and emotional factors may influence the heart rate. A bounding pulse is characteristic of patent ductus arteriosus or aortic regurgitation. Narrow or thready pulses may occur in children with heart failure or severe aortic stenosis (Menashe, 2007). Note tachycardia, bradycardia, rhythm irregularities, diminished peripheral pulses, or thready pulse. Palpate the child's abdomen for hepatomegaly, a sign of right-sided heart failure in the infant and child. AUSCULTATION Auscultate the apical pulse for a full minute to determine heart rate and rhythm. Note irregularities in rhythm, tachycardia, or bradycardia. Auscultate the heart for murmurs. Many children have functional or innocent murmurs, but all murmurs must be evaluated on the basis of the following characteristics: Location Relation to the heart cycle and duration Intensity: grade I, soft and hard to hear; grade II, soft and easily heard; grade III, loud without thrill; grade IV, loud with a precordial thrill; grade V, loud, with a precordial thrill, audible with a stethoscope partially off chest; grade VI, very loud, audible with a stethoscope or with the naked ear Quality: harsh, musical, or rough; high, medium, or low pitch Variation with position (sitting, lying, standing) (Menashe, 2007) Auscultate for the character of heart sounds. Note distinct, muffled, or distant heart sounds. Abnormal splitting or intensifying of S 2 sounds occurs in children with major heart problems. Ejection clicks, which are high pitched, are related to problems with dilated vessels and/or valve abnormalities. Heard throughout systole, they can be early, moderate, or late. Clicks on the upper left sternal border are related to the pulmonary area. Aortic clicks are best heard at the apex and can be mitral or aortic in origin. A mild to late ejection click at the apex is typical of a mitral valve prolapse. The S 3 heart sound may be heard in children and is associated with cardiac abnormalities. The S 4 heart sound is not normally heard and is always associated with cardiac abnormalities (Lorts, Krawczeski, & Marino, 2009). Auscultate the BP in the upper extremities and lower extremities and compare the findings; there should be no major differences between the upper and lower extremities. Determine the pulse pressure by subtracting the diastolic pressure from the systolic pressure. The pulse pressure is less than 50 mm Hg, or less than half the systolic pressure. A widened pulse pressure, which usually is accompanied by a bounding pulse, is associated with patent ductus arteriosus, aortic insufficiency, fever, anemia, or complete heart block. A narrowed pulse pressure is associated with aortic stenosis. Note hypotension or hypertension. Take Note! Alert children and parents if a heart murmur is detected, even if it is benign. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 19.1 explains the laboratory and diagnostic tests most commonly used when considering cardiovascular disorders in children. The tests can assist the physician in diagnosing the disorder or can be used as guidelines in determining ongoing treatment. Laboratory or nonnursing personnel obtain some of the tests, while the nurse might obtain others. In either instance the nurse should be familiar with how the tests are obtained, what they are used for, and normal versus abnormal results. This knowledge will also be necessary when providing child and family education related to the testing. CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION Cardiac catheterization is the definitive study for infants and children with cardiac disease and thus deserves special attention in this section on assessment of cardiovascular disorders. Cardiac catheterization has become almost a routine diagnostic procedure and may be performed on an outpatient basis. However, it is highly invasive and not without risks, especially in sick infants and children. Indications for cardiac catheterization include: Cardiovascular disease causing cyanosis in infants: these infants need to be catheterized as soon as they are in a reasonably stable condition Severe heart failure or progressive problems such as pulmonary edema Questionable anatomic or physiologic abnormalities Planned cardiac surgery Progressive monitoring related to pulmonary hypertension Periodic assessment after repair of a cardiac defect Therapeutic interventions such as septostomy or balloon valvotomy Cardiac catheterization may be categorized as diagnostic, interventional, or electrophysiologic. Diagnostic cardiac catheterization typically is used to identify structural defects. Interventional cardiac catheterization is used as a treatment measure to dilate occluded or stenotic structures or vessels or close some defects. Electrophysiologic cardiac catheterization involves the use of electrodes to identify abnormal rhythms and destroy sites of abnormal electrical conduction. The type of catheterization performed varies based on the individual needs of the child. The procedure lasts from 1 to 3 hours (Driscoll, 2006).PERFORMING CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION In cardiac catheterization, a radiopaque catheter is inserted into a blood vessel and is then guided through the vessel to the heart with the aid of fluoroscopy. For a right-sided catheterization, the catheter is threaded to the right atrium via a major vein such as the femoral vein. With a left-sided catheterization, the catheter is threaded to the aorta and heart via an artery. Once the tip of the catheter is in the heart, contrast material is injected via the catheter and radiographic images are taken. While the catheter is in the heart, several procedures can be performed. The blood pressures, changes in cardiac output or stroke volume, and oxygen saturation in each heart chamber and major blood vessels are recorded. With the injection of contrast material, information is revealed about the heart anatomy, ventricular wall motion and ejection fraction, intracardiac pressures and hemodynamic parameters, cardiac valve function, and structural abnormalities. The movement of the contrast material is filmed so that the details of the cardiac procedure are recorded. Samples of heart tissue to evaluate for infection, muscular dysfunction, or rejection after a transplant may also be obtained (Driscoll, 2006). NURSING MANAGEMENT OF CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION For children and parents or guardians, cardiac catheterization can be a source of much anxiety. Therefore, the nurse needs to educate the parents and, if appropriate for age, the child about all aspects of the procedure. The procedure is commonly performed on an outpatient basis, but some physicians or nurse practitioners require the child to be admitted for an overnight stay for observation. Nursing management of the child undergoing cardiac catheterization includes preprocedure nursing assessment and preparation of the child and family, postprocedural nursing care, and discharge teaching. Before the Procedure. A thorough history and physical examination are necessary to establish a baseline. Obtain vital signs. Note fever or other signs and symptoms of infection, which may necessitate rescheduling the procedure. Obtain the child's height and weight to aid in determining medication dosages. Assess the child for any allergies, especially to iodine and shellfish, because some contrast materials contain iodine as a base. Review the child's medications: medications such as anticoagulants are typically withheld for several days or longer prior to the procedure to reduce the child's risk for bleeding. Check the results of any laboratory tests, such as hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Perform a complete physical examination. Pay particular attention to assessing the child's peripheral pulses, including pedal pulses. Use an indelible pen to mark the location of the child's pedal pulses so they can be easily assessed after the procedure. Document the location and quality in the child's medical record. Teach the parents and child, if appropriate, about the procedure. Include information about what the procedure involves, how long it will take, and any special instructions from the physician or nurse practitioner. Use a variety of teaching methods as appropriate, such as videotapes, books, and pamphlets. Adapt these teaching methods to the child's developmental stage. For example, introduce the younger child to equipment through play therapy. For school-age and older children and their parents, offer a tour of the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Mention sounds and sights they may experience during the procedure. Explain the use of intravenous fluid therapy, sedation, and, if ordered, anesthesia to the child and parents. Tell the child that he or she may feel a sensation of the heart racing when the catheter is inserted. Also warn the older child that he or she may experience a feeling of warmth or stinging when the contrast material is injected. Encourage the child to use familiar ways to help him or her relax. If necessary, teach the child simple relaxation measures. Typically, food and fluid are withheld for 4 to 6 hours before the procedure. Prescribed medications may be taken with a sip of water. On the day of the procedure, check to ensure that a signed informed consent form is on the child's medical record and that all necessary assessment data have been included. Just before the procedure, ask the child to void and administer a sedative, as ordered. If appropriate and permitted, allow the parents to accompany the child to the catheterization area. Teach the child and family what to expect after the procedure is completed. Inform the parents of the possible complications that might occur, such as bleeding, low-grade fever, loss of pulse in the extremity used for the catheterization, and development of arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm). Explain to the child that he or she will have a dressing over the catheter site and that he or she will need to keep the leg straight for several hours after the procedure. Teach the child and parent that frequent monitoring will be required after the procedure (Axton & Fugate, 2009). After the Procedure. Throughout the postprocedure period, closely monitor the child for complications of bleeding, arrhythmia, hematoma, and thrombus formation and infection. After the procedure, evaluate the child's vital signs, the neurovascular status of the lower extremities, and the pressure dressing over the catheterization site every 15 minutes for the first hour and then every 30 minutes for 1 hour. Vital signs should remain within acceptable parameters. Hypotension may signify hemorrhage due to perforation of the heart muscle or bleeding from the insertion site. Expect to monitor cardiac rhythm and oxygen saturation levels via pulse oximetry for the first few hours after the procedure to help identify possible complications. Assess the child's distal pulses bilaterally for presence and quality. The pulse of the affected extremity may be slightly less than that of the other extremity in the initial postprocedure period, but it should gradually return to baseline. Also assess the color and temperature of the extremity; pallor or blanching would indicate an obstruction in blood flow. Check capillary refill and sensation to evaluate blood flow to the area. Maintain bed rest in the immediate postprocedure period. Ensure that the child maintains the extremity in a straight position for approximately 4 to 8 hours, depending on the approach used and the facility's policy. Inspect the pressure dressing frequently. Check to make sure that it is dry and intact, without evidence of bleeding. Reinforce the dressing as necessary and report any evidence of drainage on the dressing. If there is a risk of the dressing becoming soiled or wet, cover it with plastic. Take Note! If bleeding occurs after a cardiac catheterization, apply pressure 1 inch above the site to create pressure over the vessel, thereby reducing the blood flow to the area. Monitor the child's intake and output closely to ensure adequate hydration. The contrast material has a diuretic effect, so assess the child for signs and symptoms of dehydration and hypovolemia. Typically, the child resumes oral intake as tolerated, beginning with sips of clear liquids and progressing to his or her preprocedure diet. Continue intravenous fluids as ordered and encourage oral fluid intake as allowed and ordered to promote elimination of the contrast material. Allow the child to talk about the experience and how and what he or she felt. Provide positive reinforcement for the child's actions. Provide child and family education before the child is discharged home (see Teaching Guidelines 19.1 ). Areas to address include site care, signs and symptoms of complications (especially within 24 hours after the catheterization, such as fever, bleeding or bruising at the catheterization site, or changes in color, temperature, or sensation in the extremity used), diet, and activity level (Axton & Fugate, 2009). Nursing Diagnoses and Related InterventionsUpon completion of a thorough assessment, the nurse might identify several nursing diagnoses. These may include but are not limited to: Decreased cardiac output Ineffective tissue perfusion Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements Risk for delayed growth and development Risk for infection Excess fluid volume Interrupted family processes Activity intolerance Pain After completing Logan's assessment, the nurse noted the following: poor weight gain, tachypnea with occasional nasal flaring, crackles heard on auscultation, and edema noted in the face, presacral area, and extremities. Based on these assessment findings, what would your top three nursing diagnoses be for Logan? Nursing goals, interventions, and evaluation for the child with a cardiovascular disorder are based on the nursing diagnoses. Nursing Care Plan 19.1 can be used as a guide in planning nursing care for the child with a cardiovascular disorder. The nursing care plan overview should be individualized based on the child's symptoms and needs. Refer to Chapter 14 for detailed information about pain assessment and management. Additional information will be included later in the chapter as it relates to specific disorders. Based on your top three nursing diagnoses for Logan, describe appropriate nursing interventions. COMMON LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS 19.1 Teaching Guidelines 19.1 PROVIDING CARE AFTER A CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION Change the pressure dressing on the day after the procedure. Apply a dry sterile dressing or adhesive bandage for the next several days. Keep the dressing dry; cover it with plastic if there is a chance that the dressing could become wet or soiled. When changing the dressing, inspect the insertion site for redness, irritation, swelling, drainage, and bleeding. Report any of these to the physician or nurse practitioner. Check the temperature, color, sensation, and pulses on the child's extremities and compare. Report any changes to the physician or nurse practitioner. Resume the child's usual diet after the procedure; report any nausea or vomiting. Check the child's temperature at least once a day for approximately 3 days after the procedure. Report any temperature elevation of 100.4\u00b0F or greater. Avoid giving the child a tub bath for approximately 3 days after the procedure; use sponge baths or showers instead. Discourage strenuous exercise or activity for approximately 3 days after the procedure. Watch for changes in the child's appearance, such as changes in skin color, reports of the heart \"fluttering\" or \"skipping a beat,\" fever, or difficulty breathing. Give acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin) for complaints of pain. Schedule a follow-up appointment with the physician or nurse practitioner in the time specified. Adapted from Axton, S. E., & Fugate, T. (2009). Pediatric nursing care plans for the hospitalized child (3rd ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson; and The Children's Mercy Hospital. (2011). Cardiac catheterization. Retrieved March 4, 2011, from http://www.childrensmercy.org/content/uploadedFiles/Care_Cards/CMH-99-181p.pdfCONGENITAL HEART DISEASE In North America, more than 1% of newborn infants have CHD resulting from numerous causes. The prevalence of CHD is about 8 per 1,000 live births; premature infants have a higher rate (Fulton, 2008). Many chromosome defects are associated with CHD, including Down syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome, Turner syndrome, trisomy 13, trisomy 18, Williams syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, and cri-du-chat (Marian et al., 2008). About one third of infants with CHD will have disease serious enough to result in death or will require cardiac catheterization or cardiac surgery within the first year of life. Complications of CHD include heart failure, hypoxemia, growth retardation, developmental delay, and pulmonary vascular disease. Children with severe anomalies frequently experience failure to thrive. With advances in palliative and corrective surgery in the past 20 years, many more children are now able to survive into adulthood. As many as 85% of children with CHD grow to be adults, yet many have problems related to education, insurance, and employment (Abdoulhosn & Child, 2008). Hypothermia, cardiopulmonary bypass required during cardiac surgery for CHD, and episodes of hypoxemia may have a long-term impact on the child's cognitive ability and academic function (Fulton, 2008). Due to the potential long-term effects that CHD may have on these children, nurses must be expertly equipped to care for them. Pathophysiology The exact cause of CHD is unknown. However, the belief is that it results from interplay of several factors, including genetics (e.g., chromosomal alterations) and maternal exposure to environmental factors (e.g., toxins, infections, chronic illnesses, and alcohol). Congenital heart defects result from some interference in the development of the heart structure during fetal life. Subsequently, the septal walls or valves may fail to develop completely, or vessels or valves may be stenotic, narrowed, or transposed. Structures that formed to allow fetal circulation may fail to close after birth, altering the pressures necessary to maintain adequate blood flow. NURSING CARE PLAN Overview for the Child With a Cardiovascular Disorder NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Decreased cardiac output related to structural defect, congenital anomaly, or ineffective heart pumping as evidenced by arrhythmias, edema, murmur, abnormal heart rate, or abnormal heart sounds Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child or infant will demonstrate adequate cardiac output: will have elastic skin turgor, brisk capillary refill, demonstrate pink color, pulse and blood pressure within normal limits for age, regular heart rhythm, adequate urinary output. Interventions: Increasing Cardiac Output Monitor vital signs closely, especially blood pressure (BP) and heart rate, to detect increases or decreases. Monitor cardiac rhythm via cardiac monitor to detect arrhythmias quickly. Observe for signs of hypoxia such as tachypnea, cyanosis, tachycardia, bradycardia, dizziness, and/or restlessness to identify this change early. Administer oxygen as needed to correct hypoxia. Place child in knee-to-chest or squatting position as needed to increase systemic vascular resistance. Administer antiarrhythmics, vasopressors, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta blockers, corticosteroids, or diuretics as prescribed to improve cardiac output. Monitor for signs of thrombosis such as restlessness, seizure, coma, oliguria, anuria, edema, hematuria, or paralysis to identify this condition early. Administer adequate hydration to decrease possibility of thrombosis formation. Cluster nursing care and other activities to allow adequate periods of rest. Anticipate child's needs to decrease the child's stress, thereby decreasing oxygen consumption requirement. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Excess fluid volume related to ineffective cardiac muscle function as evidenced by weight gain, edema, jugular vein distention, dyspnea, shortness of breath, abnormal breath sounds, or pulmonary congestion Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will attain appropriate fluid balance, will lose weight (fluid), edema or bloating will decrease, lung sounds will be clear, and heart sounds normal. Interventions: Encouraging Fluid Loss Weigh daily on same scale in similar amount of clothing: in children weight is the best indicator of changes in fluid status. Monitor location and extent of edema (measure abdominal girth daily if ascites is present): decrease in edema indicates positive increase in oncotic pressure. Protect edematous areas from skin breakdown: edema leads to increased risk for alterations in skin integrity. Auscultate lungs carefully to identify crackles, indicating pulmonary edema. Assess work of breathing and respiratory rate: increased work of breathing is associated with pulmonary edema. Assess heart sounds for gallop: presence of S 3 may indicate fluid overload. Maintain fluid restriction as ordered to decrease intravascular volume and workload on the heart. Strictly monitor intake and output to quickly note discrepancies and provide intervention. Provide sodium-restricted diet as ordered: restricting sodium intake allows better renal excretion of extra fluid. Administer diuretics as ordered and monitor for adverse effects. Diuretics encourage excretion of fluid and elimination of edema, reduce cardiac filling pressures, and increase renal blood flow. Adverse effects include electrolyte imbalance as well as orthostatic hypotension. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to increased energy expenditure and fatigue as evidenced by weight loss or height and weight below accepted standards Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will improve nutritional intake resulting in steady increase in weight and length/height and will feed without tiring easily. Interventions: Promoting Adequate Nutrition Determine body weight and length/height norm for age to determine goal to work toward. Assess child for food preferences that fall within dietary restrictions: child will be more likely to consume adequate amounts of foods that he or she likes. Weigh child daily or weekly (according to physician order or institutional standard) and measure length/height weekly to monitor for increased growth. Offer highest-calorie meals at the time of day when the child's appetite is the greatest to increase likelihood of increased caloric intake. Provide increased-calorie shakes or puddings within diet restriction: high-calorie foods increase weight gain. Consult with the pediatric dietician to provide optimal caloric intake within dietary restrictions. Provide small, frequent feedings to discourage tiring with feeding. Feed infants with special nipple as needed to decrease amount of energy expended for sucking. Administer vitamin and mineral supplements as prescribed to attain/maintain vitamin and mineral balance in the body. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Ineffective tissue perfusion related to inadequate cardiac function or cardiac surgery as evidenced by pallor, cyanosis, edema, changes in mental status, prolonged capillary refill, clubbing, or diminished pulses Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will demonstrate adequate tissue perfusion: child will be alert, not restless or lethargic, will have pink color, decrease in edema, normal perfusion, and strong pulses. Interventions: Promoting Tissue Perfusion Assess level of consciousness, pulse, BP, peripheral perfusion, and skin color frequently to determine baseline and ongoing improvement. Administer cardiac glycosides or vasodilators as ordered to promote cardiac output necessary for proper perfusion. Monitor pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas results to assess ability to appropriately oxygenate. Supplement oxygen as needed to provide oxygen to organs for proper functioning. Monitor hemoglobin and hematocrit to identify blood loss. Strictly assess intake and output to determine adequacy of renal perfusion. Position with head of bed elevated to decrease blood volume returning to heart. Change position every 2 to 4 hours to promote circulation and avoid skin breakdown in areas of poor perfusion. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Risk for delayed growth and development related to effects of cardiac disease and necessary treatments, inadequate nutrition, or frequent separation from caregivers secondary to illness Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will display development appropriate for age: will display evidence of cognitive and motor function within normal limits (individualized for each child). Interventions: Promoting Appropriate Development Promote adequate caloric intake to stimulate growth and provide adequate energy. Provide age-appropriate developmental activities to stimulate development. Consult with the physical or occupational therapist or child life specialist to determine activities most appropriate for the child within the constraints of the child's illness. Schedule daily activities to allow for essential rest periods for energy conservation. Encourage parents, teachers, and playmates to be sensitive to child's self-image, using positive comments, to improve the child's self-concept. As energy allows, encourage participation in all activities as feasible to allow the child to feel normal. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Risk for infection related to need for multiple invasive procedures or cardiac surgery Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will remain free from infection: vital signs will be within normal limits, white blood cell count normal, and cultures negative. Child will exhibit no signs or symptoms of infection. Interventions: Preventing Infection Maintain strict hand hygiene to prevent spread of infectious organisms to the child. Assess temperature to detect elevation early in course of infection. Avoid contact with persons with known infections to prevent risk of becoming ill. Ensure appropriate immunization, including pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations, to prevent development of common childhood illness. Administer prophylactic antibiotics prior to all dental procedures, surgery, and many invasive procedures to prevent subacute bacterial endocarditis. Encourage good dental hygiene to reduce the risk of endocarditis.NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Interrupted family processes related to crisis associated with heart disease, frequent need for testing and hospitalizations, or stresses associated with care demands, as evidenced by inadequate parental coping, frequent separations of parent and child, or inadequate support Outcome Identification and Evaluation Family will maintain functional system of support and will demonstrate adequate coping, adaptation of roles and functions, and decreased anxiety: parents are involved in child's care, ask appropriate questions, express fears and concerns, and can discuss child's care and condition calmly. Interventions: Promoting Family Processes Provide ongoing support to the child and family to help them cope. Encourage parents and family members to verbalize concerns related to child's illness, diagnosis, and prognosis: allows the nurse to identify concerns and areas where further education may be needed and demonstrates family-centered care. Allow families to grieve over the loss of a \"perfect\" child: parents must work through those grief feelings so they can be fully \"present\" for this chronically ill child. Explain therapies, procedures, child's behaviors, and plan of care to parents: understanding the child's current status and plan of care helps decrease anxiety. Encourage parents to be involved in care: allows parents to feel needed and valued and gives them a sense of control over their child's health. Identify support system for family and child: helps nurse identify needs and resources available for coping. Educate family and child on additional resources available to help them develop a wide base of support. Encourage parents to seek genetic counseling to provide them with the information required to make an informed decision about having another child. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Activity intolerance related to ineffective cardiac muscle function, increased energy expenditure, or inability to meet increased oxygen or metabolic demands as evidenced by squatting positions, shortness of breath, cyanosis, or fatigue Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will increase activity level as tolerated: child participates in play and activities (specify particular activities and level as individualized for each child). Interventions: Promoting Activity Assess level of fatigue and activity tolerance to determine baseline for comparison. Note extent of dyspnea, oxygen requirement, or color change with exertion to provide baseline for comparison. Cluster care activities, allowing rest periods in between, to conserve child's energy. Work with the parent and child to determine a mutually satisfactory daily schedule to allow adequate rest and energy conservation. Instruct family and child in prescribed activity restrictions to prevent fatigue while allowing some activity. In the infant, avoid long periods of crying or prolonged nipple feeding: expends excessive calories. Provide neutral thermal environment to avoid increased oxygen and energy needs associated with excessive heat or cold. After birth, with the change from fetal to newborn circulation, pressures within the chambers of the right side of the heart are less than those of the left side and pulmonary vascular resistance is less than that for the systemic circulation. These normal pressure gradients are necessary for adequate circulation to the lungs and the rest of the body. However, these pressure gradients become disrupted if a structure has failed to develop, a fetal structure has failed to close, or a narrowing, stenosis, or transposition of a vessel has occurred. For example, blood typically flows from an area of higher pressure to lower pressure. If the ductus arteriosus fails to close, blood will move from the aorta to the pulmonary artery, ultimately increasing right atrial pressure. With this shunting of blood, highly oxygenated blood can mix with less oxygenated blood, interfering with the amount available to the tissues via the systemic circulation. Some of the defects may result in significant hypoxemia, the sequelae of which include clubbing, polycythemia, exercise intolerance, hypercyanotic spells, brain abscess, and cerebrovascular accident (Fulton, 2008). Congenital heart defects are categorized based on hemodynamic characteristics (blood flow patterns in the heart): Disorders with decreased pulmonary blood flow: tetralogy of Fallot and tricuspid atresia disorders: transposition of (TGV), pulmonary venous return (TAPVR), truncus arteriosus, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome Therapeutic Management Prenatal education about avoiding certain substances or preventing infection is essential to promote optimal outcomes for the fetus. Encourage parents of children with CHD to receive genetic counseling because of the probability of having subsequent children with a congenital heart defect. Children with small septal defects are urged to lead a normal life and often require no medical intervention. Therapeutic management of other forms of CHD focuses on palliative care or a surgical corrective approach necessary for most of the defects. In newborns and very young infants with severe cyanosis (tricuspid atresia, TGV), a prostaglandin infusion will maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus, improving pulmonary blood flow. Definitive correction of structural disorders requires surgical intervention. Table 19.2 describes the surgical procedures used for the various congenital heart defects and the relevant nursingmeasures. Nursing management for the child with CHD will be provided following the disorders section. See Evidence-Based Practice 19.1 . Disorders With Decreased Pulmonary Blood Flow Defects involving decreased pulmonary blood flow occur when there is some obstruction of blood flow to the lungs. As a result of the obstruction, pressure in the right side of the heart increases and becomes greater than that of the left side of the heart. Blood from the higher-pressure right side of the heart then shunts to the lower-pressure left side through a structural defect. Subsequently, deoxygenated blood mixes with oxygenated blood on the left side of the heart. This mixed blood, which is low in oxygen, is pumped via the systemic circulation to the body tissues. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 19.1 EFFECTS OF CHRONIC OR INTERMITTENT HYPOXIA ON COGNITION IN CHILDREN STUDY It is well known that significant hypoxia demonstrates an adverse effect on cognition, yet little is known about the effects of chronic or intermittent hypoxia on cognition in children. Many children with congenital heart disease (CHD) suffer either chronic or intermittent hypoxia. The authors performed a systematic literature review to study this question. Fifty-five studies were included, and a significant proportion of them addressed hypoxia with CHD. Findings About 80% of the studies reported adverse effects on cognition in children who suffered chronic or intermittent hypoxia, including developmental and academic achievement. Adverse effects were noted at all childhood age levels except premature infants. The effects were noted even with mild oxygen desaturation. Nursing Implications It is critical that the developing child be afforded the opportunity to develop optimal cognition. Know the child's normal oxygen saturation so that decreases may be quickly acted upon. Use supplemental oxygen judiciously and within the physician order parameters. Since many children experience improved oxygenation after CHD repair, encourage adequate nutrition so that, in turn, the infant or child will demonstrate growth adequate for safe surgical intervention. Adapted from Bass, J. L., Corwin, M., Gozal, D., Moore, C., Nishida, H., Parker, S., et al. (2004). The effect of chronic or intermittent hypoxia on cognition in childhood: A review of the evidence. Pediatrics, 114(3), 805-816.Defects with decreased pulmonary blood flow are characterized by mild to severe oxygen desaturation. Typically, the child exhibits oxygen saturation levels ranging from 50% to 90%, which can produce severe cyanosis. To compensate for low blood oxygen levels, the kidneys produce the hormone erythropoietin to stimulate the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells (RBCs). This increase in RBCs is called polycythemia . Polycythemia can lead to an increase in blood volume and possibly blood viscosity, further taxing the workload of the heart. Although the number of RBCs increases, there is no change in the amount of blood that reaches the lungs for oxygenation. Disorders within this classification include tetralogy of Fallot a heart defect composed of four heart defects: pulmonary stenosis (a narrowing of the pulmonary valve and outflow tract, creating an obstruction of blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery), VSD, overriding aorta (enlargement of the aortic valve to the extent that it appears to arise from the right and left ventricles rather than the anatomically correct left ventricle), and right ventricular hypertrophy (the muscle walls of the right ventricle increase in size due to continued overuse as the right ventricle attempts to overcome a high-pressure gradient). Surgical intervention is usually required during the first year of life (Fulton, 2008; Miyamoto, Sondheimer, Fagan, & Collins, 2011). Pathophysiology With pulmonary stenosis, the blood flow from the right ventricle is obstructed and slowed, resulting in a decrease in blood flow to the lungs for oxygenation and a decrease in the amount of oxygenated blood returning to the left atrium from the lungs. The obstructed flow also increases the pressure in the right ventricle. This blood, which is poorly oxygenated, is then shunted across the VSD into the left atrium. Poorly oxygenated blood also travels through the overriding aorta (if it extends to both ventricles). In some cases when theVSD is large, the pressure in the right ventricle may be equal to that of the left ventricle. In this case, the path of blood shunting depends on which circulation is exerting the higher pressure, pulmonary or systemic. Regardless of which way shunting occurs, a mixing of oxygenated and poorly oxygenated blood occurs, with this blood ultimately being pumped into the systemic circulation. The oxygen saturation of the blood in the systemic circulation is reduced, leading to cyanosis. The degree of cyanosis depends on the extent of the pulmonary stenosis, the size of the VSD, and the vascular resistance of the pulmonary and systemic circulations. Tetralogy of Fallot is usually diagnosed during the first weeks of life due to the presence of a murmur and/or cyanosis. Some newborns may be acutely cyanotic, while others may exhibit only mild cyanosis that gradually becomes more severe, particularly during times of stress as the child grows older. Most often, infants with tetralogy of Fallot have a PDA at birth, providing additional pulmonary blood flow and thereby decreasing the severity of the initial cyanosis. Later, as the ductus arteriosus closes, such as within the first days of life, more severe cyanosis can occur ( Fig. 19.2 ) (Fulton, 2008; Miyamoto et al., 2011). Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment consists of the health history, physical examination, and laboratory and diagnostic tests. Health History and Physical Examination Obtain the health history, noting a history of color changes associated with feeding, activity, or crying. Determine if the infant or child is demonstrating hypercyanotic spells. Hypercyanosis develops suddenly and is manifested as increased cyanosis, hypoxemia, dyspnea, and agitation. If the infant's oxygen demand is greater than the supply, such as with crying or during feeding, then the spell progresses to anoxia. When the degree of cyanosis is severe and persistent, the infant may become unresponsive. As the infant gets older, he or she may use specific postures, such as bending at the knees or assuming the fetal position, to relieve a hypercyanotic spell. The walking infant or toddler may squat periodically. These positions improve pulmonary blood flow by increasing systemic vascular resistance. Ask the parents if they have noticed any of these unusual positions. Note history of irritability, sleepiness, or difficulty breathing. During the physical examination, observe the skin color and note any evidence of cyanosis. Also observe for changes in skin color with positional changes, and inspect the fingers for clubbing. Note if the child has a hypercyanotic spell during the assessment. Count the child's respiratory rate and observe work of breathing, noting retractions, shortness of breath, or noisy breathing. Document oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry; it will likely be decreased. Auscultate the chest for adventitious breath sounds, which may suggest the development of heart failure. Auscultate the heart, noting a loud, harsh murmur characteristic of this disorder.FIGURE 19.2 Tetralogy of Fallot. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Note increased hematocrit, hemoglobin, and RBC count associated with polycythemia. Additional testing may include: Echocardiography (ultrasound study of structure and motion of heart), possibly revealing right ventricular hypertrophy, decreased pulmonary blood flow, and reduced size of the pulmonary artery Electrocardiogram (ECG), indicating right ventricular hypertrophy Cardiac catheterization and angiography, which reveal the extent of the structural defects Consider This! A va Gardener, 2 weeks old, is brought to the clinic by her mother. She presents with trouble feeding. Her mother states, \"When Ava eats, she seems to have trouble breathing, and recently I've noticed a bluish color around her lips.\" What other assessment information would you obtain? Ava is to be admitted to the hospital secondary to suspected tetralogy of Fallot. What education and interventions may be necessary for this child and family? How can you assist the family to cope? Tricuspid Atresia Tricuspid atresia is a congenital heart defect in which the valve between the right atrium and right ventricle fails to develop. As a result, there is no opening to allow blood to flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle and subsequently through the pulmonary artery into the lungs (Fulton, 2008; Miyamoto et al., 2011).Pathophysiology In tricuspid atresia, blood returning from the systemic circulation to the right atrium cannot directly enter the right ventricle due to agenesis of the tricuspid valve. Subsequently, deoxygenated blood then passes through an opening in the atrial septum (either an ASD or through a patent foramen ovale) into the left atrium, never entering the pulmonary vasculature. Thus, deoxygenated blood mixes with oxygenated blood in the left atrium. The blood then travels to the lungs through a PDA. The foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus must remain open for the newborn to maintain minimally adequate oxygenation ( Fig. 19.3 ) (Fulton, 2008; Miyamoto et al., 2011). FIGURE 19.3 Tricuspid atresia. Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment consists of the health history, physical examination, and laboratory and diagnostic tests. Health History and Physical Examination Note the infant's history since birth. Document history of cyanosis either at birth or a few days later when the ductus arteriosus closed. Note history of rapid respirations and difficulty with feeding. Inspect the skin for cyanosis or a pale gray color. Observe the apical impulse, noting overactivity. Evaluate the baby's sucking strength (will usually have a weak or poor suck). Count the respiratory rate, noting tachypnea. Note increased work of breathing. Auscultate the lungs, noting crackles or wheezes if heart failure is beginning to develop. Auscultate the heart, noting a murmur. Palpate the skin, noting coolness and clamminess of the extremities. Document the presence of clubbing in the older infant or child. Laboratory and Diagnostic TestingLaboratory and diagnostic testing is similar to that for tetralogy of Fallot. A complete blood cell (CBC) count is needed to assess compensatory increases in hematocrit, hemoglobin, and erythrocyte count (RBC) indicating the development of polycythemia. Pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas tests may be used to determine oxygen saturation levels (typically reduced). Additional testing may include: Echocardiography, revealing absence of tricuspid valve or underdeveloped right ventricle ECG, indicating possible heart failure Cardiac catheterization and angiography, which reveal the extent of the structural defects Disorders With Increased Pulmonary Flow Most congenital heart defects involve increased pulmonary blood flow. Normally, the left side of the heart has a higher pressure than the right side. Defects with connections involving the left and right sides will shunt blood from the higher-pressure left side to the lower-pressure right side. Even a small pressure gradient such as a 1- to 3-mm difference between the left and right sides will produce a movement of blood from the left to the right. In turn, the increase of blood on the right side of the heart will cause a greater amount of blood to move through the heart. If the amount of blood flowing to the lungs is large, the child may develop heart failure early in life. In addition, right ventricular hypertrophy may result. Sometimes with ventricular hypertrophy the right side of the heart pumps so forcefully that left-to-right shunting is reversed to right-to-left shunting. If this occurs, deoxygenated blood mixes with oxygenated blood, thereby lowering the overall blood oxygen saturation level. Excessive blood flow to the lungs can produce a compensatory response such as tachypnea or tachycardia. Tachypnea increases caloric expenditure; poor cellular nutrition from decreased peripheral blood flow leads to feeding problems. Subsequently, the infant experiences poor weight gain, which retards overall growth and development. Increased pulmonary blood flow results in decreased systemic blood flow, so sodium and fluid retention may occur. Increased pulmonary blood flow also places the child at higher risk for pulmonary infections. As the child grows, the continuous increased pulmonary blood flow will cause vasoconstriction of the pulmonary vessels, actually decreasing the pulmonary blood flow. This may lead to pulmonary hypertension. For children with congenital defects with increased pulmonary blood flow, oxygen supplementation is not helpful. Oxygen acts as a pulmonary vasodilator. If pulmonary dilation occurs, pulmonary blood flow is even greater, causing tachypnea, increasing lung fluid retention, and eventually causing a much greater problem with oxygenation. Over time, continuous increased pulmonary blood flow may cause pulmonary vasoconstriction and pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, preventing the development of pulmonary disease via early surgical correction is essential. Examples of defects with increased pulmonary blood flow are ASD, VSD, atrioventricular canal defect, and PDA.FIGURE 19.4 Atrial opening between the two atria. Atrial Septal Defect An ASD is a passageway or hole in the wall (septum) that divides the right atrium from the left atrium ( Fig. 19.4 ). Three types of ASDs are identified based on the location of the opening: Ostium primum (ASD1): the opening is at the lower portion of the septum. Ostium secundum (ASD2): the opening is near the center of the septum. Sinus venosus defect: the opening is near the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium. When the ASD is small, as many as 80% of infants may have a spontaneous closure within the first 18 months of life. If it does not spontaneously close by age 3, the child will most likely need corrective surgery (Fulton, 2008; Miyamoto et al., 2011). Pathophysiology With ASD, blood flows through the opening from the left atrium to the right atrium due to pressure differences. The shunting increases the blood volume entering the right atrium. This, in turn, leads to increased blood flow into the lungs. If untreated, the defect can cause problems such as pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, atrial arrhythmias, or stroke (Fulton, 2008; Miyamoto et al., 2011). Nursing Assessment Most children with ASDs are asymptomatic. However, a very large defect can cause increased blood flow, leading to heart failure, which results in shortness of breath, easy fatigability, or poor growth.Health History and Physical Examination Obtain the health history, noting poor feeding as an infant, decreased ability to keep up with peers, or history of difficulty growing. Observe the child's chest, noting a hyperdynamic precordium. Auscultate the heart, noting a fixed split second heart sound and a systolic ejection murmur, best heard in the pulmonic valve area. Palpate along the left sternal border for a right ventricular heave. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Echocardiography is done to confirm the diagnosis. An electrocardiogram (graphic recording of the heart's electrical activity) may show normal sinus rhythm or prolonged PR intervals. The chest radiograph may show enlargement of the heart and increased vascularity of the lungs. Ventricular Septal Defect A VSD is an opening between the right and left ventricular chambers of the heart ( Fig. 19.5 ). It is one of the most common congenital heart defects, with a prevalence of 1.5 to 2.5 per 1,000 live births. VSD accounts for 30% of all congenital heart defects. Spontaneous closure of small VSDs occurs in about half of children by age 2 years. Long-term outcomes for surgically repaired VSDs are good. Repair of larger defects by 2 years of age is recommended to prevent the development of pulmonary disease (Fulton, 2008; Miyamoto et al., 2011). Pathophysiology In VSD, there is an abnormal opening between the right and left ventricles. The opening varies in size, from as small as a pinhole to a complete opening between the ventricles so that the right and left sides are as one. Children with small VSDs may remain asymptomatic. In other children, blood shunts across the opening in the septum. Pulmonary vascular resistance and systemic vascular resistance determine the direction of blood flow. A left-to-right shunt results when pulmonary vascular resistance is low. Increased amounts of blood flowing into the right ventricle are then pumped to the pulmonary circulation, eventually causing an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. Increased pulmonary vascular resistance leads to increased pulmonary artery pressure (pulmonary hypertension) and right ventricular hypertrophy. When the pulmonary vascular resistance exceeds the systemic vascular resistance, right-to-left shunting of blood across the VSD occurs, resulting in Eisenmenger syndrome (pulmonary hypertension and cyanosis). Heart failure commonly occurs in children with moderate to severe unrepaired VSDs. Children with VSDs are also at risk for the development of aortic valve regurgitation as well as infective 2011).FIGURE defect; note the opening between the ventricles. Nursing Assessment Initially, the newborn may not exhibit any signs and symptoms at birth because left-to-right shunting is most likely minimal due to the high pulmonary resistance common after birth. Health History and Physical Examination Determine the health history, which commonly reveals signs of heart failure around 4 to 8 weeks of age. Note history of tiring easily, particularly with exertion or feeding. Document the child's growth history, noting difficulty thriving. Ask the parent about color change or diaphoresis with nipple feeding in the infant. Note history of frequent pulmonary infections, shortness of breath, and possibly edema. Inspect the extremities for edema, noting whether pitting is present. Note mild tachypnea. Auscultate the heart, noting a characteristic holosystolic harsh murmur along the left sternal border. In some instances, a murmur may be noted only with excessive blood flow across the opening. Adventitious lung sounds may be auscultated if the child is experiencing heart failure. Palpate the chest for a thrill. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or echocardiogram with color flow Doppler may reveal the opening as well as the extent of left- to-right shunting. These studies also may identify right ventricular hypertrophy and dilation of the pulmonary artery resulting from the increased blood flow. Cardiac catheterization may be used to evaluate the extent of blood flow being pumped to the pulmonary circulation and to evaluate hemodynamic pressures.Atrioventricular Canal Defect Atrioventricular canal defect (atrioventricular septal defect [AVSD], AV canal, or endocardial cushion defect) accounts for 4% of congenital heart disease. Thirty-five to 40% of children with Down syndrome and CHD have this defect (Fulton, 2008; Miyamoto et al., 2011). Pathophysiology AV canal defect occurs as a result of failure of the endocardial cushions to fuse ( Fig. 19.6 ). These cushions are needed to separate the central parts of the heart near the tricuspid and mitral (AV) valves. The complete AV canal defect involves atrial and ventricular septal defects as well as a common AV orifice and a common AV valve. Partial and transitional forms of AV canal defect also occur, involving variations of the complete form. The complete AV canal defect permits oxygenated blood from the lungs to enter the left atrium and ventricle, crossing over the atrial or ventricular septum and returning to the lungs via the pulmonary artery. This recirculation problem, which typically involves a left-to-right shunt, is inefficient because the left ventricle must pump blood back to the lungs and also meet the body's peripheral demand for oxygenated blood. Subsequently, the left ventricle must pump two to three times more blood than in a normal heart. Therefore, this specific type of cardiac defect causes a large left-to-right shunt; an increased workload of the left ventricle; and high pulmonary arterial pressure, resulting in an increased amount of blood in the lungs and causing pulmonary edema (Fulton, 2008; Miyamoto et al., 2011). Nursing Assessment The infant with a complete AV canal defect commonly exhibits moderate to severe signs and symptoms of heart failure. However, for infants with partial or transitional AV canal defects, the signs and symptoms will be subtler. FIGURE 19.6 Atrioventricular canal defect. Health History and Physical Examination Obtain the health history, noting frequent respiratory infections and difficulty gaining weight. Ask the parent if the infant has been experiencing difficulty feeding or increased work of breathing. Inspect the skin, fingernails, and lips for cyanosis. Observe for retractions, tachypnea, and nasal flaring. Auscultate the lungs and heart, noting rales and a loud murmur. The murmur is commonly noted within the first 2 weeks of life. Infants with partial or transitional AV canal defects may display more subtle signs. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Echocardiography will reveal the extent of the defect and shunting as well as right ventricular hypertrophy. Electrocardiogram may indicate right ventricular hypertrophy and possible first-degree heart block due to impulse blocking before reaching the AV node. Patent Ductus Arteriosus PDA is failure of the ductus arteriosus, a fetal circulatory structure, to close within the first weeks of life ( Fig. 19.7 ). As a result, there is a connection between the aorta and pulmonary artery. PDA is the second most common congenital heart defect and accounts for 10% of CHD cases. PDA occurs much more frequently in premature than in term infants and in infants born at high altitudes compared with those born at sea level. Infants with other CHDs that result in right-to-left shunting of blood and cyanosis may additionally display a PDA. In these infants, the PDA allows for some level of oxygenated blood to reach the systemic circulation (Fulton, 2008; Miyamoto et al., 2011). FIGURE 19.7 Patent ductus arteriosus. Pathophysiology Failure of the ductus arteriosus to close leads to continued blood flow from the aorta to the pulmonary artery. Blood returning to the left atrium passes to the left ventricle, enters the aorta, and then travels to the pulmonary artery via the PDA instead of entering the systemic circulation. This altered blood flow pattern increases the workload of the left side of the heart. Pulmonary vascular congestion occurs, causing an increase in pressure. Right ventricular pressure increases in an attempt to overcome this increase in pulmonary pressure. Eventually, right ventricular hypertrophy occurs (Fulton, 2008; Miyamoto et al., 2011). Nursing Assessment The symptoms of PDA depend on the size of the ductus arteriosus and the amount of blood flow it carries. If it is small, the infant may be asymptomatic. Some infants demonstrate signs and symptoms of heart failure. Health History and Physical Examination Determine the health history, which may reveal frequent respiratory infections, fatigue, and poor growth and development. On physical examination, note tachycardia, tachypnea, bounding peripheral pulses, and a widened pulse pressure. The diastolic blood pressure typically is low due to the shunting. Auscultate the lungs and heart, noting rales if heart failure is present. Note a harsh, continuous, machine-like murmur, usually loudest under the left clavicle at the first and second intercostal spaces. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Echocardiogram reveals the extent of the defective opening and confirms the diagnosis. Electrocardiogram may be normal or it may indicate ventricular hypertrophy, especially if the defect is large. Chest radiography demonstrates cardiomegaly. Obstructive Disorders Another group of congenital heart defects is classified as obstructive disorders. These disorders involve some type of narrowing of a major vessel, interfering with the ability of the blood to flow freely through the vessel. As a result, peripheral circulation or blood flow to the lungs is affected. Increased pressure backing up toward the heart causes an increased workload on the heart. Examples of defects in this group include coarctation of the aorta, the aorta is narrowing of the aorta, the major blood vessel carrying highly oxygenated blood from the left ventricle of the heart to the rest of the body ( Fig. 19.8 ). It accounts for 6% of congenital heart defects and occurs three times more often in males than in females (Fulton, 2008; Miyamoto et al., 2011). Pathophysiology Coarctation of the aorta occurs most often in the area near the ductus arteriosus. The narrowing can be preductal (between the subclavian and ductus arteriosus) or postductal (after the ductus arteriosus). As a result of the narrowing, blood flow is impeded, causing pressure to increase in the area proximal to the defect and to decrease in the area distal to it. Thus, blood pressure is increased in the heart and upper portions of the body and decreased in the lower portions of the body. Left ventricular afterload is increased, and in some children this may lead to heart failure. Collateral circulation also may develop as the body attempts to ensure adequate blood flow to the descending aorta. Due to the elevation in blood pressure, the child is also at risk for aortic rupture, aortic aneurysm, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) (Fulton, et al., 2011).FIGURE 19.8 Coarctation of the aorta. Nursing Assessment The extent of the symptoms depends on the severity of the coarctation. Some children with coarctation of the aorta grow well into the school-age years before the defect is discovered. Health History and Physical Examination Determine the health history, noting problems with irritability and frequent epistaxis. In older children, there also may be reports of leg pain with activity, dizziness, fainting, and headaches. Assess pulses throughout, noting full, bounding pulses in the upper extremities with weak or absent pulses in the lower extremities. Determine BP in all four extremities. BP in the upper extremities may be 20 mm Hg or higher than that in the lower extremities. Inspect the school-age child's chest, noting notching of the ribs. Auscultate the heart for a soft or moderately loud systolic murmur, most often heard at the base of the heart. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta is based primarily on the history and physical examination. In addition, an echocardiogram may disclose the extent of narrowing and evidence of collateral circulation. Chest radiography may reveal left-sided cardiac enlargement and rib notching indicative of collateral arterial enlargement. Other tests, such as electrocardiogram, computed tomography, or MRI, may be done to provide additional evidence about the extent of the coarctation and subsequent effects. Aortic Stenosis Aortic stenosis is a condition causing obstruction of the blood flow between the left ventricle and the aorta. The occurrence of aorticstenosis is 4 per 1,000 live births, with 75% of cases occurring in males (Balentine & Lombardi, 2010). Pathophysiology Aortic stenosis can be caused by a muscle obstruction below the aortic valve, an obstruction at the valve itself, or an aortic narrowing just above the valve ( Fig. 19.9 ). The most common type is an obstruction of the valve itself, called aortic valve stenosis. The aortic valve consists of three very pliable leaflets. Normally the leaflets of the aortic valve spread open easily when the left ventricle ejects blood into the aorta. Aortic stenosis occurs when the aortic valve narrows, causing an obstruction between the left ventricle and the aorta. As a result, cardiac output decreases. When the aortic valve does not function properly, the left ventricle must work harder to pump blood into the aorta. Because of the increased workload, the left ventricular muscle hypertrophies. If this continues, left ventricular failure can occur, leading to a backup of pressure in the pulmonary circulation and pulmonary edema. Heart failure may occur, but this is more commonly seen in the infant (Balentine & Lombardi, 2010; Fulton, 2008). FIGURE 19.9 Aortic stenosis. Nursing Assessment Typically, the child with aortic stenosis is asymptomatic. However, it is important to obtain an accurate health history and perform a physical examination. Health History and Physical Examination Obtain the child's health history, noting easy fatigability or complaints of chest pain similar to anginal pain when active. Dizziness with prolonged standing also may be reported. In the infant, note difficulty with feeding. Palpate the child's pulse; if aortic stenosis is severe, the pulses may be faint. Palpate the child's chest, noting a thrill at the base of the heart. Auscultate the heart, noting a systolic murmurbest heard along the left sternal border with radiation to the right upper sternal border. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests The echocardiogram is the most important noninvasive test to identify aortic stenosis. An electrocardiogram may be normal in children with mild to moderate forms of aortic stenosis. For children with severe aortic stenosis, left ventricular hypertrophy may be determined from the electrocardiogram. For children experiencing easy fatigability and chest pain, an exercise stress test may be done to evaluate the degree of cardiac compromise. Pulmonary Stenosis Pulmonary stenosis is a condition that causes an obstruction in blood flow between the right ventricle and the pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary stenosis occurs in 8% to 12% of all cases of CHD (Rao & Pflieger, 2010). It is often associated with other heart anomalies and with genetic syndromes. Children may be asymptomatic, although some children with severe stenosis may exhibit dyspnea and fatigue with exertion (demonstrating hypercyanotic spells similar to those in children with tetralogy of Fallot) (Rao & Pflieger, 2010). Pathophysiology Pulmonary stenosis may occur as a muscular obstruction below the pulmonary valve, an obstruction at the valve, or a narrowing of the pulmonary artery above the valve ( Fig. 19.10 ). Valve obstruction is the most common form of pulmonary stenosis. Normally the pulmonary valve is constructed with three thin and pliable valve leaflets; they spread apart easily, allowing the right ventricle to eject blood freely into the pulmonary artery. The most common problem causing pulmonary stenosis is that the pulmonary valve leaflets are thickened and fused together along their separation lines, causing the obstruction to blood flow. The right ventricle has an additional workload, causing the muscle to thicken, resulting in right ventricular hypertrophy and decreased pulmonary blood flow. When the pulmonary valve is severely obstructed, the right ventricle cannot eject sufficient blood into the pulmonary artery. As a result, pressure in the right atrium increases, which could lead to a reopening of the foramen ovale. If this occurs, deoxygenated blood would pass through the foramen ovale into the left side of the heart and would then be pumped to the systemic circulation. In some cases, a PDA may be present, thus allowing for some compensation by shunting blood from the aorta to the pulmonary circulation for (Fulton, 2008; Rao & Pflieger, 2010).FIGURE 19.10 Pulmonary stenosis. Assessment The child with pulmonary stenosis may be asymptomatic or may exhibit signs and symptoms of mild heart failure. If the stenosis is severe, the child may demonstrate cyanosis. Therefore, it is important for the nurse to obtain an accurate health history and physical examination. Health History and Physical Examination Elicit the health history, noting mild dyspnea or cyanosis with exertion. Document the child's growth history, which is typically normal. Carefully palpate the sternal border for a thrill (not always present). Auscultate the heart, noting a high-pitched click following the second heart sound and a systolic ejection murmur loudest at the upper left sternal border. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests An echocardiogram reveals the extent of obstruction present at the valve, as well as right ventricular hypertrophy. An electrocardiogram also helps to detect right ventricular hypertrophy. Mixed Defects Mixed defects are congenital heart defects that involve a mixing of well-oxygenated blood with poorly oxygenated blood. As a result, systemic blood flow contains a lower oxygen content. Cardiac output is decreased, and heart failure occurs. Examples of mixed defects include transposition of the great vessels, total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, truncus arteriosus, and hypoplasticleft heart syndrome. Transposition of the Great Vessels (Arteries) Transposition of the great vessels (TGV) is a congenital heart defect in which the pulmonary artery and the aorta are transposed from their normal positions. The aorta arises from the right ventricle instead of the left ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle instead of the right ventricle. Transposition of the great vessels accounts for approximately 5% of all CHD cases (Fulton, 2008; Miyamoto et al., 2011). It is most often diagnosed in the first few days of life when the child manifests cyanosis, which indicates decreased oxygenation. As the ductus arteriosus closes, the symptoms will worsen. Corrective surgery is usually performed by age 4 to 7 days. Pathophysiology TGV creates a situation in which poorly oxygenated blood returning to the right atrium and ventricle is then pumped out to the aorta and back to the body ( Fig. 19.11 ). Oxygenated blood returning from the lungs to the left atrium and ventricle is then sent back to the lungs through the pulmonary artery. Unless there is a connection somewhere in the circulation where the oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood can mix, all the organs of the body will be poorly oxygenated. Often the ductus arteriosus remains patent, allowing for some mixing of blood. Similarly, if a VSD is also present, mixing of blood may occur and cyanosis will be delayed. However, these associated defects can lead to increased pulmonary blood flow that increases pressure in the pulmonary circulation. This predisposes the child to heart failure (Fulton, 2008; Miyamoto et al., 2011). FIGURE 19.11 Transposition of the great vessels. Nursing AssessmentSignificant cyanosis without a murmur in the newborn period is highly indicative of TGV. In some infants, cyanosis will not develop until several days of age as the PDA closes. In infants with septal defects, cyanosis may be further delayed. Health History and Physical Examination Elicit the health history, noting onset of cyanosis with feeding or crying. Observe the infant for cyanosis while active and at rest. Observe the chest, noting a prominent ventricular impulse. Auscultate the heart, noting a loud second heart sound. A murmur may be heard if the ductus remains open or a septal defect is present. If heart failure is present, note edema, tachypnea, and adventitious lung sounds. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Echocardiography clearly reveals evidence of the transposition. Cardiac catheterization may be performed to determine whether oxygen saturation levels are low due to the mixing of the blood. Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) is a congenital heart defect in which the pulmonary veins do not connect normally to the left atrium. Instead, they connect to the right atrium, often by way of the superior vena cava. Relatively rare, it occurs in about 1 in 17,000 live births (Fulton, 2008). Pathophysiology Oxygenated blood that would normally enter the left atrium now enters the right atrium and passes to the right ventricle. As a result, the pressure on the right side of the heart increases, leading to hypertrophy. TAPVC is incompatible with life unless there is an associated defect present that allows for shunting of blood from the highly pressured right side of the heart. A patent foramen ovale or an ASD is usually present. Since none of the pulmonary veins connect normally to the left atrium, the only source of blood to the left atrium is blood that is shunted from the right atrium across the defect to the left side of the heart ( Fig. 19.12 ). The highly oxygenated blood from the lungs completely mixes with the poorly oxygenated blood returning from the systemic circulation. This causes an overload of the right atrium and right ventricle. The increased blood volume going into the lungs can lead to pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary edema (Fulton, 2008; Miyamoto et al., 2011).FIGURE 19.12 Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection. Nursing Assessment The degree of cyanosis present with TAPVC depends on the extent of the associated defects. For example, if the foramen ovale closes or the ASD is small, significant cyanosis will be present. The physical examination findings will vary depending on the type of TAPVC the infant has, whether obstruction is present, and whether other associated cardiac anomalies are present. Health History and Physical Examination Note history of cyanosis, tiring easily, and difficulty feeding. Observe the chest for prominence of the right ventricular impulse and retractions with tachypnea. Auscultate the heart, noting fixed splitting of the second heart sound and a murmur. Palpate the abdomen for hepatomegaly. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests An echocardiogram will reveal the abnormal connection of the pulmonary veins, enlargement of the right atrium and right ventricle, and an ASD if present. The chest radiograph will demonstrate an enlarged heart and pulmonary edema. Cardiac catheterization can also be useful to visualize the abnormal connection of the pulmonary veins, particularly if an obstruction is present. Truncus Arteriosus Truncus arteriosus is a congenital heart defect in which only one major artery leaves the heart and supplies blood to the pulmonary and systemic circulations. It affects males and females equally and accounts for about 1% all CHD cases (Miyamoto et al., 2011). AVSD may also be present. Pathophysiology The one great vessel contains one valve. This valve consists of two to five leaflets and is positioned over both the left and right ventricles ( Fig. 19.13 ). Due to the location of the valve, blood from the left ventricle mixes with blood from the right ventricle. Pressure in the pulmonary circulation typically is less than that of the systemic circulation, leading to increased blood flow to the lungs. As a result, systemic blood flow is decreased. Over time, the increased pulmonary blood flow can lead to pulmonary vascular disease (Fulton, 2008; Miyamoto et al., 2011). Nursing Assessment Typically, the infant demonstrates cyanosis in varying degrees, depending on the extent of compromise in the systemic circulation. Obtain an accurate health history and perform a physical examination. FIGURE 19.13 Truncus arteriosus. Health History and Physical Examination Elicit the health history, noting history of cyanosis that increases with periods of activity such as feeding. Also note history of tiring easily, difficulty in feeding, and poor growth. Count the respiratory rate, which may be elevated. Observe for nasal flaring, grunting or noisy breathing, retractions, and restlessness. Auscultate the lungs, noting adventitious breath sounds, and the heart, noting a murmur associated with a VSD. Laboratory and Diagnostic TestsAn echocardiogram will confirm the presence of truncus arteriosus as the anatomy of the great vessels, the single truncal valve, and the VSD will be seen. On rare occasions a cardiac catheterization may be done to determine pressures in the pulmonary arteries. Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a congenital heart defect in which all of the structures on the left side of the heart are severely underdeveloped ( Fig. 19.14 ). The mitral and aortic valves are completely closed or very small. The left ventricle is nonfunctional. Thus, the left side of the heart is completely unable to supply blood to the systemic circulation. HLHS is the fourth most common congenital heart defect. It appears to have a multifactorial and autosomal recessive inheritance pattern and occurs in up to 4% of cases of CHD (Miyamoto et al., 2011). The options for treatment include palliative care, cardiac transplantation within the first few weeks of life, or palliative reconstructive surgery consisting of three stages, beginning within days to weeks of birth. FIGURE 19.14 Hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Pathophysiology With HLHS, the right side of the heart is the main working part of the heart. Blood returning from the lungs into the left atrium must pass through an ASD to the right side of the heart. The right ventricle must then pump blood to the lungs and also to the systemic circulation through the PDA. A few days after birth, when the ductus arteriosus closes, the heart cannot pump blood into the systemic circulation, causing poor perfusion of the vital organs and shock. Death will occur rapidly without intervention (Fulton, 2008; Miyamoto et al., 2011). Nursing AssessmentInitially after birth, the newborn may be asymptomatic because the ductus arteriosus is still patent. However, as the ductus begins to close at a few days of age, the newborn will begin to exhibit cyanosis. Some infants may present with circulatory collapse (shock) and must be resuscitated emergently. Health History and Physical Examination Obtain the health history, noting onset of cyanosis. Note poor feeding and history of tiring easily. Evaluate the vital signs, noting tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypothermia. Observe for increased work of breathing and gradually increasing cyanosis. Note pallor of the extremities and decreased oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry. Auscultate the heart and lungs. Note adventitious breath sounds, a gallop rhythm, a single second heart sound, and a soft systolic ejection or holosystolic murmur. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Prenatally, a fetal echocardiogram can diagnose this syndrome, as can a maternal ultrasound. After birth, the echocardiogram illustrates the defect. Nursing Management of the Child With Congenital Heart Disease The child with a congenital heart defect has multiple needs and requires comprehensive, multidisciplinary care. Nurses play a key role in helping the child and family during this intensely stressful time. Nursing care focuses on improving oxygenation, promoting adequate nutrition, assisting the child and family with coping, providing postoperative nursing care, preventing infection, and providing child and family education. An important component of education involves preparing the child and parents for discharge. In addition to the nursing management presented below, refer to Nursing Care Plan 19.1 for additional interventions appropriate for the child with CHD. Individualize nursing care specific to the child's needs. Improving Oxygenation Due to the hemodynamic changes accompanying the underlying structural defect, oxygenation is key. Provide frequent ongoing assessment of the child's cardiopulmonary status. Assess airway patency and suction as needed. Position the child in the Fowler or semi-Fowler position to facilitate lung expansion. Monitor vital signs, especially heart and respiratory rates. Monitor the child's color and oxygen saturation levels closely, using these to guide oxygen administration. Observe for tachypnea and other signs of respiratory distress, such as nasal flaring, grunting, and retractions. Auscultate the lungs for adventitious sounds. Provide humidified supplemental oxygen as ordered, warming it to prevent wide temperature fluctuations. Anticipate the need for assisted ventilation if the child has difficulty maintaining the airway or experiences deterioration in oxygenation capacity. Box 19.1 lists interventions related to relief of hypercyanotic spells. BOX 19.1 RELIEVING HYPERCYANOTIC SPELLS Use a calm, comforting approach. Place the infant or child in a knee-to-chest position. Provide supplemental oxygen. Administer morphine sulfate (0.1 mg/kg IV, IM, or SQ). Supply IV fluids. Administer propranolol (0.1 mg/kg IV). IM, intramuscularly; SQ, subcutaneously. Adapted from Kargar, M. (2009). Hypercyanotic spells tet spells and nursing care. Retrieved March 4, 2011, from http://www.icrj.ir/iacc/arts%5C391.pdf Promoting Adequate Nutrition Adequate nutrition is critical to foster growth and development as well as to reduce the risk for infection. Children with congenital heart defects typically have increased nutritional needs due to the increased energy expenditure associated with increased cardiac and respiratory workloads. In addition, many of the defects lead to heart failure, which may affect the child's fluid balance status, further increasing the child's energy expenditure. Nutrition may be provided orally, enterally, or parenterally. For example, for the newborn or infant, nutrition via breast milk orformula may be provided orally or via gavage feedings. Breastfeeding is usually associated with decreased energy expenditure during the act of feeding, yet some infants in intensive care are not stable enough to breastfeed. Gavage with breast milk is possible, and the use of human milk fortifier (either with breastfeeding or added to the gavage feed) adds additional calories that the infant requires. Formula-fed infants may also require increased-calorie formula, which may be achieved by more concentrated mixing of the formula or through the use of additives such as Polycose or vegetable oil. Consult the nutritionist to determine the individual infant's caloric needs and prescription of appropriate feeding. Cutting a large hole in the nipple or \"cross-cutting\" the nipple decreases the work of feeding for some infants. Generally, nipple feedings should be limited to a 20-minute duration, as feeding for longer periods results in excess caloric expenditure. Many infants may feed orally for 20 minutes, receiving the remainder of that feeding via orogastric or nasogastric tube. Offer older children small, frequent feedings to reduce the amount of energy required to feed or eat and to prevent overtiring the child. When needed, administer and monitor total parenteral nutrition as prescribed. Take Note! Breastfeeding a child before and after cardiac surgery may boost the infant's immune system, which can help fight postoperative infection. If breastfeeding is not possible, mothers can pump milk and the breast milk may be given via bottle, dropper, or gavage feeding. Assisting the Child and Family to Cope The diagnosis of CHD is especially overwhelming for the child and the parents. The numerous examinations, diagnostic tests, and procedures are sources of stress for the infant or child regardless of age and for the parents. The parents may fear long-term disability or death or may worry that allowing the child to engage in any activity will worsen his or her status. Thus, the parents may tend to overprotect the child. It is important for the parents to continue parenting the child, even when the child requires extended hospitalizations or intensive care. Explain all that is happening with the child, using language the parents and child can understand. Allow the parents and child to voice their feelings, concerns, or questions. Provide ample time to address these questions and concerns. Encourage the parents and the child, as developmentally appropriate, to participate in the child's care. If the child is a newborn or infant, encourage attachment and bonding. Emphasize the child's positive attributes, including the normal aspects of the infant. Help the parents to experience the joy of a new infant and see the beauty of the child, no matter how ill the infant is. Urge the parents to touch, stroke, pat, and talk to the infant. Encourage them to hold the infant close, using kangaroo care as appropriate. If the child is older, offer suggestions as to how the parents can meet the child's emotional needs. For example, encourage them to bring a favorite toy or object from home while the child is hospitalized. Provide developmentally appropriate explanations to the child. Encourage play therapy to help the child understand what is happening. Preventing Infection Teach parents proper hand hygiene. Provide appropriate dental care. Make sure the child receives prophylaxis for infective endocarditis as needed. Ensure that children 24 months or younger who have hemodynamically significant heart defects receive respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis as recommended during RSV season (Sorce, 2009). Providing Care for the Child Undergoing Cardiac Surgery Cardiac surgery may be necessary to correct a congenital defect or to provide symptomatic relief. The surgery may be planned as an elective procedure or done as an emergency. Open heart surgery involves an incision of the heart muscle to repair the internal structures. This may require cardiopulmonary bypass. Closed heart surgery involves structures related to the heart but not the heart muscle itself and may be performed with or without cardiopulmonary bypass. PROVIDING PREOPERATIVE CARE The preoperative nursing assessment complements the history and physical examination and provides important baseline information for comparison during the postoperative period. Establish a relationship with the child and parents. Identify problems that may require particular nursing interventions during the postoperative period. Before cardiac surgery, interview the parents and, if age appropriate, the child. Focus the interview on the history of the present illness, cardiac risk factors, the child's present physical and functional status, additional medical problems, current medications and drug allergies, the child's and family's understanding of the illness and planned procedure, and the family support system. The preoperative physical assessment includes: Temperature and weight measurements Examination of extremities for peripheral edema, clubbing, and evaluation of peripheral pulses Auscultation of the heart (rate, rhythm, heart sounds, murmurs, clicks, and rubs) Respiratory assessment, including respiratory rate, work of breathing, and auscultation of the lungs for breath sounds Obtain any necessary laboratory and diagnostic tests to establish a baseline. In addition, review the results of any tests done previously. Testing may include CBC count, electrolyte levels, clotting studies, urinalysis, cultures of blood and other body secretions, renal and hepatic function tests, chest radiography, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and cardiac catheterization. In most nonemergent cases, preoperative assessment is performed in an outpatient setting and the child is admitted to the hospital on the day of surgery. Nursing care during this phase focuses on thorough child and parent education. If the surgery is an emergency, teaching must be done quickly, emphasizing the most important elements of the child's care (Beke, Braudis, & Lincoln, 2005). Child and parent education typically includes the following topics: Heart anatomy and its function, including what area is involved with the defect that is to be corrected Events before surgery, including any testing or preparation such as a skin scrub Location of the child after surgery, such as a pediatric intensive care unit, which may include a visit to the unit if appropriate and explanation of the sights and sounds that may be present Appearance of the child after surgery (equipment or devices used for monitoring, such as oxygen administration, electrocardiogram leads, pulse oximeter, chest tubes, mechanical ventilation, or intravenous lines) Approximate location of the incision and coverage with dressings Postoperative activity level, including measures to reduce the risk of complications, such as coughing and deep-breathing exercises, incentive spirometry, early ambulation, and leg exercises Nutritional restrictions, such as nothing by mouth for a specified time before surgery and use of intravenous fluids Medications, such as anesthesia, sedation, and analgesics as well as medications the child is taking now that need to be continued or withheld (Beke et al., 2005) Prepare and educate the child at an age- and developmentally appropriate level. Advise parents to read books with their child about CHD and hospitalization such as: Clifford Visits the Hospital by N. Bridwell, 2000 (Scholastic Inc.) Franklin Goes to the Hospital by P. Bourgeois, 2000 (Scholastic Paperbacks) Pump the Bear by G. O. Whittingon, 2000 (Brown Books) Blue Lewis and Sasha the Great by C. D. Newell, 2005 (Cally Press) Cardiac Kids: A Book for Families Who Have a Child with Heart Disease by V. Elder, 1994 (Dayton Area Heart and Cancer Association) When Molly Was in the Hospital: A Book for Brothers and Sisters of Hospitalized Children by D. Duncan, 1994 (Rayve Productions) (siblings) A Night Without Stars by J. Howe, 1993 (Camelot) (older children) Additionally, parents may order It's My Heart , a parent resource book, free of charge from the Children's Heart Foundation, a link to which is provided on . Parents may also help their child by buying a small thrift-store suitcase, spray-painting it, and allowing the child to decorate it with his or her name, pictures of family, stickers, or favorite story characters. This will be the child's \"hospital suitcase\" that the child may pack with toys and videos to bring to the hospital. Hospital tours are appropriate for school-age children and older children and teens may benefit from an intensive care unit tour before surgery. Instruct parents to stop food and liquids at the designated time, depending on the child's age, and to give all medications as directed. Some medications may be withheld before surgery. If the child's nutritional status is poor or questionable, nutritional supplementation may be ordered for a period of time preoperatively to ensure that the child has the best possible nutritional status before surgery. When it is time for the child to be transported to the surgical area, allow the parents to accompany the child as far as possible, depending on the institution's policy. Also reinforce with the child that his or her parents will be present at the bedside when he or she awakens from surgery (Beke et al., 2005). PROVIDING POSTOPERATIVE CARE The child will usually be transported from the operating room to the intensive care unit. Depending on the child's age, postoperative stability, and type of surgery, the child may stay in the intensive care unit for several hours up to several days. Vigilant nursing careaids in the transition of the child and parents after surgery and reduces the risk of complications. During the postoperative period the nurse should do the following: Assess vital signs frequently, as often as every 1 hour, until stable. Assess the color of the skin and mucous membranes, check capillary refill, and palpate peripheral pulses. Observe cardiac rate and rhythm via electronic monitoring and auscultate heart rate and rhythm and heart sounds frequently. Monitor hemodynamic status via arterial and/or central venous lines (left and right atrial and pulmonary artery pressures, pulmonary artery oxygen saturation). Provide site care and tubing changes according to the institution's policy. Auscultate lungs for adventitious, diminished, or absent breath sounds. Assess oxygen saturation levels via pulse oximetry and arterial blood gases as well as work of breathing and level of consciousness frequently. Administer supplemental oxygen as needed. Monitor mechanical ventilation and suction as ordered. Inspect chest tube functioning, noting amount, color, and character of drainage. Inspect the dressing (incision and chest tube) for drainage and intactness. Reinforce or change the dressing as ordered. Assess the incision for redness, irritation, drainage, or separation. Monitor intake and output hourly. Maintain accurate intravenous infusion rate; restrict fluids as ordered to prevent hypervolemia. Assess for changes in level of consciousness. Report restlessness, irritability, or seizures. Obtain ordered laboratory tests, such as CBC count, coagulation studies, cardiac enzyme levels, and electrolyte levels. Report abnormal results. Administer medications, such as digoxin or inotropic or vasopressor agents, as ordered, watching the child closely for possible adverse effects. Encourage the child to turn, cough, deep breathe, use the incentive spirometer, and splint the incisional area with pillows. BOX 19.2 POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS AFTER CARDIAC SURGERY Atelectasis Bacterial endocarditis Cardiac arrhythmias Cardiac tamponade Pneumothorax Postperfusion syndrome Postcardiac surgery syndrome Pulmonary edema Seizures Wound infection Adapted from Bacha, E.

Cardiac complications associated with the treatment of patients with congenital cardiac disease: Consensus definitions from the Multi-Societal Database Committee for Pediatric and Congenital Heart Disease. Cardiology in the Young, 7S (Suppl. 2), 196-201. Assess the child's pain level and administer analgesics as ordered. Allow time for the child to rest and sleep. Assist the child to get out of bed as soon as possible and as ordered. Assess daily weights. Administer small, frequent feedings or meals when oral intake is allowed. Position the child in a comfortable position, one that maximizes chest expansion. Change position frequently. Assess the child for complications ( Box 19.2 ). Provide emotional and physical support to the child and family, making appropriate referrals such as to social services for assistance. Prepare the child and family for discharge (Beke et al., 2005). Take Note! Abrupt cessation of chest tube output accompanied by an increase in heart rate and increased filling pressure (right atrial) may indicate cardiac tamponade (Beke et al., 2005). Providing Child and Family Education Provide child and family education throughout the child's stay. Initially, teaching focuses on the underlying defect and measures to treat or control the problem. If the child requires surgery, teaching shifts to preoperative and postoperative events. Emphasize discharge teaching for each admission. Teaching Guidelines 19.2 highlights the major areas to be addressed in child and family education. Teaching Guidelines 19.2 CARING FOR THE CHILD WITH A CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE Give medications, if ordered, exactly as prescribed. Weigh the child at least once a week or as ordered, at approximately the same time of the day with the same scale, and wearing the same amount of clothing. Allow the child to engage in activity as directed. Provide time for the child to rest frequently throughout the day to prevent overexertion. Provide a nutritious diet, taking into account any restrictions for fluids or foods. Use measures to prevent infection, such as frequent hand washing, prophylactic antibiotics, and skin care. Adhere to schedule for follow-up diagnostic tests and procedures. Support the child's growth and development needs. Use available community support services. Notify the physician or nurse practitioner if the child has increasing episodes of respiratory distress, cyanosis, or difficulty breathing; fever; increased edema of the hands, feet, or face; decreased urinary output; weight loss or difficulty eating or drinking; increased fatigue or irritability; decreased level of alertness; or vomiting or diarrhea.

St. Louis: Mosby.ACQUIRED CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS Acquired cardiovascular disorders occur in children as a result of an underlying cardiovascular problem or may refer to other cardiac disorders that are not congenital. The most common type of acquired cardiovascular disorder in children is heart failure. Other acquired disorders include rheumatic fever, cardiomyopathy, infective endocarditis, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and Kawasaki disease. Heart Failure Heart failure occurs most often in children with CHD and is the most common reason for admission to the hospital for children with CHD. Most cases of heart failure in children with CHD occur by 6 months of age (Miyamoto et al., 2011). Heart failure also occurs secondary to other conditions such as myocardial dysfunction following surgical intervention for CHD, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, fluid volume overload, hypertension, anemia, or sepsis or as a toxic effect of certain chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment of cancer. Heart failure refers to a set of clinical signs and symptoms that reflect the heart's inability to pump effectively to provide adequate blood, oxygen, and nutrients to the body organs and tissues (Francis, Sonnenblick, Wilson Tang, & Poole-Wilson, 2008; Miyamoto et al., 2011). The child experiencing heart failure requires a multidisciplinary approach to care. Collaboration is necessary to achieve improved cardiac function, restored fluid balance, decreased cardiac workload, and improved oxygen delivery to the tissues. Pathophysiology Cardiac output is controlled by preload (diastolic volume), afterload (ventricular wall tension), myocardial contractility (inotropic state), and heart rate. Protracted alterations in any of these factors may lead to heart failure. In the event of reduced cardiac output, multiple compensatory mechanisms are activated. When the ventricular contraction is impaired (systolic dysfunction), reduced ejection of blood occurs, and therefore cardiac output is reduced. Diminished ability to receive venous return (diastolic dysfunction) occurs when high venous pressures are required to support ventricular function. As a result of decreased cardiac output, the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system is activated as a compensatory mechanism. Fluid and sodium retention as well as improved contractility and vasoconstriction then occur. Initially blood pressure is supported and organ perfusion is maintained, but increased afterload worsens systolic dysfunction. As the heart chambers dilate, myocardial oxygen consumption increases and cardiac output is limited by excessive wall stretch. Over time, the capacity of the heart to respond to these compensatory mechanisms fails, and cardiac output is further decreased (Francis et al., 2008; Miyamoto et al., 2011). Figure 19.15 shows the clinical manifestations that occur related to the mechanisms of heart failure. Therapeutic Management Management of heart failure is supportive. Promotion of oxygenation and ventilation is of utmost importance. Digitalis, diuretics, inotropic agents, vasodilators, antiarrhythmics, and antithrombotics have been widely used in children for palliation of symptoms. Many children with heart failure require management in the intensive care unit until they are stabilized. Augmenting nutrition and ensuring adequate rest are also key components of management.FIGURE 19.15 Pathophysiology of heart failure. (Adapted from Francis, G. S., Sonnenblick, E. H., Wilson Tang, W. H., & Poole-Wilson, P. [2008]. Pathophysiology of heart failure. In V. Fuster, R. A. O'Rourke, R. Walsh, & P. Poole-Wilson [Eds.], Hurst's the heart [12th ed.]. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.) Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 651 . Specific assessment findings related to heart failure are discussed below. Health History When obtaining the health history, elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common complaints reported during the health history might include: Failure to gain weight or rapid weight gain Failure to thrive Difficulty feeding Fatigue Dizziness, irritability Exercise intolerance Shortness of breath Sucking and then tiring quickly Syncope Decreased number of wet diapers Infants with heart failure often display subtle signs such as difficulty feeding and tiring easily. Pay close attention for reports of these problems from the parents. Also be alert for statements such as \"The baby drinks a small amount of breast milk (or formula) and stops, but then wants to eat again very soon afterwards\"; \"The baby seems to perspire a lot during feedings\"; or \"The baby seems to be more comfortable when he's sitting up or on my shoulder than when he's lying flat.\" In addition, the parents may report episodes of rapid breathing and grunting. The child's current and past medical history also provide additional clues. Question the parents about any history of congenitalheart defects and treatments such as surgery to repair the defect. Determine the current medication regimen. Also ask about any recent or past infections, such as streptococcal infections or fever. Physical Examination Weigh the child and note recent rapid weight gain or lack of weight gain. Obtain the child's vital signs, noting tachycardia or tachypnea. These findings are often the first indicators of heart failure in an infant or older child. Measure the BP in the upper and lower extremities, comparing the findings for differences. Note decreased BP, which may be due to impaired cardiac muscle function. Inspect the skin color, noting pallor or cyanosis. Also observe for diaphoresis (profuse sweating). Inspect the face, hands, and lower extremities for edema. Observe for increased work of breathing, such as nasal flaring or retractions. Note the presence of a cough, which may be productive with bloody sputum. Auscultate the apical pulse, noting its location and character. Listen for a murmur, which may suggest a congenital heart defect, a gallop rhythm, or an accentuated third heart sound, suggesting sudden ventricular distention. Auscultate the lungs, noting crackles or wheezes suggestive of pulmonary congestion. Palpate the peripheral pulses, noting weak or thready pulses. Note the temperature and color of the extremities; they may be cool, clammy, and pale. Assess the child's abdomen, looking for distention indicative of ascites. Gently palpate the abdomen to identify hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests The diagnosis of heart failure is based on the child's signs and symptoms and is confirmed with several laboratory and diagnostic tests. These include: Chest radiograph, revealing an enlarged heart and/or pulmonary edema Electrocardiogram, indicating ventricular hypertrophy Echocardiogram, revealing the underlying cause of heart failure, such as a congenital heart defect Other tests may be done to support the diagnosis. For example, the CBC count may show evidence of anemia or infection. Electrolyte levels may reveal hyponatremia secondary to fluid retention and hyperkalemia secondary to tissue destruction or impaired renal function. Arterial blood gas results may demonstrate respiratory alkalosis in mild heart failure or metabolic acidosis. Tissue hypoxia may be evidenced by increased lactic acid and decreased bicarbonate levels. Nursing Management Nursing management of the child with heart failure focuses on promoting oxygenation, supporting cardiac function, providing adequate nutrition, and promoting rest. Promoting Oxygenation Position the infant or child in a semi-upright position to decrease work of breathing and lessen pulmonary congestion. Suction as needed. Chest physiotherapy and postural drainage may also be beneficial. Administer supplemental oxygen as ordered and monitor oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry. Oxygen also serves the function of vasodilator and decreases pulmonary vascular resistance. Occasionally, the infant or child with heart failure may require intubation and positive-pressure ventilation to normalize blood gas tension. Take Note! In a child with a large left-to-right shunt, oxygen will decrease pulmonary vascular resistance while increasing the systemic vascular resistance, which leads to increased left-to-right shunting. Monitor the child carefully and use oxygen only as prescribed. Supporting Cardiac Function Administer digitalis, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and diuretics as prescribed. Digoxin therapy begins with a digitalizing dose divided into several doses (oral or intravenous [IV]) over a 24-hour period to reach maximum cardiac effect. During digitalization, monitor the electrocardiogram for a prolonged PR interval and decreased ventricular rate. Doses are then administered every 12 hours. Monitor the child for signs of digoxin toxicity. Measure BP before and after administration of ACE inhibitors, holding the dose and notifying the physician if the BP falls more than 15 mm Hg. Observe for signs of hypotension such as lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting. Weigh the child daily to determine fluid loss. Maintain accurate records of intake and output, restricting fluid intake if ordered. Carefully monitor potassium levels, administering potassium supplements if prescribed. Sodium intake is not usuallyrestricted in the child with heart failure. Providing Adequate Nutrition Due to the increased metabolic rate associated with heart failure, the infant may require as much as 150 calories/kg/day. Older children will also require higher caloric intake than typical children. Offer small, frequent feedings if the child can tolerate them. During the acute phase of heart failure, many infants in particular will require continuous or intermittent gavage feeding to maintain or gain weight. Concentrate infant formula to 24 to 28 calories/ounce as instructed by the nutritionist. Promoting Rest Minimize metabolic needs to decrease cardiac demand. The infant or older child with heart failure will usually limit activities based on energy level. Ensure adequate time for sleep and attempt to limit disturbing interventions. Provide age-appropriate activities that can be performed quietly or in bed, such as books, coloring or drawing, and video or board games. The older child or adolescent with significant heart failure may require home schooling. As the child improves, a rehabilitation program may be helpful for maximizing activity within the child's cardiovascular status limits. Infective Endocarditis Infective endocarditis is a microbial infection of the endothelial surfaces of the heart's chambers, septum, or valves (most common). Children with congenital heart defects (septum or valve defects) or prosthetic valves are at increased risk of acquiring bacterial endocarditis, which is potentially fatal in these children. Other risk factors for endocarditis include central venous catheters and intravenous drug use. Infective endocarditis occurs when bacteria or fungi gain access to a damaged epithelium. Turbulence in blood flow associated with narrowed or incompetent valves or with a communication between the systemic and pulmonary circulation leads to damage of the endothelium. Thrombi and platelets then adhere to the endothelium, forming vegetations. When a microbe gains access to the bloodstream, it colonizes the vegetation, using the thrombi as a breeding ground. Clumps may separate from the vegetative patch and travel to other organs of the body, causing significant damage (septic emboli). Fungi or more commonly bacteria (particularly -hemolytic streptococcus or Staphylococcus aureus ) are frequently implicated in infective endocarditis (Brusch, 2009; Miyamoto et al., 2011). Complete antibiotic or antifungal treatment of the causative organism is necessary, and treatment may last 4 to 7 weeks. Prevention of infective endocarditis in the susceptible child with CHD or a valvular disorder is of the utmost importance (Brusch, 2009; Miyamoto et al., 2011). Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 651 . Assessment findings related to endocarditis are discussed below. Health History Obtain the health history, noting intermittent, unexplained low-grade fever. Document history of fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, or flu- like symptoms (e.g., arthralgia, myalgia, chills, night sweats). Note history of CHD, valve disorder, or heart failure. Physical Examination Measure the child's temperature, noting low-grade fever. Observe for edema if heart failure is also present. Note petechiae on the palpebral conjunctiva, the oral mucosa, or the extremities. Inspect for signs of extracardiac emboli: Roth spots: splinter hemorrhages with pale centers on palate, buccal mucosa, chest, fingers, or toes Janeway lesions: painless, flat, red or blue hemorrhagic lesions on the palms or the soles Osler nodes: small, tender nodules on the pads of the toes or fingers Black lines (splinter hemorrhages) under the nails (Brusch, 2009; Miyamoto et al., 2011) Evaluate the electrocardiogram for a prolonged PR interval or dysrhythmias. Auscultate the heart for a new or changing murmur. Auscultate the lungs for adventitious breath sounds. Palpate the abdomen for splenomegaly. Laboratory and Diagnostic TestsDiagnosis is usually based on the clinical presentation. Laboratory tests may reveal: Blood culture: bacteria or Echocardiogram: cardiomegaly, abnormal valve function, area of vegetation Nursing Management Nursing management focuses on maintaining IV access for at least 4 weeks to appropriately administer the antibiotic or antifungal course of therapy. Monitor the child's temperature and subsequent blood culture results. Ideally, infective endocarditis in children should be prevented. Children at increased risk for the development of infective endocarditis include those with: Prosthetic cardiac valve or prosthetic material used for cardiac valve repair Previous endocarditis Unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease Completely repaired congenital heart defect with prosthetic material or device within the first 6 months after the procedure Repaired congenital heart disease with residual defects at the site or adjacent to the site of a prosthetic patch or prosthetic device Cardiac transplantation recipients who develop cardiac valve abnormalities (Brusch, 2009) Children at high risk should practice good oral hygiene, including regular tooth brushing and flossing. Instruct parents or the older child to carry emergency medical identification at all times. A wallet card is available from the American Heart Association and a direct link is provided on . The card may be presented to any physician or nurse practitioner and includes the recommended antibiotic prophylactic regimen (AHA, 2011a). Instruct the parents to notify the primary care provider or cardiologist if the child develops flu-like symptoms or a fever. High-risk children (as noted above) who are undergoing dental procedures should receive prophylaxis as recommended by the American Heart Association. Antibiotics typically used for prophylaxis may include ampicillin, amoxicillin, gentamicin, or vancomycin. Acute Rheumatic Fever Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is a delayed sequela of group A streptococcal pharyngeal infection. In the United States this disease occurs more often in school-age children between 5 and 15 years of age in areas where streptococcal pharyngitis is more prevalent, especially during the colder months. It usually develops 2 to 3 weeks after the initial streptococcal infection. Current understanding of the disease process of ARF is that the child develops an antibody response to surface proteins of the bacteria. The antibodies then cross-react with antigens in cardiac muscle and neuronal and synovial tissues, causing carditis, arthritis, and chorea (involuntary random, jerking movements). ARF affects the joints, central nervous system, skin, and subcutaneous tissue and causes chronic, progressive damage to the heart and valves. Most attacks of ARF last 6 to 12 weeks and then are resolved, but rheumatic fever may recur with subsequent streptococcal infections (Parillo & Parillo, 2010). Diagnosis of ARF is based on the modified Jones criteria ( Box 19.3 ). Therapeutic management is directed toward managing inflammation and fever, eradicating the bacteria, preventing permanent heart damage, and preventing recurrences. A full 10-day course of penicillin therapy (or equivalent) is used along with corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Continuous prophylaxis with monthly intramuscular injections of penicillin G benzathine or daily oral doses of penicillin or erythromycin following the initial illness are recommended to prevent a new streptococcal infection and recurrent ARF. Prophylaxis is continued until adulthood (no valvular disease) or age 40 years (with valvular disease) (Parillo & Parillo, 2010). Nursing Assessment Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint, noting fever and joint pain. Explore the child's recent medical history for risk factors such as documented streptococcal infection or sore throat within the past 2 to 3 weeks, or for past history of ARF. Observe the child for Sydenham chorea, a movement disorder of the face and upper extremities. Inspect the skin for evidence of the classic rash, erythema marginatum, a maculopapular red rash with central clearing and elevated edges. Auscultate the heart, noting a murmur. Palpate the surfaces of the wrist, elbows, and knees for firm, painless, subcutaneous nodules. Note prolonged PR interval on the electrocardiogram. Throat culture will provide definitive diagnosis of current streptococcal infection, while streptococcal antibody tests may yield evidence of recent infection. Echocardiogram is required to determine if carditis is present. BOX 19.3BOX 19.3 MODIFIED JONES CRITERIA (AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION) Diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever requires the presence of either two major criteria or one major plus two minor criteria. Major Criteria Carditis Migratory sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein Prolonged PR interval Adapted from Miyamoto, S. D., Sondheimer, H. M., Fagan, T. E., & Collins, K. K. (2011). Cardiovascular diseases. In W. W. Hay, M. J. Levin, J. M. Sondheimer, & R. R. Deterding (Eds.), Current pediatric diagnosis and treatment (20th ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill. Nursing Management Nursing management of the child with ARF focuses on ensuring compliance with the acute course of antibiotics as well as prophylaxis following initial recovery from ARF. Allow the child to verbalize the frustration he or she may be feeling in relation to chorea symptoms. Offer support for dealing with the abnormal movements. Educate the child and others that the sudden jerky movements of chorea will eventually disappear, though they may last as long as several months. Some children may require a neuroleptic agent such as haloperidol (Haldol) for management of chorea. Administer corticosteroids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents for control of joint pain and swelling. Cardiomyopathy Cardiomyopathy is a condition in which the myocardium cannot contract properly. The incidence of cardiomyopathy among children is increasing; it occurs at a rate of 1 per 100,000 (AHA, 2010). Cardiomyopathy may occur in children with genetic disorders or congenital heart defects, as a result of an inflammatory or infectious process or hypertension, or after cardiac transplantation or surgery, but most commonly it is idiopathic. Cardiomyopathy occurs predominately in clusters in infancy and adolescence. Three types of cardiomyopathy exist\u2014restrictive, dilated, and hypertrophic. Restrictive cardiomyopathy is rare in children and results in atrial relaxation. Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common type in childhood and may result in heart failure because of ventricular dilatation with decreased contractility (Kantor, Abraham, Dipchand, Benson, & 2010). There is some familial tendency toward dilated cardiomyopathy, and it is also associated with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (Marian et al., 2008). Children with dilated cardiomyopathy may present with heart failure (Kantor et al., 2010). Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is more common in adolescence and results in hypertrophy of the heart muscle, particularly the left ventricle, affecting the heart's ability to fill. About two thirds of all cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are familial, with some inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion (Marian et al., 2008). There is no cure for cardiomyopathy, meaning that, currently, heart muscle function cannot be restored. Therapeutic management is directed toward improving heart function and blood pressure. Mechanical ventilation and vasoactive medications are needed in many children. ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, or calcium channel blockers may be used. Pacemakers or surgery is helpful in some children. For severely affected children, heart transplantation is the only viable long-term treatment option (Kantor et al., 2010). Nursing Assessment Explore the health history for risk factors such as: Congenital heart defect, cardiac transplantation, or surgery Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy History of myocarditis, HIV infection, or Kawasaki disease Hypertension Drugs, alcohol, or radiation exposure Connective tissue, autoimmune, or endocrine disease Maternal diabetes Familial history of sudden death Inquire about a history of respiratory distress, fatigue, poor growth (dilated), chest pain, dizziness, or syncope (hypertrophic). Observe the child for extremity edema and abdominal distention. Note increased work of breathing. Auscultate the heart, noting tachycardia and irregular rhythm. Evaluate heart rhythm via electrocardiogram, noting dysrhythmias or indications of left ventricular hypertrophy. Chest radiography may reveal cardiomegaly or congested lungs. Echocardiogram demonstrates increased heart size, poor contractility, decreased ejection fraction, or asymmetric septal hypertrophy. Cardiac catheterization is usually performed to aid in the diagnosis. Nursing Management Many children with cardiomyopathy require intensive care initially. Monitor for complications such as blood clots or arrhythmias, which could lead to cardiac arrest. Refer to the previous section on heart failure for nursing interventions related to heart failure, which may be present with dilated cardiomyopathy. Administer vasoactive and other medications as prescribed, monitoring the child closely for response to these therapies as well as for complications. Support the child in choosing activities that fit within the prescribed restrictions. Provide extensive emotional support to the child and family, who may experience significant stress as they realize the severity of this illness. Hypertension Hypertension affects only 1% to 3% of children and adolescents, but often leads to long-term health consequences such as cardiovascular disease and left ventricular hypertrophy (Hollis, 2009). In children, acceptable BP values are based on gender, age, and height. Hypertension is defined as BP persistently greater than the 95th percentile for gender, age, and height. Prehypertension refers to BP that is persistently between the 90th and 95th percentiles. BP is considered normal when the systolic and diastolic values are less than the 90th percentile for gender, age, and height (Brady, Siberry, & Solomon, 2008). Childhood hypertension may be further defined as primary or secondary. Primary hypertension in children is rare, but its incidence increases with age. Therefore, it is more common in adolescence than in early childhood. Hypertension in children most frequently occurs secondary to an underlying medical problem (most often renal disease). Mild to moderate hypertension in childhood is usually asymptomatic and usually is determined only upon BP screening during a well-child visit or during follow-up for known risk factors. Therapeutic management depends on the extent of the hypertension and the length of time it has existed. Weight reduction, appropriate diet, and increased physical activity are important components of management of prehypertensive and asymptomatic hypertensive children. Some children are candidates for, and require, antihypertensive medications or diuretics (Brady et al., 2008; Hollis, 2009). Pathophysiology The balance between cardiac output and vascular resistance determines the BP. An increase in either of these variables, in the absence of a compensatory decrease in the other, increases the mean BP. Factors regulating cardiac output and vascular resistance include changes in electrolyte balance, particularly sodium, calcium, and potassium (Brady et al., 2008; Hollis, 2009). Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment consists of the health history, physical examination, and laboratory and diagnostic tests. Health History Elicit the health history, determining the presence of risk factors for hypertension such as: Family history Obesity Hyperlipidemia Renal disease (including frequent urinary tract infections) Systemic lupus erythematosus Congenital heart disease Neurofibromatosis, Turner syndrome, and other genetic disorders Prematurity Prolonged neonatal ventilation Umbilical artery catheterization Diabetes mellitus Increased intracranial pressure Malignancy Solid organ transplant Medications known to raise BP Signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Growth retardation (with certain chronic medical conditions) Obesity Signs and symptoms seen particularly in older children Headache Subtle behavioral or school performance changes Fatigue Blurred vision Nosebleed Bell palsy Physical Examination Determine the child's weight and height/length. Plot these growth parameters on the gender-appropriate chart for the child's age. Note the percentile for height/length, as it will be used to determine the BP percentile (see Appendix the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute blood pressure charts). Measure the BP in all four extremities (to rule out coarctation of the aorta). Ensure that the child is relaxed and sitting or reclined. Refer to Chapter 10 for specific information related to accurate BP measurement in children. Inspect the skin for: Acne, hirsutism, or striae (associated with anabolic steroid use) Caf\u00e9-au-lait spots (associated with neurofibromatosis) Malar rash (associated with lupus) Pallor, diaphoresis, or flushing (associated with pheochromocytoma) Observe the extremities for edema (renal disease) or joint swelling (lupus). Inspect the chest for apical heave (ventricular hypertrophy) or wide-spaced nipples (Turner syndrome). Auscultate heart sounds, noting tachycardia (associated with primary hypertension) or murmur (associated with coarctation of the aorta). Palpate the abdomen for a mass or enlarged kidney. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Though diagnosis of hypertension is based on BP measurements, additional laboratory or diagnostic tests may be used to evaluate the underlying cause of secondary hypertension, including: Urinalysis, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine: may determine presence of renal disease Renal ultrasound or angiography: may reveal kidney or genitourinary tract abnormalities Echocardiogram: may show left ventricular hypertrophy Lipid profile: determines the presence of hyperlipidemia Nursing Management Salt restriction and potassium or calcium supplements have not been scientifically shown to decrease BP in children. However, obese children may benefit from salt restriction, as those children seem to be sensitive to salt intake. Assist the child and family to develop a plan for weight reduction if the child is overweight or obese. Encourage the child and family to control portion sizes, decrease the intake of sugary beverages and snacks, eat more fresh fruits and vegetables, and eat a healthy breakfast. Consult the nutritionist foradditional assistance with meal planning. To increase physical activity, encourage the child to find a sport or type of exercise in which he or she is interested. Aerobic activities involving running, walking, or cycling are particularly helpful. When a child requires antihypertensive therapy, teach the child and family how to administer the medication. Caution the parents about side effects related to antihypertensives. Teach the parent to measure the child's BP as determined by the physician or nurse practitioner, as well as to keep appointments for BP follow-up. See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Kawasaki Disease Kawasaki disease is an acute systemic vasculitis occurring mostly in infants and young children. It is the leading cause of acquired heart disease among children and occurs more frequently in the winter and spring. Over 4,000 children are hospitalized annually in the United States with Kawasaki disease, and though it affects all ethnic groups, it occurs more frequently in those of Asian or Pacific descent. It is a self-limited syndrome but causes serious cardiovascular sequelae in up to 25% of affected children (Driscoll, 2006). Coronary artery aneurysm results in myocardial infarction and death in some children. Therapeutic management of acute Kawasaki disease focuses on reducing inflammation in the walls of the coronary arteries and preventing coronary thrombosis. Chronic management of children developing aneurysms during the initial phase is directed toward preventing myocardial ischemia. In the acute phase, high-dose aspirin in four divided doses daily and a single infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are used. Children whose fever persists longer than 48 hours after initiation of aspirin therapy may receive a second dose of IVIG. Pulsed-dose corticosteroid therapy may also be used to prevent or halt coronary dilatation and inhibit progression to aneurysm (Rowley & Shulman, 2010). Pathophysiology Though the etiology is still unknown, Kawasaki disease may result from an infectious cause. Current thought is that some infectious organism (as yet unidentified) causes disease in genetically susceptible people. Kawasaki disease appears to be an autoimmune response mediated by cytokine-induced endothelial cell surface antigens that leads to vasculitis. by mononuclear cells, T lymphocytes, and immunoglobulin A-producing plasma cells, infiltrate the vessels. Inflammation then occurs in all three layers of the small and medium-sized blood vessels. Edema and smooth muscle necrosis occur in the vessel wall media in severe cases. Generalized systemic vasculitis occurs in the blood vessels throughout the body due to the inflammation and edema. As elastin and collagen fibers fragment, the structural integrity of the vessel wall is impaired. This mechanism leads to coronary dilatation (ectasia) or aneurysm. Some children never develop coronary artery changes, while others develop an aneurysm in either the acute phase or as a long-term sequela. Infants are at the highest risk for coronary aneurysm or ectasia (Rowley & Shulman, 2010). Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment consists of determining the health history, physical examination, and laboratory and diagnostic testing. Health History Elicit the health history, noting any of the following: Fever Chills Headache Malaise Extreme irritability Vomiting Diarrhea Abdominal pain Joint pain Of particular note is a history of high fever (39.9\u00b0C) of at least 5 days' duration that is unresponsive to antibiotics. Physical Examination Observe for significant bilateral conjunctivitis without exudate. Inspect the mouth and throat for dry, fissured lips; strawberry (cracked and reddened) tongue; and pharyngeal and mucosa erythema. for: Diffuse, polymorphous rash Edema of the hands and feet Erythema and painful induration of the palms and soles Desquamation (peeling) of the perineal region, fingers, and toes, extending to the palms and soles Possible jaundice Palpate the neck for cervical lymphadenopathy (usually unilateral) and the joints for tenderness. Palpate the abdomen for liver enlargement. Auscultate the heart, noting tachycardia, gallop, or murmur. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing The CBC count may reveal mild to moderate anemia, an elevated white blood cell count during the acute phase, and significant thrombocytosis (elevated platelet count [500,000 to 1 million]) in the later phase. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and the C-reactive protein (CRP) level are elevated. Echocardiogram is performed as soon as possible after the diagnosis is confirmed to provide a baseline of a healthy heart or to evaluate for coronary artery involvement. Echocardiograms may be repeated during the illness and as part of long-term follow-up. Occasionally cardiac involvement warrants cardiac catheterization. Nursing Management In addition to the administration of aspirin and immunoglobulin, nursing management of the child with Kawasaki disease focuses on monitoring cardiac status, promoting comfort, and providing family education. Monitoring Cardiac Status Administer intravenous and oral fluids as ordered, evaluating intake and output carefully. Prepare the child for the echocardiogram. Assess frequently for signs of developing heart failure such as tachycardia, gallop, decreased urine output, or respiratory distress. Evaluate quality and strength of pulses. Provide cardiac monitoring as ordered, reporting arrhythmias. Promoting Comfort Provide acetaminophen for fever management and apply cool cloths as tolerated. Keep the environment quiet and cluster nursing care activities to decrease stimulation and hence irritability. Teach parents that irritability is a prominent feature of Kawasaki disease, and support their efforts to console the child. Apply petrolatum jelly or another lubricating ointment to the lips. Encourage the older child to suck on ice chips; the younger child may suck on a cool, moist washcloth. Popsicles are also soothing. Provide comfortable positioning, particularly if the child has joint pain or arthritis. Providing Child and Family Education Teach parents to continue to monitor the child's temperature after discharge until the child has been afebrile for several days. Children with prolonged or recurrent fever may require a second dose of IVIG. Inform parents that irritability may last for up to 2 months after initial diagnosis with Kawasaki disease. Report any toxic effects of aspirin therapy, such as headache, confusion, dizziness, or tinnitus to the physician or nurse practitioner. It is important to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents while aspirin therapy is ongoing. For children with continued arthritis (which resolves in several weeks), range-of-motion exercises with a morning bath may help to decrease stiffness. Instruct parents to avoid measles and varicella vaccination for 11 months after high-dose IVIG administration. It is critical that the family comply with regularly scheduled cardiology follow-up appointments to determine development or progression ofcoronary artery ectasia or aneurysm. If the child has severe cardiac involvement, teach the parents about infant and/or child cardiopulmonary resuscitation before discharge from the hospital. Hyperlipidemia Hyperlipidemia refers to high levels of lipids (fats/cholesterol) in the blood. High lipid levels are a risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis, which can result in coronary artery disease, a serious cardiovascular disorder occurring in adults. Children with high lipid levels, though remaining asymptomatic, are likely to have high levels as adults, which increases their risk for coronary artery disease. Therefore, detection, screening, and early intervention are important, especially if there is a family tendency toward heart disease (Daniels, Greer, & the Committee on Nutrition, 2008). Pathophysiology Cholesterol is a building block for hormones and cell membranes. It occurs naturally in foods derived from animals such as eggs, dairy products, meat, poultry, and seafood. Cholesterol is also manufactured in the body. Together, cholesterol and triglycerides are known as lipids. Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) is a lipoprotein composed mainly of triglycerides with only small amounts of cholesterol, phospholipid, and protein. VLDLs are easily converted to low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). Cholesterol is expressed in terms of LDL cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. LDLs contain relatively more cholesterol and triglycerides than they do protein. HDLs contain about 50% protein, with the rest being cholesterol, triglyceride, and phospholipid. High levels of cholesterol and triglycerides place a person at risk for atherosclerosis. Elevated VLDL and LDL levels and decreased HDL levels produce a particular increase in the risk for atherosclerosis (Daniels et al., 2008). Therapeutic Management Screening children for hyperlipidemia is of prime importance for early detection, intervention, and subsequent prevention of adult atherosclerosis. The National Cholesterol Education Program recommends screening for hyperlipidemia in children older than 2 years of age if: The parent has a total cholesterol level above 240 mg/dL. There is a family history of cardiovascular disease in a parent or grandparent before age 55 years. The family history is unavailable. All children should eat a diet with the appropriate amount of fats (see the section on nursing management below) and should participate in physical activity. When diet and exercise are not enough to lower cholesterol to appropriate levels, medications such as resins, fibric acid derivatives, statins, or niacin may be used (Daniels et al., 2008). Nursing Assessment Elicit the health history, noting risk factors such as family history of hyperlipidemia, early heart disease, hypertension, diabetes or other endocrine abnormality, cerebral vascular accident, or sudden death. Note prior lipid levels if available. Measure the child's height and weight, plotting them on standardized growth charts. Note if the child is overweight or obese, as these are risk factors associated with hyperlipidemia. Typically, there are no other particular physical findings associated with hyperlipidemia. Table 19.3 gives details about the interpretation of cholesterol levels. Nursing ManagementInstruct families that the child must fast for 12 hours before lipid screening (initially and on follow-up samples). Dietary management is the first step in the prevention and management of hyperlipidemia in children older than 2 years of age. The diet should consist primarily of fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, beans, lean meat, poultry, and fish. As in adults, fat should account for no more than 30% of daily caloric intake. Fat intake may vary over a period of days, as many young children are picky eaters. Limit saturated fats by choosing lean meats, removing skin from poultry before cooking, and avoiding palm, palm kernel, and coconut oils as well as hydrogenated fats. Teach families to read nutrition labels to determine the content of the food. Limit intake of processed or refined foods as well as high-sugar drinks; these products provide minimal nutrition and significant calories. Children older than 2 years of age should have 60 minutes per day of vigorous play or physical activity. Refer parents to \"Healthy Habits for Healthy Kids\u2014A Nutrition and Activity Guide for Parents\" published by the American Dietetic Association. (See . for a direct link.) If medications are required, teach the child and family about the dose, administration, and possible adverse effects. Assist the family to develop a medication-dosing plan that is compatible with school and work schedules to increase compliance.HEART TRANSPLANTATION Heart transplantation is indicated in children with end-stage heart disease related to cardiomyopathy or inoperable CHD. About 450 children receive a heart transplant each year (Conway & Dipchand, 2010). The 1-year survival rate is 80% to 85% and the overall 20-year rate is 40% (Conway & Dipchand, 2010). A comprehensive evaluation is performed to determine whether the child is a candidate for heart transplant. The evaluation includes: Chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, exercise stress test, cardiac catheterization, and pulmonary function tests CBC count with differential, prothrombin and partial thromboplastin time, serum chemistries and electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine Urinalysis and urine creatinine clearance Blood, throat, urine, stool, and sputum cultures for bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella, herpes, hepatitis, and HIV titers HLA and panel reactive antibody typing and titer Computed tomography or MRI scan and electroencephalogram Consults with neurology, psychology, genetics, social work, nutritionist, physical and occupational therapy, and financial coordinator or case manager (Conway & Dipchand, 2010) Children with irreversible lung, liver, kidney, or central nervous system disease; recent malignancy (past 5 years); or chronic viral infection may be excluded as candidates. Once candidacy is determined, the transplant center registers the child as a potential recipient with the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). Blood type, body size, length of time on the waiting list, and medical urgency are used to evaluate compatibility. Children awaiting transplantation may need continuous or intermittent hospitalization. Coordination of organ procurement and the transplantation procedure is essential. Surgical Procedure and Postoperative Therapeutic Management Most transplantation procedures are orthotopic , which means that the recipient's heart is removed and the donor heart is implanted in its place in the normal anatomic position. Cardiopulmonary bypass and hypothermia are used to maintain circulation, protect the brain, and oxygenate the recipient during the procedure. Postoperatively, the child may have near-normal heart function and capacity for exercise and may be able to return to school. Immunosuppressive therapy is necessary for the rest of the child's life to avoid rejection of the transplanted heart. Usually a three- drug regimen is used that includes calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus), cell toxins (mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine), The cardiologist and transplant surgeon provide ongoing follow-up. Complications of heart transplantation include bacterial, fungal, and viral infection and heart rejection. Neoplasm may occur as a result of chronic immunosuppression. Nursing Management Preoperative nursing care for the child undergoing a heart transplant is similar for children undergoing other types of heart surgery. In addition, the nurse should assist with the comprehensive pretransplant evaluation. Care for the child in the posttransplant period is intense and complex. Evaluate the family's ability to perform the tasks that will be necessary. Teach families about the evaluation and transplantation process, as well as the waiting period. In the immediate preoperative period, perform a thorough history and physical examination and obtain last-minute blood work. Provide preoperative teaching similar to other cardiac surgeries. Older children, adolescents, and parents may enjoy the book Future Conditional by J. Hatton (1996, Yorkshire Art Circus), which was written by one of the first heart transplant survivors. Postoperatively, provide frequent assessments and routine care for cardiac surgery children. In addition, monitor the child closely for infection or signs of rejection. Acute rejection may be indicated by low-grade fever, fatigue, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and decreased activity tolerance, though some children will be asymptomatic. Maintain strict hand washing techniques and isolate the child from other children with infections. Though live vaccines are contraindicated in immunosuppressed children, inactivated vaccines should be given as recommended (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010). Teach children and families that the child may return to school and usual activities about 3 months after the transplant. Provide emotional support to the child related to body image changes such as hair growth, gum hyperplasia, weight gain, moon facies, acne, and rashes that occur due to long-term immunosuppressive therapy.KEY CONCEPTS At birth, when the umbilical cord is cut and the neonate's first breath occurs, the ductus venosus closes with the foramen ovale and the ductus arteriosus closes shortly thereafter. Pulmonary vascular resistance decreases and systemic vascular resistance increases. The infant's heart rate averages 120 to 130 beats per minute and decreases throughout childhood, reaching the adult rate in adolescence. Conversely, the infant's and child's blood pressure is significantly lower than the adult's, increasing as the child ages. Check the infant's apical pulse prior to digoxin administration and hold the dose if the heart rate is less than 90. Poor weight gain, failure to thrive, and increased fatigability commonly occur with congestive heart failure. Clubbing of the fingernails occurs as a result of chronic hypoxia in the child with severe congenital heart disease. Children with cardiac conditions resulting in cyanosis often have baseline oxygen saturations that are relatively low, because of the mixing of oxygenated with deoxygenated blood. Document the presence of a murmur by grading its intensity (I through IV), describing where it occurs within the cardiac cycle, and noting the location where the murmur is best heard. Congenital heart disease should be suspected in the cyanotic newborn who does not improve with oxygen administration. Cardiac catheterization postprocedure care focuses on evaluation of the child's vital signs and condition of the pressure dressing, as well as assessment of the distal pulses bilaterally for presence and quality. Congenital heart disorders resulting in decreased pulmonary blood flow (tetralogy of Fallot, tricuspid atresia) result in cyanosis. Disorders pulmonary (patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect, and ventricular septal defect) may result in pulmonary edema if the defect is severe. A decrease in the lower extremity pulses or blood pressure as compared with the upper extremities may be indicative of coarctation of the aorta. It is important to remain calm when an infant or child demonstrates a hypercyanotic spell. Place the child in a knee-chest position, administer oxygen and/or morphine or propranolol, and supply intravenous fluids. Children with certain congenital heart defects and/or heart failure require additional calories in order to display adequate growth. Children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, certain congenital heart defects, valve dysfunction, or prosthetic valves require prophylaxis for infective endocarditis when undergoing procedures or invasive dental work. Hypertension in the child or adolescent often leads to long-term health consequences such as cardiovascular disease and left ventricular hypertrophy. Kawasaki disease may result in severe cardiac sequelae, so these children need ongoing cardiac follow-up to screen for development of problems. It is important to screen for hyperlipidemia in high-risk children. Abrupt cessation of chest tube output, accompanied by an increase in the heart rate and increased filling pressure, may indicate cardiac tamponade. REFERENCES Abdallah, H. (2011).

KEY TERMS atresia cholestasis cirrhosis cleft tenderness regurgitation steatorrhea Learning Objectives Upon completion of the chapter, you will be able to: 1. Compare the differences in the anatomy and physiology of the gastrointestinal system between children and adults. 2. Discuss common medical treatments for infants and children with gastrointestinal disorders. 3. Discuss common laboratory and diagnostic tests used to identify disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. 4. Discuss medication therapy used in infants and children with gastrointestinal disorders. 5.

Ethan Richar dson, 2 months old, is brought to the clinic by his mother He has been vomiting for the past 3 days. His mother states that she switched for mula to see if that would help, but the vomiting worsened. Since last night she has attempted to feed him only Pedialyte. Mrs. Roberts says, \"He can't keep anything down and he's very irritable.\" His weight at birth was 8 lbs 9 ounces, length 21 inches, and head circumference 37 cm. At his 2-month check-up last week he weighed 13 lbs. Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders affect children of all ages. GI illnesses range from acute to chronic and from non-life-threatening to life-threatening problems. However, even acute, non-life-threatening illnesses (e.g., diarrhea or vomiting) can become life-threatening without proper nursing assessment and interventions. The most common result of a GI illness is dehydration, requiring fluid therapy at home or, in more extreme cases, in a hospital setting. It is important to take all GI disorders seriously until symptoms are well controlled. Child and family education related to the treatment of GI disorders is key to preventing the illness from progressing to an emergency situation. Therefore, the nurse's knowledge of the disorders that affect the GI system is crucial. Most often, the parents or child, if the child is older, will contact the physician or nurse practitioner in an outpatient setting to seek help. The nurse is usually the person to triage the phone call to determine the next step in the situation, which may be determining whether the child should be managed at home, brought to the office for assessment, or sent directly to an emergency room for evaluation. The majority of GI disorders can be handled in an outpatient setting to avoid unnecessary hospitalizations. However, some life-threatening problems (e.g., bowel obstruction) require emergency care in the hospital. Again, the knowledge base of the nurse is instrumental in obtaining the proper information by taking a thorough and accurate health history from the parents or child (if the child is older).VARIATIONS IN PEDIATRIC ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY The GI tract includes all of the structures from the mouth to the anus. The primary functions of the GI system are the digestion and absorption of nutrients and water, elimination of waste products, and secretion of various substances required for digestion. Babies are born with immature GI tracts that are not fully mature until age 2. Due to this immaturity, there are many differences between the digestive tract of the young child and that of the older child or adult. Mouth The mouth is highly vascular, making it a common entry point for infectious invaders. In addition, the infant and young child repeatedly bring objects to their mouths and explore them in that fashion. This behavior increases the infant's and young child's risk for contracting infectious agents via the mouth. Esophagus The esophagus provides a passageway from the mouth to the stomach for food. The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) prevents regurgitation (backflow) of stomach contents up into the esophagus and/or oral cavity. The muscle tone of the LES is not fully developed until age 1 month, so infants younger than 1 month of age frequently regurgitate after feedings. Many children younger than 1 year of age continue to regurgitate for several months, but this usually disappears with age. If edema or narrowing of the esophagus occurs in a child with undeveloped esophageal muscle tone, dysphagia (difficult or painful swallowing) may occur. Stomach Newborns have a stomach capacity of only 10 to 20 mL. At 2 months of age an infant has the capacity to hold up to 200 mL, though most young infants cannot tolerate 200-mL feedings. By age 16, the stomach capacity is 1,500 mL; by adulthood it is 2,000 to 3,000 mL. Hydrochloric acid, which is found in gastric contents to aid in digestion, reaches the adult level by the time the child is 6 months old. Intestines The small intestine is not functionally mature at birth. A full-term infant has approximately 250 cm of small intestine; an adult has up to 600 cm. Infants who have small bowel loss during early infancy have more problems with absorption and diarrhea than adults who have the same amount of small bowel loss. Biliary System The liver is relatively large at birth, allowing for the smooth edge of the liver to be easily palpated in infancy, as much as 2 cm below the costal margin. The pancreatic enzymes continue to develop postnatally, reaching adult levels around 2 years of age. Fluid Balance and Losses Compared with adults, children exhibit differences in how fluid volume is maintained. These differences are evident in body fluid balance and insensible fluid losses. Body Fluid Balance Infants and children have a proportionately greater amount of body water than do adults. Infants and young children require a larger relative fluid intake than adults and excrete a relatively greater amount of fluid. This places them at increased risk for fluid loss with illness compared to adults. Until age 2 years, the extracellular fluid, with its larger proportion of sodium and chloride, makes up about half of the child's total body water. Therefore, when potential fluid-loss states occur, water loss occurs more rapidly and in larger amounts than in adults. Insensible Fluid Losses Fever increases fluid loss at a rate of about 7 mL/kg/24-hour period for every sustained 1\u00b0C rise in temperature. Since children become febrile with illness more readily and their fevers are higher than those of adults, infants and young children are more apt than adults to experience insensible fluid loss with fever when ill.Fluid loss via the skin accounts for about two thirds of insensible fluid loss. Infants have a relatively larger body surface area (BSA) compared to older children and adults. The newborn's BSA is about two or three times greater than the adult's, and the preterm infant's is about five times greater than the adult's. This places infants, especially young infants, at increased risk of insensible fluid loss as compared to older children and adults. The basal metabolic rate in infants and children is higher than that of adults in order to support growth. This higher metabolic rate, even in states of wellness, accounts for increased insensible fluid losses and increased need for water for excretory functions. The young infant's renal immaturity does not allow the kidneys to concentrate urine as well as in older children and adults. This puts infants at particular risk for dehydration or overhydration, depending on the circumstances.COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS There are many different forms of medical treatment for GI disorders. In the hospital setting, most medical treatments will require a physician's order. The most common treatments and medications used for GI disorders are listed in Common Medical Treatments 20.1 and Drug Guide 20.1 . Both tables provide essential information about medical treatments and medications used in pediatric GI disorders. Refer to these tables as needed while completing the remainder of the chapter. NURSING PROCESS OVERVIEW FOR THE CHILD WITH A GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDER Nursing care of the child with a GI disorder includes nursing assessment, nursing diagnosis, planning, interventions, and evaluation. It is important to individualize each step of this process for each child. A general understanding of the GI tract and the most common disorders can help the nurse to individualize the nursing care plan. Remember Ethan, the 2-month-old with vomiting and irritability? What additional health history and physical examination assessment information should you obtain? Assessment The assessment of the child with a GI disorder includes a health history, physical examination, and laboratory and diagnostic testing. Health History A thorough health history is very important in the assessment of a child with a GI disorder. The health history includes past history (previous illnesses/surgeries), past family history, present illness (when the symptoms began and how this differs from the child's normal status), and how the child's symptoms have been managed up to this point (relevant medical records/home treatments). Detailed knowledge of the past medical and surgical history of the child may reveal bowel resection, previous intestinal infections, and dietary issues and problems. The child's growth patterns can also be an instrumental part of the health history and may help to generate a timeline for when the current problems appeared. The family history is also extremely important in identifying common genetic or familial GI symptoms or disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, or food allergies. The history of the present illness and symptoms can often distinguish chronic problems from acute disorders. All of these pieces of the health history require descriptive questions and answers from both the nurse and the child, or the child's family. The person providing the history must be able to provide accurate details of the health history. Physical Examination Perform the physical examination of the child from the least invasive part of the examination to the most invasive. It is important for the child to remain as relaxed as possible during this part of the assessment. INSPECTION AND OBSERVATION Inspect and observe the child's color, hydration status, abdominal size and shape, and mental status. Color. First observe the child's skin, eye, and lip color. Pale skin or lips in a child with a GI disorder may be a sign of anemia or dehydration. During liver dysfunction, the bilirubin levels can rise, causing the skin to look jaundiced (yellow). The sclerae can also become icteric (yellowed in color), further indicating that the liver is not functioning correctly. Inspect the abdomen for distended veins, which can indicate abdominal or vascular obstruction or distention. As in any part of a physical assessment, watch for areas of ecchymosis (bruising), which may be a sign of abuse. Hydration Status. The child's hydration status often indicates how severe the current GI illness is. Dehydration can occur rapidly in children, especially in infants and young children. The oral mucosa should be pink and moist. Skin turgor should be elastic. Decreased turgor and tenting indicate dehydration. During crying, especially in infants, the absence of tears may indicate dehydration. Assess the amount of urine output the child has had in the past 24 hours. Abdominal Size and Shape. Inspect the size and shape of the abdomen while the child is standing and while the child is lying supine. The abdomen should be flat when the child is supine. An especially protuberant (bulging outward) abdomen suggests the presence of ascites, fluid retention, gaseous distention, or even a tumor. However, many children (toddlers in particular) have a prominent \"pot-bellied\" abdomen as a normal variation of their anatomy (Weber & Kelley, 2010). A depressed or concave abdomen could indicate a high abdominal obstruction or dehydration. Inspect the umbilicus for color, odor, discharge, inflammation, and herniation. Mental Status. Perform a brief mental status examination of all children with GI complaints. Mental status changes can occur in many instances, such as during severe dehydration, with anaphylactic reactions to foods or medicines, when ammonia levels are elevated with severe liver disease, and with other metabolic disorders. Irritability and restlessness are usually the early signs of mental status changes. Lethargy (sluggishness or abnormal drowsiness) and listlessness can occur much more rapidly in children than in adults. It is important to identify this promptly and treat it emergently. AUSCULTATION As with all children, auscultate bowel sounds in all four quadrants. Hyperactive bowel sounds may be noted in children with diarrhea or gastroenteritis. Hypoactive or absent bowel sounds may signify an obstructive process. The nurse can determine absence of bowel sounds after a 5-minute period of auscultation. This can be extremely difficult to perform with children and infants, who may be uncooperative during the examination. Immediately report hypoactive or absent bowel sound findings to the physician or nurse practitioner. PERCUSSION Dullness or flatness is normally found along the right costal margin and 1 to 3 cm below the costal margin of the liver. The area above the symphysis pubis may be dull in young children with full bladders, which is a normal finding. Percussion of the remainder of the abdomen should reveal tympany. Note abnormal findings.PALPATION Reserve palpation for last in the sequence of abdominal examination. First, lightly palpate the abdomen to assess for areas of tenderness, lesions, muscle tone, turgor, and cutaneous hyperesthesia (a finding in acute peritonitis). Then perform deep palpation from the lower quadrants upward to best feel the liver edge, which should be firm and smooth. In infants and children, palpate the liver during inspiration below the right costal margin. The tip of the spleen may be palpated also during inspiration; it should be 1 to 2 cm below the left costal margin. Palpable kidneys, except in neonates, may indicate tumor or hydronephrosis. The sigmoid colon can be palpated in the left lower quadrant. The cecum may be felt in the right lower quadrant as a soft mass. Areas of firmness or masses may indicate tumor or stool in the abdomen. Tenderness in the abdomen is not a normal physical finding. Right upper quadrant tenderness could indicate liver enlargement. Right lower quadrant pain, including rebound tenderness (pain upon release of pressure during palpation), can be a warning sign of appendicitis; immediately report any positive findings to a physician. Palpate the external inguinal canals for the presence of inguinal hernias, often elicited by having the child turn the head and cough, or blow up a balloon. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 20.1 gives information about the tests most often ordered by physicians for children with GI illnesses. Some of these tests are ordered in the hospital setting; others are done on an outpatient basis. Typically, the nurse is involved directly in specimen collection while a specifically trained person performs the diagnostic tests. Regardless of who performs the test, nurses must be familiar with preparation guidelines for the child, how each test is performed, and normal and abnormal findings and their significance in order to provide appropriate child and family education. Teaching Guidelines 20.1 gives tips on collecting stool specimens. Nursing Diagnoses, Goals, Interventions, and Evaluation Upon completion of a thorough assessment, the nurse might identify several nursing diagnoses, including: Risk for deficient fluid volume Diarrhea Constipation Risk for impaired skin integrity Imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements Pain Ineffective breathing pattern Risk for caregiver role strain Disturbed body image After completing an assessment on Ethan, you note the following: weight 10 lbs, length 23.5 inches, head circumference 40.75 cm. Head is round with sunken anterior fontanel, eyes appear sunken, mucous membranes are dry, heart rate 158, breath sounds clear with respiratory rate of 42, positive bowel sounds in all four quadrants, difficulty palpating abdomen due to crying. Based on these assessment findings, what would your top three nursing diagnoses be for Ethan? Nursing goals, interventions, and evaluation for the child with a GI disorder are based on the nursing diagnoses. Nursing Care Plan 20.1 can be used as a guide in planning nursing care for the child with a GI disorder. Individualize the nursing care plan based on the child's symptoms and needs. Refer to Chapter 14 for detailed information about pain management. Additional information will be included later in the chapter as it relates to specific disorders. Based on your top three nursing diagnoses for Ethan, describe appropriate nursing interventions. Stool Diversions Children may undergo stool diversions for a variety of GI disorders. Surgical procedures involve the creation of an ostomy, primarily an ileostomy or colostomy, by bringing a portion of the small or large intestine to the surface of the abdomen ( Fig. 20.1 ). Ostomy pouches are worn over the ostomy site to collect stool. The pouch must be of an appropriate size and it should fit around the stoma properly ( Fig. 20.2 ). The pouch may be tucked inside the diaper or underwear or angled to fit outside of the diaper/underwear. Contemporary pouches cannot be seen under most clothing because they are designed to lie flat against the body. Avoid tight or constricting clothing around the stoma site. Teach families to store ostomy supplies in a cool, dry place. Educate parents to inform school staff that the child should be allowed to use the water fountain and the bathroom without restriction, and the school nurse should have extra ostomy supplies available. Ostomy care for a child can be challenging due to the child's normal growth and development as well as activity. Empty the ostomy pouch and measure for stool output several times per day. The stool may be semisolid to very liquid in consistency depending on the location of the stoma. Liquid stool output can be acidic, causing irritation and severe burn-like areas on the surrounding skin, so special attention to skin care around the ostomy site is essential. Products such as powders and pastes are available to help protect the skin. The stoma should be moist and pink or red, demonstrating proper circulation to the intestine ( Fig. 20.3 ). Immediately notify the provider if the stoma is not moist and pink or red. Also notify the provider if the volume of stool output is greatly increased, or if the stoma is prolapsed or retracted. Perform ostomy care as needed; pouches usually need to be changed every 1 to 4 days. Refer to Nursing Procedure 20.1 for an explanation of the steps for changing an ostomy pouch. COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS 20.1 GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERSDRUG GUIDE 20.1 COMMON DRUGS FOR GI DISORDERS COMMON LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS 20.1 Teaching Guidelines 20.1 STOOL SPECIMEN COLLECTION VARIATIONS If the child is in diapers, use a tongue blade to scrape a specimen into the collection container. If the child has runny stool, a piece of plastic wrap in the diaper may catch the stool specimen. Very liquid stool may require application of a urine bag to the anal area to collect the stool. The older ambulatory child may first urinate in the toilet, and then the stool specimen may be retrieved from the new or clean collection container that fits under the seat at the back of the toilet. For the bedridden child, collect the stool specimen from a clean bedpan (do not allow urine to contaminate the stool specimen). Send the specimen to the laboratory immediately for accuracy of results. NURSING CARE PLAN 20.1 Overview for the Child With a Gastrointestinal Disorder NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Fluid volume, risk for deficit: risk factors may include excessive losses through vomiting or diarrhea, inadequate oral intake, possible NPO status (particularly in the surgical child) Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will maintain adequate fluid volume as evidenced by elastic skin turgor; moist, pink oral mucosa; presence of tears; urine output 1 mL/kg/hour or more. Interventions: Maintaining Fluid Balance Maintain IV line and administer IV fluid as ordered to maintain fluid volume. Offer small amounts of oral rehydration solution frequently to maintain fluid volume. Small amounts are usually well tolerated by children with diarrhea and vomiting. When symptoms have lessened or resolved, reintroduce regular diet to reduce number of stools, provide adequate nutrition, and shorten duration of effects of illness. Avoid high-carbohydrate fluids such as Kool-aid and fruit juice, as they are low in electrolytes, and increased simple carbohydrate consumption can decrease stool transit time. Assess hydration status (skin turgor, oral mucosa, presence of tears) every 4 to 8 hours to evaluate maintenance of adequate fluid volume. Assess adequacy of urine output to assess end-organ perfusion. Maintain strict intake and output record and weigh child daily to evaluate effectiveness of rehydration. Weigh child daily: accurate weight is one of the best indicators of fluid volume status in children. Discourage milk products and fluids that contain high levels of sugar during the acute phase of illness, as these products may worsen diarrhea. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Diarrhea; may be related to inflammation of small intestines, presence of infectious agents or toxins, possibly evidenced by loose liquid stools, hyperactive bowel sounds, or abdominal cramping Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will experience decrease in diarrhea: will have bulkier stool as per normal routine.Interventions: Relieving Diarrhea Maintain clear liquid diet no longer than 24 hours, as prolonged clear liquids will result in continued liquid (\"starvation\") stools. Avoid milk products until diarrhea improves: temporary poor absorption from villus injury follows viral diarrhea. Encourage complex carbohydrate foods to bulk up the stools. Add fat to carbohydrates to increase intestinal transit time to encourage water absorption (bulks up stool). NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Constipation, related to GI obstructive lesions, pain on defecation, diagnostic procedures, inadequate toileting, or behavioral stool holding, possibly evidenced by change in character or frequency of stools, feeling of abdominal or rectal fullness or pressure, changes in bowel sounds, and abdominal distention Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will experience improvement in constipation by passing daily soft bowel movement without pain or straining. Intervention: Relieving Constipation Palpate for abdominal distention, percuss for dullness, and auscultate for bowel sounds to assess for signs of constipation. Encourage adequate fluid intake to soften the stool. Administer medications as ordered to keep stool moving on daily basis. Encourage activity as tolerated: immobility contributes to constipation. The child with stool withholding should sit on the toilet twice daily, preferably after breakfast and dinner, to maximize chances for successful stool passage by taking advantage of the gastrocolic reflex. For behavioral stool holding, use rewards or stickers to encourage appropriate toileting. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Skin integrity, risk for impaired: risk factors include frequent loose stools, poor nutritional status, presence of stoma, acidic gastric contents contact with skin if gastrostomy present Outcome Identification and Evaluation Infant's skin will remain intact: buttocks skin will be free from rash, excoriation. In the child with an ostomy: skin surrounding stoma will remain intact: free from redness, rash, excoriation. Intervention: Maintaining Skin Integrity Change diapers frequently to limit acidic stool content contact with skin. Use barrier diaper cream to protect skin. Assess skin integrity at every diaper change to recognize skin changes early so that corrective measures can begin. Leave diaper area open to air several times a day if redness is present so that air can circulate and skin healing can be facilitated. Use plain water or only mild soap to cleanse the skin with diaper changes to avoid pH changes that contribute to diaper area skin breakdown. Avoid diaper wipes that contain fragrance or alcohol if the skin is red or has a rash, as both alcohol and perfume cause stinging if used on nonintact skin and can worsen skin breakdown. For the child with an ostomy: Ensure proper fit of the ostomy appliance/pouch to avoid acidic stool contact with skin. Use a barrier wafer (e.g., Stomahesive\u00ae or Duoderm\u00ae) to attach appliance: avoids repeated pulling of adhesive tape from skin. If redness occurs, use barrier/healing cream or paste on skin around stoma to promote healing and prevent further skin breakdown. Consult enterostomal therapy nurse as needed to provide additional support. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Nutrition: imbalanced, less than body requirements; may be related to inability to ingest, digest, or absorb nutrients; intestinal pain after eating; decreased transit time through bowel; or psychosocial factors, possibly evidenced by lack of appropriate weight gain or growth, weight loss, aversion to eating, poor muscle tone, or observed lack of intake Outcome Identification and Evaluation Nutritional status will be maximized: child will maintain or gain weight appropriately. Intervention: Maintaining Appropriate Nutrition Encourage favorite foods (within prescribed diet restrictions if present) to maximize oral intake. Administer enteral tube feedings as ordered to maximize caloric intake. Add butter, gravy, or cheese as appropriate to foods (if allowed within diet restrictions) to increase caloric intake. Encourage high-quality, high-calorie snacks between meals, so as not to interfere with meal intake. Document response to feeding to determine feeding tolerance. Limit intake of calorie-free beverages: beverages should contain nutrients and calories. Consult nutritionist for appropriate diet supplementation recommendations. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Breathing pattern, ineffective, related to postoperative immobility, abdominal pain interfering with breathing, use of narcotic analgesics as evidenced by increased work of or shallow breathing, tachypnea, decreased lung aeration Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will demonstrate effective breathing pattern: respiratory rate normal for age, absence of accessory muscle use, adequate aeration with clear breath sounds throughout all lung fields. Intervention: Promoting Effective Breathing Patterns Turn, cough, and deep breathe every 2 hours to encourage adequate aeration and discourage fluid pooling in lungs. In the infant or toddler, turn every 2 hours and use percussor or chest physiotherapy to prevent pooling of secretions. Play games to encourage deep breathing (blow out penlight, blow cotton ball across bedside table with straw, etc.): children are more likely to cooperate with interventions if play is involved. In the developmentally able child, encourage incentive spirometer use every 2 hours to improve lung aeration. Demonstrate/encourage use of pillow splinting with coughing to decrease abdominal pain and stress on incision. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Caregiver role strain, risk for: risk factors may include infant with congenital defect, child with chronic illness, marginal caregiver coping patterns, long-term stress, complexity and quantity of care child requires Outcome Identification and Evaluation Caregiver will exhibit emotional health: verbalizes concerns calmly, participates in child's care, and demonstrates knowledge of resources. Intervention: Easing Caregiver Role Strain Assess parental behavior to identify role strain. Provide emotional support and encourage talking about feelings, fears, and concerns: to promote trust in nurse as a source of emotional support. Arrange for and/or encourage respite care for child: provides parent with time away from continual care. Consult social services to identify community resources available for caregiver support (home health, support group, etc.). Encourage parent to meet own needs and find personal time to increase energy level and self-esteem, ultimately enhancing the quality of care given. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Body image disturbance; may be related to presence of stoma, loss of control of bowel elimination, scars from multiple surgical procedures, or effects of treatment regimen, possibly evidenced by verbalization of negative feelings about body, refusal to look at stoma or participate in care Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child or teen will demonstrate acceptance of change in body image by verbalization of adjustment; looking at, touching, and caring for body; and returning to previous social involvement. Intervention: Promoting Proper Body Image Observe child's coping mechanisms to reinforce their use in times of stress. Acknowledge denial, anger, and other feelings as normal to support child/teen through difficult transition. Allow child gradual introduction to stoma to ease transition. Encourage child/teen to participate in care, as this sense of control will contribute to positive self-esteem.

Boston, MA: Author.STRUCTURAL ANOMALIES OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT Structural anomalies of the GI tract include cleft lip and palate, omphalocele and gastroschisis, hernias (inguinal and anorectal Lip Palate Cleft lip and palate ( Fig. 20.4 ) is the most common congenital craniofacial anomaly, occurring once in every 700 births worldwide. It occurs frequently in association with other anomalies and has been identified in more than 350 syndromes (Curtin & Boekelheide, 2010). The most common anomalies associated with cleft lip and cleft palate include heart defects, ear malformations, skeletal deformities, and genitourinary abnormality. Complications of cleft lip and palate include feeding difficulties, altered dentition, delayed or altered speech development, and otitis media. The infant with cleft lip may have difficulty forming an adequate seal around a nipple in order to create the necessary suction for feeding and may also experience excessive air intake. Gagging, choking, and nasal regurgitation of milk may occur in babies with cleft palate. Excessive feeding time, inadequate intake, and fatigue contribute to insufficient growth. Primary or permanent teeth may be missing, malformed, or unusually positioned. Children with cleft palate may have a nasal quality to the speech as well as delays in speech development. Optimally, speech articulation should be clear by 4 years of age, or additional surgical intervention may be necessary (Curtin & Boekelheide, 2010). The opening in the cleft palate contributes to build-up of fluid in the middle ear (otitis media with effusion), which can lead to an acute infection (acute otitis media). Long-lasting otitis media with effusion leads to temporary and sometimes permanent hearing loss (Curtin & Boekelheide, 2010). FIGURE 20.4 The cleft lip may extend all the way through the vermilion border and up into the nostril, or it may be significantly smaller. The cleft palate may be a small opening or may involve the entire palate. Pathophysiology Development of the cleft occurs early in pregnancy. The tissue that forms the lip ordinarily fuses by 5 to 6 weeks of gestation, and the palate closes between 7 and 9 weeks of gestation. Therefore, if either the lip or palate does not fuse, then the infant is born with a cleft. Cleft lip or cleft palate may occur in isolation from one another, but 50% of infants born with cleft lip also have cleft palate (Curtin & Boekelheide, 2010). The cleft may be unilateral (the left side is affected more often) or bilateral. Therapeutic Management Babies with cleft lip and cleft palate are usually managed by a specialized team that may include a plastic surgeon or craniofacial specialist, oral surgeon, dentist or orthodontist, prosthodontist, psychologist, otolaryngologist, nurse, social worker, audiologist, andspeech-language pathologist. Many children's hospitals offer these services in one location, such as a craniofacial specialty center. Historically, cleft lip has been repaired surgically around the age of 2 to 3 months and cleft palate at 9 to 18 months. Early repair of the cleft lip restores a normal appearance to the child's face and may improve parent-infant bonding. Regardless of the timing of the surgical repair, however, surgical revision of the palate may be required as the child grows. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 696 . Assessment findings pertinent to cleft lip and palate are discussed below. Health History For the newborn, explore pregnancy history for risk factors for development of cleft lip and cleft palate, which include: Maternal smoking Prenatal infection Advanced maternal age Use of anticonvulsants, steroids, and other medications during early pregnancy When an infant or child with cleft lip or palate returns for a clinic visit or hospitalization, inquire about feeding difficulties, respiratory difficulties, speech development, and otitis media. Physical Examination Observe the infant for the presence of the characteristic physical appearance of cleft lip. The cleft may involve the lip only or extend up into the nostril ( Fig. 20.5 ). Cleft palate may be visualized on examination of the mouth. Palpate with a gloved finger to discover mild clefts. FIGURE 20.5 Cleft lip. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Cleft lip may be diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound, but it is diagnosed most commonly at birth by the classic physical appearance.Nursing Management Refer to Nursing Care Plan 20.1 for nursing diagnoses and interventions related to airway maintenance, fluid balance promotion, and restoration of family processes, and to Chapter 14 for pain management. These should be individualized for the particular situation. In addition to the nursing diagnoses and related interventions discussed in Nursing Care Plan 20.1 , interventions common to cleft lip and cleft palate follow. Preventing Injury to the Suture Line It is critical to prevent injury to the facial suture line or to the palatal operative sites. Do not allow the infant to rub the facial suture line. To prevent this, position the infant in a supine or side-lying position. It may be necessary to use arm restraints to stop the hands from touching the face or entering the mouth. Clean the suture line as ordered by the surgeon. Possible care options include using petroleum jelly on the facial suture line or a lip-protective device such as a Logan bow (curved thin metal apparatus) or a butterfly adhesive, both of which protect and maintain the suture line. Protect the palate operative site. Avoid putting items in the mouth that might disrupt the sutures (e.g., suction catheter, spoon, straw, pacifier, or plastic syringe). Prevent vigorous or sustained crying in the infant, because this may cause tension on either suture line. Ways to prevent crying include administering medications as needed for pain and providing other comfort or distraction measures, such as cuddling, rocking, and anticipation of needs. Promoting Adequate Nutrition Preoperatively, the baby with a cleft lip may demonstrate enhanced growth patterns if breastfed. The contour of the breast against the lip may allow for a better seal to be maintained for adequate sucking (Reilly, Reid, Skeat, & the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine Clinical Protocol Committee, 2007). Some infants will be fed with a special cleft lip nipple ( Fig. 20.6 ). Parent and surgeon preference will determine the method of feeding. Burp the infant well to expel excess air taken in during difficulty with sucking. The infant with unrepaired cleft palate is at risk for aspiration with oral feeding. In some instances a prosthodontic device may be created to form a false palate covering. This device may prevent breast milk or formula from being aspirated. Breastfeeding may be effective in the infant with cleft palate due to the pliability of the breast and the fact that breast tissue may cover the opening in the palate. Postoperatively, some surgeons allow breastfeeding to be resumed almost immediately (Reilly et al., 2007). In the bottle-fed infant special nipples or feeders may have to be used. When the suture line is healed, ordinary feeding may resume.FIGURE 20.6 (A) Specialty feeding devices used for infants with cleft lip and cleft palate. (B) An infant uses a Haberman feeder. Encouraging Infant-Parent Bonding For some parents, the appearance of a cleft lip is appalling (Curtin & Boekelheide, 2010). Encourage parents to hold the medically stable infant immediately after delivery to encourage bonding. Acknowledge normal feelings of guilt, anger, and sadness. Support the parents in providing care for the infant, particularly feeding, which is viewed as a significant nurturing function. Provide education about the anticipated surgical procedure and eventual normal appearance of the infant's lip. Providing Emotional Support Many families will benefit from support in addition to that received from the craniofacial team. Refer parents to the Cleft Palate Foundation or a parent-to-parent support network, links to which can be found on . See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . anomalies in which the esophagus and trachea do not separate normally during embryonic development. Esophageal atresia refers to a congenitally interrupted esophagus where the proximal and distal ends do not communicate; the upper esophageal segment ends in a blind pouch and the lower segment ends a variable distance above the diaphragm ( Fig. 20.7 ). Tracheoesophageal fistula is an abnormal communication between the trachea and esophagus. When associated with esophageal atresia, the fistula most commonly occurs between the distal esophageal segment and the trachea. The incidence of esophageal atresia is 1 per 3,000 to 4,000 live births (Blackburn, 2007). Both defects are thought to be the result of incomplete separation of the lung bed from the foregut during early fetal development. A large percentage of newborns with either of these defects also have other congenital anomalies (Blackburn, 2007). Nursing Assessment Review the maternal history for polyhydramnios. Often this is the first sign of esophageal atresia because the fetus cannot swallow and absorb amniotic fluid in utero, leading to accumulation (Blackburn, 2007). Soon after birth, the newborn may exhibit copious, frothy bubbles of mucus in the mouth and nose, accompanied by drooling. Note abdominal distention as air builds up in the stomach. In esophageal atresia, a gastric tube cannot be inserted beyond a certain point because the esophagus ends in a blind pouch. The newborn may have rattling respirations, excessive salivation and drooling, and \"the three C's\" (coughing, choking, and cyanosis) if feeding is attempted. The presence of a fistula increases the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonitis and atelectasis due to aspiration of food and secretions. Diagnosis is made by radiograph showing either an inserted gastric tube appearing coiled in the upper esophageal pouch (indicating esophageal atresia) or air in the gastrointestinal tract (indicating the presence of a fistula between the trachea and esophagus). Nursing Management Nursing management focuses on preparing the newborn and parents for surgery and providing meticulous postoperative care. Providing Preoperative Care Preoperative nursing interventions include: Initiate nothing by mouth (NPO) status. Elevate the head of the bed 30 to 45 degrees to prevent reflux and aspiration. Monitor hydration status and fluid and electrolyte balance; administer and monitor parenteral intravenous (IV) fluid infusions. Assess and maintain the patency of the orogastric tube; monitor the functioning of the tube, which is attached to low continuous suction; and avoid irrigation of the tube to prevent aspiration. Have oxygen and suctioning equipment readily available should the newborn experience respiratory distress.FIGURE 20.7 Esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula. (A) The most common type of esophageal atresia, in which the esophagus ends in a blind pouch and a fistula connects the trachea with the distal portion of the esophagus. (B) The upper and distal portions of the esophagus end in a blind pouch. (C) The esophagus is one segment, but a portion of it is narrowed. (D) The upper portion of the esophagus connects to the trachea via a fistula. Assist with diagnostic studies to rule out other anomalies. Use comfort measures to minimize crying and prevent respiratory distress; provide nonnutritive sucking. Inform the parents about the rationales for the aspiration prevention measures. Document frequent observations of the newborn's condition. Providing Postoperative Care Surgery consists of closing the fistula and joining the two esophageal segments. Postoperative care involves closely observing all of the newborn's body systems to identify any complications. Expect to administer total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and antibiotics until the esophageal anastomosis is proven intact and patent. Then begin oral feedings, usually within a week after surgery. Keep the parents informed of their newborn's condition and progress. Closely assess the newborn during feeding and report any difficulty with swallowing. Provide parent teaching. Demonstrate and reinforce all teaching prior to discharge. Omphalocele and Gastroschisis Omphalocele and gastroschisis are congenital anomalies of the anterior abdominal wall. An omphalocele is a defect of the umbilical ring that allows evisceration of the abdominal contents into an external peritoneal sac. Defects vary in size; they may be limited to bowel loops or may include the entire gastrointestinal tract and liver ( Fig. 20.8 ). Bowel malrotation is common, but the displaced organs are usually normal. Omphaloceles are associated with an abnormal karyotype or genetic syndrome in more than 50% of the cases (Thilo & Rosenberg, 2011). This anomaly is usually detected during routine prenatal ultrasound of the fetus or during investigation of an increased -fetoprotein level (Glasser, 2011). Gastroschisis is a herniation of the abdominal contents through an abdominal wall defect, usually to the left or right of the umbilicus (Glasser, 2011). Gastroschisis differs from omphalocele in that there is no peritoneal sac protecting the herniated organs, and thus exposure to amniotic fluid makes them thickened, edematous, and inflamed. Gastroschisis is associated with significant newborn mortality and morbidity rates. Despite surgical correction, feeding intolerance, failure to thrive, and prolonged hospital stays occur in nearly all newborns with this anomaly (Glasser, 2011). Each of these diagnoses requires that a pediatric surgeon be available at delivery to determine the extent of the defect and complications. Nursing Assessment Review the maternal history for factors associated with high-risk pregnancies, such as maternal illness and infection, drug use, smoking, and genetic abnormalities. They contribute to placental insufficiency and the birth of a small-for-gestational-age or preterm newborn, the populations in which both of these abdominal defects most commonly occur. The combined incidence of both congenital abdominal wall anomalies is 1 in 2,000 births (Glasser, 2011).FIGURE 20.8 (A) Omphalocele: a membranous sac covers the exposed organs. (B) In gastroschisis, the organs are not covered by a membrane. Omphalocele and gastroschisis are observed readily. Note the appearance of the protrusion on the abdomen and evidence of a sac. Inspect the sac closely for the presence of organs, most commonly the intestines but sometimes the liver. Also inspect the contents for any twisting of the intestines. Note the color of the organs within the sac and measure the size of the omphalocele. Also perform a complete physical examination of the newborn. Typically these congenital conditions are associated with other congenital anomalies, such as those involving the cardiovascular, genitourinary, and central nervous systems. Nursing Management Nursing management of newborns with omphalocele or gastroschisis focuses on preventing hypothermia, maintaining perfusion to the eviscerated abdominal contents by minimizing fluid loss, and protecting the exposed abdominal contents from trauma and infection. The abdominal contents are covered with a non-adherent sterile dressing in such a fashion as to avoid causing trauma to the contents. Strict sterile technique is necessary to prevent contamination. A radiant warmer is necessary to maintain the newborn's temperature. Covering the dressing with Saran\u00ae wrap may help to decrease heat and fluid loss (Glasser, 2011). Maintain low suction to an orogastric tube to prevent intestinal distention. Establish an IV line to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance and provide a route for antibiotic therapy. As much as 2-3 times maintenance may be required in order to maintain perfusion to the exposed organs and tissues (Glasser, 2011). Monitor the newborn's fluid status frequently. Closely observe the exposed bowel for vascular compromise, such as changes in color or a decrease in temperature, and report these immediately. Providing Postoperative Care Surgical repair of both defects occurs after initial stabilization and comprehensive evaluation for any other anomalies. It may have tooccur in stages, depending on the defect. Postoperative care involves providing pain management, monitoring respiratory and cardiac status, monitoring intake and output, assessing for vascular compromise, maintaining the orogastric tube to suction, documenting the amount and color of drainage, and administering ordered medications and treatments. Also be alert for complications, such as short bowel syndrome (see section on short bowel syndrome later in the chapter). Promoting Parent-Newborn Interaction Give the parents continued support and progress reports on their newborn. They may be distraught at the sight of the anomaly, and they may be frightened to touch their newborn. Encourage the parents to touch the newborn and participate in care as much as possible. Because of the nature of this defect, bonding opportunities will be limited initially. However, strongly encourage frequent visiting. In addition, provide information to the parents about the defect, treatment modalities, and prognosis. After surgery, instruct the parents in care measures and provide them with home care instructions. Anticipate the need for a referral to a home health care agency and community resources for support. Anorectal Malformations Imperforate anus is a congenital malformation of the anorectal opening. The defect is identified in the newborn period. The level (high or low) of the defect significantly influences the outcome in terms of fecal continence as well as management ( Fig. 20.9 ). Numerous other congenital anomalies may be associated with imperforate anus (Sundaram, Sondheimer, & Furuta, 2011) ( Box 20.1 ). The nurse may encounter the infant with imperforate anus and an ostomy when the child is admitted to the hospital at several months of age for corrective surgery. Infants often require a staged repair in which the bowel is connected to the anal opening or an anal opening is created. When the final repair is achieved, the stoma will be closed and the infant will pass stool through the anal opening. Surgical intervention is needed for both high and low types of imperforate anus. Surgery for a high type of defect involves a colostomy in the newborn period, with corrective surgery performed in stages to allow for growth. Surgery for the low type of anomaly, which frequently includes a fistula, involves closure of the fistula, creation of an anal opening, and repositioning of the rectal pouch into the anal opening. A major challenge for either type of surgical repair is finding, using, or creating adequate nerve and muscle structures around the rectum to provide for normal evacuation. Nursing Assessment In the newborn, observe for an appropriate anal opening. If the anal opening exists, observe for passage of meconium stool within the first 24 hours of life (generally not passed in the infant with imperforate anus). Assess urine output to identify accompanying genitourinary problems. Assess for signs of intestinal obstruction, which may occur as a result of the malformation. These include abdominal distention and bilious vomiting. BOX Renal agenesis Hypospadias Vesicoureteral reflux Bladder exstrophy Cardiac anomalies Skeletal anomalies Nursing Management Nursing management focuses on preparing the newborn for surgery and providing postoperative care. Preoperatively, maintain thenewborn's NPO status and provide gastric decompression. Administer IV therapy and antibiotic therapy as ordered and monitor the newborn's hydration status. It is important to provide the parents with a full explanation of the defect, surgical options, potential complications, typical postoperative course, and long-term care needed. Prepare the parents for the possibility that the newborn may require an ostomy. Provide support to the parents and family. Postoperative care includes ensuring adequate pain relief, maintaining NPO status and gastric decompression until normal bowel function is restored, and providing colostomy care, if applicable. After the intestinal pull-through procedure is completed, it will be the first time that stool has passed through the anal sphincter. The stool may be quite loose depending on the severity of the imperforate anus. The perianal skin is at significant risk for breakdown. Therefore, use a barrier cream on the area and clean it once daily with soap and water. Otherwise, wipe liquid stool off the barrier cream with mineral oil and cotton balls. Most of the barrier cream will remain intact, protecting the infant's perianal area. FIGURE 20.9 Imperforate anus, in which the rectum ends in a blind pouch. Take Note! To decrease the drying associated with frequent cleaning, avoid baby wipes and frequent use of soap and water. Meckel Diverticulum Meckel diverticulum is the result of an incomplete fusion of the omphalomesenteric duct during embryonic development. This causes a fibrous band to connect the small intestine to the umbilicus, known as a Meckel diverticulum. It is the most common congenital anomaly of the GI tract, occurring in 2% of the population (Rabinowitz & Li, 2010). Complications (only seen in about 5% of children) associated with Meckel diverticulum include bleeding, anemia, and intestinal obstruction such as volvulus and intussusception (Rabinowitz & Li, 2010). Surgical correction of the Meckel diverticulum is necessary in children who have complications. The surgery is usually done to remove the diverticulum itself. At times, ileal resection is necessary. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 696 . Assessment findings pertinent to Meckel diverticulum are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Bleeding Anemia Severe colicky abdominal pain (in children with associated intestinal obstruction) Physical Examination Assess the child for an acute abdomen. Observe for abdominal distention, auscultate for hypoactive bowel sounds, and then palpatefor an abdominal mass, guarding (tensing of the abdominal wall muscles), and rebound tenderness. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Common laboratory and diagnostic tests ordered for assessment of Meckel diverticulum include: Abdominal radiographs to rule out an acute obstructive process Meckel scan (conclusive) Stool tests for color, consistency, and occult blood (usually positive in Meckel diverticulum) Complete blood count (CBC) to assess for anemia Nursing Management If anemia is significant, administer ordered blood products (packed red blood cells) to stabilize the child before surgery. Administer intravenous fluids and maintain NPO status for symptomatic children while further evaluation is being performed. Immediately report an acute abdomen to a physician or nurse practitioner. Postoperative care will vary depending on the surgery that was performed. Provide child and family education as necessary to relieve anxiety related to the diagnosis and surgical intervention. Refer to the Nursing Care Plan 20.1 for additional information. Inguinal and Umbilical Hernias Inguinal and umbilical hernias are defects that occur during fetal development. Either may be visible at birth, and inguinal hernias may be noted later in life (Sundaram et al., 2011). Inguinal Hernia When the processus vaginalis fails to close completely during embryonal development, an inguinal hernia may occur. This allows the abdominal or pelvic viscera to travel through the internal inguinal ring into the inguinal canal The hernia sacs that develop most often contain bowel in males and fallopian tubes or ovaries in females. Boys are more likely than girls to develop inguinal hernia and premature infants are particularly susceptible, with an incidence of up to 30% (Sundaram et al., 2011). Surgical correction of the inguinal hernia is usually performed when the infant is several weeks old and has been thriving. Nursing Assessment Assess infants and children with an inguinal hernia for the presence of a bulging mass in the lower abdomen or groin area ( Fig. 20.10 ). It may be possible to visualize the mass, but often the mass is seen only during crying or straining, making it difficult to actually identify in the clinic setting. Nursing Management If a mass is felt upon palpation, the physician or nurse practitioner may attempt to reduce the hernia by pushing it back through the external inguinal ring. The physician or nurse practitioner may ask the nurse to assist in a reduction, most likely helping to hold the child in a position that will allow the physician or nurse practitioner to reduce the hernia. If reduction is not possible even with sedation, the hernia could be incarcerated (Sundaram et al., 2011). An incarcerated hernia could eventually lead to bowel strangulation.FIGURE 20.10 (A) Inguinal hernia: note the bulge in the inguinal (groin) area. (B) Umbilical hernia: note the protrusion in the umbilical area. Reduction is only a temporary method of managing inguinal hernias; they must be corrected surgically. The hernia should be manually reduced as needed until the time of the surgery, so teach the family how to reduce the hernia. Instruct the family to contact the surgeon immediately if the hernia becomes irreducible. Provide routine pre- and postoperative care during inguinal hernia surgical repair, including child and family education to relieve anxiety. Take Note! Tell the parents that if the child's inguinal hernia becomes hard, discolored, or painful (evidenced by inconsolable crying), they should immediately call the physician or nurse practitioner to determine the next course of action (office visit or emergency room visit). Umbilical Hernia Umbilical hernia occurs commonly in preterm infants and much more frequently in African Americans compared to Caucasians (Sundaram et al., 2011). An umbilical hernia is caused by an incomplete closure of the umbilical ring, allowing intestinal contents to herniate through the opening. Unlike inguinal hernias, most umbilical hernias are not corrected surgically. Most children will have spontaneous closure of the umbilical hernia by 5 years of age (Sundaram et al., 2011). Surgical correction is necessary only for the largest umbilical hernias that have failed to close by the time the child is 5 years old. Nursing Assessment Assess whether the hernia can be reduced. Notify the surgeon if the hernia will not reduce. Incarceration is extremely rare, but when it does occur, the child will report abdominal pain, tenderness, or redness at the umbilicus (see Fig. 20.10 ).Nursing Management Since operative repair is not as likely with umbilical hernias as with inguinal hernias, the aim of nursing management is education. Teach the child and family how to reduce the hernia. The child may have some self-esteem issues related to the large protrusion of the unrepaired umbilical hernia. Teach the child coping skills to help relieve anxiety. Take Note! The use of home remedies to reduce an umbilical hernia should be discouraged because of the risk of bowel strangulation. This includes taping a quarter over a reduced umbilical hernia and the use of \"belly bands\" (Children's Hospital Boston, 2010).ACUTE GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS Acute GI disorders include dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea, oral Dehydration Dehydration occurs more readily in infants and young children than it does in adults. The risk is increased in infants and young children because they have an increased extracellular fluid percentage and a relative increase in body water compared to adults. Increased basal metabolic rate, increased body surface area, immature renal function, and increased insensible fluid loss through temperature elevation also contribute to the increased risk for dehydration in infants and young children as compared to adults. Dehydration left unchecked leads to shock, so early recognition and treatment of dehydration is critical to prevent progression to hypovolemic shock. The goals of therapeutic management of dehydration are to restore appropriate fluid balance and to prevent complications. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 696 . Assessment findings pertinent to dehydration are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history are included in Comparison Chart 20.1 , which compares the clinical manifestations of mild, moderate, and severe dehydration. Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors for dehydration such as: Diarrhea Vomiting Decreased oral intake Sustained high fever Diabetic ketoacidosis Extensive burns Take Note! Nurses must be able to assess a child's hydration status accurately and intervene quickly. Children are at higher risk than adults for hypovolemic shock. Dehydrated children may deteriorate very quickly and experience shock. Physical Examination and Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Assess the child's hydration status, including heart rate, blood pressure, skin turgor, fontanels, oral mucosa, eyes, temperature and color of extremities, mental status, and urine output. Children usually compensate well initially; their heart rate increases in moderate dehydration, but blood pressure remains normal until it decreases in severe dehydration. Nursing Management Nursing goals for the infant or child with dehydration are aimed at restoring fluid volume and preventing progression to hypovolemia. Provide oral rehydration to children for mild to moderate states of dehydration (see Teaching Guidelines 20.2 ). Children with severe dehydration should receive intravenous fluids. Initially, administer 20 mL/kg of normal saline or lactated Ringer, and then reassess the hydration status (refer to Chapter 31 for further specifics regarding hypovolemic shock). COMPARISON CHART 20.1 DEHYDRATION Teaching Guidelines 20.2 ORAL REHYDRATION THERAPY Oral rehydration solution (ORS) should contain 75 mmol/L sodium chloride and 13.5 g/L glucose (standard ORS solutions include Pedialyte, Infalyte, and Ricelyte). Tap water, milk, undiluted fruit juice, soup, and broth are NOT appropriate for oral rehydration. Children with mild to moderate dehydration require 50 to 100 mL/kg of ORS over 4 hours. After reevaluation, oral rehydration may need to be continued if the child is still dehydrated. When rehydrated, the child can resume a regular diet. Adapted from Stanton, B., Evans, J. B., & Batra, B. (2011). Oral rehydration therapy. Retrieved October 9, 2011, from http://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral- rehydration-therapy Once initial fluid balance is restored, the physician or nurse practitioner may order intravenous fluids at the maintenance rate or as much as 1.5 times maintenance. Maintenance fluid requirements refer to the amount needed under conditions of normal hydration. Maintenance fluid requirements may be determined with the use of the formula found in Box 20.2 . In the example provided in Box 20.2 , a 23-kg child will need maintenance fluid equivalent to 65 mL/hour. The same anatomic and physiologic differences that make infants and young children susceptible to dehydration also make them susceptible to overhydration. Thus, continuously evaluate hydration status and be aware of the appropriateness of intravenous fluid orders. BOX 20.2 FORMULA FOR FLUID MAINTENANCE 100 mL/kg for first 10 kg 50 mL/kg for next 10 kg 20 mL/kg for remaining kg Add together for total mL needed per 24-hour period. Divide by 24 for mL/hour fluid requirement. Thus, for a 23-kg child: 100 \u00d7 10 = 1,000 50 \u00d7 10 = 500 20 \u00d7 3 = 60 1,000 + 500 + 60 = 1,560 1,560/24 = 65 mL/hour Adapted from Johns Hopkins Hospital, Custer, J. W., Rau, R. E., & Lee, C. K. (2008). The Harriett Lane handbook (18th ed.). St. Louis, MO: Mosby.Vomiting Vomiting is the forceful expulsion of gastric contents through the mouth. It occurs as a reflex with three different phases: Prodromal period: nausea and signs of autonomic nervous system stimulation Retching Vomiting Vomiting in infants and children has many different causes and is considered to be a symptom of some other condition. Table 20.1 lists common causes of vomiting. Therapeutic management of vomiting most often involves slow oral rehydration and at times may require administration of antiemetics. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 696 . Assessment findings pertinent to vomiting are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Note onset and progression of symptoms. The assessment of an infant or child with vomiting should include a history of the vomiting events, including: Contents/character of the emesis Effort and force of vomiting episodes Timing (in relation to meals, as well as time of day) Contents and character of the vomitus may give clues to the cause of vomiting. Bilious vomiting is never considered normal and suggests an obstruction, whereas bloody emesis can signify esophageal or GI bleeding (Sundaram et al., 2011). Assess the effort and force of vomiting to identify whether the episodes are effortful and projectile, as with pyloric stenosis, or effortless, as is often seen in gastroesophageal reflux. The timing of the vomiting also is helpful in determining the cause. Vomiting that occurs several hours past meals could signify delayed gastric emptying. When vomiting occurs upon waking or in the middle of the night, particularly if it is associated with headaches, an intracranial lesion or tumor may be suspected. Note any events associated with the vomiting, such as diarrhea or pain. Diarrhea may occur with viral gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Pain in the epigastric area could signify peptic ulcer disease, pancreatitis, or cholecystitis. Assess the child's past medical history to identify preexisting illnesses, drug abuse, trauma, prescribed medications, and previous abdominal surgery. Risk factors for vomiting include exposure to viruses, certain medication use, and overfeeding in an infant.Physical Examination Perform a physical examination, noting the child's general appearance. Note hydration status, as well as mental status changes. Note the quality of bowel sounds upon auscultation. Palpate the abdomen for the presence of abdominal masses, tenderness, or signs of trauma. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Laboratory studies may be ordered to assess the child's hydration status or to rule out certain causes of vomiting, such as urinary tract infection, pancreatitis, or an acute infectious process. Common laboratory and diagnostic tests ordered for assessment of the cause of vomiting include: Abdominal ultrasound Upper GI series Plain abdominal radiographs Nursing Management Nursing management focuses on promoting fluid and electrolyte balance. Oral rehydration is accomplished successfully in most outpatient cases of simple vomiting. Teach the primary caregiver about oral rehydration (refer to Teaching Guidelines 20.2 ). In the child with mild to moderate dehydration resulting from vomiting, withhold oral feeding for 1 to 2 hours after emesis, after which time oral rehydration can begin. Give the infant or child 0.5 to 2 ounces of oral rehydration solution every 15 minutes, depending on the child's age and size. Most infants and children can retain this small amount of fluid if fed the restricted amount every 15 minutes. As the child improves, larger amounts will be tolerated. Take Note! Homemade oral rehydration solution can be made by combining 1 quart of water (can be water poured from cooking rice if desired), 8 teaspoons sugar, and 1 teaspoon salt. If oral rehydration is not possible due to continued nausea and vomiting, intravenous fluids will likely be ordered. In some cases, antiemetics may be used to help control the vomiting. Some antiemetics can cause drowsiness or other side effects and should not be used until a definitive diagnosis is made or severe pathologic processes can be excluded (Sundaram et al., 2011). Educate the family regarding the prevention of vomiting and use of antiemetic therapy. Take Note! Ginger capsules, ginger tea, and candied ginger are generally useful in reducing nausea, are safe for use in children, and usually produce no side effects (White, 2007). Diarrhea Diarrhea is either an increase in the frequency or a decrease in the consistency of stool. Diarrhea in children can either be acute or chronic. Acute infectious diarrhea (gastroenteritis) remains the leading cause of death for children worldwide. In the United States, over 3.5 million infants experience diarrhea yearly, leading to more than 500,000 office visits and 55,000 hospitalizations (Tablang, Grupka, & Wu, 2009). Pathophysiology Acute diarrhea in children is most commonly caused by viruses, but it may also be related to bacterial or parasitic enteropathogens. Viruses injure the absorptive surface of mature villous cells, resulting in decreased fluid absorption and disaccharidase deficiency. Bacteria produce intestinal injury by directly invading the mucosa, damaging the villous surface, or releasing toxins. Acute diarrhea may be bloody or nonbloody. The viral, bacterial, and parasitic causes of acute infectious diarrhea are discussed in Box 20.3 . Diarrhea may also occur in relation to antibiotic use. Risk factors for acute diarrhea include recent ingestion of undercooked meats, foreign travel, day care attendance, and well water use (Tablang et al., 2009). Though most cases of diarrhea in children are of acute origin, diarrhea may also occur chronically. Chronic diarrhea is diarrhea that lasts for more than 2 weeks. This type of diarrhea is not usually caused by serious illnesses. The causes of chronic diarrhea are listed according to age groups in Box 20.4 .Since most cases of diarrhea are acute and viral in nature, therapeutic management of diarrhea is usually supportive (maintaining fluid balance and nutrition). Probiotic supplementation may decrease the length and extent of diarrhea (Tablang et al., 2009). Bacterial and parasitic causes of diarrhea may be treated with antibiotics or antiparasitic medications, respectively. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 696 . Assessment findings pertinent to diarrhea are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Important information related to the course of the diarrhea includes: Number and frequency of stools Duration of symptoms Stool volume Associated symptoms (abdominal pain, cramping, nausea, vomiting, fever) Presence of blood or mucus in the stool Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as: Likelihood of exposure to infectious agents (well water, farm animals, day care attendance) Dietary history Family history of similar symptoms Recent travel Child's age (to identify common etiology for that age group) Physical Examination INSPECTION Assess the child with diarrhea for dehydration. Observe the child's general appearance and color. In mild dehydration, the child may appear normal. In moderate dehydration, the eyes may have decreased tear production or sunken orbits. Mucous membranes may also be dry. Mental status may be compromised with moderate to severe dehydration, as evidenced by listlessness or lethargy. Skin may be nonelastic or exhibit tenting, signifying lack of proper hydration. Abdominal distention or concavity may be present. Urine output may also be decreased if the child is dehydrated. Stool output may be available to assess for color and consistency. Inspect the anal area for presence of redness or rash related to increased stool volumes and increased frequency. AUSCULTATION Auscultate bowel sounds to assess for presence of hypoactive or hyperactive bowel sounds. Hypoactive bowel sounds may indicate obstruction or peritonitis. Hyperactive bowel sounds may indicate diarrhea/gastroenteritis. PERCUSSION Percuss the abdomen. Note any abnormalities. The presence of abnormalities on examination for a diagnosis of acute or chronic diarrhea would indicate a pathologic process. PALPATION Tenderness in the lower quadrants may be related to gastroenteritis. Rebound tenderness or pain should not be found on palpation. If found, it could indicate appendicitis or peritonitis. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of diarrhea include: Stool culture: may indicate presence of bacteria Stool for ova and parasites (O&P): may indicate the presence of parasites Stool viral panel or culture: to determine presence of rotavirus or other virusesBOX 20.3 CAUSES OF ACUTE INFECTIOUS DIARRHEA BOX 20.4 CAUSES OF CHRONIC DIARRHEA BY AGE EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 20.1 EFFECTS OF PROBIOTICS USE ON THE COURSE OF DIARRHEA STUDY Diarrhea (more than three loose, watery stools in a 24-hour period) occurs frequently in children. Most cases of diarrhea are caused by viruses, and symptomatic treatment is the only available therapy. The authors reviewed 23 randomized controlled studies that included a total of over 1,900 participants. The studies evaluated the use of probiotics as compared with placebo or no treatment in relation to the severity and length of diarrhea. Findings A variety of probiotics were noted to reduce diarrhea in infants and children as well as adults. Several of the studies demonstrated a shortened course of diarrhea when probiotics were used. The results were statistically significant, leading the authors to determine that probiotic therapy during acute diarrhea may be beneficial. Nursing ImplicationsProbiotics are available as supplements: capsules or powder that may be sprinkled on food. Additionally, live culture yogurt contains probiotics. Recommend these additions to the diet of older infants or children with acute diarrhea. Adapted from Allen, S. J., Okoko, B., Martinez, E., Gregorio, G., & Dans, L. F. (2007). Probiotics for treating infectious diarrhoea. The Cochrane Library 2007, 4. Indianapolis, IN: John Wiley & Sons. Stool for occult blood: may be positive if inflammation or ulceration is present in the GI tract Stool for leukocytes: may be positive in cases of inflammation or infection Stool pH/reducing substances: to see if the diarrhea is caused by carbohydrate intolerance Electrolyte panel: may indicate dehydration Abdominal radiographs (KUB): presence of stool in colon may indicate constipation or fecal impaction (hardened immobile bulk of stool); air-fluid levels may indicate intestinal obstruction Nursing Management Nursing management of the child with diarrhea focuses on restoring fluid and electrolyte balance and providing family education. Restoring Fluid and Electrolyte Balance Continue the child's regular diet if the child is not dehydrated. Initial nursing management of the dehydrated child with diarrhea is focused on fluid and electrolyte balance restoration. Refer to Nursing Care Plan 20.1 on page 703 . Probiotic supplementation while a child is taking antibiotics for other disorders may reduce the incidence of antibiotic-related diarrhea (Land & Martin, 2008) (see Common Medical Treatments 20.1 , and Evidence-Based Practice 20.1 ). After rehydration is achieved, it is important to encourage the child to consume a regular diet to maintain energy and growth. Take Note! Avoid prolonged use of clear liquids in the child with diarrhea because \"starvation stools\" may result. Also avoid fluids high in glucose, such as fruit juice, gelatin, and soda, which may worsen diarrhea (Fleisher & Matson, 2011). Providing Family Education Teach the parents the importance of oral rehydration therapy (see Teaching Guidelines 20.2 ). The physician may order medication therapy. In such instances, teach the importance of finishing all prescribed antibiotic therapy. After the cause of the diarrhea is known, teach the child and family how to prevent further occurrences. As most cases of acute diarrhea are infectious, provide education about proper hand-washing techniques and transmission route. Chronic diarrhea is often a result of excessive intake of formula, water, or fruit juice, so teach the parents about appropriate fluid intake. Oral Candidiasis (Thrush) Oral candidiasis (thrush) is a fungal infection of the oral mucosa. It is most common in newborns and infants. Children at risk for thrush include those with immune disorders, those using corticosteroid inhalers, and those receiving therapy that suppresses the immune system (e.g., chemotherapy for cancer). Antibiotic use may also contribute to thrush. Additionally, fungal infection may be transmitted between the infant and breastfeeding mother. Therapeutic management includes treatment with oral antifungal agents such as Mycostatin (nystatin) or fluconazole. Nursing Assessment Assess for risk factors for oral candidiasis such as young age, immune suppression, antibiotic use, use of corticosteroid inhalers, or presence of fungal infection in the mother. Inspect the oral mucosa. Thrush appears as thick white patches on the tongue, mucosa, or palate, resembling curdled milk ( Fig. 20.11 ). Unlike milk retained in the mouth, the patches do not easily wipe off with a swab or washcloth. Also assess for the presence of candidal diaper rash (beefy-red rash with satellite lesions). Determine the extent to which the presence of the lesions is interfering with the infant's ability to feed. The lesions may cause significant discomfort.FIGURE 20.11 Thick white patches in the infant with oral candidiasis (thrush). Diagnosis is usually based on clinical presentation. However, a careful scraping of the lesions can be sent out for fungal culture. Nursing Management Nursing management of the child with thrush includes administering medications and providing family education. Administering Medications Ensure appropriate administration of oral antifungal agents. Administer Mycostatin suspension four times per day following feeding to allow the medication to remain in contact with the lesions. In the younger infant, apply Mycostatin to the lesions with a cotton-tipped applicator. The older infant or child can easily swallow the pleasantly flavored suspension. An advantage of fluconazole is its once- daily dosing, but monitor infants and children receiving it for hepatotoxicity. Unlike Mycostatin, it is important to administer fluconazole with food to decrease the side effects of nausea and vomiting. Educating the Family If the mother is also infected, she must receive antifungal treatment as well. Fungal infection of the breast can cause the mother a great deal of pain with nursing, but if appropriately treated breastfeeding can continue without interruption. Stress appropriate hand washing. It is important to keep bottle nipples and pacifiers clean. Infants and young children often mouth their toys, so it is important to clean them appropriately. Explain to parents of infants with thrush the importance of reporting diaper rash because fungal infections in the diaper area often occur concomitantly with thrush and also need to be treated. Take Note! Geographic tongue is a benign, noncontagious condition. A reduction in the filiform papillae (bumps on the tongue) occurs in patches that migrate periodically, thus giving a map-like appearance to the tongue, with darker and lighter, higher and lower patches. Do not confuse the lighter patches of geographic tongue with the thick white plaques that form on the tongue with thrush. Oral Lesions A number of oral lesions may affect infants and children. A few of the most common are aphthous ulcers, gingivostomatitis (from herpes simplex virus), and herpangina. Table 20.2 lists the causes of common oral lesions. Regardless of type, oral lesions are often painful and can interfere with the child's ability to eat. Therapeutic management of oral lesions varies depending on the cause. Nursing Assessment Explore the health history for the presence of risk factors such as immune deficiency, cancer chemotherapy treatment, exposure toinfectious agents, trauma, stress, or celiac or Crohn disease. Note the onset of the lesion(s) and progression over time. Question the parent or child about the presence of sore throat or dysphagia (occurs with herpangina). Inspect the oral cavity, including the tongue, buccal mucosa, palate, and hypoglossal area. Note the presence of lesions and their distribution. Refer to Table 20.2 for descriptions and illustrations of various oral lesions. Inspect the pharynx, which may be red with herpangina. Generally the diagnosis is based on the history and clinical presentation, but occasionally oral lesions are cultured for herpes simplex virus (HSV). Nursing Management The primary concerns with oral lesions are pain management and maintenance of hydration. A corticosteroid-containing dental paste used for aphthous ulcers is formulated to \"stick\" to mucous membranes, so the lesion area should be as dry as possible prior to application of the paste. Children do not care for having the paste applied and will often resist. Older children with herpangina or stomatitis can \"swish and spit\" various formulations of \"magic mouthwash\" (typically a combination of liquid diphenhydramine, liquid acetaminophen, and milk of magnesia); they may offer some pain relief. Common over-the-counter medications such as Anbesol, Oragel, and Kank-A may be helpful for topical pain relief, though oral analgesics are often necessary. The child with herpangina is typically a toddler or preschooler (Gompf, Casanas, Carrington, & Cunha, 2010). It may be very difficult to coach a young child to drink fluids when his or her mouth is hurting. Playing games and offering favorite fluids and popsicles may encourage adequate oral intake. It is important to avoid carbonated beverages and citrus juices when oral lesions are present as they can cause further stinging and burning. Take Note! Viscous lidocaine should be used with caution in younger children as a topical treatment for numbing the lesions or as a swish-and-spit treatment because they may swallow one of the most common conditions requiring surgery in the first 2 months of life (Singh & Kass, 2010). In pyloric stenosis, the circular muscle of the pylorus becomes hypertrophied, causing thickness in the luminal side of the pyloric canal ( Fig. 20.12 ). This thickness creates a gastric outlet obstruction, causing nonbilious vomiting that presents between weeks 2 and 4 of life. The vomiting becomes more frequent and forceful as time goes on and is often projectile. The incidence is 2 to 4 per 1,000 live births, and it occurs more in males than females (4:1), with 30% of all case being in first-born males (Singh & Kass, 2010). The cause of pyloric stenosis is probably multifactorial. FIGURE 20.12 (A) Hypertrophied pylorus muscle and narrowed stomach outlet. (B) In pyloromyotomy, the pylorus is incised, thus increasing the diameter of the pyloric outlet. Pyloric stenosis requires surgical intervention. A pyloromyotomy is performed to cut the muscle of the pylorus and relieve the gastric outlet obstruction (see Fig. 20.10 ). Postoperative complications are rare. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 696 . Assessment findings pertinent to hypertrophic pyloric stenosis are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Forceful, nonbilious vomiting, unrelated to feeding position Hunger soon after vomiting episode Weight loss due to vomiting Progressive dehydration with subsequent lethargy Possible positive family history Physical Examination and Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Palpate for a hard, moveable \"olive\" in the right upper quadrant (hypertrophied pylorus). If an easily palpable mass is felt, no furthertesting is necessary and a surgical consult is called. If no mass is identified, a pyloric ultrasound may be ordered to identify a thickened hypoechoic ring in the region of the pylorus. An upper GI series may identify pyloric stenosis as well, but an ultrasound is less invasive and is considered more diagnostic of pyloric stenosis. Assess laboratory values to determine if the infant has metabolic alkalosis resulting from dehydration. Take Note! It may be difficult to examine the infant's abdomen when pyloric stenosis is suspected because of the infant's extreme irritability. A pacifier or nipple dipped in glucose water may soothe the infant long enough to perform the abdominal examination. Nursing Management Preoperative management of infants with pyloric stenosis is aimed at fluid management and correcting abnormal electrolyte values. Family anxiety is high during this time because of the impending surgery for an otherwise healthy infant. Provide emotional support to the family. Teach them about the surgical procedure and what to expect postoperatively. After surgery, infants usually resume oral feedings after 1 to 2 days. Intussusception Intussusception is a process that occurs when a proximal segment of bowel \"telescopes\" into a more distal segment, causing edema, vascular compromise, and, ultimately, partial or total bowel obstruction ( Fig. 20.13 ). Intussusception most often occurs in otherwise healthy infants younger than 1 year of age. It is three times more likely in males than females (Blanco & Chahine, 2011). A lead point (i.e., pathologic point) may cause the telescoping. Examples of lead points are Meckel diverticulum, duplication hemangiomas, tumors, or the appendix. A barium enema is successful at reducing a large percentage of intussusception cases; other cases are reduced surgically. If surgical reduction is unsuccessful or bowel necrosis has occurred, a portion of the bowel must be resected. FIGURE 20.13 In intussusception, the intestine telescopes upon itself. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 696 . Assessment findings pertinent to intussusception are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Sudden onset of intermittent, crampy abdominal pain Severe pain (children usually draw up their knees and scream) Vomiting Diarrhea Currant-jelly stools, gross blood, or Hemoccult-positive stools Lethargy Typically, symptoms flare and then regress. Between episodes, children may have no symptoms of intussusception. This return to a normal state is due to the intussusception reducing on its own. The child may be asymptomatic and may appear well when presenting to the physician or nurse practitioner or emergency room. Again, this may be a sign that the bowel has reduced spontaneously. Assess the severity of pain, length of time the symptoms have been present, presence of vomiting, and stool patterns and color. Immediately report the presence of bilious vomiting, which occurs only in an obstructive situation. Also assess for signs and symptoms of acute peritonitis. Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors, such as cystic fibrosis or celiac disease. Physical Examination Palpate the abdomen for the presence of a sausage-shaped mass in the upper midabdomen; this is a hallmark sign of intussusception. Note any mental status changes. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Intussusception is usually diagnosed with an air or barium enema. Use of an enema may show the intussusception and also may reduce it, making the enema therapeutic. A pediatric surgeon should be available at the time the enema is given in case the enema is unsuccessful or perforation (rare) occurs. White blood cell elevation may occur and electrolytes may show signs of dehydration. Nursing Management Administer intravenous fluids and antibiotics before the diagnostic laboratory and radiograph studies are performed. Refer to Nursing Care Plan 20.1 for nursing management of the postoperative child. The parents may be very fatigued after dealing with a crying infant. They are often quite anxious about surgery in an otherwise healthy child. Offer emotional support and provide appropriate preoperative and postoperative education to the family. Malrotation and Volvulus Intestinal malrotation results from a disruption in embryonic development. When malrotation occurs, the intestine is abnormally attached and the mesentery narrows, twisting on itself (volvulus). If the volvulus involves the entire small bowel, it is termed a midgut volvulus. The main symptom of malrotation is bilious vomiting. Many children also have abdominal pain, shock symptoms, abdominal distention, tachycardia, and bloody stools. Most cases of malrotation will present in the first few weeks of life, but symptoms may occur in the older infant, child, or adult (Parish & Hatley, 2010). Therapeutic management of malrotation and volvulus is accomplished surgically. A Ladd procedure is performed, during which the intestine is straightened out and bands contributing to the misalignment are divided. If bowel necrosis has occurred (rare), then an ostomy may be necessary. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 696 . Assessment findings pertinent to malrotation and volvulus are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include vomiting and abdominal pain. Since obstruction can occur with resulting necrosis of the bowel, immediately inform the physician if obstruction is suspected. Physical Examination and Diagnostic and Laboratory Tests Observe for severity of pain, auscultate for hypoactive bowel sounds, and palpate for abdominal guarding or rebound tenderness. Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of malrotation and volvulus include: KUB to reveal obstruction Upper GI series to identify the location of the duodenojejunal junction and corkscrew appearance of the twisted bowel Nursing Management When diagnostic testing reveals malrotation/volvulus, administer ordered intravenous fluids and intravenous antibiotics. Often a nasogastric tube is placed to decompress the stomach. Surgery is performed as soon as possible. After surgery, provide postoperative care of the child (see Nursing Care Plan 20.1 ). Provide continuous emotional support and family education. Appendicitis Appendicitis, an acute inflammation of the appendix, is the most common cause of emergent abdominal surgery in children (Sundaram et al., 2011). It occurs in all age groups; the median age in the pediatric population is 4 to 15 years (Albanese & Sylvester, 2010). Pathophysiology Appendicitis is due to a closed-loop obstruction of the appendix ( Fig. 20.14 ). It is thought that the obstruction is due to fecal material impacted into the relatively narrow appendix, though other causes such as ingested foreign bodies may exist. This causes a subsequent increase in the intraluminal pressure of the appendix, resulting in mucosal edema, bacterial overgrowth, and eventual perforation. Due to the fecal material in the appendix, perforation causes inflammatory fluid and bacterial contents to leak into the abdominal cavity, resulting in peritonitis. Diffuse peritonitis is more likely in younger children. Older children and adolescents have a more developed omentum, which walls off the inflamed or perforated appendix, often causing a focal abscess. Therapeutic Management Appendicitis is considered a surgical emergency because if left uncorrected, the appendix may perforate. Surgical removal of the appendix is necessary and is often accomplished via a minimally invasive laparoscopic technique. In the case of perforation, an open surgical procedure is usually required, and lavage of the abdominal cavity may be performed to cleanse it of the infected fluid released from the appendix. Nursing Assessment Early diagnosis and intervention are the key elements to avoid perforation. For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 696 . Assessment findings pertinent to appendicitis are discussed below.FIGURE 20.14 (A) In appendicitis, the lumen of the appendix is obstructed, resulting in edema and compressed blood vessels. (B) As appendicitis progresses, pain may become localized at McBurney's point (a point midway between the anterior superior iliac crest and the umbilicus). Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Appendicitis may be gradual, but symptoms usually do not come and go; they remain persistent and intensify. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Vague abdominal pain in the initial stages, localizing to the right lower quadrant over a few hours Nausea and vomiting (which usually develop after the onset of pain) Small-volume, frequent, soft stools, often confused with diarrhea Fever (usually low grade unless perforation occurs, which results in high fever) Physical Examination Children with appendicitis often appear anorexic and ill. They often cannot walk or climb up onto the examination table without assistance. Upon palpation, maximal tenderness occurs over the McBurney point in the right lower quadrant (see Fig. 20.14 ). Take Note! If the child's abdominal pain is suddenly relieved without intervention, suspect perforation and notify the physician immediately. Assess the abdomen for acute peritonitis, as indicated by diffuse abdominal tenderness or distention. Immediately report positive findings to a physician or nurse practitioner. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of appendicitis include: Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan: performed to visualize the appendix for further evaluation Laboratory testing: may reveal an elevated white blood cell count C-reactive protein: may be elevated Nursing ManagementProvide pre- and postoperative care and child and family education (see Nursing Care Plan 20.1 ). Care depends on what was found during surgical exploration. A nonruptured, nongangrenous appendix usually requires no antibiotic therapy, so provide routine surgical care. In addition to routine surgical care, administer 48 to 72 hours of ordered antibiotics to the child with a suppurative or gangrenous (nonperforated) appendix to decrease the risk of postoperative infection. The child with a perforated appendix will require 7 to 14 days of intravenous antibiotic therapy in addition to normal postoperative care. Provide family teaching, because the child is often discharged home while still receiving intravenous antibiotic therapy.CHRONIC GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS Chronic GI disorders include gastroesophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease, constipation/encopresis, Hirschsprung disease, short bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, recurrent abdominal pain, failure to thrive, and chronic feeding problems. Gastroesophageal Reflux Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is passage of gastric contents into the esophagus. It is considered a normal physiologic process that occurs in healthy infants and children. However, when complications develop from the reflux of gastric contents back into the esophagus or oropharynx, it becomes more of a pathologic process known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GER occurs frequently during the first year of life; 85% of infants outgrow reflux by age 12 months (Sundaram et al., 2011). GER is particularly common in premature infants. Other possible diagnoses that can be mistaken for GER include food allergies, formula enteropathies, gastric outlet obstruction, malrotation, cyclic vomiting, and central nervous system lesions. Pathophysiology The process of GER occurs during episodes of transient relaxation of the LES, which can occur during swallowing, crying, or other Valsalva maneuvers that increase intra-abdominal pressure. Delayed esophageal clearance and gastric emptying, highly acidic gastric contents, hiatal hernia (protrusion of the stomach upward into the mediastinal cavity through the esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm), or neurologic disease may also be contributing factors associated with reflux. The signs and symptoms of GERD are often seen as a result of the damaging components of the refluxate (the pH of the gastric contents, bile acids, and pepsin). The longer the pH of the refluxate is below 4, the higher the risk for development of severe GERD (Weill, 2008). Symptoms of GERD in infants and children are listed below in the health history section. GERD may cause esophagitis, esophageal stricture, Barrett esophagus (a precancerous condition), or anemia from chronic esophageal erosion. Additionally, complications such as laryngitis, recurrent pneumonia, or asthma may occur. FIGURE 20.15 In the Nissen fundoplication, the fundus (upper portion of the stomach) is wrapped around the lower segment of the esophagus. Therapeutic Management Conservative medical management begins with appropriate positioning, such as elevating the head of the bed and keeping the infant or child upright for 30 minutes after feeding. Smaller, more frequent feedings may be helpful. If reflux does not improve with these measures, medications are prescribed to decrease acid production and stabilize the pH of the gastric contents. Also, prokinetic agents may be used to help empty the stomach more quickly, minimizing the amount of gastric contents in the stomach that the child can reflux. If the GERD cannot be medically managed effectively or requires long-term medication therapy, surgical intervention may be necessary. A Nissen fundoplication is the most common surgical procedure performed for antireflux therapy. The gastric fundus iswrapped around the lower 2 to 3 cm of the esophagus ( Fig. 20.15 ). Laparoscopic fundoplications are being performed as a way to minimize the recovery period and reduce potential complications. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 696 . Assessment findings pertinent to gastroesophageal reflux are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Note onset and progression of symptoms. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history include: Recurrent vomiting or regurgitation Weight loss or poor weight gain Irritability in infants Respiratory symptoms (chronic cough, wheezing, stridor, asthma, apnea) Hoarseness/sore throat Halitosis (mostly in older children) Heartburn or chest pain Abdominal pain Abnormal neck posturing (Sandifer syndrome) Hematemesis Dysphagia or feeding refusal Chronic sinusitis, otitis media Poor dentition (caused by acid erosion) Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as: Prematurity, noting prolonged ventilator use or chronic lung disease Dietary habits (e.g., chocolate, coffee, spicy or fatty foods, caffeine, formula-fed or breastfed, overeating or overfeeding) Current medications Smoking/alcohol use (older children) Food allergies Other GI disorders (gastric outlet dysfunction/hiatal hernia) or congenital abnormalities Feeding positions and patterns (especially important in infants) Sleeping positions/patterns Other medical history, such as asthma or recurrent infections/pneumonia Physical Examination The physical examination consists of inspection, auscultation, percussion, and palpation. INSPECTION Observe the child's general appearance and color. Infants and children with uncontrolled GER for a period of time may appear underweight or malnourished. Infants may be irritable due to painful regurgitation/reflux events. Note breathing patterns, because reflux-induced asthma may have developed. Acute life-threatening events (ALTEs) and apnea have been associated with severe GERD (Sundaram et al., 2011). Observe the child for cyanosis, altered mental status, and alterations in tone. Inspect emesis for blood or bile. AUSCULTATION Evaluate the lung fields for the presence of complications related to GERD, such as wheezing or pneumonia. No further pathologic findings related to GERD should be auscultated on examination. PERCUSSION Perform routine abdominal percussion, noting any abnormalities. No specific findings should be noted.PALPATION Use caution when palpating the abdomen, especially with infants with GERD, because it may induce vomiting. No abnormalities should be palpated. Take Note! Not all infants with GERD actually vomit. Those with \"silent\" GERD may only demonstrate irritability associated with feeding or posturing (arching back during or after feeding) and grimacing. Episodes of GERD often cause bradycardia, so if the above signs occur, they should be reported to the physician or nurse practitioner, even if the baby is not vomiting (Weill, 2008). Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of gastroesophageal reflux include: Upper GI series: though not sensitive or specific to GER, may show some reflux; studies are used to narrow down the differential diagnosis Esophageal pH probe study: quantifies GER episodes as they correlate to symptoms Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD): shows esophageal and gastric tissue damage from GERD Complete blood count: may demonstrate anemia if chronic esophagitis or hematemesis is present Hemoccult: may be positive if chronic esophagitis is present Nursing Management As with most GI disorders, initial nursing management is aimed at restoring proper fluid balance and nutrition. Refer to Nursing Care Plan 20.1 on page 703 . Additional considerations are reviewed below. Promoting Safe Feeding Techniques and Positioning Feeding adjustments are an essential part of reflux management. Give infants smaller, more frequent feedings using a nipple that controls flow well. Frequently burp the infant during feeds to control reflux. Thickening of the formula with products such as rice or oatmeal cereal can significantly help keep the formula and gastric contents down. Positioning after feedings is important. Keep infants upright for 30 to 45 minutes after feeding by holding them and/or elevating the head of the crib 30 degrees. Placing in infant seats or swings is not recommended as this increases intra-abdominal pressure (Weill, 2008). For older children, elevate the head of the bed as much as possible and restrict meals for several hours before bedtime. Maintaining a Patent Airway GERD symptoms often involve the airway. Maximize reflux precautions to keep the risk of airway involvement to a minimum. In rare instances, GERD causes apnea or an ALTE (Sundaram et al., 2011). In these cases, use an apnea or bradycardia monitor to monitor for such episodes. The monitor requires a physician's order and can be ordered through a home health company. Teach parents how to deal with these episodes, as their anxiety is very high. Provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) instruction to all parents whose children have had an ALTE previously. Educating the Family and Child The goals for the infant and child with gastroesophageal reflux are a decrease in symptoms, a decrease in the frequency and duration of reflux episodes, healing of the injured mucosa, and prevention of further complications of GERD. Teach the parents the signs and symptoms of complications. Explain that reflux is usually limited to the first year of life, though in some cases it persists. If medications are prescribed, thoroughly explain their use and their side effects (see Drug Guide 20.1 ). Providing Postoperative Care If the child requires fundoplication, a gastrostomy tube is often placed for use in the immediate postoperative period or for long-term feeding. In the immediate postoperative period, assess for pain, abdominal distention, and return of bowel sounds. If a gastrostomy tube is placed, it is often open to straight drain for a period of time postoperatively to keep the stomach empty and allow for the internal incision to heal. When bowel sounds have returned and the infant or child is stable, introduce feedings slowly (typically via the gastrostomy tube). Assess for tolerance of feedings (absence of abdominal distention or pain, minimal residual, and passage of stool). If the abdomen does become distended or the child has discomfort, open the gastrostomy tube to air to decompress the stomach.Assess the insertion site of the gastrostomy tube for redness, edema, or drainage. Keep the site clean and dry per surgeon or hospital protocol. Teach the parents how to care for the gastrostomy tube and insertion site and how to use the tube for feeding. Promoting Family and Child Coping Parents may experience a great deal of anxiety. Teach the family about all aspects of GERD to help promote coping. School-age children often have reflux episodes exhibited by postprandial vomiting, which can be very embarrassing for the children. Notify the school about the medical issues related to GER to minimize the situations for the child. Peptic Ulcer Disease Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is a term used to describe a variety of disorders of the upper GI tract that result from the action of gastric secretions ( Fig. 20.16 ). Mucosal inflammation and subsequent ulceration occur as a result of either a primary or a secondary factor. In children, duodenal ulcers are more common than gastric ulcers (Sundaram et al., 2011). Primary peptic ulcers are usually associated with Helicobacter pylori, a gramnegative organism that causes mucosal inflammation and in some cases more severe disease (Sundaram et al., 2011). H. pylori is found mostly in the duodenum. FIGURE 20.16 Peptic ulcer disease. Secondary peptic ulcers may occur as a result of an identifiable factor, such as excess acid production, stress, medications, or the presence of other underlying conditions. Secondary ulcers tend to be gastric in location as opposed to duodenal. Take Note! Severe stress, such as burns or another illness necessitating critical care, can contribute to the development of a peptic ulcer in children (Sundaram et al., 2011). Therapeutic Management PUD may be treated with antibiotics (if H. pylori is verified), histamine agonists, and/or proton pump inhibitors. If the child presents with a severe esophageal or gastric hemorrhage, a nasogastric tube may be placed to decompress the stomach. The child may requireintravenous infusion of a histamine-2 receptor antagonist or a proton pump inhibitor initially until the bleeding has stopped and the disease is stabilized. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 696 . Assessment findings pertinent to PUD are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Abdominal pain GI bleeding Vomiting Abdominal pain is the most common complaint of children with PUD. It is important to characterize the abdominal pain, as many other digestive disorders may mimic PUD. The pain tends to be dull and vague, mostly epigastric or periumbilical. Most often, children with PUD have pain that worsens after meals, and the pain may wake them at night. Vomiting may be noted in preschool and school-age children. Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as a family history of PUD or other GI diseases, or chronic salicylate or prednisone use. Take Note! Adolescents at increased risk for the development of PUD include those who use tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine (Sundaram et al., 2011). Physical Examination and Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Palpate the abdomen for the location of the pain, which is usually epigastric or periumbilical. Note the presence of blood in emesis or stools, as GI bleeding may occur. Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of PUD include the following: Laboratory studies: to identify anemia or H. pylori antibodies Urea breath test: to identify H. pylori gastritis Upper GI series: to detect presence of ulcerations Upper endoscopy: the definitive diagnostic test to look for ulceration and nodularity in the upper GI tract Biopsies: to assess for H. pylori, granulomas, eosinophils, or corrosive agents to identify the primary cause of PUD Nursing Management Hemodynamic stabilization should be the focus of nursing management if significant GI bleeding occurs. Once children are stabilized and tolerating oral feeds, they may be discharged to home. Provide discharge instructions on the following topics: Medications Dietary management (especially when allergic gastroenteropathy is found) Safety precautions (in cases of ingested substances) Stressors Prevention of disease recurrence Constipation and Encopresis Constipation is a very common problem seen in a pediatric practice, representing 3% to 10% of all pediatric outpatient visits (Montgomery & Navarro, 2008). Constipation is usually defined as failure to achieve complete evacuation of the lower colon. It is usually associated with difficulty in passing hard, dry stools but can sometimes be associated with passing small stools the size of marbles. Term newborns should pass a meconium stool within the first 24 hours of life. If this does not occur, the newborn is at risk for developing an underlying GI disorder. The bowel habits of both infants and children vary widely, so assess and treat each child on an individual basis. Breastfed infants mayproduce a stool with each feeding, though some will skip a few days between stools. Most bottle-fed babies will produce a stool one or two times per day, but they may go 2 to 3 days without producing a stool. Encopresis is a term used to describe soiling of fecal contents into the underwear beyond the age of expected toilet training (4 to 5 years of age). Encopresis is often seen as a result of chronic constipation and withholding of stool. As stool is withheld in the rectum, the rectal muscle can stretch over time, and this stretching of the rectum causes fecal impactions. Children who have a stretched rectal vault may experience diarrhea, where leakage occurs around a fecal mass. This is often an embarrassing issue that occurs with school- age children, and the child may hide his or her underwear to avoid punishment. Many psychological issues arise from chronic constipation and encopresis as the child may experience ridicule and shame (Burns, Dunn, Brady, Starr, & Blosser, 2009). Pathophysiology As stool passes through the colon, water is reabsorbed into the colon, resulting in a formed stool by the time it reaches the rectum. At this point, the anal sphincter relaxes to allow the passage of stool from the anus. In constipation, however, this relaxation does not occur. Most causes of constipation are functional in nature (inorganic) (Montgomery & Navarro, 2008). Children with functional constipation usually present with this problem during the toilet-training years. Children have a painful experience during defecation, which in turn creates a fear of defecation, resulting in further withholding of stool. Organic causes of constipation rarely occur in children. When they do occur, they may be a sign of a disease such as spina bifida or sacral agenesis. The causes of pediatric constipation are discussed in Table 20.3 . Therapeutic Management Once any organic process is ruled out as a cause, constipation may initially be managed with dietary manipulation such as increasing fiber and fluids. However, behavior modification is necessary for most children. Children need to relearn to allow bowel evacuation when stool is present. Children with severe constipation and withholding behaviors may not benefit from dietary management and may require laxative therapy. Sometimes mechanical disimpaction is required initially, followed by the above measures. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 696 . Assessment findings pertinent to constipation/encopresis are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Note the onset of symptoms as described by the parent/child. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history may include: Altered stooling patterns (size, frequency, amount, and color) Pain with defecation Withholding behaviors (postures to try to withhold the stool, such as crossing the legs, squatting or hiding in a corner, or \"dancing\") Complaints of abdominal pain and cramping and poor appetite Diarrhea leakage Soiling of undergarments It is important to note the duration of the symptoms to determine an acute onset versus a chronic disorder. Explore the child's past and current medical history for risk factors such as: Family history of GI disorders History of rectal bleeding or anal fissures Report of first meconium stool after 24 hours of age History of sexual abuse It is important to take an accurate dietary history as well as a history of fluid intake. Also explore current medication or laxative use. Physical Examination Physical examination of the child with constipation consists of inspection, auscultation, percussion, and palpation. INSPECTION Observe the child's general appearance. Note whether the abdomen appears distended or rounded. Observe the lower back for a deep pilonidal dimple with hair tuft, which is suggestive of spina bifida occulta. Flat buttocks may be suggestive of sacral agenesis. Inspect the anus for signs of fissures or soiling. Inspect the child's underwear for stains or smears, which are indicative of soiling. AUSCULTATION Auscultate bowel sounds to determine the possibility of an obstruction (hypoactive or absent bowel sounds) in the child with an acute case of constipation. PERCUSSION Percuss the abdomen to reveal dullness, which would indicate a fecal mass. PALPATION Palpate the abdomen for any tenderness or masses. The nurse may assist the physician or nurse practitioner with the performance of a rectal examination to assess for rectal tone and rectal vault size. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Laboratory and diagnostic tests are not routine with the diagnosis of functional constipation, but if an organic cause is suspected, the following laboratory and diagnostic tests would be ordered: Stool for occult blood: the presence of blood could indicate some other disease process Abdominal radiograph: large quantities of stool may be seen in the colon Sitz marker study: to detect colonic dysmotility Barium enema: out a stricture or Hirschsprung disease Rectal manometry: to evaluate rectal musculature dysfunction Rectal suction biopsy: to rule out Hirschsprung disease Nursing Management Nursing management for the infant or child with constipation is aimed at educating the child and family and promoting child and family coping. Refer to Nursing Care Plan 20.1 on page 703 . Additional considerations are reviewed below. Educating the Family and Child Teach parents how to assess for signs of constipation and withholding behaviors. Also provide guidelines on scheduling andsupervising bowel habits in reconditioning the child to use the toilet regularly. Teach parents to use positive reinforcement techniques. For example, when the child produces an adequate-volume bowel movement, reward him or her with stickers, extra playtime or television time, and so on. Dietary changes may help some children. High-fiber diets help to regulate bowel activity. Increasing fluid intake may also aid in bringing extra water into the bowel, thereby softening the stool. Infants and toddlers with constipation may be experiencing constipation from formula or milk changes. Therefore, manipulating the formula or milk may result in better bowel habits. NURSING PROCEDURE 20.2 Administering an Enema 1. Gather supplies (enema bag, lubricant, enema solution). 2. Wash hands and apply gloves. 3. Position the child: Infant or toddler on abdomen with knees bent Child or adolescent on left side with right leg flexed toward chest 4. Clamp the enema tubing, remove the cap, and apply lubricant to the tip. 5. Insert the tube into the rectum: 2.5 to 4 cm (1 to 1.5 inches) in the infant 5 to 7.5 cm (2 to 3 inches) in the child 6. Unclamp the tubing and administer the prescribed volume of enema solution at a rate of about 100 mL per minute. Recommended volumes: 250 mL or less for the infant 250 to 500 mL for the toddler or preschooler 500 to 1,000 mL for the school-age child 7. Hold the child's buttocks together if needed to encourage retention of the enema for 5 to 10 minutes. Educate families about the importance of compliance with medication use, if medication is ordered. Parents often are very anxious about the use of these medications, but stress to them that compliance is essential. Assess for improper laxative use based on the history of stool patterns. Many children present to their physician or nurse practitioner with fecal impaction or partial impaction. Teach parents how to disimpact their children at home; this often requires an enema or stimulation therapy. Nursing Procedure 20.2 gives instructions on enema administration in children. Explain the procedure to the child in developmentally appropriate terms. Enema administration can be uncomfortable, but calming measures, such as distraction and praise, provide a comforting environment. After the impaction is removed, promote regular bowel habits to keep the impaction from recurring. Promoting Child and Family Coping Childhood constipation can be a very stressful process for both the child and family. Behavior modification is necessary for many children. To facilitate daily bowel evacuation, the child should sit on the toilet twice a day (after breakfast and dinner) for 5 to 15 minutes. Instruct the family to keep a \"star\" or reward chart to encourage compliance. Parents should award the star for compliance with time sitting on the toilet and should not reserve rewards for successful bowel movements only. Weeks to months may be required to change the stooling pattern (Burns et al., 2009). Many parents seek counselors to help the entire family deal with the issues. Counseling is geared toward allaying the fears of a child who is afraid to defecate due to pain. Also, children who are older may have behavioral issues that need to be addressed. Psychological evaluation and possible behavioral therapy may need to be implemented if constipation becomes a power struggle. Consider This J ung Kim, 3 years old, is brought to the clinic by his parents with abdominal pain and a poor appetite. His mother states, \"He cries when I put him on the toilet.\" What other assessment information would you obtain? What education and interventions may be necessary for this child and family?Hirschsprung Disease (Congenital Aganglionic Megacolon) Hirschsprung disease is the most common cause of neonatal intestinal obstruction (Lee, Shekherdimian, & Dubois, 2009) ( Fig. 20.17 ). The disease is most commonly characterized by constipation in newborns. This is due to a lack of ganglion cells in the bowel, which causes inadequate motility in part of the intestine. These ganglion cells can be absent from the rectosigmoid colon all the way into the small intestine. Hirschsprung disease occurs in 1 of every 5,400 to 7,200 newborns (Lee et al., 2009). Therapeutic Management Surgical resection of the aganglionic bowel and reanastomosis of the remaining intestine are necessary to promote proper bowel function. There are several types of surgical procedures to correct this, usually performed in stages. The surgical resection requires the child to have an ostomy to divert the stool through a stoma on the abdomen. This allows the area of the resected bowel and anastomosis to heal before it is used. The ostomy is closed at a later date. FIGURE 20.17 Enlarged megacolon of Hirschsprung disease. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 696 . Assessment findings pertinent to Hirschsprung disease are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Newborn stool patterns are a key element in recognizing this diagnosis. Assess whether the newborn passed a meconium stool; most children with Hirschsprung disease do not pass a meconium stool within the first 24 to 48 hours of life. Also, newborns who required rectal stimulation to pass their first meconium stool or who passed a meconium plug should be evaluated for Hirschsprung disease. Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as a family history of Hirschsprung disease or Down syndrome, or intestinal atresia (lack of a normal opening) (Lee et al., 2009). Physical Examination Inspect and palpate the abdomen. The abdomen is typically distended, and, often, it is possible to palpate stool masses in the abdomen. Perform a rectal examination to assess for rectal tone and the presence of stool in the rectum. Often with Hirschsprung disease, no stool is present in the rectum. However, at the end of the rectal examination, when the finger is being withdrawn, a child with Hirschsprung disease may have a forceful expulsion of fecal material. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of Hirschsprung disease include: Barium enema: to look for a narrowing of the intestine Rectal suction biopsy: to demonstrate an absence of ganglion cells (definitive diagnosis)Nursing Management Nursing management includes providing postoperative care, performing ostomy care, and providing child and family education. Providing Postoperative and Ostomy Care Provide routine postoperative care and observe for the possible complication of enterocolitis (see Nursing Care Plan 20.1 ). The child with Hirschsprung disease may have either a colostomy or ileostomy, depending on the extent of disease in the intestine. In either case, perform proper ostomy care to avoid skin breakdown. Accurately measure stool output to assess the child's fluid volume status. Observe for the following signs and symptoms of enterocolitis: Fever Abdominal distention Chronic diarrhea Explosive stools Rectal bleeding Straining If any of the above symptoms are noted, immediately notify the physician or nurse practitioner, maintain bowel rest, and administer intravenous fluids and antibiotics to prevent the development of shock and possibly death. Providing Child and Family Education The family may be anxious and fearful about upcoming surgeries and possible complications. Help to relieve their anxiety by providing information about the diagnosis and the stages of surgical procedures the child will undergo. Provide postoperative teaching to educate parents on proper stoma care as well as medication management (to avoid dehydration, most children with Hirschsprung disease will be prescribed medications to slow stool output). Arrange for the family to consult with a wound care nurse to help them deal with the anxieties and care of newly placed stomas. Provide education about possible postsurgical problems, emphasizing the importance of prompt medical treatment for signs of enterocolitis. Short Bowel Syndrome Short bowel syndrome is a clinical syndrome of nutrient malabsorption and excessive intestinal fluid and electrolyte losses that occurs following massive small intestinal loss or surgical resection. The degree of malabsorption is usually related to the extent of resection of small bowel (Cuffari, 2009). The most common causes of short bowel syndrome are necrotizing enterocolitis, small intestinal atresia, gastroschisis, malrotation with volvulus, and trauma to the small intestine. The extent of malabsorption experienced by an individual child is dependent upon the extent of duodenal, ileal, and/or jejunal loss and the length of small intestine lost, as well as the type. If the terminal ileum is lost, vitamin B 12 deficiency and bile salt malabsorption may occur. If the ileocecal valve is lost, small bowel bacterial overgrowth is likely to occur, as well as poor intestinal motility. Therapeutic Management The child with short bowel syndrome is at risk for chronic complications. The goals of therapeutic management are to minimize bacterial overgrowth and to maximize the child's nutritional status. Antibiotics may be used to control bacterial overgrowth. Vitamin and mineral supplementation is necessary because the small intestine is usually where fat-soluble vitamins, calcium, magnesium, and zinc are absorbed. Antidiarrheal agents such as loperamide and gastric acid-suppressive medications may be used to decrease stool output. Many children with short bowel syndrome require TPN for extended periods to achieve adequate growth. Progression to enteral feeding may occur extremely slowly, depending on the intestine's response. Despite a markedly improved prognosis for these children, some will not do as well and may ultimately require intestinal and liver transplantation due to irreversible liver damage from long-term use of TPN. Nursing Assessment Elicit the health history, noting diarrhea, which is the primary symptom of short bowel syndrome. Note past history of bowel loss or resection as noted above. Assess the child's hydration state. Inspect the stool for consistency, color, odor, and volume. Review laboratory results, particularly chemistries, to evaluate hydration status, and liver function tests, which may reveal evolving cholestasis(impairment of bile flow) secondary to long-term TPN use. Nursing Management Nursing management focuses on encouraging adequate nutrition and promoting effective family coping. Encouraging Adequate Nutrition Treatment for short bowel syndrome can be a slow and tedious process. Most children will require TPN until they can tolerate enteral feeds without significant malabsorption. TPN is usually required for a lengthy time, so most children will require long-term intravenous access. Long-term intravenous access places the child at high risk for infection and resulting sepsis. Therefore, closely monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Immediately report to the physician or nurse practitioner any fevers or redness or drainage at the intravenous site. When started, enteral feeding must be administered very slowly to avoid further malabsorption. Usually the feeding is started continuously, 24 hours per day, via a feeding pump. Most children have long-term feeding tubes, usually gastrostomy tubes. Most of these children will require special formulas to promote absorption. Assess for feeding tube residuals and abdominal distention or discomfort. Strictly monitor intake and output to avoid dehydration. Assess the stool for signs of carbohydrate malabsorption. Administer vitamin and mineral supplementation, antidiarrheals, and antibiotics as ordered. Teach the family about use of enteral feeding tubes, feeding pumps, and medication administration. Promoting Effective Family Coping Children with short bowel syndrome are considered to be medically fragile for a lengthy period. There is much anxiety related to the initial bowel resection that resulted in short bowel. Long-term hospitalization is almost always required, causing parents to miss work and cutting down on the time they have to spend with other children. This can lead to even more anxiety about finances and relationships. Encourage families to become the experts on their child's needs and condition via education and participation in care. Provide teaching so that the family is better able to care for the child in an outpatient setting. Education focuses on information about TPN and central line care, enteral feedings, assessing for hydration status, and managing medications. Take Note! Maintaining long-term central venous access for TPN in infants can present a challenge. One-piece clothing with the central venous line (CVL) tubing exiting and secured on the back of the outfit can help discourage the infant from pulling on (and subsequently dislodging) the line. Inflammatory Bowel Disease Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis are the two major idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases of children. The causes are unknown. However, they may be due to an abnormal or uncontrolled genetically determined immunologic or inflammatory response to an environmental antigenic trigger, possibly a virus or bacterium (Haas-Beckert & Heyman, 2010). The features of Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis are listed in Comparison Chart 20.2 . Therapeutic Management Medication is used to control inflammation and symptoms. Medications commonly used include 5-aminosalicylates, antibiotics, immunomodulators, immunosuppressives, and anti-tumor necrosis antibody therapy. Dietary manipulation is also very important. COMPARISON CHART 20.2 FEATURES OF CROHN DISEASE AND ULCERATIVE COLITISFailure to respond to medical therapy may result in surgical intervention. Many children with ulcerative colitis eventually undergo a total proctocolectomy, with resulting ostomy, as a curative measure. Children or adolescents with Crohn disease may require surgery to relieve obstruction, drain an abscess, or relieve intractable symptoms. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 696 . Assessment findings pertinent to Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history include: Abdominal cramping Nighttime symptoms, including waking due to abdominal pain or urge to defecate Fever Weight loss Poor growth Delayed sexual development Children may be reluctant or unwilling to talk about their bowel movements, so explain the importance of doing so. Assess stool pattern history, including frequency, presence of blood or mucus, and duration of symptoms. Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors, such as: Family history of inflammatory bowel disease Family history of colon cancer Family history of immunologic disorders Physical Examination Assess the child's growth using growth charts to identify any poor growth patterns. Perform a full abdominal examination, noting tenderness, masses, or fullness. Inspect the perianal area to look for skin tags or fissures, which would be highly suspicious for Crohndisease. Assist the physician in performing a rectal examination to further assess the rectal area for blood or other lesions. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Laboratory test results may be normal. Results for children with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis are found in Comparison Chart 20.2 . Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of inflammatory bowel disease include: Radiologic studies such as upper GI series with small bowel series: may identify evidence of intestinal inflammation, estimate distribution and extent of disease, and help distinguish between Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis CT scan: to rule out suspected abscess Colonoscopy: to diagnose inflammatory bowel disease Upper endoscopy: to rule out affected mucosal tissue between the mouth and anus in children with upper abdominal complaints Nursing Management Nursing management focuses on teaching about disease management, teaching about nutritional management, teaching about medication therapy, and promoting family and child coping. Teaching About Disease Management The diagnosis of Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis can be very difficult for the child and family to comprehend. Provide teaching about the disease process and medication therapy to help the child and family understand the seriousness of the disease. The physician may discuss surgical options during uncontrolled flare-ups, but the nurse may be the person to whom the family members or child address their questions regarding surgery. Provide the family with information to help answer some of their questions and allay fears. Teaching About Nutritional Management Teach the child and family about nutritional management of the disease. For example, adequate nutrition with a high-protein and high- carbohydrate diet may be recommended. When the disease is active, lactose may be tolerated poorly, and vitamin and iron supplements will most likely be recommended. Explain that in severe cases enteral feeding tubes or TPN may be needed; this is rare but often induces remission. Teaching About Medication Therapy Medications are extremely important in controlling inflammatory bowel disease. Provide information about the following common medications used to control the disease: 5-Aminosalicylates (5-ASA): used to prevent relapse (usually used in ulcerative colitis) Antibiotics (usually metronidazole and ciprofloxacin): typically used in children who have perianal Crohn disease Immunomodulators (usually 6-mercaptopurine [6-MP] or azathioprine): used to help maintain remission. Monitor children for neutropenia and hepatotoxicity. Cyclosporine or tacrolimus: used occasionally in conjunction with 6-MP or azathioprine to maintain remission in fulminant ulcerative colitis Methotrexate: sometimes used to manage severe Crohn disease Anti-tumor necrosis antibody therapy: widely used for children with Crohn disease; occasionally used for children with ulcerative colitis Promoting Family and Child Coping Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic and often debilitating illness. Many children with this diagnosis can lead normal lives, but frequent illnesses can cause school absences, which in turn add stress to the situation. Because schools have become much less tolerant of absences and tardiness, it may be necessary to write letters to the school explaining the frequent absences or in-school needs. Bathroom privileges should be very flexible for children during flare-ups. Children tend to be of small stature due to the illness itself and steroid use, which stunts growth; this may cause psychological issues, especially for older boys (Haas-Beckert & Heyman, 2010). Children with ostomies as a result of surgical resection may have self-esteem issues related to the presence and care of the ostomy. Arrange for counseling for both the child and family to discuss fears and anxiety related to a chronic disease. Celiac DiseaseCeliac disease, also known as celiac sprue, is an immunologic disorder in which gluten, a product most commonly found in grains, causes damage to the small intestine. The villi of the small intestine are damaged due to the body's immunologic response to the digestion of gluten. The function of the villi is to absorb nutrients into the bloodstream. When the villi are blunted or damaged, malnutrition occurs. Celiac disease is one of the most common chronic disorders in Europe and the United States, affecting about 1% of the population (Runge & Nguyen, 2010). Increased incidence occurs in those with a family history of celiac disease and in persons with autoimmune or genetic disorders (Runge & Nguyen, 2010). The only current treatment for celiac disease is a strict gluten-free diet. Eliminating gluten will cause the villi of the intestines to heal and function normally, with subsequent improvement of symptoms. Even very small amounts of gluten introduced back into the diet can cause damage to the villi, so the child must adhere to the diet throughout life (Runge & Nguyen, 2010). Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 696 . Assessment findings pertinent to celiac disease are discussed below. The child with symptoms of celiac disease often presents for evaluation by age 2. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. The symptoms of celiac disease are very broad and are easily confused with other GI disorders. The classic symptoms of children with celiac disease are: Diarrhea Steatorrhea (fatty stools) Constipation Failure to thrive or weight loss Abdominal distention or bloating Poor muscle tone Irritability and listlessness Dental disorders Anemia Delayed onset of puberty or amenorrhea Nutritional deficiencies Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as Caucasian European descent and a family history of celiac disease. Physical Examination Assess for the typical appearance of children with celiac disease: distended abdomen, wasted buttocks, and very thin extremities ( Fig. 20.18 ). Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of celiac disease include serologic antibody screening, intestinal biopsy, and genetic testing. The serum antibody markers identify antibodies in the bloodstream that are specific to a child's response to gluten. If antibodies are positive, an intestinal biopsy is taken from the four to six sites in the duodenum during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed by a gastroenterologist. Pathology from the biopsy reveals partial or subtotal villous atrophy or blunting of the villi of the small intestine. Genetic testing is also available for celiac disease, looking for certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types (Runge & Nguyen, 2010). Nursing Management Providing child and family education is the key nursing role in managing children with celiac disease. The child must adhere to a strict gluten-free diet for his or her entire life. This is often very challenging, because gluten is found in most wheat products, rye, barley, and possibly oats. Encourage the parents and child to maintain this gluten-free diet. Often, families consult a dietitian to learn about the gluten-free diet ( Teaching Guidelines 20.3 ). Teaching Guidelines 20.3 DIETARY CONSIDERATIONS IN A GLUTEN-FREE DIET Adapted from Celiac Disease Foundation. (2011). Diet & lifestyle. Retrieved April 20, 2011, from http://www.celiac.org/index.php? option=com_content&view=article&id=11&Itemid=l6 FIGURE 20.18 The child with celiac disease typically displays a distended abdomen and wasted extremities. Provide educational materials and resources to the parents. Many resources are available today about celiac disease because it isbecoming more commonly diagnosed. Links to several resources are located on . These resources can offer information on all aspects of celiac disease, including dietary guidelines and resources for food shopping and eating in restaurants. A reading source appropriate for school-age children is Gluten-free Friends: An Activity Book for Kids by Nancy Patin Falini. Recurrent Abdominal Pain Recurrent abdominal pain is a common GI complaint of children and adolescents. It affects children of all ages, and about 2% to 4% of all pediatric outpatient visits are related to recurrent abdominal pain (Noe & Li, 2009). The etiology remains unclear. The Rome Committee is a group of specialists who are focusing on the identification, management, and treatment of both adults and children with these functional GI disorders. The three categories of recurrent abdominal pain in children are functional abdominal pain, nonulcer dyspepsia, and irritable bowel syndrome. Box 20.5 outlines the Rome Committee's criteria for distinguishing different features of irritable bowel syndrome (Yacob & Di Lorenzo, 2009). Pathophysiology The etiology of recurrent abdominal pain is controversial but most likely multifactorial. It is thought that the autonomic nervous system, which controls the body's response to emotions and stress, and intestinal motility are the two mechanisms. Symptoms may result from an alteration in the transmission of messages between the enteric nervous system and the central nervous system, leading to visceral hypersensitivity. Information from the GI tract is transmitted through bidirectional nerve pathways to the brain. Most neurotransmitters are found in both the brain and the gut, suggesting the potential for integrated effects of pain modulation. As different possibilities exist for the pathophysiology of recurrent abdominal pain, it is clear that there are no structural or biochemical abnormalities that are identifiable. Therapeutic management most often focuses on increasing the child's coping skills. Some children may need dietary manipulation or medications to control diarrhea (irritable bowel syndrome). Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 696 . Assessment findings pertinent to recurrent abdominal pain are discussed below. Health History The diagnosis of recurrent abdominal pain is made on a symptom-based approach. Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. The symptom reported mostly commonly during the health history is abdominal pain. The child may have difficulty providing a good description of the pain. It is usually periumbilical and is usually described as attacks of pain. It is uncommon for the child to wake up in the middle of the night with this type of pain. In cases of irritable bowel syndrome, the pain may be relieved by defecation. Because diet may play a large role in the symptoms, obtain a dietary history. Take a detailed medication history, because abdominal pain may be an adverse effect of some medications. Identifying social and school stressors is essential. BOX 20.5 ROME COMMITTEE CRITERIA FOR IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME 12 weeks or more of the following symptoms: Abdominal pain relieved by defecation Onset of pain or discomfort associated with a change in frequency of stool Onset of pain or discomfort associated with a change in form of the stool No structural or metabolic explanation for this abdominal pain Adapted from Yacob, D., & Di Lorenzo, C. (2009). Functional abdominal pain: All paths lead to Rome (criteria). Pediatric Annals, 38(5), 253-258. Physical Examination Note the child's body positioning and facial expressions. Interactions with family members during the interview may provide more details regarding social stressors. Palpate the abdomen for tenderness. Laboratory and Diagnostic TestsCommon laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of recurrent abdominal pain include: Complete blood count: to rule out organic causes of abdominal pain Erythrocyte sedimentation rate: to rule out organic causes of abdominal pain Urinalysis: to rule out organic causes of abdominal pain Complete metabolic panel (CMP): to rule out organic causes of abdominal pain Stool studies: to assess for routine pathogens Nursing Management Once the diagnosis of recurrent abdominal pain with no organic cause is made, the majority of the nursing management is focused on promoting coping skills. Often the physician performs a battery of tests to rule out organic causes, especially when child and family anxiety is high. After these tests are complete, teach the family about the factors that exacerbate the pain and how to deal with these factors. Diet changes may need to be implemented. High-fiber diets help with bowel regulation by keeping motility regular. Often medications are used to relieve abdominal cramps. Antidiarrheals may be used for children with irritable bowel syndrome that is manifested by diarrhea. Occasionally pain modulators and antidepressants are used to help block the neurotransmitters in the brain-gut connection that cause pain. Encourage compliance with the medication regimen; compliance is needed to achieve beneficial results with many of these medications. Arrange for counseling, if necessary, for children with social stressors. Children with recurrent abdominal pain may become so debilitated that they cannot function in school, possibly requiring homebound instruction. Provide education to the school, with parental permission, regarding the child's illness and how to best deal with it. Explain that this recurrent abdominal pain is a true pain that children feel and is not \"in their minds.\"HEPATOBILIARY DISORDERS Hepatobiliary biliary and portal hypertension, and liver transplantation. Pancreatitis Pancreatitis is increasingly being recognized as a childhood problem (Sokol & Narkewicz, 2011). It is classified into two categories\u2014 acute and chronic. Acute pancreatitis is an acute inflammatory process that occurs within the pancreas, with variable involvement of localized tissues and remote organ systems. Most common causes of acute pancreatitis include abdominal trauma, drugs and alcohol (though probably rare in children), multisystem disease (such as inflammatory bowel disease or systemic lupus erythematosus), infections (usually viruses such as cytomegalovirus or hepatitis), congenital anomalies (ductal or pancreatic malformations), obstruction (most likely gallstones or tumors in children), or metabolic disorders. Chronic pancreatitis is defined based on the structural and/or functional permanent changes that occur in the pancreas. When pancreatitis is suspected, the child is placed on immediate bowel rest (NPO). Often, a nasogastric tube placed for suction will be needed to keep the stomach decompressed. Serial monitoring of serum amylase levels will determine when oral feeding may be restarted. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 696 . Assessment findings pertinent to pancreatitis are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history include: Acute onset of persistent midepigastric and periumbilical abdominal pain, often with radiation to the back or chest Vomiting, especially after meals Fever Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as: Cystic fibrosis History of gallstones Traumatic injury Family history of hereditary pancreatitis Physical Examination On abdominal assessment, the bowel sounds may be diminished, suggesting peritonitis. The abdomen may be tender, and distention may occur in younger children and infants. In severe cases, jaundice, ascites, or pleural effusions may occur. Bluish discoloration around the umbilicus or flanks is seen in the most severe cases of pancreatitis when hemorrhage is present. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment and monitoring of pancreatitis include: Serum amylase and/or lipase: levels three times the normal values are extremely indicative of pancreatitis Liver profile: often done to check for increased liver functions and/or bilirubin levels Blood work: leukocytosis is common with acute pancreatitis. Hyperglycemia and hypocalcemia may also be noted. C-reactive protein: levels may be elevated Diagnostic imaging studies performed to identify malformations or cysts on the pancreas include: Plain abdominal radiograph: may show a localized ileus Ultrasound: allows direct visualization of the pancreas and the surrounding structures. This is used most frequently with children, as it is less invasive than a CT scan. A CT scan is usually used when there is difficulty in determining the cause of the pancreatitis during ultrasonography. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): used in some children who may have ductal anomalies, usually with chronic pancreatitis, though complications from this procedure may occurNursing Management Maintain NPO status and nasogastric tube suction and patency. Administer intravenous fluids to keep the child hydrated and correct any alterations in fluid and electrolyte balance. Pain management is crucial in children with pancreatitis. If hemorrhagic pancreatitis has occurred, blood products and/or intravenous antibiotics may be needed. Oral feedings are restarted only after the serum amylase level has returned to normal (usually in 2 to 4 days). Often, pancreatic enzymes are given with oral feedings if pain occurs after oral feeds are restarted. Surgery is rarely needed in children with pancreatitis, except in those with severe abdominal trauma or major ductal abnormalities. Though chronic pancreatitis is rare in children, provide child and family education regarding the signs and symptoms of recurrence and complications. Gallbladder Disease Cholelithiasis is the presence of stones in the gallbladder. Cholesterol stones are usually associated with hyperlipidemia, obesity, pregnancy, birth control pill use, or cystic fibrosis (Schwarz, Hebra, & Miller, 2011). They are seen more often in females than males, and increased risk occurs with age and onset of puberty (Schwarz et al., 2011). These stones occur in the gallbladder and may be found in the common bile duct. Pigment stones are found in prepubertal children and occur about equally in males and females. They are usually found in the common bile duct (associated with bacterial or parasitic infections) or the gallbladder itself (associated with hemolytic anemia or liver cirrhosis). Cholecystitis is an inflammation of the gallbladder that is caused by the chemical irritation due to the obstruction of bile flow from the gallbladder into the cystic ducts. This inflammation is typically associated with gallstones in children. The most common complication in children with gallstone disease is pancreatitis. If cholelithiasis results in symptomatic cholecystitis, then surgical removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) will be necessary. This is often accomplished laparoscopically. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 696 . Assessment findings pertinent to gallbladder disease are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history include: Right upper quadrant pain, often radiating substernally or to the right shoulder Nausea and vomiting Jaundice and fever (with cholecystitis) Document a detailed diet history as it relates to the presenting symptoms. Pain episodes usually occur after meals (postprandially), especially after the ingestion of fatty or greasy foods. Younger children may present with more nonspecific symptoms, most often due to their lack of ability to communicate their symptoms to others. Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as chronic TPN use or sickle cell disease. Physical Examination Palpate the abdomen for tenderness. If cholecystitis is present, the gallbladder becomes inflamed, often to the point of causing localized tenderness upon palpation. Assess skin and sclerae color for jaundice. Note presence of fever. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of cholecystitis include: Liver function tests, bilirubin, and C-reactive protein: values may be elevated if ductal stones are present CBC: may reveal leukocytosis Amylase and lipase: may be elevated if pancreatitis is also present Plain abdominal radiographs: may reveal radiopaque stones Ultrasound of the gallbladder and surrounding structures: to assess the intraluminal contents of the gallbladder as well as anyanatomic alterations ERCP: to rule out ductal stones Hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan: to evaluate the function of the gallbladder Nursing Management The child with symptomatic cholecystitis will usually be hospitalized. Administer intravenous fluids, maintain NPO status and gastric decompression, and administer pain medications. If ordered, administer intravenous antibiotics to treat clinically worsening symptoms of cholecystitis, such as persistent fever. Provide routine postoperative care after cholecystectomy is performed. Provide pre- and postoperative teaching for families of children undergoing gallbladder removal. Biliary Atresia Biliary atresia is an absence of some or all of the major biliary ducts, resulting in obstruction of bile flow. The ensuing obstruction to bile flow causes cholestasis resulting in jaundice and eventual progressive fibrosis with end-stage cirrhosis of the liver. Biliary atresia affects 1 in 10,000 to 15,000 infants (Schwarz, 2011). The etiology of biliary atresia is unknown, but there are several theories, including infectious, autoimmune, or ischemic causes. Therapeutic Management If there is a high suspicion of biliary atresia, the infant will undergo exploratory laparotomy. If biliary atresia is found, a Kasai procedure (hepatoportoenterostomy) is performed to connect the bowel lumen to the bile duct remnants found at the porta hepatis. This procedure is most successful for infants up to 10 weeks of age, as bile flow restoration after this age is minimal (Schwarz, 2011). Infants who are not identified early enough or those who have failed to respond to the Kasai procedure will need to undergo liver transplantation, usually by age 2 (Schwarz, 2011). Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 696 . Assessment findings pertinent to biliary atresia are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Persistent or recurring jaundice is the most common symptom reported during the health history. Physical Examination In the initial assessment of an infant with cholestasis of unknown origin, assess the stool character. In biliary atresia, stools will be acholic (chalky and white due to the lack of bile pigment). Note jaundice of the skin and sclerae (yellow discoloration caused by bile pigment deposition). Palpate the abdomen; the liver will feel enlarged and hardened. Splenomegaly may occur. In the absence of other congenital malformations, the infant will otherwise appear healthy. Laboratory and Diagnostic Studies Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of biliary Biliary whether the cholestasis is intrahepatic or extrahepatic Liver biopsy: to confirm the diagnosis Nursing Management Nursing management of infants who have biliary atresia will focus on vitamin and caloric support. Administer fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Special formulas containing medium-chain triglycerides are used because significant fat malabsorption occurs when cholestasis is present. Administer feedings via nasogastric tube as needed to ensure increased caloric intake. Identify infections as quickly as possible and administer intravenous antibiotics as ordered. Manage ascites with diuretics and dietary restrictions.Preoperative management before a Kasai procedure is focused on preparation for surgery; infants who have suspected biliary atresia require immediate surgery to optimize outcomes. Parents and family members of these infants will have extreme anxiety due to the implications of the diagnosis and outcomes. Focus education on the diagnosis and postoperative care. Nursing Care Plan 20.1 gives information about routine postoperative care. Hepatitis Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that is caused by a variety of agents, including viral infections, bacterial invasion, metabolic disorders, chemical toxicity, and trauma. The most common viral causes of hepatitis are listed in Table 20.4 . Other viruses that may cause hepatitis are cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and adenovirus. Fulminant hepatitis to be caused by a non-A, non-B, non-C virus. Children who present with fulminant hepatitis have acute massive hepatic necrosis. The disease progresses rapidly to severe jaundice, coagulopathy, elevated ammonia levels, significantly elevated aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]), and progressive coma, resulting in death without liver transplantation. Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic disorder, affecting mostly adolescent females. The clinical presentation of a child with autoimmune hepatitis includes hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, fever, fatigue, and right upper quadrant pain. Therapeutic Management Acute hepatitis is treated with rest, hydration, and nutrition. Control of bleeding may also be necessary. Chronic hepatitis often eventually requires liver transplantation. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants may be used for autoimmune hepatitis. The child with fulminant hepatitis usually requires intensive care with cardiorespiratory support. See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov .Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 696 . Assessment findings pertinent to hepatitis are discussed below. The nursing assessment for any child who presents with suspected hepatitis should be the same. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and the chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history include: Jaundice Fever Fatigue Abdominal pain Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as: Recent foreign travel Sick contacts Medication use Abdominal trauma Sexual activity Intravenous drug use Blood product transfusion Document onset of symptoms as well as all signs and symptoms the child has been experiencing. Physical Examination Observe the skin for jaundice and the sclerae for icterus. Palpate the abdomen to reveal abnormal liver and spleen size or tenderness. Laboratory and Diagnostic Studies Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of hepatitis include: Liver enzymes, GGT: elevated Prothrombin time (PT)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT): prolonged Ammonia: elevated in the presence of encephalopathy Autoimmune studies, such as antinuclear antibodies, anti-smooth muscle antibodies, and liver-kidney microsomal antibodies: may be used to diagnose autoimmune hepatitis Viral studies: to identify viral causes of hepatitis, such as hepatitis A to E antigens and antibodies, CMV, and EBV Ultrasound: to assess liver or spleen abnormalities Liver biopsy: to determine the type of hepatitis and to assess for damage that has already been done to the liverNursing Management Acute hepatitis requires rest, hydration, and nutrition. If the child develops vomiting, dehydration, elevated bleeding times (PT/PTT), or mental status changes (encephalopathy), hospitalization may be required. When caring for children with infectious hepatitis, provide education about transmission and prevention, including proper hygiene, safe sexual activity, careful hand-washing techniques, and blood/bodily fluid precautions. Fulminant hepatitis treatment is aggressive and will require NPO status, nasogastric tube administration of lactulose to decrease ammonia levels that lead to encephalopathic conditions, TPN administration, vitamin K injections to help with coagulopathies, and, ultimately, liver transplantation. Fear and anxiety of the child and parents will likely be very high. Teach the child and family about the diagnosis and what to expect during treatment. Provide immunoglobulin therapy and vaccinations to close contacts of children with infectious hepatitis. Cirrhosis and Portal Hypertension Cirrhosis of the liver occurs as a result of the destructive processes that occur during liver damage, leading to the formation of nodules. These nodules can be small (micronodular [less than 3 mm]) or large (macronodular [greater than 3 mm]) and distort the vasculature of the liver, leading to further complications. Causes of cirrhosis in children include biliary malformations, 1 -antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson disease, galactosemia, tyrosinemia, chronic active hepatitis, and prolonged TPN use (Sokol & Narkewicz, 2011). Major complications may exist due to cirrhosis of the liver, including portal hypertension. In portal hypertension, the blood flow to, through, or from the liver meets resistance, causing portal blood flow pressures to rise. As these pressures rise, collateral veins form between the portal and systemic venous circulations. The most significant complication of portal hypertension is GI bleeding, from shunting to submucosal veins (varices) in the stomach and esophagus. Esophageal varices may be treated with sclerotherapy during endoscopy to stop acute bleeding. Often blood product administration and vasopressive drugs are needed. In the long term, the only cure for cirrhosis is liver transplantation. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 696 . Assessment findings pertinent to cirrhosis and portal hypertension are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history include: Nausea and vomiting Jaundice Weakness Swelling Weight loss Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as hepatitis, cystic fibrosis, Wilson disease, hematochromatosis, and biliary atresia. Assess the past medical history to identify possible causes for liver disease. Physical Examination Inspect for jaundice, ascites, spider angiomas, and palmar erythema. Gynecomastia is often seen in males. Palpate the liver; typically it is enlarged and hard, but occasionally it is small and shrunken. Evaluate mental status to determine the presence of hepatic encephalopathy. Laboratory and Diagnostic Studies Laboratory and diagnostic testing will be similar to that of a child with hepatitis. Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of cirrhosis or portal hypertension include: Liver biopsy: reveals regenerating nodules and surrounding fibrosis Upper endoscopy: reveals varices and bleeding Nursing ManagementNursing management is very similar to the care of the child with hepatitis. In cases of cirrhosis causing portal hypertension and bleeding varices, GI bleeding must be controlled. This is usually done by replacing blood loss and providing vasopressive therapy to constrict the shunted blood flow. As with all liver disorders and GI bleeding, address and manage family and child anxiety. Be honest about the child's treatment plan and prognosis. Involve the family in the care of the child and educate them as needed. Liver Transplantation Hepatobiliary disorders that result in failure of the liver to function result in the need for liver transplantation. Liver transplantation in children has become increasingly successful in the past several years due to advances in immunosuppression, better selection of transplant candidates, and improvements in surgical techniques and postoperative care (Boudi, 2011). Transplant centers now offer both cadaveric and living-related liver transplants for children. Rejection of the transplanted liver is the most significant complication. Most children will require immunosuppressive therapy for a lifetime, putting them at risk for infections. Nursing Assessment Many children will be admitted to a transplant center for a preoperative workup to determine the best possible tissue and blood match for the child. There is much anxiety among family members when a cadaveric transplant is the only possibility for survival. This puts a child on a waiting list that is prioritized based on several criteria. Because there are a limited number of pediatric liver transplant centers throughout the country, there may be many issues regarding transportation, finances, job loss, and lodging. Assess the need for social work intervention; a social worker is almost always involved with these children. A liver transplant coordinator will assist with coordinating the care for pre- and posttransplant children. Nursing Management Preoperatively, assist with the transplant workup and teach the child and family what to expect during and after the liver transplantation. Postoperatively, the child will be in the intensive care unit for several days until he or she is stabilized from the actual surgery (see Nursing Care Plan 20.1 ). After the child is sent to a regular unit in the hospital, monitor the child for several days to weeks for signs and symptoms of rejection and infection, including fever, increasing liver function test results and GGT, and increasing pain, redness, and swelling at the incision site. Child and family education is an important element of nursing management in the posttransplant child. Assess and reassess medication knowledge throughout the entire hospitalization, as these children usually require medications for a lifetime. KEY CONCEPTS The esophagus of the young child exhibits underdeveloped muscle tone compared with the adult. A major difference between children and adults is the reduced stomach capacity in the child and the significantly shorter length of the small intestine (250 cm in the child vs. 600 cm in the adult). Infants and children have a proportionately greater amount of body water than adults, resulting in a relatively greater fluid intake requirement than adults and placing infants and children at higher risk for fluid loss as compared with adults. The most common result of GI illnesses in infants and children is dehydration. The mildly or moderately dehydrated child must be identified and receive rehydration therapy to prevent progression to hypovolemic shock. Rehydration is a key medical treatment for dehydration as a result of many different GI disorders. Oral rehydration is most common, but in cases requiring hospitalization intravenous fluid therapy is key. Promotion of adequate nutrition is another significant treatment component. The child with a chronic GI disorder may require intravenous TPN or enteral tube feedings to exhibit appropriate growth. Surgical intervention is necessary for many acute or congenital GI disorders, such as pyloric stenosis, omphalocele, gastroschisis, and palate, appendicitis, and intestinal malrotation. Monitoring the blood count, electrolyte levels, and liver function tests is necessary in many pediatric GI disorders. Histamine-2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors, and prokinetic agents are used to treat disorders in which gastric acid is a problem, such as esophagitis, GERD, and ulcers. Close monitoring for infection is important in children with inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune hepatitis, or liver transplant who are being treated with immunosuppressants and/or corticosteroids. GI stimulants and laxatives may be necessary for treating constipation and encopresis. Diarrhea, vomiting, decreased oral intake, sustained high fever, diabetic ketoacidosis, and extensive burns place the infant or childat risk for the development of dehydration. Risk factors for vomiting include exposure to viruses, use of certain medications, and overfeeding in the infant. Risk factors for acute diarrhea include recent ingestion of undercooked meats, foreign travel, day care attendance, and well water ingestion. Vomiting is a symptom and should be characterized in terms of volume, color, relation to meals, duration, and associated symptoms. Bleeding may occur as a result of a GI disorder, particularly from the intestine with Meckel diverticulum and from esophageal varices with portal hypertension. Acute GI disorders are those that usually have a rapid onset and a short course, which at times may be severe. Examples include dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea, hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, and appendicitis. Chronic GI disorders are those that are long lasting or recur over time. Examples include constipation, GER, inflammatory bowel disease, recurrent abdominal pain, and failure to thrive. Right lower quadrant pain and rebound tenderness of the abdomen found on physical examination are telltale signs of appendicitis, which is considered a surgical emergency. Bilious vomiting is the main symptom of conditions resulting in bowel obstruction, such as malrotation with volvulus. The focus of nursing management of the child with diarrhea or vomiting is restoring proper fluid and electrolyte balance through oral rehydration therapy or intravenous fluids if necessary. Reduction of inguinal and umbilical hernias should be attempted; if reduction of the hernia is impossible, immediately notify the physician. Small, frequent, and thickened feedings and proper positioning after feedings are key elements in the treatment of GER. A crucial nursing intervention related to cleft lip and palate repair is protection of the surgical site while it is healing. Palpation of the abdomen should be the last part of the physical examination of an infant or child. A key element of nursing care for the child with a GI disorder is promotion of appropriate bowel elimination. Maximizing nutritional status is a critical nursing function for the child with a GI disorder. For the child who has undergone surgical repair for correction of a GI disorder, promoting effective breathing patterns and managing pain are important nursing goals. Counseling families about how to manage the child with vomiting or diarrhea at home, including oral rehydration therapy, is a key component of child/family education. Education of the child and family regarding the importance of medication compliance for management of inflammatory bowel disease is critical. Behavioral therapy and counseling may be necessary for children who have functional constipation and stool withholding. The child or adolescent with ineffective bowel control, poor growth, or an ostomy may have poor self-esteem and body image. REFERENCES Albanese, C. T., & Sylvester, K. G. (2010). Pediatric surgery.

She presents with fever and lethargy for the past 24 hours. Her mother states, \"Corey has had a few accidents in her pants over the past few days, which is unusual for her. She also has been getting up at night more often to use the bathroom.\" Genitourinary (GU) disorders in children and adolescents may occur as a result of abnormalities in fetal development, infectious processes, trauma, neurologic deficit, genetic influences, or other causes. Congenital disorders account for a large proportion of GU disorders in infants. External GU malformations are easily identified at birth, but internal structural defects may not be identified until later in infancy or childhood when symptoms or complications arise. Enuresis and urinary tract infection (UTI) also occur in a significant number of children. Some GU disorders directly involve the kidney from the outset, while others involve other parts of the urinary tract and may have a long-term effect on the kidneys and renal function, particularly if left untreated or treated inadequately. Disorders affecting the reproductive organs often require early diagnosis and management to preserve future reproductive capabilities. Nurses must be knowledgeable about pediatric GU conditions to provide prompt recognition, nursing care, education, and support to children and their families. Though some disorders are acute and resolve quickly, many have a long-term effect on quality of life and will require more intense, extended support. Management of acute or common pediatric GU disorders may be provided in the pediatric or family practice outpatient setting, while specialists such as pediatric nephrologists or urologists usually manage chronic or involved GU disorders.VARIATIONS IN PEDIATRIC ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY Though all of the urinary tract and reproductive organs are present at birth, their functioning is immature initially. The infant or child is at increased risk for the development of certain GU disorders because of the anatomic and physiologic differences between children and adults. Structural Differences The kidney is large in relation to the size of the abdomen until the child reaches adolescence. Due to this increased size, the kidneys of the child are less well protected from injury by the ribs and fat padding than they are in the adult. The urethra is naturally shorter in all ages of females compared to males, placing them at increased risk for the entrance of bacteria into the bladder via the urethra. In the female infant or young child, this risk is compounded by the physical proximity of the urethral opening to the rectum. The young male's urethra is much shorter than the adult male's, placing the male infant or young child at increased risk of urinary tract infection compared with the adult male. Urinary Concentration Blood flow through the kidneys (glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) is slower in the infant and young toddler compared with the adult (Lum, 2011). The kidney is less able to concentrate urine and reabsorb amino acids, placing the infant and young toddler at increased risk for dehydration during times when fluid loss or decreased fluid intake occurs. The normal range for serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine of the healthy infant or young toddler is usually less than the older child's or adult's. The renal system usually reaches functional maturity at around 2 years of age. Urine Output Bladder capacity is about 30 mL in the newborn; it increases to the usual adult capacity of about 270 mL by 1 year of age. The expected urine output in the infant and child is 0.5 to 2 mL/kg/hour, with the average 1-year-old voiding about 400 to 500 mL per day. The average urine output for a teenager is about 800 to 1,400 mL per day. The infant and toddler may void as often as 9 or 10 times per day. By age 3 the average number of voids per day is the same as the adult's (three to eight). Reproductive Organ Maturity The reproductive organs are also immature at birth. The gonads are not mature until adolescence in most children. The hormonal changes that occur with puberty account for some of the reproductive concerns, particularly for female adolescents.COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS A variety of medications as well as other medical treatments and surgical procedures are used to treat GU problems in children. Most of these treatments will require a physician's or nurse practitioner's order when the child is in the hospital. The most common treatments and medications are listed in Common Medical Treatments 21.1 and Drug Guide 21.1 . The nurse caring for the child with a GU disorder should be familiar with what the procedures are, how the treatments and medications work, and common nursing implications related to use of these modalities. COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS 21.1 GENITOURINARY DISORDERS NURSING PROCESS OVERVIEW FOR THE CHILD WITH A GENITOURINARY DISORDER Care of the child with a GU disorder includes assessment, nursing diagnosis, planning, interventions, and evaluation. There are a number of general concepts related to the nursing process that may be applied to GU disorders. From a general understanding of the care involved for a child with urinary, renal, or reproductive dysfunction, the nurse can then individualize the care based on specifics for that child. Assessment Assessment of urinary tract, renal, or reproductive dysfunction includes health history, physical examination, and laboratory and diagnostic testing. Remember Corey, the 5-year-old with fever and lethargy? What additional health history and physical examination assessment information should you obtain? Health History The health history consists of the past medical history, including the mother's pregnancy history; family history; and history of present illness (when the symptoms started and how they have progressed), as well as medications and treatments used at home. The past medical history may be significant for maternal polyhydramnios, oligohydramnios, diabetes, hypertension, or alcohol or cocaine ingestion. Neonatal history may include the presence of a single umbilical artery or an abdominal mass, chromosome abnormality, or congenital malformation. Document past medical history of UTI or other problems with the GU tract. Family history may be significant for renal disease or uropathology, chronic UTIs, renal calculi, or a history of parental enuresis. Determine age of successful toilet training, pattern of incontinent episodes (having \"accidents\"), and toileting hygiene self-care routines. Note myelomeningocele or other spinal disturbance that may affect the child's ability to urinate. Note previous urologic surgeries or ongoing renal interventions (e.g., dialysis). For the adolescent girl, obtain a thorough menstrual history, including sexual behavior and pregnancy history. When determining the history of the present illness, inquire about the following: Burning on urination Changes in voiding patterns Foul-smelling urine Vaginal or urethral discharge Genital pain, irritation, or discomfort Blood in the urine Edema Masses in the groin, scrotum, or abdomen Flank or abdominal pain Cramps Nausea and/or vomiting Poor growth Weight gain Fever Infectious exposure (particularly Streptococcus A or Escherichia coli ) Trauma Record medications used for acute or chronic conditions, or for contraception. Physical Examination Physical examination of the GU system includes inspection and observation, auscultation, percussion, and palpation. INSPECTION AND OBSERVATION Observe the child's general appearance, noting growth retardation or unusual weight gain. Inspect the skin for the presence of pruritus, edema (generalized or periorbital), or bruising. Note pallor of the skin or dysmorphic features (associated with genetic conditions). Document the presence of lethargy, fatigue, rapid respirations, confusion, or developmental delay. Observe the external genitalia area for infant diaper rash, constant urine dribble, displaced urethral opening, reddened urethral opening, or discharge. In females, note vaginal irritation or labial fusion. In males, observe the scrotal sac for enlargement or discoloration. Note the condition of a urinary stoma or diversion if present. With the child lying flat, observe the abdomen for distention, ascites, or slack abdominal musculature. AUSCULTATION Listen carefully to heart sounds, as a flow murmur may be present in the anemic child with a renal disorder (Klein, 2010). Note elevated heart rate. Auscultate blood pressure with the appropriate-size cuff, noting elevation or depression. In the edematous child, carefully auscultate the lungs, noting the presence of adventitious sounds. Note the absence of bowel sounds, as this may indicate peritonitis. In the child who receives chronic hemodialysis, auscultate the fistula for the presence of a bruit (desired normal finding). Take Note! Use the bell of the stethoscope when auscultating the infant's or child's blood pressure so that you can hear the softer Korotkoff sounds more accurately. PERCUSSION Percuss the abdomen. Note unusual dullness or flatness (dullness is usually heard over the spleen at the right costal margin, over the kidneys, and 1 to 3 cm below the left costal margin). A full bladder may yield dullness above the symphysis pubis. PALPATION Palpate the abdomen. Note the presence of palpable kidneys (indicating enlargement or mass, as they are usually difficult to palpate in the older infant or child). Note the presence of abdominal masses or a distended bladder. Document tenderness to palpation or along the costovertebral angle. Palpate the scrotum for the presence of descended testicles, masses, or other abnormalities. Note whether the foreskin, if present, can be retracted. In the child who receives chronic hemodialysis, palpate the fistula or graft for the presence of a thrill (desired normal finding). Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 21.1 offers an explanation of the most commonly used laboratory and diagnostic tests for a child suspected of having a GU disorder. The test results can help the physician or nurse practitioner to diagnose the disorder or to determine treatment. Laboratory or nonnursing personnel obtain some of the tests, while the nurse might obtain others. In either instance the nurse should be familiar with how the tests are obtained, what they are used for, and normal versus abnormal results. This knowledge will also be necessary when providing child and family education related to the tests and results. Urine specimens may be collected using a variety of different methods in infants and children. Suprapubic aspiration is a useful method for obtaining a sterile urine specimen from the neonate or young infant. A sterile needle is inserted into the bladder through the anterior wall of the abdomen and the urine is then aspirated. The physician or nurse practitioner generally performs this method. Infants and toddlers who are not toilet trained may require a urine bag for urine collection. A sterile urine bag is required for a urine culture, a clean bag for routine urinalysis. A 24-hour urine collection bag is also available. Nursing Procedure 21.1 gives details on the use of the urine bag. Sterile urinary catheterization is performed like that in adults. The size of the catheter varies depending on the size of the child. General size recommendations are: 6 French: Birth to 2 years old 6 to 8 French: 2 to 5 years old 8 to 10 French: 5 to 10 years old 10 to 12 French: 10 to 16 years old (Bowden & Greenberg, 2008) Take Note! Use familiar terms such as \"pee-pee,\" \"tinkle,\" or \"potty\" to explain to the child what is needed and to gain his or her cooperation. Nursing Diagnoses and Related Interventions Upon completion of a thorough assessment, the nurse might identify several nursing diagnoses, such as: Impaired urinary elimination Fluid volume excess Imbalanced nutrition, less (or more) than body requirements Risk for infection Deficient knowledge of the child or family Urinary retention Activity intolerance Interrupted family processes Disturbed body image After completing an assessment of Corey, you note the following: foul-smelling urine, abdominal tenderness, redness in her perineal area, and slightly blood-tinged, cloudy urine. Based on these assessment findings, what would your top three nursing diagnoses be for Corey? Nursing goals, interventions, and evaluation for the child with a GU disorder are based on the nursing diagnoses. Nursing Care Plan 21.1 can be used as a guide in planning nursing care for the child with a GU disorder. The care plan overview includes nursing diagnoses and interventions for urinary tract disorders as well as genital (or reproductive system) disorders. It is important to individualize it based on the child's symptoms and needs. Refer to Chapter 14 for detailed information about pain management. Additional information will be included later in the chapter as it relates to specific disorders. Based on your top three nursing diagnoses for Corey, describe appropriate nursing interventions. DRUG GUIDE 21.1 COMMON DRUGS FOR GU DISORDERS Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 21.1 GENITOURINARY DISORDERS Atraumatic Care When examining the genital area or performing urinary catheterization of the young female, allow the girl to sit with her mother on the examination table to decrease anxiety. Have the girl lie back on her mother's chest, seated on the table between the mother's legs. Encourage the mother to console and hug the girl while the invasive examination orprocedure is being performed. NURSING PROCEDURE 21.1 Applying the Urine Bag 1. Cleanse the perineal area well and pat dry (Figure A). If a culture is to be obtained, cleanse the genital area with povidone- iodine (Betadine) or per institutional protocol. 2. Apply benzoin around the scrotum or the vulvar area to aid with urine bag adhesion. 3. Allow the benzoin to dry. 4. Apply the urine bag. For boys: Ensure that the penis is fully inside the bag; a portion of the scrotum may or may not be inside the bag, depending on scrotal size. For girls: Apply the narrow portion of the bag on the perineal space between the anal and vulvar areas first for best adhesion, and then spread the remaining adhesive section (Figure B). 5. Tuck the bag downward inside the diaper to discourage leaking. 6. Check the bag frequently for urine (Figure C).NURSING CARE PLAN 21.1 Overview for the Child With a Genitourinary Disorder NURSINGS DIAGNOSIS: Activity intolerance related to generalized edema, anemia, or generalized weakness as evidenced by verbalization of weakness or fatigue; elevated heart rate, respiratory rate, or blood pressure with activity; complaint of shortness of breath with play or activity Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will display increased activity tolerance, desire to play without developing symptoms of exertion. Intervention: Promoting Activity Encourage activity or ambulation per physician's or nurse practitioner's orders: early mobilization results in better outcomes. Observe child for symptoms of activity intolerance such as pallor, nausea, lightheadedness, or dizziness or changes in vital signs to determine level of tolerance. If child is on bed rest, perform range-of-motion exercises and frequent position changes, as negative changes to the musculoskeletal system occur quickly with inactivity and immobility. Cluster nursing care activities and plan for periods of rest before and after exertional activities to decrease oxygen need and consumption. Refer the child to physical therapy for exercise prescription to increase skeletal muscle strength. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Excess fluid volume related to decreased protein in the bloodstream, decreased urine output, sodium retention, possible inappropriate fluid intake, or altered hormone levels inducing fluid retention as evidenced by edema, bloating, weight gain, oliguria, azotemia, or changes in heart and lung sounds Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will attain appropriate fluid balance, will lose weight (fluid), edema or bloating will decrease, lung sounds will be clear and heart sounds normal. Intervention: Encouraging Fluid Loss Weigh child daily on same scale in similar amount of clothing: in children, weight is the best indicator of changes in fluid status. Monitor location and extent of edema (measure abdominal girth daily if ascites present): decrease in edema indicates positive increase in oncotic pressure. Auscultate lungs carefully to determine presence of crackles (indicating pulmonary edema). Assess work of breathing and respiratory rate: increased work of breathing is associated with pulmonary edema. Assess heart sounds for presence or absence of gallop: presence of S 3 may indicate fluid overload. Maintain fluid restriction as ordered to decrease intravascular volume and workload on the heart. Strictly monitor intake and output to quickly note discrepancies and provide intervention. Provide sodium-restricted diet as ordered: restricting sodium in the diet allows for better renal excretion of extra fluid. Administer diuretics as ordered and monitor for side effects of those medications. Diuretics encourage excretion of fluid and elimination of edema, reduce cardiac filling pressures, and increase renal blood flow. Side effects include electrolyte imbalance as well as orthostatic hypotension. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements related to anorexia and protein loss as evidenced by weight, length/height, and/or BMIbelow average for age Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will improve nutritional intake, resulting in steady increase in weight and length/height. Intervention: Promoting Adequate Nutrition Determine body weight and length/height norm for age to determine goal to work toward. Assess child for food preferences that fall within dietary restrictions, as the child will be more likely to consume adequate amounts of foods that he or she likes. Weigh daily or weekly (according to physician or nurse practitioner order or institutional standard) and measure length/height weekly to monitor for increased growth. Offer highest-calorie meals at the time of day when the child's appetite is the greatest to increase likelihood of increased caloric intake. Provide increased-calorie shakes or puddings within diet restriction: high calorie foods increase weight gain. Administer vitamin and mineral supplements as prescribed to attain/maintain vitamin and mineral balance in the body. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Imbalanced nutrition: more than body requirements related to increased appetite secondary to steroid therapy as evidenced by weight greater than 95th percentile for age or recent increase in weight Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will demonstrate balanced nutritional intake, will maintain current weight or steadily lose excess weight. Intervention: Encouraging Appropriate Nutritional Intake Determine ideal body weight and body mass index for age to determine goal to work toward. Consult dietitian for guidance in planning nutrient-rich diet in context of restrictions. Evaluate for emotional/psychological reasons for overeating to address these concerns. Formulate a contract with the child to involve him or her in the planning process and encourage compliance with the plan. With the child, plan for daily exercise/activity to expend excess calories: it is important to involve the child in planning, in order to increase compliance. Instruct the child/parent about appropriate nutrient-rich foods to choose within the constraints of diet and fluid restrictions to provide basis for ongoing diet management at home. Weigh child twice weekly on same scale to determine progress toward goal. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Impaired urinary elimination related to urinary tract infection or other urologic condition, or other factors such as ignoring urge to void at appropriate time as evidenced by urinary retention or incontinence, dribbling, urgency, or dysuria Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will maintain continence, will void in the toilet. Intervention: Promoting Adequate Urinary Elimination Assess the child's usual voiding pattern and success within that pattern to determine baseline. Develop a schedule for bladder emptying to encourage voiding in the toilet. Maintain adequate hydration, as dehydration irritates the bladder. Avoid constipation, as constipation is associated with inability to adequately empty bladder. Teach parents to restrict child's fluid intake after dinner to avoid bedwetting. Ensure child voids prior to going to bed to avoid bedwetting. Teach bladder-stretching exercises as prescribed per physician or nurse practitioner to increase bladder capacity. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Urinary retention related to anatomic obstruction, sensory motor impairment, or dysfunctional voiding as evidenced by dribbling, inadequate bladder emptying Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child's bladder will empty adequately, according to preestablished quantities and frequencies individualized for the child (usual urine output is 0.5 to 2 mL/kg/hour). Intervention: Promoting Successful Bladder Emptying Assess child's ability to adequately empty bladder via history focused on character and duration of lower urinary symptoms to establish baseline. Assess for history of fecal impaction or encopresis, as alterations in bowel elimination may have a negative impact on urinary elimination. Assess for bladder distention by palpation or urinary retention by postvoid residual obtained via catheterization or bladder ultrasound to determine extent of retention. Maintain adequate hydration to avoid irritating effects of dehydration on the bladder. Schedule voiding to decrease bladder overdistention. In the child with significant urinary retention, teach parents/child the technique of clean intermittent catheterization, which allows for regular complete bladder emptying. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Disturbed body image related to anatomic differences, short stature, or effects of long-term corticosteroid use as evidenced by verbalization of dissatisfaction with the child's or adolescent's looks Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child or adolescent will display appropriate body image, will look at self in mirror and participate in social activities. Intervention: Promoting Body Image Acknowledge feelings of anger over body changes and illness: venting feelings is associated with less body image disturbance. Support the child's or teen's choices of comfortable, fashionable clothing that may disguise anatomic abnormalities and dialysis tubing. Involve the child and especially the teen in the decision-making process, as a sense of control of his or her own body will improve body image. Encourage children or teens to spend time with others their own age who have short stature or other effects of renal disorders: a peer's opinions are often better accepted than those of persons in authority, such as parents or health care professionals. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Knowledge deficit related to lack of information regarding complex medical condition, prognosis, and medical needs as evidenced by verbalization, questions, or actions demonstrating lack of understanding regarding child's condition or care Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child and parents will verbalize accurate information and understanding about condition, prognosis, and medical needs: child and parents demonstrate knowledge of condition and medications and will demonstrate therapeutic procedures the child requires. Intervention: Educating the Child and Parents Assess child's and parents' willingness to learn: child and parents must be open to learning for teaching to be effective. Provide parents with time to adjust to diagnosis: will facilitate adjustment and ability to learn and participate in child's care. Teach in short sessions: many short sessions are found to be more helpful than one long session. Repeat information: allows parents and child time to learn and understand. Individualize teaching to the parents' and child's level of understanding (depends on age of child, physical condition, memory) to ensure understanding. Provide reinforcement and rewards to facilitate the teaching/learning process. Use multiple modes of learning involving many senses (written, verbal, demonstration, and videos) when possible: child and parents are more likely to retain information when it is presented in different ways using many senses.URINARY TRACT AND RENAL DISORDERS The urinary tract and renal disorders discussed below include structural disorders, UTI, enuresis, and acquired disorders that result in altered renal function. Structural Disorders Numerous urologic conditions are congenital (present at birth) and occur as a result of altered fetal development. Many of these defects are apparent at birth, yet some are not recognized until later in infancy or childhood when symptoms or complications arise. Bladder Exstrophy In classic bladder exstrophy, a midline closure defect occurs during the embryonic period of gestation, leaving the bladder open and exposed outside of the abdomen. The bony pelvis may also be malformed, resulting in an opening in the pelvic arch. Bladder exstrophy may be diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound. Complications include UTI from ascending organisms. Treatment of bladder exstrophy involves surgical repair. FIGURE 21.1 Note the bright-red color of the bladder exstrophy. Nursing Assessment On physical examination of the infant or child, note the red appearance to the bladder seen on the abdominal wall ( Fig. 21.1 ). Draining urine will be visible. Note excoriation of abdominal skin around the bladder resulting from contact with urine. A malformed urethra may be present in females, while males may have an unformed or malformed penis or a normal penis with an epispadias. Nursing Management Nursing management consists of preventing infection and skin breakdown, providing postoperative care, and catheterizing the stoma. Preventing Infection and Skin Breakdown Bladder exstrophy requires surgical repair. In the preoperative period, care is focused on protecting the exstrophied bladder and preventing infection. Keep the infant in a supine position; keep the bladder moist and cover it with a sterile plastic bag. Change soiled diapers immediately to prevent contamination of the bladder with feces. Sponge-bathe the infant rather than immersing him or her in water to prevent pathogens in the bath water from entering the bladder. Prevent breakdown of the surrounding abdominal skin by applying protective barrier creams. In some instances it may be necessary to consult the ostomy nurse for advice on dealing with the abdominal skin excoriation. If an orthopedic surgeon is involved due to the malformed pubic arch, follow through with recommended positioning or bracing to prevent further separation of the pubic arch.Providing Postoperative Care Nursing management in the postoperative period focuses on preventing infection. Keep the infant supine and quickly change soiled diapers to prevent contamination of the incision with stool. Surgical reconstruction of the bladder within the pelvic cavity and reconstruction of a urethra are done if enough bladder tissue is present. An indwelling urethral catheter or suprapubic tube will allow urinary drainage, allowing the bladder to rest in the initial postoperative period. Ensure that catheters drain freely and do not become kinked. Sometimes tubes or catheters used in the postoperative period require irrigation. Refer to the institution's policy and the surgeon's orders for specifics related to urinary catheter irrigation. Manage bladder spasms with oxybutynin (Ditropan) or belladonna and opioid (B & O) suppositories as ordered. Note blood- tinged urine upon return from surgery, with clearing of urine within hours to days. Catheterizing the Stoma If bladder tissue is insufficient for repair, then the bladder is removed and a continent urinary reservoir is created. The ureters are connected to a portion of the small intestine that is separated from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, thus creating a urinary reservoir. The intestines are reanastomosed to leave the GI tract intact and separate from the GU tract. A stoma is created on the abdominal wall; it provides access to the urinary reservoir ( Fig. 21.2 ). The stoma is catheterized about four times per day to empty the reservoir of urine. Urine from an intestine-based urinary reservoir tends to be mucus-like and is often cloudier than urine from a urinary bladder. Teach parents the procedure for catheterizing the urinary reservoir and instruct them to call the child's urologist or physician or nurse practitioner if signs or symptoms of UTI occur. FIGURE 21.2 The abdominal stoma allows for urinary continence and requires catheterization. Take Note! Children with congenital urologic malformations are at high risk for the development of latex allergy (Behrman, 2008). Latex allergy can result in anaphylaxis. Primary prevention of latex allergy is warranted in all children with urologic malformations, so use latex-free gloves, tubes, and catheters in these children. Hypospadias/Epispadias Hypospadias is a urethral defect in which the opening is on the ventral surface of the penis rather than at the end of the penis ( Fig. 21.3 ). Epispadias is a urethral defect in which the opening is on the dorsal surface of the penis. In either case, the opening may be near the glans of the penis, midway along the penis or near the base. If left uncorrected, the boy may not be capable of appropriately aiming a urinary stream from a standing position. In addition, the abnormal placement of the urethral opening may interfere with the deposition of sperm during intercourse, leaving the man infertile. Also, if left uncorrected, the boy's self-esteem and body image maybe damaged by the abnormal appearance of his genitalia (Pfeil & Lindsay, 2010). For these reasons, the defect is usually repaired sometime after about 1 year of age. The goal of surgical correction for either condition is to provide for an appropriately placed meatus that allows for normal voiding and ejaculation. The meatus is moved to the glans penis and the urethra is reconstructed as needed. Most repairs are accomplished in one surgery. More extensive reconstructions may require two stages. FIGURE 21.3 (A) Hypospadias: the urethral opening is located on the ventral side of the penis. (B) Epispadias: the urethral opening is located on the dorsal side of the penis. Nursing Assessment Note history of an unusual urine stream. Inspect the penis for placement of the urethral meatus: it may be slightly off center of the glans or may be present somewhere along the shaft of the penis. Inspect for chordee, a fibrous band causing the penis to curve downward. Palpate for the presence or absence of testicles in the scrotal sac, because cryptorchidism (undescended testicles) often occurs with hypospadias, as do hydrocele and inguinal hernia. Nursing Management The newborn with hypospadias or epispadias should not undergo circumcision until after surgical repair of the urethral meatus. In more extreme cases, the surgeon may need to use some of the excess foreskin while reconstructing the meatus. Nursing management of the infant who has undergone a hypospadias or epispadias repair focuses on providing routine postoperative care and parent education. Providing Postoperative Care Postoperatively, assess urinary drainage from the urethral stent or drainage tube, which allows for discharge of urine without stress along the surgical site. Ensure that the urinary drainage tube remains carefully taped with the penis in an upright position to prevent stress on the urethral incision. The penile dressing is usually a compression type, used to decrease edema and bruising. Administer antibiotics if prescribed. Assess for pain, which is usually not extensive, and administer analgesics or antispasmodics (oral oxybutynin or B & O suppository) as needed for bladder spasms. Take Note! Bladder spasms may also be managed effectively through the use of epidural analgesia, which is being used more frequently in the postoperative period in the pediatric population (Ellis, Martelli, LaMontagne, & Splinter, 2007). Double diapering is a method used to protect the urethra and stent or catheter after surgery; it also helps keep the area clean and free from infection. The inner diaper contains stool and the outer diaper contains urine, allowing separation between the bowel and bladder output. Nursing Procedure 21.2 details the double-diapering technique. Change the outside (larger) diaper when the child iswet; change both diapers when the child has a bowel movement. NURSING PROCEDURE 21.2 Double Diapering 1. Cut a hole or a cross-shaped slit in the front of the smaller diaper. 2. Unfold both diapers and place the smaller diaper (with the hole) inside the larger one. 3. Place both diapers under the child. 4. Carefully bring the penis (if applicable) and catheter/stent through the hole in the smaller diaper and close the diaper. 5. Close the larger diaper, making sure the tip of the catheter/stent is inside the larger diaper. Pictures and text adapted from Mount Nittany Medical Center. (2011).

Retrieved May 29, 2011, from http://www.mountnittany.org/wellness-library/healthsheets/documents?ID=11970 Educating the Family If the child is to be discharged with the urinary catheter in place (which is common), teach the parents how to care for the catheter and drainage system. Have parents demonstrate their ability to irrigate the catheter should a mucus plug occur. Tub baths are generally prohibited until it is time to remove the penile dressing. Roughhousing, ride-on toys, or any activity involving straddling is not allowed for 2 to 3 weeks. Obstructive Uropathy Obstructive uropathy is an obstruction at any level along the upper or lower urinary tract. This discussion will focus on congenital structural defects, though obstruction can also occur as a result of other disease processes (acquired obstructive uropathy). The most common sites of obstruction are listed in Table 21.1 . The defect may be unilateral or bilateral and can cause partial or complete obstruction of urine flow, resulting in dilation of the affected kidney (hydronephrosis). Complications include recurrent UTI, renal insufficiency, and progressive damage to the kidney resulting in renal failure. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 752 . Assessment findings pertinent to obstructive uropathy are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Recurrent UTI Incontinence Fever Foul-smelling urine Flank pain Abdominal pain Urinary frequency (needing to void often) Urinary urgency (urge to void immediately) Dysuria (difficulty or pain with voiding) Hematuria (blood in the urine) Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as: \"Prune belly\" syndrome Chromosome abnormalities Anorectal malformations Ear defects Physical Examination and Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Palpate the abdomen for the presence of an abdominal mass (hydronephrotic kidney). Assess the blood pressure; elevation may occur if renal insufficiency is present. Many cases of obstructive uropathy may be diagnosed with prenatal ultrasound if the obstruction has been significant enough to cause hydronephrosis or dilatation elsewhere along the urinary tract. Nursing Management Surgical correction is specific to the type of obstruction and generally consists of removal of the obstruction, reimplantation of the ureters as necessary, and, occasionally, creation of a urinary diversion. Postoperatively, assess urine output via vesicostomy, nephrostomy, suprapubic tube, or urethral catheter for color, clots, clarity, and amount. Encourage fluids once the child can tolerate them orally. Administer analgesics and/or antispasmodics as needed for bladder spasms. Teach parents care of vesicostomy or drainage tubes, with which the child may be discharged. Take Note! Upon return from surgery, most children have intravenous fluids without added potassium infusion. Potassium is withheld from the intravenous fluid until adequate urine output is established postoperatively to avoid the development of hyperkalemia should the kidneys fail to function properly (Browne, Flanigan, McComiskey, & Pieper, 2007). Hydronephrosis Hydronephrosis is a condition in which the pelvis and calyces of the kidney are dilated ( Fig. 21.4 ). Hydronephrosis may occur as a congenital defect, as a result of obstructive uropathy, or secondary to vesicoureteral reflux. Congenital hydronephrosis may be revealed on prenatal ultrasound. Complications of hydronephrosis include renal insufficiency, hypertension, and eventually renal failure. FIGURE 21.4 Hydronephrosis. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 752 . Assessment findings pertinent to hydronephrosis are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. The infant may be asymptomatic, but signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Failure to thrive Intermittent hematuria Presence of an abdominal mass Signs and symptoms associated with a UTI such as fever, vomiting, poor feeding, and irritabilityExplore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as: Maternal oligohydramnios or -fetoprotein (congenital hydronephrosis) Physical Examination and Diagnostic and Laboratory Tests Monitor the blood pressure of infants and children suspected of having hydronephrosis. Palpation of the abdomen may reveal enlarged kidney(s) or a distended bladder. A voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) will be performed to determine the presence of a structural defect that may be causing the hydronephrosis. Other diagnostic tests, such as a renal ultrasound or an intravenous pyelogram, may also be performed to clarify the diagnosis. Nursing Management Teach the parents signs and symptoms of UTI and sepsis, as these complications may occur. Explain to the parents that they should observe the child for adequacy of urine output and hydration status. Teach the parents to perform appropriate perineal hygiene and to avoid using irritants in the genital area. The infant or child with hydronephrosis will need follow-up with a pediatric nephrologist or urologist. Vesicoureteral Reflux Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a condition in which urine from the bladder flows back up the ureters. This reflux of urine occurs during bladder contraction with voiding ( Fig. 21.5 ). Reflux may occur in one or both ureters. If reflux occurs when the urine is infected, the kidney is exposed to bacteria and pyelonephritis may result. The increased pressure placed upon the kidney with reflux can cause renal scarring and lead to hypertension later in life and, if severe, renal insufficiency or failure. FIGURE 21.5 Note retrograde flow of urine up the ureter upon bladder contraction. Primary VUR results from a congenital abnormality at the vesicoureteral junction that results in incompetence of the valve. Secondary VUR is related to other structural or functional problems such as neurogenic bladder, bladder dysfunction, or bladder outlet obstruction. As many as 70% of all children diagnosed with UTI have VUR (Nelson & Koo, 2011). VUR is graded according to its severity, from grade I, which is characterized by minor dilatation of the proximal ureter, to grade V, which is characterized by severe dilatation of the ureter and pelvis of the kidney. Grade I and II VUR cases usually resolve spontaneously, but grade III through V cases are generally associated with recurrent UTIs, hydronephrosis, and progressive renal damage (Nelson & Koo, 2011). The goal of therapeutic management of VUR is prevention of pyelonephritis and subsequent renal scarring, which may contribute to the development of hypertension later in life (Nelson & Koo, 2011). Management includes antibiotic prophylaxis and hygiene/voiding practices to prevent UTI. Serial urine cultures are used to determine recurrence of UTI. Biannual, annual, or biennial radionuclide VCUGs are performed to determine the status of VUR. Grade III, IV, and V cases usually warrant surgical intervention. The ureters are resected from the bladder and reimplantedelsewhere in the bladder wall to regain functionality. Take Note! The keys to prevention of long-term sequelae such as hypertension in children with urologic conditions are early diagnosis and intervention, prevention of infection, and close clinical follow-up. Nurses play a key role in monitoring and education. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 752 . Assessment findings pertinent to VUR are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Fever Dysuria Frequency or urgency Nocturia Hematuria Pain in the back, abdomen, or flank Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as: Recurrent UTI in the female Single episode of UTI in the male Congenital defect Family history of VUR For the child who is receiving ongoing follow-up for VUR, determine whether UTIs have occurred since the last visit, as well as the name and dose of prophylactic antibiotic. Physical Examination Monitor the blood pressure for elevation. Palpate the abdomen for presence of a mass (if hydronephrosis is present). VCUG may be used to diagnose VUR. Nursing Management Nursing management for the child with VUR includes preventing infection and providing postoperative care. Preventing Infection When VUR is present, the goal is to avoid urine infection so that infected urine cannot gain access to the kidneys. Initially, most cases of VUR are managed medically. Teach the child to empty the bladder completely. Teach the child and parents appropriate perineal hygiene as well as toileting hygiene to prevent recurrence of UTI. Teach parents about the antibiotic therapy prescribed; the child will be maintained on a low daily dose to prevent UTI. The drug is most effective when given at bedtime because of urinary stasis overnight. Inform parents of the schedule for serial urine cultures and follow-up VCUG. Providing Postoperative Care If VUR is severe or if UTI is recurrent, surgical correction will be necessary. In the first 24 to 48 hours after surgery, maintain the intravenous fluid rate at 1.5 times maintenance to encourage a high urinary output. Monitor urine output via the Foley catheter; urine should be bloody initially, clearing within 2 to 3 days. If ureteral stents are present, monitor urine output from those as well. Administer analgesics for incisional pain relief and antispasmodics or B & O suppositories as needed for bladder spasms. Encourage ambulation and advancement of diet as ordered to promote return of appropriate bowel function. Teach parents that prophylactic antibiotics will be given until 1 to 2 months after surgery, when the VCUG demonstrates absence of reflux. Take Note! When caring for the child who has undergone urologic surgery, avoid manipulating the Foley or suprapubic catheter: catheter manipulation contributes to bladder spasms. Urinary Tract Infection UTI is an infection of the urinary tract, most commonly affecting the bladder. UTI occurs most often as a result of bacteria ascending to the bladder via the urethra. The incidence of UTI in children is nearly 3% and is most common in infants and young children. It occurs more frequently in males than females during infancy, but after 1 year of age it is more common in females (Fisher, Howes & Thornton 2011). One explanation for the more common occurrence in females is that the female's shorter urethra allows bacteria to have easier access to the bladder. The urethra is also located quite close to the vagina and anus in females, allowing spread of bacteria from those areas. The sexually active female adolescent is at risk for the development of UTI, as bacteria may be forced into the urethra by pressure from intercourse. The adolescent male may be somewhat protected from UTI by the antibacterial properties of prostate secretions. UTI presents differently in infants than it does in children. Infants may exhibit fever, irritability, vomiting, failure to thrive, or jaundice. Children may also experience fever and vomiting, but also may have dysuria, frequency, hesitancy, urgency, and/or pain. Pathophysiology E. coli most commonly causes UTI, as it is usually found in the perineal and anal region, close to the urethral opening. Other organisms include Klebsiella, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus, Pseudomonas , and Haemophilus . Numerous factors may contribute to bacterial proliferation. Urinary stasis contributes to the development of a UTI once the bacteria have gained entry. Urine that remains in the bladder after voiding allows bacteria to grow rapidly. A decreased fluid intake also contributes to bacterial growth, as the bacteria become more concentrated. If the urine is alkaline, bacteria are better able to flourish. Untreated bladder infection may allow reflux of infected urine up the ureters to the kidneys and result in pyelonephritis, a more serious infection. Therapeutic Management UTIs are treated with either oral or intravenous antibiotics, depending on the severity of the infection. Urine culture and sensitivity determines the appropriate antibiotic. A 7- to 14-day course of antibiotics is often prescribed, though 2- to 5-day courses may be as effective. Adequate fluid intake is necessary to flush the bacteria from the bladder. Fever management may also be needed. (See Evidence-Based Practice 21.1 .) Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 752 . Assessment findings pertinent to UTI are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Fever Nausea or vomiting Chills Abdomen, back, or flank pain Lethargy Jaundice (in the neonate) Poor feeding or \"just not acting right\" (in the infant) Urinary urgency or frequency Burning or stinging with urination (the infant may cry with urination, the toddler may grab the diaper) Foul-smelling urine Poor appetite (child) Enuresis or incontinence in a previously toilet-trained child Blood in the urine Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as: Previous UTI Obstructive uropathy Inadequate toileting hygiene (often occurs with preschool girls) VUR Constipation Urine holding or dysfunctional voiding EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 21.1 ANTIBIOTICS AND URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS IN CHILDREN STUDY Urinary tract infections (UTIs) commonly occur in children, causing frequent and painful urination. Traditionally, 7- to 10-day courses have been recommended for treating UTI in children. In the search for options to decrease side effects and improve costs, short courses of antibiotics may provide the solution. The authors included 10 randomized and quasi-randomized trials with a total of 652 participants. Participants included were low risk, between the ages of 3 months and 18 years with culture- proven UTI. The studies assessed the benefits and harms of short-course (2 to 4 days) antibiotic treatment compared with that of standard duration (7 to 14 days). Findings The authors found that a 2- to 4-day course of oral antibiotics appears to be as effective as the traditional long course (7 to 14 days) in eradicating UTI in children. Additionally, there was no statistical significance demonstrated in terms of repeat UTI within 1 to 15 months after the original infection. Nursing Implications Shorter courses of antibiotic treatment are much easier for families to comply with and complete, yet families may be accustomed to longer courses of antibiotic treatment and need further education. Educate families that the shorter course is indeed effective in treating UTI. Nurses should advocate for short-course antibiotic treatment in low-risk children with UTI. Adapted from Michael, M., Hodson, E. M., Craig, J. C., Martin, S., & Voyer, V. A. (2007). Short versus standard duration oral antibiotic therapy for acute urinary tract infection in children. The Cochrane Library 2007, 4. Indianapolis, IN: John Wiley & Sons. Neurogenic bladder Uncircumcised male Sexual intercourse Pregnancy Chronic illness Physical Examination In the neonate or young infant, observe for jaundice or increased respiratory rate. In infants and children, inspect the perineal area for redness or irritation. Observe the urine for visible blood, cloudiness, dark color, sediment, mucus, or foul odor. Note pallor, edema, or elevated blood pressure. Palpate the abdomen. Note distended bladder, abdominal mass, or tenderness, particularly in the flank area. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of UTI include: Urinalysis (clean-catch, suprapubic, or catheterized): may be positive for esterase, white blood cells, or bacteria ( bacteriuria ) Urine culture: will be positive for infecting organism Renal ultrasound: may show hydronephrosis if child also has a structural defect VCUG: not usually performed until the child has been treated with antibiotics for at least 48 hours, as infected urine tends to reflux up the ureters anyway. VCUG performed once the urine has regained sterility may be positive for VUR. Renal ultrasound, VCUG, and other nuclear medicine scans such as the technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan may be indicated in certain populations. The physician or nurse practitioner will determine the need for radiologic testing. Nursing Management Goals for nursing management include eradicating infection, promoting comfort, and preventing recurrence of infection. Eradicating Infection The child who can tolerate oral intake will be prescribed an oral antibiotic. The child who has protracted vomiting related to the UTI or who has suspected pyelonephritis will require hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics. Any infant younger than 8 weeks of age with fever, UTI, and a concerning history should also be hospitalized for administration of intravenous antibiotics (Fisher, et al. 2011). Administer oral or intravenous antibiotics as prescribed. Urge the parent to complete the entire course of oral antibiotic at home, even though the child is feeling better. Administer intravenous fluids as ordered or encourage generous oral fluid intake to help flush the bacteria from the bladder. Promoting Comfort Administer antipyretics such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen to reduce fever. A heating pad or warm compress may help relieve abdomen or flank pain. If the child is afraid to urinate due to burning or stinging, encourage voiding in a warm sitz or tub bath. Preventing Recurrence of Infection Encourage the parents to return as ordered for a repeat urine culture after completion of the antibiotic course to ensure eradication of bacteria. Teaching Guidelines 21.1 gives further information on preventing UTI. Teaching Guidelines 21.1 PREVENTING URINARY TRACT INFECTION IN FEMALES Drink enough fluid (to keep urine flushed through bladder). Drink cranberry juice to acidify the urine. Avoid colas and caffeine, which irritate the bladder. Urinate frequently and do not \"hold\" urine (to discourage urinary stasis). Avoid bubble baths (they contribute to vulvar and perineal irritation). Wipe from front to back after voiding (to avoid contaminating the urethra with rectal material). Wear cotton underwear (to decrease the incidence of perineal irritation). Avoid wearing tight jeans or pants. Wash the perineal area daily with soap and water. While menstruating, change sanitary pads frequently to discourage bacterial growth. Void immediately after sexual intercourse. Enuresis Enuresis is continued incontinence of urine past the age of toilet training. Box 21.1 gives further definitions related to enuresis. Nocturnal enuresis generally subsides by 6 years of age; if it does not, further investigation and treatment may be warranted. Occasional daytime wetting or dribbling of urine is usually not a cause for concern, but frequent daytime wetting concerns both the child and the parents. Nocturnal enuresis may persist in some children into late childhood and adolescence, causing significant distress for the affected child and family. In some children, enuresis may occur secondary to a physical disorder such as diabetes mellitus or insipidus, sickle cell anemia, ectopic ureter, or urethral obstruction. Other causes common to both diurnal and nocturnal enuresis include a urine-concentrating defect, UTI, constipation, and emotional distress (sometimes serious). The most frequent cause of daytime enuresis is dysfunctional voiding or holding of urine, though giggle incontinence and stress incontinence also occur. Nocturnal enuresis may be related to a highfluid intake in the evening, obstructive sleep apnea, sexual abuse, a family history of enuresis, or inappropriate family expectations. Physical causes of enuresis must be treated; further management of the disorder focuses on behavioral training, which may be augmented with the use of enuresis alarms or medications. BOX 21.1 DEFINITIONS RELATED TO ENURESIS Primary enuresis: enuresis in the child who has never achieved voluntary bladder control Secondary enuresis: urinary incontinence in the child who previously demonstrated bladder control over a period of at least 3 to 6 consecutive months Diurnal enuresis: daytime loss of urinary control Nocturnal enuresis: nighttime bedwetting Nursing Assessment Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Determine the age of toilet training and when or if the child achieved successful daytime and nighttime dryness. Inquire about urine-holding behaviors such as squatting, dancing, or staring as well as rushing to the bathroom (diurnal enuresis). Inquire about the amount and types of fluid the child typically consumes before bedtime (nocturnal enuresis). Assess for risk factors such as: Family disruption or other stressors Chronic constipation (carefully assess bowel movement patterns) Excessive family demands related to toileting patterns History of being difficult to arouse from sleep Family history of enuresis Assess the child's cognitive status: developmentally delayed children may take significantly longer to achieve urine continence than their typical same-age peers. Assess for short stature or elevated blood pressure, as these may occur when renal abnormalities are present. Nursing Management For the child with diurnal enuresis, encourage him or her to increase the amount of fluid consumed during the day in order to increase the frequency of the urge to void. Set a fixed schedule for the child to attempt to void throughout the day. These practices will usually be sufficient to retrain the child's voiding patterns. The child with nocturnal enuresis without a physiologic cause for bedwetting may require a varied approach (Cox, 2009). Educating the Child and Family About Nocturnal Enuresis Teach the family that the child is not lazy, nor does he or she wet the bed intentionally. Encourage the child and family to read books such as Dry All Night: The Picture Book Technique That Stops Bedwetting by Alison Mack or Waking Up Dry: A Guide to Help Children Overcome Bedwetting by Dr. Howard Bennett. Encourage the parents to limit intake of bladder irritants such as chocolate and caffeine. Teach parents to limit fluid intake after dinner and ensure that the child voids just before going to bed. Waking the child to void at 11 p.m. may also be helpful. Teach the parents to use bed pads and to make the bed with two sets of sheets and pads to decrease the workload in the middle of the night. When sleeping at home, the child should wear his or her usual underwear or pajamas. If away on a family vacation, pull-ups may decrease the stress on both the child and the parents. Providing Support and Encouragement It is important for the child to understand that he or she is not alone. Depending on the child's developmental level, explain that as many as 5 million people have enuresis (this can be done in terms the child can relate to, such as a proportion within a school or 100 times the number of children in one school, etc.). It is not only \"little kids\" who wet the bed, and all kids who wet the bed need help overcoming this problem. Parents should include the child in plans for nighttime urinary control; this helps to increase the child's motivation to become dry. Parents should set up a reward system for dry nights. Parents should include the child in bed linen changes when he or she does wet the bed, but should do so in a matter-of-fact manner rather than in a punitive way; in fact, it is important toalways avoid punishment for bedwetting. With patience, consistency, and time, dryness will be achieved. Provide ongoing emotional support and positive reinforcement to the child and family. Decreasing Nighttime Voiding Teach the family using an enuresis alarm system how to use the alarm as well as the previously mentioned techniques ( Fig. 21.6 ). (Also see links to resources on .) Most of these devices work by sounding an alarm when the first few drops of urine appear; the child then awakens and stops the urine flow. Over time the child becomes conditioned to either awaken when the bladder is full or stop the urine flow when sleeping. Consider This A ntonio Cruise, a 7-year-old boy, is brought to the clinic by his mother for his annual examination. During your assessment the mother brings up concerns that Antonio continues to wet the bed at night. She states, \"I was hoping this would end on its own, but now I'm concerned that there is a problem.\" What further assessment information would you obtain? What education and interventions may be necessary for this child and family? What can you do to provide support and encouragement for Antonio and his family? FIGURE 21.6 Some children and families find great success with the use of an enuresis alarm. The alarm wakes the child at the first sign of wetness. Over time, the child learns to awaken at night in response to the sensation of a full bladder. When behavioral and motivational therapies are unsuccessful, particularly in the older child, medications may be prescribed. Teach the child and parents about the use of medications such as oxybutynin, imipramine, and desmopressin (DDAVP) if these are prescribed (refer to Drug Guide 21.1 ). Take Note! Enuresis is a source of shame and embarrassment for children and adolescents. It affects the child's life emotionally, behaviorally, and socially. The family's life is also significantly affected. Treatment failures for enuresis have been correlated with adolescent low self-esteem (Martin & Volkmar, 2007). Acquired Disorders Resulting in Altered Renal Function A number of acquired disorders are responsible for alterations in renal function. They may occur as an autoimmune response or in relation to a bacterial infection. Renal dysfunction may also occur as a result of obstructive disorders or repeated VUR, as discussed earlier. Left untreated, these disorders may lead to renal failure. Even when treated appropriately, sometimes the appropriateresponse is not achieved and acute or chronic renal failure develops. Renal disorders are the most frequent cause of hypertension in children. Take Note! Severe hypertension (blood pressure higher than the 99th percentile for age and sex) may lead to damage of the eye or vital organs (kidney, brain, or heart), or even death (Flynn & Tullus, 2009). Nurses must be adept at accurately measuring blood pressure in children. Nephrotic Syndrome Nephrotic syndrome occurs as a result of increased glomerular basement membrane permeability, which allows abnormal loss of protein in the urine. Nephrotic syndrome generally occurs in three forms\u2014congenital, idiopathic, and secondary. Congenital nephrotic syndrome is an inherited disorder; it is rare and occurs primarily in families of Finnish descent. The prognosis is poor, though some success has occurred with early, aggressive treatment and with the advances in kidney transplantation in infants (Jalanko, 2009). Nephrotic syndrome may also occur secondary to another condition such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Henoch- Sch\u00f6nlein purpura, or diabetes. Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is the most commonly occurring type in children and is often termed minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) (Lane, 2010). MCNS occurs more frequently in males than females, with 70% of cases occurring by age 5 years (Lane, 2010). This discussion will focus primarily on MCNS. Complications of nephrotic syndrome include anemia, infection, poor growth, peritonitis, thrombosis, and renal failure. Pathophysiology Increased glomerular permeability results in the passage of larger plasma proteins through the glomerular basement membrane. This results in excess loss of protein (albumin) in the urine ( proteinuria ) and decreased protein and albumin (hypoalbuminemia) in the bloodstream. Protein loss in nephrotic syndrome tends to be almost exclusively albumin. Hypoalbuminemia results in a change in osmotic pressure, and fluid shifts from the bloodstream into the interstitial tissue (causing edema). This decrease in blood volume triggers the kidneys to respond by conserving sodium and water, leading to further edema. The liver senses the protein loss and increases production of lipoproteins. Hyperlipidemia then develops as the excess lipids cannot be excreted in the urine. Hyperlipidemia associated with nephrotic syndrome may be quite severe, yet cholesterol levels may decrease when the nephrotic syndrome is in remission, only to rise significantly again with a relapse. Children with nephrotic syndrome are at increased risk for clotting (thromboembolism) because of the decreased intravascular volume. They are also at increased risk for the development of serious infection, most commonly pneumococcal pneumonia, sepsis, or spontaneous peritonitis. Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome may result in acute renal failure. Therapeutic Management Medical management of MCNS usually involves the use of corticosteroids. Intravenous albumin may be used in the severely edematous child. Diuretics are also required in the edematous phase. Long-term therapy is usually required to induce remission. The nephrologist will determine the length of therapy based on the child's response. Children who have steroid-responsive MCNS generally have a favorable prognosis. Some children with MCNS exhibit a minimal response to steroid therapy or experience remissions and the MCNS is steroid resistant (Lane, 2010). Immunosuppressive therapy such as cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine A, or mycophenolate mofetil may be necessary. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 752 . Assessment findings pertinent to MCNS are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Nausea or vomiting (may be related to ascites) Recent weight gain History of periorbital edema upon waking, progressing to generalized edema throughout the day Weakness or fatigue Irritability or fussiness Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as: Intrauterine growth retardation Young age (younger than 3 years) Male sex Physical Examination The physical assessment of the child with nephrotic syndrome includes inspection and observation, auscultation, and palpation. Observe the child for edema (periorbital, generalized [ anasarca ], or abdominal ascites). As the disease progresses, the edema also progresses to become more generalized, eventually becoming severe. Inspect the skin for a stretched, tight appearance; pallor; or skin breakdown related to significant edema ( Fig. 21.7 ). Document height (or length) and weight. Note increased respiratory rate or increased work of breathing related to ascites and edema. FIGURE 21.7 Note marked edema associated with nephrotic syndrome. Note the blood pressure; it may be elevated in the child with nephrotic syndrome, though it is most often either normal or decreased unless the child is progressing to renal failure. Auscultate heart and lung sounds, noting abnormalities related to fluid overload. Palpate the skin, noting tautness. Palpate the abdomen and document the presence of ascites. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Urine dipstick will reveal marked proteinuria. Infrequently, mild hematuria is also present. Serum protein and albumin levels will be low (often markedly so). Serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels are elevated. With continued nephrotic syndrome, creatinine and BUN may become elevated. Nursing Management Goals for nursing management include promoting diuresis, preventing infection, promoting adequate nutrition, and educating the parents about ongoing care at home. As with other chronic disorders, provide ongoing emotional support to the child and family. Promoting Diuresis Administer corticosteroids as ordered. Tapering or weaning doses are required when the time comes to stop corticosteroid therapy.Administer diuretics if ordered, usually furosemide (Lasix). Children may develop hypokalemia because of potassium loss as an adverse effect of furosemide. Those children may require potassium supplementation or a diet higher in potassium-containing foods. Monitor urine output and the amount of protein in the urine (by dipstick). Weigh the child daily on the same scale either naked or wearing the same amount of clothing. Assess for resolution of edema. Measure pulse rate and blood pressure every 4 hours to detect hypovolemia resulting from excessive fluid shifts. Enforce oral fluid restrictions if ordered. In cases of severe hypoalbuminemia, intravenous albumin may be administered. Increases in the serum albumin level cause fluid to shift from the subcutaneous spaces back into the bloodstream. A diuretic such as furosemide administered immediately after the albumin infusion allows for optimal diuresis and prevents fluid overload. Refer to Drug Guide 21.1 for the nursing implications related to use of these medications. Preventing Infection Monitor the child's temperature. Administer pneumococcal vaccine as prescribed (see Chapter 9 for information on immunizations). Administer prophylactic antibiotics, if prescribed. Delay administering live vaccines until at least 2 weeks after corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive medication therapy ceases. Teach parents that if the child is unimmunized and is exposed to chickenpox, the parents should notify the child's pediatrician, nurse practitioner or nephrologist immediately so that the child may receive varicella zoster immunoglobulin. Encouraging Adequate Nutrition and Growth Encourage a nutrient-rich diet within prescribed restrictions. Fluid restriction is reserved for children with massive edema. Sodium intake may be restricted in the edematous child in an effort to prevent further fluid retention. Consultation with the dietitian is often helpful in meal planning because many of the foods that children like are high in sodium. Encourage protein-rich snacks. Consult with the child and family in planning meals and snacks that the child likes and will be likely to consume. Use of nutritional supplement shakes may be helpful for some children. Educating the Family Teach parents how to give medications and monitor for adverse effects. Demonstrate the urine dipstick technique for detecting protein, and encourage the family to keep a chart of dipstick results. The child may return to school but should avoid contact with sick playmates. If the child is exposed to another child with an infectious illness, explain to the parents that they should monitor temperature and urine dipstick results more frequently to identify a relapse in nephrotic syndrome early so that treatment can begin. Providing Emotional Support Nephrotic syndrome is often a chronic condition, and children who are responsive to steroid treatment may enter remission only to experience relapse. This cycle of relapse and remission takes an emotional toll on the child and family. Frequent hospitalizations require the child to miss school and the parents to miss work; this creates further stress for the family. The child may experience social isolation because he or she must avoid exposure to infections or because of self-esteem problems. The child may be dissatisfied with his or her appearance because of edema and weight gain, short stature, and the classic \"moon face\" associated with chronic steroid use. Provide emotional support to the child and family. Encourage them in their efforts to maintain the treatment plan. Introduce the child to other youngsters with chronic renal conditions. Refer families to the National Kidney Foundation, a link to which can be found on , for information about local support groups and resources. Acute Poststreptococcal Glomerulonephritis Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) is a condition in which immune processes injure the glomeruli. Immune mechanisms cause inflammation, which results in altered glomerular structure and function in both kidneys. It often occurs following an infection, usually an upper respiratory or skin infection. APSGN is caused by an antibody-antigen reaction secondary to an infection with a nephritogenic strain of group A -hemolytic streptococcus. APSGN occurs more frequently in males than females and with a peak prevalence occurring around 5 to 6 years of age (Bhimma, 2010). The most serious complication is progression to uremia and renal failure (either acute or chronic). There is no specific medical treatment for APSGN. Treatment is aimed at maintaining fluid volume and managing hypertension. If there is evidence of a current streptococcal infection, antibiotic therapy will be necessary.Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 752 . Assessment findings pertinent to acute glomerulonephritis are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Fever Lethargy Headache Decreased urine output Abdominal pain Vomiting Anorexia Assess the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as a recent episode of pharyngitis or other streptococcal infection, age older than 2 years, or male sex. Physical Examination and Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Assess the child's blood pressure for elevation, which is common. Note the presence of mild edema. Observe for signs of cardiopulmonary congestion such as increased work of breathing or cough. Auscultate the lungs for crackles and the heart for gallop. The urine dipstick test will reveal proteinuria as well as hematuria. Inspect the urine for gross hematuria, which will cause the urine to appear tea colored, cola colored, or even a dirty green color. Serum creatinine and BUN may be normal or elevated, the serum complement level is depressed, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is elevated. Laboratory findings specific to streptococcus include an elevated antistreptolysin (ASO) titer and an elevated DNAase B antigen titer. Nursing Management Administer antihypertensives such as labetalol or nifedipine and diuretics as ordered. Monitor blood pressure frequently. Maintain sodium and fluid restrictions as prescribed during the initial edematous phase. Weigh the child daily on the same scale wearing the same amount of clothing. Monitor increasing urine output and note improvement in the urine color. Document resolution of edema. Provide a careful neurologic evaluation, as hypertension may cause encephalopathy and seizures. Children with APSGN generally are fatigued and choose bed rest during the acute phase. Provide the child with age-appropriate activities and cluster care to allow rest periods. Some children may be managed at home if edema is mild and they are not hypertensive. Teach the family to monitor urine output and color, take blood pressure measurements, and restrict the diet as prescribed. The child cared for at home should not participate in strenuous activity until proteinuria and hematuria are resolved. If renal involvement progresses, dialysis may become necessary. Take Note! Avoid use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in children with questionable renal function, as the antiprostaglandin action of NSAIDs may cause a further decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (Solomon, 2011). Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is defined by three features\u2014hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. Typical HUS features an antecedent diarrheal illness. Other causes of HUS include idiopathic, inherited, drug-related, association with malignancies, transplantation, and malignant hypertension. This discussion will focus on typical HUS, the type preceded by a diarrheal illness. Watery diarrhea progresses to hemorrhagic colitis, then to the triad of HUS. The features of HUS, as well as effects on other organs, are caused primarily by microthrombi and ischemic changes within the organs. The thrombotic events in the small blood vessels of the glomerulus lead to occlusion of the glomerular capillary loops and glomerulosclerosis, resulting in renal failure. A verotoxin-producing strain of E. coli , O157:H7, causes the majority of cases, though Streptococcus pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae , and other bacteria may also be the cause (Tan & Silverberg, 2010). It is thought that antibiotic treatment for the bacteriamay contribute to release of the verotoxin. Undercooked ground beef accounts for most cases of E. coli O157:H7 infection, but it is also transmitted via the feces of numerous animals as well as unpasteurized dairy and fruit products. Transmission also occurs via human feces, and cases have been linked to public swimming pools. HUS occurs most often in children age 6 months to 4 years (Tan & Silverberg, 2010). Complications include chronic renal failure, seizures and coma, pancreatitis, intussusception, rectal prolapse, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therapeutic management of HUS is directed toward maintaining fluid balance; correcting hypertension, acidosis, and electrolyte abnormalities; replenishing circulating red blood cells; and providing dialysis if needed. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 752 . Assessment findings pertinent to HUS are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include watery diarrhea accompanied by cramping and sometimes vomiting. After several days, the diarrhea becomes bloody and eventually improves. Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as ingestion of ground beef, visits to a water park or to a petting zoo before the onset of the diarrheal illness, or use of antidiarrheal medications or antibiotics. Physical Examination Observe the child for pallor, toxic appearance, edema, oliguria (decreased urine output), or anuria (absent urine output). Assess for elevated blood pressure and tenderness in the abdomen. Assess the child for neurologic involvement, which may include irritability, altered level of consciousness, seizures, posturing, or coma. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Urinalysis may reveal the presence of blood, protein, pus, and/or casts. Serum laboratory abnormalities are numerous and may include: Elevated BUN and creatinine Moderate to severe anemia (with the presence of Burr cells, schistocytes, spherocytes, or helmet cells), mild to severe thrombocytopenia Increased reticulocyte count Increased bilirubin and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) Negative test (except in cases left shift Hyponatremia Hyperkalemia Hyperphosphatemia Metabolic acidosis Nursing Management Nursing management of the child with HUS focuses on close observation and monitoring of the child's status. Institute and maintain contact precautions to prevent spread of E. coli O157:H7 to other children (bacteria are shed for up to 17 days after resolution of the diarrhea). Close attention must be paid to fluid volume status. Prevention of HUS is also an important nursing function. Maintaining Appropriate Fluid Volume Balance Maintain strict intake and output monitoring and recording to evaluate the progression toward renal failure. Carefully monitor intravenous infusions and blood chemistries. Administer diuretics as ordered. Assess blood pressure frequently and report elevations to the physician or nurse practitioner. Administer antihypertensives as ordered and monitor their effectiveness. Encourage adequate nutritional intake within the constraints of prescribed dietary restrictions. Monitor for bleeding as well as for fatigue and pallor. Follow the institutional protocol for transfusion of packed red blood cells and/or platelets (platelets are usually transfused only if activebleeding or severe thrombocytopenia occurs). Report progressive deterioration in laboratory findings to the physician or nurse practitioner. Some children with HUS will require dialysis for at least several days. Preventing Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome Proper hand washing is necessary. Teach children to wash their hands after using the bathroom, before eating, and after petting farm animals. Encourage the use of \"swim diapers,\" which contain feces, for children who are not toilet trained. Teach parents to thoroughly cook all meats to a core temperature of 155\u00b0F, or until the meat is gray or brown throughout and the juices from the meat are clear rather than pink. Wash all fruits and vegetables thoroughly. Ensure that drinking water and water used for recreation are treated appropriately. Avoid unpasteurized dairy products and fruit juices (including cider). Renal Failure Renal failure is a condition in which the kidneys cannot concentrate urine, conserve electrolytes, or excrete waste products. As in adults, renal failure in children may occur as an acute or chronic condition. Some cases of acute renal failure resolve without further complications, while dialysis is necessary in other children. When acute renal failure continues to progress, it becomes chronic (also known as end-stage renal disease [ESRD]). Dialysis and kidney transplantation are treatment modalities used for ESRD. Acute Renal Failure Acute renal failure is defined as a sudden, often reversible, decline in renal function that results in the accumulation of metabolic toxins (particularly nitrogenous wastes) as well as fluid and electrolyte imbalance. Fluid overload may lead to hypertension, pulmonary edema, and congestive heart failure. Additional complications include hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, and uremia. In children, acute renal failure most commonly occurs as a result of decreased renal perfusion, as occurs in hypovolemic or septic shock. It may also occur in children with hemolytic anemia or as a result of nephrotoxicity from medications. Complications include anemia, hyperkalemia, hypertension, pulmonary edema, cardiac failure, and altered level of consciousness or seizures. In addition, acute renal failure may also progress to a chronic state. Therapeutic management is aimed at treating the underlying cause, managing the fluid and electrolyte disturbances, and decreasing blood pressure. Take Note! Medications commonly used in children can reduce renal function. Cephalosporins may cause a transient increase in BUN and creatinine. Truly nephrotoxic drugs often used in children include aminoglycosides, sulfonamides, vancomycin, and NSAIDs. Make sure that potentially nephrotoxic drugs are administered according to published safe guidelines (dosage, frequency, rate of administration) (Taketokmo, Hodding, & Kraus, 2010). Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 752 . Assessment findings pertinent to acute renal failure are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Lethargy Fever Decreased urine output Assess the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as history of shock, trauma, burns, urologic abnormalities, renal disease, use of nephrotoxic medications, or severe blood transfusion reaction. Physical Examination and Laboratory and Diagnostic TestsNote decreased skin elasticity, dry mucous membranes, or edema. Auscultate the lungs for crackles, which may occur with pulmonary edema. Document tachypnea. Note cardiac rhythm disturbances. Evaluate the child's level of consciousness. Laboratory tests will reveal increased serum creatinine levels and possible electrolyte disturbances, such as hyperkalemia hypocalcemia. Urinalysis may reveal proteinuria or hematuria. Take Note! Monitor the infant or child with renal failure carefully for signs of congestive heart failure, such as edema accompanied by bounding pulse, presence of an S 3 heart sound, adventitious lung sounds, and shortness of breath. Nursing Management Nursing care focuses on managing hypertension, restoring fluid and electrolyte balance, and educating the family. Managing Hypertension Carefully monitor the child's blood pressure. Administer antihypertensives as prescribed. When a fast-acting drug such as nifedipine (Procardia) sublingually or labetalol intravenously is used, stay with the child and frequently monitor blood pressure. Immediately notify the physician or nurse practitioner if high blood pressure is resistant to medication and the blood pressure remains elevated. Restoring Fluid and Electrolyte Balance Monitor vital signs frequently and assess urine specific gravity. Maintain strict records of intake and output. Administer diuretics as ordered. When urine output is restored, diuresis may be significant. Monitor for signs of hyperkalemia (weak, irregular pulse; muscle weakness; abdominal cramping) and hypocalcemia (muscle twitching or tetany). Administer polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) as ordered orally, rectally, or through a nasogastric tube to decrease potassium levels. Kayexalate removes potassium primarily by exchanging sodium for it, which is then eliminated in the feces. Administer packed red blood cell transfusions as ordered (may need to be followed by a dose of diuretic). Dialysis may become necessary if oliguria is sustained and leads to significant fluid overload, the electrolyte imbalance reaches dangerous levels, or uremia results in depression of the central nervous system. Providing Family Education Educate the family about the plan of care and the need for fluid restriction, if ordered. Instruct the family to save all voids for observation and measurement by the nurse. Provide education about the use of dialysis if relevant. End-Stage Renal Disease ESRD is chronic renal failure requiring long-term dialysis or renal transplantation. Chronic renal failure in children most often results from congenital structural defects such as obstructive uropathy (Klein, 2010). It may also be caused by an inherited condition such as familial nephritis or may result from an acquired problem such as glomerulonephritis; it may follow an infectious process such as pyelonephritis or HUS (Klein, 2010). This is in contrast to chronic renal failure in adults, which primarily results from diabetes or hypertension. Uremia, hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis many. Uremic toxins deplete erythrocytes and the failing kidneys cannot produce erythropoietin, so severe anemia results. Hypertension is common and heart failure may occur. Hypocalcemia results in renal rickets (brittle bones). Growth is retarded and sexual maturation may be delayed or absent. Many children with ESRD experience depression, anxiety, impaired social interaction, and poor self-esteem (Klein, 2010). See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 752 . Assessment findings pertinent to ESRD are discussed below. Health History Explore the health history for low birthweight (associated with kidney dysfunction and anatomic alterations), poor growth (weight, length/height, and head circumference), and regimen of dialysis. Note decreased appetite or energy level, dry or itchy skin, or bone or joint pain. Physical Examination and Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Perform a thorough physical assessment, noting any abnormalities (may vary from child to child). If present, assess the peritoneal catheter site for absence of drainage, bleeding, or redness. If the child undergoes hemodialysis, assess the fistula or graft site for the presence of a bruit and a thrill. Laboratory tests may reveal low hemoglobin and hematocrit, increased serum phosphorus and potassium levels, and decreased sodium, calcium, and bicarbonate levels. BUN, uric acid, and creatinine levels will be elevated. A 24-hour urine creatinine clearance test will show increased amounts of creatinine in the urine, reflecting decreasing kidney function. Take Note! Carefully assess children with ESRD for worsening uremia or metabolic acidosis. Uremia may result in central nervous system symptoms such as headache or coma, or gastrointestinal or neuromuscular disturbances. Metabolic acidosis causes lethargy, dull headache, and confusion. Nursing Management Nursing goals for the child with ESRD include promoting growth and development, removing waste products and maintaining fluid balance via dialysis, encouraging psychosocial well-being, and supporting and educating the family. Promoting Growth and Development Encourage the child to choose foods he or she likes that are within the imposed dietary restrictions. Daily protein requirements for adequate growth range from 0.9 to 1.5 grams of protein per kilogram of weight. Sodium and/or potassium restrictions may also be necessary. Enforce fluid restrictions if prescribed. Administer medications such as erythropoietin, growth hormone, and vitamin and mineral supplements to augment nutritional status and promote growth. Table 21.2 lists medications and supplements used to support growth. Encouraging Psychosocial Well-Being The child with chronic renal failure and particularly ESRD often suffers from depression and anxiety. Refer children and their families to the hospital social worker or counselor as needed for depression or anxiety issues. The chronic need for dialysis (daily with peritoneal dialysis or three or four times per week with hemodialysis) confers long-term stress on the child and family. The child usually demonstrates poor growth and often suffers from body image disturbance. Frequent medical appointments and hospitalizations interfere with the child's scholastic achievements. Introduce the child to other children with ESRD (this often happens anyway at the hemodialysis center). Ensure that the family is aware of financial and support resources within the community and refer them to the National Kidney Foundation. Also suggest the American Kidney Fund, which provides financial aid and access to summer camps for children withrenal problems. Links to both of these resources are located on . Camp is an excellent way for children to demonstrate that they have mastered some of the loss-of-control issues related to their disease. Several websites provide forums for children and teens with kidney failure or transplantation so they can learn about their disease, access resources, and/or communicate with other children. Links to such websites are available on . Dialysis and Transplantation Peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis is required on a long-term basis for children with chronic renal failure or ESRD. Once the child has progressed to ESRD, kidney transplantation is needed in order for the child to progress with normal growth and development. Peritoneal Dialysis Peritoneal dialysis uses the child's abdominal cavity as a semipermeable membrane to help remove excess fluid and waste products ( Figs. 21.8 and 21.9 ). The parent or caregiver performs peritoneal dialysis at home after completing a training course. The process is either completed overnight with the use of a machine (continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis) or in increments throughout the day for a total of 4 to 8 hours (continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis). Comparison Chart 21.1 compares these two methods of peritoneal dialysis. The advantages of peritoneal dialysis over hemodialysis include improved growth as a result of more dietary freedom, increased independence in daily activities, and a steadier state of electrolyte balance. However, the risk for infection (peritonitis and sepsis) is a continual concern with peritoneal dialysis (Klein, 2010). Dialysate exchange protocols, care of the catheter in the abdomen, and dressing changes must all be performed using sterile technique to avoid introducing microorganisms into the peritoneal cavity. Box 21.2 lists additional risks associated with peritoneal dialysis. FIGURE 21.8 The peritoneal dialysis catheter is tunneled under the skin into the peritoneal cavity. Hemodialysis Hemodialysis removes toxins and excess fluid from the blood by pumping the child's blood through a hemodialysis machine and then reinfusing the blood into the child. Needles to remove and reinfuse the blood are inserted into an arteriovenous fistula or graft, usually located in the child's arm ( Figs. 21.10 and 21.11 ). Hemodialysis frees the parent from the need to perform daily dialysis, but the procedure, which takes 3 to 6 hours, must be done two to four times per week (usually three) at a pediatric hemodialysis center. This requires time away from school and other activities for the child and from work and other family responsibilities for the parent. Since hemodialysis is usually performed only every other day, larger amounts of waste products build up in the child's blood (uremia), placing the child at higher risk for seizures. The access site may become infected, and occlusion is also possible. The child must follow a stricter diet between hemodialysis treatments, though dietary restrictions are usually lifted while the child is actually undergoing the treatment. FIGURE 21.9 (A) During the \"fill\" phase of peritoneal dialysis, dialysate fluid is instilled into the peritoneal cavity. (B) During the \"dwell\" phase, the child may be up out of bed with the empty dialysate bag folded up with the tubing under his clothing. (C) During the \"drain\" phase, the old dialysate is drained from the peritoneum bygravity, bringing with it waste products and excess fluid. The dialysate bags are weighed prior to filling and after draining to determine the amount of fluid removed from the child. COMPARISON CHART 21.1 METHODS OF PERITONEAL DIALYSIS Nursing Assessment Refer to the section on nursing assessment of the child with chronic renal failure/ESRD, as it is similar to assessment of the child undergoing dialysis. Assess for alterations in blood pressure and laboratory values following dialysis. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Assess the child receiving peritoneal dialysis for toleration of the fluid volume instilled within the peritoneum. The abdomen will remain distended while the fluid is indwelling and will be significantly flatter when the fluid is drained. Assess the Tenckhoff catheter site for signs of infection. Monitor the child's temperature. Inspect the dialysate effluent for fibrin or cloudiness, which may indicate infection. Weigh the child daily (in the drain phase if on peritoneal dialysis). For the child who receives hemodialysis, assess the arteriovenous fistula or graft site with each set of vital signs. Auscultate the site for the presence of a bruit and palpate for the presence of a thrill. Notify the physician or nurse practitioner immediately if either is absent. BOX 21.2 RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PERITONEAL DIALYSIS Hypertension and other cardiac complications Seizures Obstructed catheter Dialysate leakage Hyperglycemia Increased triglyceride levels Increased protein loss Parental stress and burnout related to repetitive nature of daily interventionFIGURE 21.10 (A) Arteriovenous fistula. (B) Arteriovenous graft. FIGURE 21.11 hemodialysis. Take Note! Avoid taking blood pressure, performing venipuncture, or using a tourniquet in the extremity with the arteriovenous fistula or graft; these procedures may cause occlusion and subsequent malfunction of the fistula or graft. Teach parents and children to inform all health care providers they come in contact with about the presence of the fistula or graft. Nursing ManagementSpecially trained and certified nurses perform both peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. The general pediatric nurse's role is related to the ongoing care of the child. The child undergoing peritoneal dialysis usually is allowed a more liberal diet and intake of fluid than the child undergoing hemodialysis. Peritoneal dialysis removes waste and excess fluids on a daily basis, whereas hemodialysis occurs about every other day. Most routine medications are withheld on the morning that hemodialysis is scheduled, since they would be filtered out through the dialysis process anyway. Administer these medications as soon as the child returns from the dialysis unit. See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Thinking About Development T revon Smith is a 17-year-old male football player who was on track for a college scholarship. Following an episode of acute glomerulonephritis, Trevon has progressed to chronic renal failure and is dependent upon hemodialysis. He is listed for a kidney transplant. How will Trevon's developmental stage affect his desire to comply with the medical regimen? What types of psychosocial issues might Trevon be experiencing and how can the nurse best support Trevon at this time? How will the nurse educate Trevon about self-care? Renal Transplantation Renal transplantation is the optimal treatment for ESRD and offers the best opportunity for the child to live a normal life. Vigilant medication administration is necessary after the transplant to prevent organ rejection. The child achieves improved renal function with the transplant and may demonstrate improved growth, enhanced cognitive development, and improved psychosocial development and quality of life. Kidneys are obtained from a cadaver (a patient declared brain-dead who had previously given consent to organ donation) or from a blood relative (living-related). The transplanted kidney must match the child's blood type and the child's human leukocyte antigens (HLAs). The cadaver kidney or living-related kidney is implanted surgically in the abdomen and the blood vessels are anastomosed to the aorta and superior vena cava. Generally, living-related transplants have a decreased rejection rate compared to cadaver transplants (Klein & Martin, 2010). Living-related kidney donation and subsequent transplantation can be planned ahead and scheduled in advance. In contrast, cadaver kidneys become available suddenly, leaving less time for preoperative preparation. For either type, last-minute blood tissue typing is required before the final decision is made to move forward with transplantation. Often the child's native kidneys are removed before or at the time of the renal transplant because of their association with hypertension in the child (Klein & Martin, 2010). Take Note!Cadaver kidneys are allocated to potential recipients based on the age of the child with renal failure, the time that he or she has been awaiting a transplant, blood type, HLA antibody matching, panel reactive antibodies, and region of the country (so that the donated kidney can be received expeditiously). Nursing Assessment A thorough physical assessment is warranted for any child undergoing renal transplant, whether in the initial postoperative period, at a clinic visit, or when admitted to the hospital, to rule out transplant rejection. Note recent health history, medications and their doses, and any symptoms the child has been having. In the initial postoperative period, assess the incision for redness, edema, or drainage. If any of these signs of infection or rejection occur, notify the transplant surgeon and nephrologist immediately. Monitor blood pressure and other vital signs closely. Document resolution of edema. Record intake and output accurately. Assess for signs and symptoms of transplant rejection such as malaise, fever, unexplained weight gain, or pain over the transplant area. Nursing Management Postoperative care focuses on preventing rejection, monitoring renal function, maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance, and educating the child and family. Take Note! Encourage the child with a renal transplant to wear a medical alert necklace or bracelet, and urge the parents to inform community emergency services of the child's transplant status. Preventing Rejection and Promoting Renal Function Administer immunosuppressants accurately and in a timely fashion. Obtain and monitor serum levels of these medications per protocol. Immediately report significant alterations in vital signs or edema at the surgical site, as they may indicate transplant rejection. Maintain strict documentation of intake and output. Once adequate urine output is established, intake is usually liberalized. Educating the Child and Family Develop a schedule to cluster care so that the child may receive the rest needed for recovery despite the many and frequent assessments and interventions. With the family, develop a medication schedule that will be compatible with the family's life at home as well as the restrictions related to some medications. Begin teaching with the family as soon as the child's condition is stable. Accurate medication administration and home monitoring are necessary to prevent rejection. The child may return to school when discharged from the hospital, but the family will need to communicate closely with the school nurse about the child's immunosuppressed status. The American Nephrology Nurses Association has developed a renal transplant fact sheet that can be shared with the school nurse. A link to the association's website is located on . Take Note! Tell the parents to inform their child's physician or nurse practitioner about the child's long-term corticosteroid use and/or immunosuppressed status, as the child should not receive any live vaccines.REPRODUCTIVE ORGAN DISORDERS A number of disorders may occur within the female or male genitalia and internal reproductive organs in children. These problems may be structural or infectious. FIGURE 21.12 Labial adhesions. Note fusion of the labia minora. Copyrighted 2011. UBM Medica LLC. 82486:1111JM Female Disorders Disorders of the female reproductive organs that occur in children and adolescents include structural disorders, infectious disorders, and menstrual disorders. Labial Adhesions Labial adhesion or labial fusion is partial or adherence of the labia minora ( Fig. 21.12 ). UTI may result from urinary stasis behind the labia; if the adhesions are left untreated, the vaginal orifice may become inaccessible, presenting difficulty with sexual intercourse in the future. Nursing Assessment Younger girls have a higher risk of adhesions (3 months to 4 years) (Nepple & Cooper, 2011). Assess the history for dysuria or urinary frequency. Inspect the genitalia for fusion or adherence of the labia minora. Nursing Management Administer topical estrogen cream as prescribed, usually once or twice daily. Teach the parents to continue cream application until the labia separate. Encourage use of petroleum jelly daily for 1 month following labial separation to prevent recurrence of adhesion. Vulvovaginitis Vulvovaginitis is inflammation of the vulva and vagina. Inflammation may occur as a result of bacterial or yeast overgrowth or from chemical factors such as bubble bath, soaps, or perfumes found in personal care products. Poor hygiene may also cause vulvovaginitis. Tight clothing may cause a heat rash in the perineal area. Persistent scratching of the irritated area may result in the complication of superficial skin infection. Nursing AssessmentElicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history may include itching or burning in the perineal area. Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors, which may include: Young age (toilet-trained preschooler) Poor hygiene Sexual activity Immune disorders Diabetes mellitus Inspect the perineum for redness, edema, irritation, rash, or vaginal discharge (note color, consistency, and odor). Nursing Management Teach appropriate hygiene (daily and toileting). Girls (or their parents) should wash the genital area thoroughly on a daily basis with mild soap and water. Rinse the area well. Encourage girls to wipe after urinating and after bowel movements to wipe in a front-to- back motion. The girl should wear cotton underwear and should change it at least once a day. Administer topical or oral medications as ordered. Table 21.3 lists treatments related to specific types of vulvovaginitis. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an inflammation of the upper female genital tract and nearby structures. The fallopian tubes, ovaries, or peritoneum may be involved, and endometriosis may also be present. PID results from bacterial invasion through the cervix and vagina, ascending into the uterus and fallopian tubes. The most common causes of PID are Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae , although other bacteria and normal vaginal flora may be implicated. PID may result in fever, abdominal pain, pain with intercourse, dysmenorrhea (painful menstrual cycles), and abnormal uterine bleeding. Long-term complications include chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility related to scarring. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 752 . When discussing any problem related to the reproductive organs or menstruation with the preteen or teen, it is necessary to discuss sexuality. The girl may be reluctant to share this information with the nurse. Approaches to discussing sexuality with the adolescent that may increase the likelihood of obtaining a truthful history include: Discuss the girl's general health, menarche, and menstrual cycle first, and then work toward discussing sexual behavior. Start with questions about the girl's friends and social life, moving the conversation toward sexual behavior. Always discuss sexual behavior one on one with the adolescent (without the parent present), and then ask the adolescent's permission to discuss concerns with the parent. If the adolescent does not consent to parental involvement, then confidentiality must be maintained. Assessment findings pertinent to PID are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Abdominal pain (ranging from mild to severe) Prolonged or increased menstrual bleeding Dysmenorrhea Dysuria Painful sexual intercourse Nausea Vomiting Explore the girl's current and past medical health history for risk factors such as: Multiple sexual partners Lack of consistent condom use Lack of contraceptive use History of prior sexually transmitted infection Douching Prostitution Alcohol or drug use (particularly if associated with sexual activity) Physical Examination Inspect for fever (usually over 101\u00b0F) or vaginal discharge. Palpate the abdomen, noting tenderness over the uterus or ovaries. An elevated C-reactive protein level and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate indicate an inflammatory process. Cervical culture reveals the causative bacterial organism. Nursing Management PID is often treated in the outpatient setting with intramuscular or oral antibiotic regimens. If the adolescent is severely ill or has a very high fever or protracted vomiting, then she may be hospitalized. Antibiotics are needed to eradicate the infection. Maintain hydration via intravenous fluids if necessary and administer analgesics as needed for pain. Semi-Fowler positioning promotes pelvic drainage. A key element to treatment of PID is education to prevent recurrence (see Healthy People 2020 and Teaching Guideline 21.2 ). HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Teaching Guidelines 21.2 PREVENTING PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE Insist that sexual partners use condoms. Do not use a vaginal douche routinely, as this may lead to bacterial overgrowth. Get screened regularly for sexually transmitted infections. Make sure that each sexual partner also receives antibiotic treatment. Menstrual Disorders Menstruation begins in most girls about 2 years after breast development starts, around the time of Tanner stage 4 breast and pubic hair development and on average at around 12 to 13 years of age. Menstruation has many effects on girls and women, including emotional and self-image issues. Adolescents may suffer from a variety of menstrual disorders, including premenstrual syndrome and several different disorders related to menstrual bleeding and cramping ( Table 21.4 ). In healthy girls, the menstrual period varies in the heaviness of flow. Periods may occur irregularly for up to 2 years after menarche (the onset of menstruation), but after that the regular menstrual cycle should be established. The normal cycle can vary from 21 to 45 days in length, with the period usually lasting 2 to 7 days. Girls who take oral contraceptives usually have very regular 28-day cycles, with lighter bleeding than those who do not take contraceptives. Pathophysiology Premenstrual syndrome is a collection of physical and/or affective symptoms that occur predictably during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Symptoms begin 5 to 10 days before each period and usually resolve by the time the period begins or shortly thereafter (the timing may vary by adolescent but is consistent with each cycle). Disorders of bleeding and cramping are summarized in Table 21.4 . Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 752 . When girls present for evaluation of menstrual concerns, a focused yet thorough nursing assessment is necessary. Health History Obtain a thorough and accurate menstrual history; determine age at menarche, usual length of menstrual period, usual menstrual flow,number of pads or tampons used per day, date of last normal menstrual period, premenstrual symptoms, and any pain related to the menstrual cycle. Obtain a description of the pain, what relief measures have been tried, and what the success of those measures has been. If pain occurs with menstrual periods, assess for associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or loose stools. Explore the history for symptoms of bloating, water retention, weight gain, headache, muscle aches, abdominal pain, food cravings, or breast tenderness. Determine the extent of emotional symptoms related to the menstrual cycle, such as anxiety, insomnia, mood swings, tension, crying spells, or irritability. Note the timing of these symptoms within the menstrual cycle. Note past medical history, including any chronic illnesses and family history of gynecologic concerns. Elicit a sexual behavior history, including the type of sexual activity (oral, anal, or vaginal), number and gender of sexual partners, frequency and most recent sexual contact, history of molestation or sexual abuse, and use of contraceptives (noting type) and/or condoms. Take a medication history, including prescription medications and contraceptives, and determine whether the girl uses anabolic steroids, tobacco, or marijuana, cocaine, or other illegal drugs. Physical Examination The physical assessment related to menstrual disorders includes inspection and observation, auscultation, and palpation. The bimanual pelvic examination and Papanicolaou (Pap) smear are usually indicated only for more severe menstrual disorders and are usually performed by the physician or nurse practitioner. Inspect the breasts and pubic hair distribution to determine Tanner stage. Observe the external genitalia for vaginal discharge, redness, or irritation. Note pallor or weight gain. Document presence and extent of clots in menstrual flow. Measure orthostatic blood pressure and orthostatic pulse; decreases with position change may occur in girls with anemia. Palpate the abdomen, noting distention or tenderness. Laboratory and Diagnostic TestsCommon laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of menstrual disorders include: Complete blood count: to determine presence of anemia with menorrhagia (excess menstrual flow) or metrorrhagia Human chorionic gonadotropin: to assess for pregnancy with amenorrhea (absence of menses) Nursing Management Nursing goals for the girl with a menstrual disorder focus on normalizing menstrual flow and restoring blood volume, providing comfort, and encouraging independence in self-care. Normalizing Menstrual Flow and Restoring Blood Volume For the girl with mild anemia related to menorrhagia, administer iron supplements as ordered. For moderate menorrhagia, oral contraceptives may also be prescribed, since altering hormone levels decreases menstrual flow. If the contraceptive contains a high dose of estrogen, the girl may experience nausea. Administer antiemetics as ordered and encourage the girl to eat small, frequent meals to alleviate nausea. Adolescents with severe anemia may require hospitalization and blood transfusion. Providing Comfort Provide a heating pad or warm compress to help alleviate menstrual cramps. Administer NSAIDs such as ibuprofen or naproxen to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, which contributes to menstrual cramps. Advise girls that beginning NSAID therapy at the first sign of menstrual discomfort is the best way to minimize discomfort. If NSAIDs are unsuccessful, oral contraceptives may be ordered; teach the girl appropriate use of oral contraceptives. The adolescent experiencing premenstrual syndrome should keep a diary of her symptoms, their severity, and when they occur in the menstrual cycle. Like all adolescents, girls with premenstrual syndrome should eat a balanced diet that includes nutrient-rich foods so they can avoid hypoglycemia and associated mood swings. Encourage adolescent girls to participate in aerobic exercise three times a week to promote a sense of well-being, decrease fatigue, and reduce stress. Administer calcium (1,200 to 1,600 mg per day), magnesium (400 to 800 mg per day), and vitamin B6 (50 to 100 mg per day) as prescribed. In some studies, these nutrients have been shown to decrease the intensity of premenstrual symptoms (Moreno & Giesel, 2009). NSAIDs may be useful for painful physical symptoms, and spironolactone (Aldactone) may help reduce bloating and water retention. Herbs such as chasteberry or ginkgo may be recommended. Take Note! Adolescents who experience more extensive emotional symptoms with premenstrual syndrome should be evaluated for premenstrual dysphoric disorder, as they may require antidepressant therapy (Htay & Aung, 2009). Encouraging Independence in Self-Care Establishing a trusting relationship with the adolescent may make education about self-care more successful. Some girls have open relationships with their mothers and can discuss issues related to menses and sexuality with them, but many others cannot discuss such \"embarrassing\" issues with their mothers, and the nurse or other health care provider may be the only source of reliable information. Provide the adolescent with accurate information about menstruation and sexuality. Educate her about normal menstruation, the menstrual cycle, and the risk for pregnancy if sexual intercourse occurs. Refer the teen for contraception if sexually active. Refer girls to reliable websites if they are not comfortable with receiving information from the nurse. Links to several websites are available on . Encourage the girl to call or visit the office if she has additional questions. Male Disorders Male reproductive disorders include structural disorders and disorders caused by infection or inflammation. Circumcision will also be discussed below. Phimosis and Paraphimosis In phimosis, the foreskin of the penis cannot be retracted. Although this is normal in the newborn, it can be pathologic later. Over time, the prepuce (foreskin) naturally becomes retractable. Local irritation, balanitis, or UTI may occur if urine is retained within the foreskin after voiding. Paraphimosis ( Fig. 21.13 ) is a serious disorder characterized by retraction of the phimotic prepuce, which causes a constricting band behind the glans of the penis and results in incarceration if left untreated.FIGURE 21.13 Paraphimosis: note the swollen prepuce. Copyrighted 2011. UBM Medica LLC. 82486:1111JM Topical steroid cream applied twice a day for 1 month may be prescribed for phimosis. Paraphimosis requires reduction of the prepuce or a small dorsal incision to release the foreskin. Circumcision may be used to treat either condition. Nursing Assessment Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Irritation or bleeding from the opening of the prepuce (phimosis) Dysuria (phimosis) Pain (paraphimosis) Swollen penis (paraphimosis) Determine the onset of symptoms and inspect the penis for irritation, erythema, edema, or discharge. Take Note! A swollen, reddened penis (paraphimosis) is a medical emergency and can quickly result in necrosis of the tip of the penis if left untreated. Nursing Management Apply topical steroid medication as prescribed for phimosis, following gentle retraction to stretch the foreskin back. Topical vitamin E cream may also help to soften the phimotic ring. When surgical intervention is necessary, provide routine postprocedural care and pain management (refer to the section on circumcision below). Teach the parents and uncircumcised boy proper hygiene, which will help to prevent phimosis and paraphimosis ( Teaching Guidelines 21.3 ). Teaching Guidelines 21.3 HYGIENE IN THE UNCIRCUMCISED MALE The foreskin does not normally retract in the newborn boy, so do not force it to do so. Change the diaper frequently and wash the penis daily with water and mild soap. When the infant is older and the foreskin easily retracts, gently retract the foreskin and clean around the glans with water and mild soap once a week. Dry the area prior to replacing the foreskin. Always replace the foreskin after retraction. Teach the preschool-age boy to retract the foreskin and clean the penis during each bath or shower. Circumcision Circumcision is the removal of the excess foreskin of the penis. Some newborn boys are circumcised shortly after birth before going home from the hospital. Some parents elect not to have their newborn boy circumcised at that time but may desire it later. Neonatal circumcision may be performed in the newborn nursery, hospital unit treatment room, or outpatient office. Circumcision is indicated later for the conditions of phimosis and paraphimosis. Circumcision done after the newborn period usually requires general anesthesia. The benefits of circumcision include a decreased incidence of UTI, sexually transmitted diseases, AIDS, and penile cancer, and in female partners a decreased occurrence of cervical cancer. Complications of circumcision include alterations in the urinary meatus, unintentional removal of excessive amounts of foreskin, or damage to the glans penis (American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP], 2005). Whether to circumcise or not is a personal decision and often based on religious beliefs or social or cultural customs. Nurses should support and educate the parents in either case. Nursing Assessment Prior to the procedure, assess for normal placement of the urinary meatus on the glans penis (in boys with hypospadias, circumcision should be delayed until evaluation by the pediatric urologist). After the circumcision, assess for redness, edema, or active bleeding. Note signs of infection, such as purulent drainage. Assess pain level. Nursing Management Nursing care of the boy undergoing circumcision focuses on managing pain, providing postprocedural care, and educating the parents. Managing Pain Whether circumcision is performed in the obstetric area of the hospital before newborn discharge or in the outpatient setting at a few days of age, pain management during the procedure must not be neglected. Advocate for appropriate pain management for the infant undergoing circumcision. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends using a subcutaneous ring block with lidocaine or a dorsal nerve block to the penis. The AAP also recommends the use of EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetic) cream topically to decrease pain during the circumcision (2005). Playing calming music during the procedure may also help to soothe the infant, providing distraction. A sucrose-dipped pacifier may also be used as adjuvant therapy for pain management. To increase a sense of comfort during the procedure, restrain the infant in a padded circumcision chair with blankets covering the legs and upper body (Kraft, 2003). This allows the infant to be in a semi-upright position during the procedure while still allowing for a sterile procedural field. If a padded restraint chair is not available, provide atraumatic care by padding the circumcision board and covering the infant as previously described. Providing Postprocedural Care Usual care after circumcision depends on the type of appliance used (Gomco or Mogen clamp or Plastibell apparatus). Cleanse the penis with clear water for the first few days and avoid using alcohol-containing wipes. To avoid irritation to the penis, fasten diapers loosely. Notify the physician or nurse practitioner if excessive redness, active bleeding, or purulent discharge occurs. Assess for the first void following the procedure, or if performed in the outpatient setting instruct parents to call the physician or nurse practitioner if the infant has not voided by 6 to 8 hours after the circumcision. Apply antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly to the penile head with each diaper change as prescribed, based on the circumcision method used and the preference of the physician or nurse practitioner. Take Note! If excess bleeding occurs after the circumcision, apply direct pressure and notify the physician or nurse practitioner immediately. Educating the Parents Instruct parents to give sponge baths until the circumcision is healed. Describe the normal granulation tissue that will be present during the healing process. Teach parents to apply ointment or petroleum jelly if indicated. Instruct the parents to call the physician or nursepractitioner if any of the following occur: The infant does not urinate within 6 to 8 hours after the procedure. Heavy bleeding occurs (more than small spots on the diaper or bleeding that requires direct pressure to stop it). There is purulent or serous drainage from the circumcised area. There is redness or swelling of the penile shaft. Take Note! If the Plastibell is used, teach parents NOT to use petroleum jelly, as it may cause the ring to be dislodged. A yellowish crust may form that should be allowed to fall off on its own after several days. Cryptorchidism Cryptorchidism (also known as undescended testicles) occurs when one or both testicles do not descend into the scrotal sac. Ordinarily the testes, which in the fetus develop in the abdomen, make their descent into the scrotal sac during the seventh month of gestation. The cause for this failure to descend may be mechanical, hormonal, chromosomal, or enzymatic. The disorder may occur unilaterally or bilaterally. Up to 3% of term male infants exhibit cryptorchidism (Ashley, Barthold, & Kolon, 2010). Complications associated with cryptorchidism that is allowed to progress into the school-age years include sterility and an increased risk for testicular cancer in adolescence or the young adult years. Therapeutic management is surgical. An orchiopexy is performed to release the spermatic cord, and the testes are then pulled into the scrotum and tacked into place. Nursing Assessment Explore the health history for risk factors such as: Prematurity First-born child Cesarean birth Low birthweight Hypospadias Palpate for the presence (or absence) of both testes in the scrotal sac. Take Note! A retractile testis is one that may be brought into the scrotum, remains for a time, and then retracts back up the inguinal canal. This should not be confused with true cryptorchidism. Nursing Management If the testes are not descended by 6 months of age, the infant should be referred for surgical repair (Ashley et al., 2010). Postoperatively, observe the incision for signs of bleeding or infection. Hydrocele and Varicocele Hydrocele (fluid in the scrotal sac) is usually a benign and self-limiting disorder. It is usually noted early in infancy and often resolves spontaneously by 1 year of age. Varicocele (a venous varicosity along the spermatic cord) is often noted as a swelling of the scrotal sac. Complications of varicocele include low sperm count or reduced sperm motility, which can result in infertility. Nursing Assessment Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. The boy with hydrocele will have an enlarged scrotum that may decrease in size when he is lying down. Inspect the scrotum for a fluid-filled appearance. The boy with varicocele will have a mass on one or both sides of the scrotum and bluish discoloration. Inspect the scrotum for masses; the spermatic vein feels worm-like on palpation. The boy with varicocele may have pain. Nursing ManagementBoth hydrocele and painless varicocele require watchful waiting, as these conditions will usually resolve spontaneously. If they do not resolve, or if the difference in testicular volume is marked in the boy with varicocele, refer the child to a urologist, as surgery may be indicated. Reassure parents that hydrocele is not associated with the development of infertility. Varicocele may lead to infertility if left untreated, so instruct parents to seek care if pain occurs or if there is a large difference in testicular size. Either condition may be surgically corrected on an outpatient basis. Provide routine postoperative care following either surgery. Testicular Torsion In testicular torsion, a testicle is abnormally attached to the scrotum and twisted. It requires immediate attention because ischemia can result if the torsion is left untreated, leading to infertility. Testicular torsion may occur at any age but most commonly occurs in boys aged 12 to 18 years (Dufour, 2008). Nursing Assessment Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Signs and symptoms of testicular torsion include sudden, severe scrotal pain. Inspect the affected side for significant swelling, which may appear hemorrhagic or blue-black. Nursing Management Surgical correction is necessary immediately. Administer pain medication prior to surgery. Reassure the child and family that surgery will alleviate the problem and is performed to restore adequate blood flow to the testicle. After surgical repair, provide routine postoperative care. Take Note! Testicular torsion is considered a surgical emergency, as necrosis of the testis may occur and gangrene may set in. Epididymitis Epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis) is caused by infection with bacteria. It is the most common cause of pain in the scrotum. It rarely occurs before puberty, but if it does it may occur as a result of a urethral or bladder infection related to a urogenital anomaly. Therapeutic management is directed toward eradicating the bacteria. If left untreated, a scrotal abscess, testicular infarction, or infertility may occur. Nursing Assessment Note history of painful swelling of the scrotum, which may be gradual or acute. If the boy is sexually active, explore history of sexual encounters prior to the onset of symptoms. Document history of dysuria or urethral discharge. Note fever, which may last from days to weeks. On inspection, note edema and erythema of the scrotum. Gently palpate the scrotum for a hardened and tender epididymis. Note urethral discharge if present. Palpate the inguinal lymph nodes for enlargement. Urinalysis may be positive for bacteria and white blood cells. The culture of urethral discharge may be positive for a sexually transmitted infection such as gonorrhea or Chlamydia . The complete blood count may reveal an elevated white blood cell count. Nursing Management Encourage the boy to rest in bed with the scrotum elevated. Ice packs to the scrotum may help with pain relief. Administer pain medications such as NSAIDs or other analgesics as needed. Administer antibiotics as prescribed. Educate the boy and his family to complete the entire course of antibiotics as prescribed to eradicate the infection. Advise the child and family to notify the physician or nurse practitioner if the condition is not improving or if the pain and swelling worsen. KEY CONCEPTS Though present at birth, the reproductive organs do not reach functional maturity until puberty. The short length of the urethra in girls and its proximity to the vagina and anus place the young girl at higher risk for the development of urinary tract infections compared with the adult. The urinary tract is immature in infants and young children, with a slower glomerular filtration rate and a decreased ability toconcentrate urine and reabsorb amino acids compared with the adult. The expected urine output in the infant and child is 0.5 to 2 mL/kg/hour. Obtaining a clean or sterile urine specimen is necessary for accurate urine culture results. A urinary catheter must be inserted just prior to the voiding cystourethrogram. Close monitoring of serum blood counts and electrolytes is a critical component of nursing care related to renal disorders. Certain congenital urologic anomalies may require multiple surgeries as well as urinary diversion; urine drains through a stoma on the abdominal wall that is either pouched or catheterized. The treatment for nocturnal enuresis may include the use of desmopressin nasal spray and/or an enuresis alarm to train the child to awaken to the sensation of a filling bladder. Nephrotic syndrome results in significant proteinuria and edema. Acute glomerulonephritis most often follows a group A streptococcal infection and commonly results in hematuria, proteinuria, and hypertension. The most common cause of hemolytic-uremic syndrome is infection with E. coli O157:H7. It can be prevented by adequately cooking ground meat, washing hands and produce well, and making sure that an appropriate chemical balance is maintained in public recreational water sources such as swimming pools and water parks. Corticosteroids can cause gastrointestinal upset. If used on a long-term basis, they should be tapered rather than discontinued abruptly to avoid adrenal crisis. In children, chronic kidney disease is most often the result of congenital structural defects, or infectious, inflammatory, or immune processes that damage the kidney, whereas in adults it usually results from hypertension or diabetes. Children taking immunosuppressants for nephrotic syndrome or for renal transplant are at increased risk for the development of overwhelming infection. Peritoneal dialysis may be accomplished at home by the parent. Close attention to sterile technique is needed. Hemodialysis requires an arteriovenous fistula or graft that is accessed with needles three or four times per week at a hemodialysis center. This is disruptive to the child's academic, social, and family lives. Renal transplantation is the best option for the treatment of end-stage renal disease in children, but vigilant medication administration is needed to prevent organ rejection. Children with renal failure experience anemia, poor growth, depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. The diet for a child with a renal disorder must be individualized according to prescribed sodium, fluid, and/or protein restrictions. Postoperative care for the child undergoing urologic surgery includes pain management, avoidance or treatment of bladder spasms, and monitoring of urine output.

In the clinical setting, compare the growth and development of two children the same age, one with chronic renal failure and one who has been healthy. 2. While caring for children in the clinical setting, compare and contrast the medical history, signs and symptoms of illness, and prescribed treatments for a child with nephrotic syndrome and one with acute glomerulonephritis. 3. Observe peritoneal dialysis in the hospital or hemodialysis in a hospital or outpatient center. Record observations about the children's psychosocial and developmental status.22 Nursing Care of the Child With a Neuromuscular Disorder Words of Wisdom Enhancing a child's abilities may enhance his or her strength to overcome anything. KEY completion of the chapter, you will be able to: 1. Compare differences between the anatomy and physiology of the neuromuscular system in children versus adults. 2. Identify nursing interventions related to common laboratory and diagnostic tests used in the diagnosis and management of neuromuscular conditions. 3. Identify appropriate nursing assessments and interventions related to medications and treatments used for childhood neuromuscular conditions. 4. Distinguish various neuromuscular illnesses occurring in childhood. 5. Devise an individualized nursing care plan for the child with a neuromuscular disorder. 6. Develop child/family teaching plans for the child with a neuromuscular disorder. 7. Describe the psychosocial impact of chronic neuromuscular disorders on the growth and development of children. Frederick Stevens, 4 years old, seems to be falling often and has started to have difficulty climbing the stairs on his own. His mother states, \"Recently he hasn't been able to keep up with his 6-year-old sister when we're playing at the park. He usually ends up sitting on the bench with me.\" She is concerned about the changes she has seen in her son.A variety of neuromuscular disorders may affect children, but the result of each is muscular dysfunction. Some of the disorders result from a neurologic insult such as trauma or hypoxia to the brain or spinal cord. Others occur as a result of genetic dysfunction or structural abnormality. Still others may be autoimmune in nature, often following a simple viral infection. Many neuromuscular disorders are chronic, lasting the child's entire life and resulting in handicaps. The nurse caring for a child with neuromuscular dysfunction plays an important role in the management of these disorders. Not only must the nurse provide direct intervention in response to health alterations that result, but also the nurse is often part of the larger multidisciplinary team and may serve as the coordinator of many specialists or interventions. Understanding the most common responses to these disorders gives the nurse the foundation required to plan care for any child with any neuromuscular disorder.VARIATIONS IN PEDIATRIC ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY The neuromuscular system is the combination of the nervous system and the muscles working together to create movement. Anatomic and physiologic differences in infants and children, such as the immaturity of the neurologic and musculoskeletal systems, place them at increased risk for the development of a neuromuscular disorder. Brain and Spinal Cord Development Early in gestation, around 3 to 4 weeks, the neural tube of the embryo begins to differentiate into the brain and spinal cord. If the fetus suffers infection, trauma, malnutrition, or teratogen exposure during this critical period of growth and differentiation, brain or spinal cord development may be altered. The premature infant's central nervous system is less mature than the term newborn's. Such immaturity in the preterm infant places him or her at a higher risk of central nervous insult within the neonatal period, which may result in delayed motor skill attainment or cerebral palsy. Compared with the adult, the child's spine is very mobile, especially the cervical spine region, resulting in a higher risk for cervical spine injury. Myelinization Though development of the structures of the nervous system is complete at birth, myelinization is incomplete. Myelinization continues to progress and is complete by about 2 years of age. Myelinization proceeds in a cephalocaudal and proximodistal fashion, allowing the infant to gain head and neck control before becoming able to control the trunk and the extremities. As myelinization proceeds, the speed and accuracy of nerve impulses increase. Muscular Development The muscular system, including tendons, ligaments, and cartilage, arises from the mesoderm in early embryonic development. At birth (term or preterm), the muscles, tendons, ligaments, and cartilage are all present and functional. The newborn infant is capable of spontaneous movement but lacks purposeful control. Full range of motion is present at birth. Healthy infants and children demonstrate normal muscle tone; hypertonia (increased muscle tone) or hypotonia (low muscle tone) is an abnormal finding. Deep tendon reflexes are present at birth and are initially brisk in the newborn and progress to average over the first few months. Sluggish deep tendon reflexes indicate an abnormality. As the infant matures and becomes mobile, the muscles develop further and become stronger. The adolescent boy, in response to testosterone release, experiences a growth spurt, particularly in the trunk and legs, and develops bulkier muscles at that time.COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS A variety of medications as well as other medical treatments are used to treat neuromuscular disorders in children. Most of these treatments will require a physician's or nurse practitioner's order when the child is in the hospital. The most common treatments and medications are listed in Common Medical Treatments 22.1 and Drug Guide 22.1 . The nurse caring for the child with a neuromuscular disorder should become familiar with what these procedures are and how they work as well as common nursing implications related to use of these modalities. NURSING PROCESS OVERVIEW FOR THE CHILD WITH A NEUROMUSCULAR DISORDER Care of the child with a neuromuscular disorder includes assessment, nursing diagnosis, planning, interventions, and evaluation. There are a number of general concepts related to the nursing process that may be applied to neuromuscular dysfunction in children. From a general understanding of the care involved for a child with a neuromuscular disorder, the nurse can then individualize the care based on specifics particular for that child. Assessment Assessment of neuromuscular dysfunction in children includes health history, physical examination, and laboratory and diagnostic testing. Remember Frederick, the 4-year-old who has been falling and having difficulty climbing stairs and who seems to tire easily when playing with his sister? What additional health history and physical examination assessment information should the nurse obtain? Health History The health history consists of the past medical history, including the mother's pregnancy history; family history; and history of present illness (when the symptoms started and how they have progressed), as well as treatments used at home. The past medical history might be significant for prematurity, difficult birth, infection during pregnancy, changes in gait, falls, delayed development, or poor growth. Family history might be significant for neuromuscular disorders that are genetic. When eliciting the history of the present illness, inquire about the following: Changes in gait Recent trauma Poor feeding Lethargy Fever Weakness Alteration in muscle tone Determine the child's history of attainment of developmental milestones. Note the age that milestones such as sitting, crawling, and walking were attained, and determine whether the pace of attainment of milestones has decreased. Some children may progress normally at first and then demonstrate decreased velocity of development of achievements or even loss of abilities. Obtain a clear description of weakness; is it fatigue, or is the child truly not as strong as he or she was in the past? Physical Examination Physical examination of the nervous and musculoskeletal systems consists of inspection, observation, and palpation. It should also include auscultation of the heart and lungs, as the function of these organs may be affected by certain neuromuscular conditions. INSPECTION AND OBSERVATION Observe the infant or child playing with toys, crawling, or walking to obtain significant information about cranial nerve, cerebellar, and motor function. Observe the child's general appearance, noting any asymmetry in muscle development. When extremities are not used, muscular atrophy develops, so a shortened limb may indicate chronic hemiparesis. Note symmetry of spontaneous movement of extremities as well as facial muscles. Determine cranial nerve function (refer back to Chapter 16 for a complete description of assessment of cranial nerves). Inspect the spine for cutaneous abnormalities such as dimples or hair tufts, which may be associated with spinal cord abnormalities. Observe the child's level of consciousness (LOC), noting a decrease or significant changes. Note the presence of lethargy. Refer to Chapter 16 for a complete description of evaluation of LOC. Motor Function. Observe spontaneous activity, posture, and balance, and assess for asymmetric movements. In the infant, observe resting posture, which will normally be a slightly flexed posture. The infant should be able to extend extremities to a normal stretch. Note position of comfort of the infant's or child's neck. Reflexes. Note sluggish or brisk deep tendon reflexes. Note persistence of primitive reflexes in the older infant or child, such as Moro or tonic neck. Assess for development of protective reflexes, which is often delayed in infants with motor disorders. Sensory Function. Alterations in sensory function accompany many neuromuscular disorders. Assess sensory function in a similar fashion to that used in the adult. The sensory functions of light touch, pain, vibration, heat, and cold are distinguishable by a child. In the infant, assess for response to light touch or pain. The usual response to pain will be withdrawal from the stimulus. Always prepare the child for the sensory examination in order to gain cooperation. The pinprick test may be particularly frightening, but most children will cooperate if educated appropriately. PALPATION Assess muscle strength and tone in the infant or child. Compare strength and tone bilaterally. Evaluate neck tone by pulling the infant from a supine position to a sitting position ( Fig. 22.1 ). By 4 to 5 months the infant should be able to maintain the head in a neutral position. Perform passive range of motion of the neck. Alterations in range of motion may indicate a neuromuscular disorder or torticollis. Note trunk tone in the infant by holding the infant under the axillae and palpating for trunk tone. The hypotonic infant will feel as though he or she is slipping through the examiner's hands. Generalized hypotonia is a common sign ofneuromuscular disease in the infant and young child (Sarant, 2007). The hypertonic infant will feel rigid, extending the trunk and legs. Assess leg tone in the infant by placing the infant in the vertical position with the feet on a flat surface; the 4-month-old infant should be able to momentarily support his or her weight ( Fig. 22.2 ). Assess the strength of the infant or young child by noting ability to move the muscles against gravity. In older children, have the child push against the examiner's hand with the sole of the foot to determine muscle strength ( Fig. 22.3 ). Note any hypertonia or spasticity , which is involuntary muscle contractions that are not coordinated with other muscles (e.g., when you stretch out your forearm the triceps contract and the biceps stretch; in spasticity they both contract at the same time). These may be an early indication of cerebral palsy or another neuromuscular disorder. Take Note! In cases of trauma or suspected trauma, do not perform any assessment that involves movement of the head and neck until cervical injury is ruled out. Maintain complete immobilization of the cervical spine until that time. AUSCULTATION Auscultate the child's lungs; adventitious sounds are often present when respiratory muscle function is impaired. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 22.1 offers an explanation of the laboratory and diagnostic tests most commonly used in neuromuscular disorders. The tests can assist the physician or nurse practitioner in diagnosing the disorder and/or be used as guidelines in determining ongoing treatment. Laboratory or nonnursing personnel perform some of the tests, while the nurse might perform others. In either instance the nurse should be familiar with how the tests are performed, what they are used for, and normal versus abnormal results. This knowledge will also be necessary when providing child and family education related to the testing. Nursing Diagnoses, Goals, Interventions, and Evaluations Upon completion of a thorough assessment, the nurse might identify several nursing diagnoses, including: Impaired physical mobility Imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements Urinary retention Constipation Self-care deficit (specify) Risk for impaired skin integrity Chronic sorrow Risk for injury Deficient knowledge (specify) Family processes, interrupted After completing an assessment of Fredrick, the nurse noted the following: he started walking at 2 years of age, he has difficulty jumping, his gait has a waddling appearance, and he does not rise from the floor in the usual fashion. Based on these assessment findings, what would your top three nursing diagnoses be for Fredrick? Nursing goals, interventions, and evaluation for the child with neuromuscular dysfunction are based on the nursing diagnoses (see Nursing Care Plan 22.1 ). The nursing care plan may be used as a guide in planning nursing care for the child with a neuromuscular disorder. The care plan includes many nursing diagnoses that are applicable to the child or adolescent. Children's responses to neuromuscular dysfunction and its treatment will vary, and nursing care should be individualized based on the child's and family's responses to illness; see Healthy People 2020. Additional information about nursing management will be included later in the chapter as it relates to specific disorders. Based on your top three nursing diagnoses for Fredrick, describe appropriate nursing interventions.

FIGURE 22.3 Assessing leg strength of the child. COMMON LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS 22.1HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . NURSING CARE PLAN 22.1 Overview for the Child With a Neuromuscular Disorder NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Impaired physical mobility related to muscle weakness, hypertonicity, impaired coordination, loss of muscle function or control as evidenced by an inability to move extremities, to ambulate without assistance, to move without limitations Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will be able to engage in activities within age parameters and limits of disease: child is able to move extremities, move about environment, and participate in exercise programs within limits of age and disease. Interventions: Maximizing Physical Mobility Encourage gross and fine motor activities to facilitate motor development. Collaborate with physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy to strengthen muscles and promote optimal mobility to facilitate motor development. Use passive and active range-of-motion (ROM) exercises and teach child and family how to perform them to prevent contractures, facilitate joint mobility and muscle development (active ROM), and help increase mobility. Praise accomplishments and emphasize child's abilities to improve self-esteem and encourage feeling of confidence and competence. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Nutrition, imbalanced, less than body requirements, related to difficulty feeding secondary to deficient sucking, swallowing, or chewing; difficulty assuming normal feeding position; inability to feed self as evidenced by decreased oral intake, impaired swallowing, weight loss, or plateau Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will exhibit signs of adequate nutrition as evidenced by appropriate weight gain, intake and output within normal limits, and adequate ingestion of calories. Intervention: Promoting Adequate Nutrition Monitor height and weight: insufficient intake will lead to impaired growth and weight gain. Monitor hydration status (moist mucous membranes, elastic skin turgor, adequate urine output): insufficient intake can lead to dehydration. Use techniques to promote caloric and nutritional intake and teach family about these techniques (e.g., positioning, modified utensils, soft or blended foods, allowing extra time) to facilitate intake. Assess respiratory system frequently to assess for aspiration. Assist family to help child assume as normal a feeding position as possible to help increase oral intake. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Urinary retention related to sensory motor impairment as evidenced by dribbling, inadequate bladder emptying Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child's bladder will empty adequately, according to preestablished quantities and frequencies individualized for the child (usual urine output is 0.5 to 2 mL/kg/hour). Intervention: Promoting Successful Bladder Emptying Assess child's ability to empty bladder via history focused on character and duration of lower urinary symptoms to establish baseline. Assess for history of fecal impaction or constipation, as alterations in bowel elimination may hinder urinary elimination. Assess for bladder distention by palpation or urinary retention by postvoid residual obtained via catheterization or bladder ultrasound to determine extent of retention. Maintain adequate hydration to avoid irritating effects that dehydration has on the bladder. Schedule voiding to decrease bladder overdistention. Teach the family (and the child if old enough) with significant urinary retention the technique of clean intermittent catheterization to allow regular, complete bladder emptying. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for constipation related to immobility, loss of sensation Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will demonstrate adequate stool passage: will pass soft, formed stool every 1 to 3 days without straining or other adverse effects. Intervention: Promoting Appropriate Bowel Elimination Assess usual pattern of stooling to determine baseline and identify potential problems with elimination. Palpate for abdominal fullness and auscultate for bowel sounds to assess for bowel function and presence of constipation. Encourage fiber intake to increase frequency of stools. Ensure adequate fluid intake to prevent formation of hard, dry stools. Encourage activity within child's limits or restrictions: even minimal activity increases peristalsis. Administer medications or enemas as ordered to promote bowel training/evacuation (especially in child with myelomeningocele or spinal cord injury). NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Self-care deficit related to neuromuscular impairments, cognitive deficits as evidenced by an inability to perform hygiene care and transfer self independently Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will demonstrate ability to care for self within age parameters and limits of disease: child is able to feed, dress, and manage elimination within limits of disease and age. Intervention: Maximizing Self-Care Introduce child and family to self-help methods as soon as possible to promote independence from the beginning. Encourage family and staff to allow child to do as much as possible to allow child to gain confidence and independence. Teach specific measures for bowel and urinary elimination as needed to promote independence and increase self-care abilities and self-esteem. Collaborate with physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy to provide child and family with appropriate tools to modify environment and methods to promote transferring and self-care to allow for maximum functioning. Praise accomplishments and emphasize child's abilities to improve self-esteem and encourage feelings of confidence and competence. Balance activity with periods of rest to reduce fatigue and increase energy for self-care. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for impaired skin integrity related to immobility, use of braces or adaptive devices Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child's skin will remain intact, without evidence of redness or breakdown. Intervention: Promoting Skin Integrity Monitor condition of entire skin surface at least daily to provide baseline and allow for early identification of areas at risk. Avoid excessive friction or harsh cleaning products that may increase risk of breakdown in child with susceptible skin. Keep child's skin free from stool and urine to decrease risk of breakdown. Change child's position frequently to decrease pressure to susceptible areas. Monitor skin condition affected by braces or adaptive equipment frequently to prevent skin breakdown related to poor fit. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Chronic sorrow related to presence of chronic disability as evidenced by child's or family's expression of sadness, anger, disappointment, or feeling overwhelmed Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child and/or family will accept situation: child/family will appropriately identify feelings, function at a normal developmental level, and plan for the future. Intervention: Easing Sorrow Assess degree of sorrow to provide baseline for intervention. Identify problems with eating or sleeping, often affected when grief or sorrow is present. Spend time with the child and family: an empathetic presence is valued by suffering families. Encourage the use of positive coping techniques: taking action, expressing feelings, and intentional attempts at coping are helpful techniques. Refer to appropriate support groups: can be helpful to talk to others in similar situations. Refer for spiritual counseling as desired: many families experience grief resolution in a more timely fashion if spiritual needs are addressed. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for injury related to muscle weakness Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will remain free from injury: child will not fall or experience other injury. Intervention: Preventing Injury Ensure that side rails of bed are elevated when caregiver is not directly at bedside to prevent fall from bed. Use appropriate safety restraints with adaptive equipment and wheelchairs to prevent fall or slipping from equipment. Do not leave child unattended in tub as weakness may cause the child to slip under the water. Avoid restraint use if at all possible: close observation is more appropriate. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Deficient knowledge related to lack of information regarding complex medical condition, prognosis, and medical needs as evidenced by verbalization, questions, or actions demonstrating lack of understanding regarding child's condition or care Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child and family will verbalize accurate information and understanding about condition, prognosis, and medical needs: child and family demonstrate knowledge of condition and prognosis and medical needs, including possible causes, contributing factors, and treatment measures. Intervention: Providing Child and Family Teaching Assess child's and family's willingness to learn: child and family must be willing to learn for teaching to be effective. Provide family with time to adjust to diagnosis to facilitate adjustment and ability to learn and participate in child's care. Repeat information to allow family and child time to learn and understand. Teach in short sessions: many short sessions are more helpful than one long session. Gear teaching to the level of understanding of the child and family (depends on age of child, physical condition, memory) to ensure understanding. Provide reinforcement and rewards to facilitate the teaching/learning process. Use multiple modes of learning involving many senses (provide written, verbal, demonstration, and videos) when possible: child and family are more likely to retain information when it is presented in different ways using many senses. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Family processes, interrupted, related to child's illness, hospitalization, diagnosis of chronic illness in child, and potential long-term effects of illness as evidenced by family's presence in hospital, missed work, demonstration of inadequate coping Outcome Identification and Evaluation Family will maintain functional system of support and demonstrate adequate coping and adaptation of roles: parents are involved in child's care, ask appropriate questions, express fears and concerns, and are able to discuss child's care and condition calmly. Intervention: Promoting Appropriate Family Functioning Encourage parents and family to verbalize concerns related to child's illness, diagnosis, and prognosis: allows the nurse to identify concerns and areas where further education may be needed; demonstrates family-centered care. Explain therapies, procedures, child's behaviors, and plan of care to parents: understanding of the child's current status and plan of care helps decrease anxiety. Encourage parental involvement in care to allow parents to feel needed and valued and to have a sense of control over their child's health. Identify support system for family and child: support system is often needed by stressed families to assist with coping. Educate family and child on additional resources available to help them develop a wide base of support.CONGENITAL NEUROMUSCULAR DISORDERS Several disorders with neuromuscular effects are congenital in nature. These include neural tube defects and genetic neuromuscular disorders. The structural disorders are spina bifida occulta, meningocele, and myelomeningocele (neural tube defects). The genetic neuromuscular disorders include the various types of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These disorders are not always recognized at birth because signs and symptoms are not evident until months or even years after birth. However, they are still considered to be congenital as they have a genetic basis. Neural Tube Defects Neural tube defects account for the majority of congenital anomalies of the central nervous system. The neural tube closes between the third and fourth week of gestation. The cause of neural tube defects is not known, but many factors, such as drugs, malnutrition, chemicals, and genetics, can hinder normal central nervous system development. Strong evidence exists that maternal preconception supplementation of folic acid can decrease the incidence of neural tube defects in pregnancies at risk by 50% to 70% (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011; Kinsman & Johnston, 2007). Beginning in 1992 and continuing until today, the U.S. Public Health Service along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all women of childbearing age who are capable of becoming pregnant take 0.4 mg (400 mcg) of folic acid daily (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011). Pregnant women who had a previous child with a neural tube defect are recommended to take a higher dosage and should consult with their physician or nurse practitioner (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011). Prenatal screening of maternal serum for -fetoprotein (AFP) and ultrasound examination at 16 to 18 weeks' gestation can help identify fetuses at risk. Neural tube defects primarily affecting spinal cord development include spina bifida occulta, meningocele, and myelomeningocele ( Fig. 22.4 ). Neural tube defects primarily affecting brain development are discussed in Chapter 16 . Spina Bifida Occulta Spina bifida is a term that is often used to refer to all neural tube disorders that affect the spinal cord. This can be confusing and a cause of concern for parents. There are well-defined degrees of spinal cord involvement, and it is important for health care professionals to use the correct terminology. Spina bifida occulta is a defect of the vertebral bodies without protrusion of the spinal cord or meninges. This defect is not visible externally and in most cases has no adverse affects (see Fig. 22.4 ). Spina bifida occulta is a common anomaly. It is estimated that it affects 10% to 20% of otherwise healthy people (Spina Bifida Association, 2009a). Children with spina bifida occulta need no immediate medical intervention. Complications are rare, but may include more significant abnormalities of the spinal cord such as tethered cord, syringomyelia, or diastematomyelia. Nursing Assessment In most cases, spina bifida occulta is benign and asymptomatic and produces no neurologic signs. In fact, it may be considered a normal variant (Spina Bifida Association, 2009a). The defect, which is usually present in the lumbosacral area, often goes undetected. However, there may be noticeable dimpling, abnormal patches of hair, or discoloration of skin at the defect site. If so, further investigation, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be warranted.FIGURE 22.4 (A) Normal spine. (B) Spina bifida occulta. (C) Meningocele. (D) Myelomeningocele. Nursing Management Nursing care will focus on educating the family. Inform parents of its presence and what the diagnosis means. Many times parents will confuse this diagnosis with spina bifida cystica, a much more serious defect. Occasionally, children with spina bifida occulta eventually need surgical intervention due to degenerative changes or involvement of the spine and nerve roots resulting in complications such as tethered cord, syringomyelia, or diastematomyelia. When these associated problems occur, the condition is often termed \"occult spinal dysraphism\" to avoid confusion. Meningocele Meningocele, the less serious form of spina bifida cystica, occurs when the meninges herniate through a defect in the vertebrae. The spinal cord is usually normal and there are typically no associated neurologic deficits. Treatment for meningocele involves surgical correction of the lesion (see Fig. 22.4 ). Nursing Assessment Initial assessment after delivery will reveal a visible external sac protruding from the spinal area. It is most often seen in the lumbar region but can be anywhere along the spinal canal. Most are covered with skin and pose no threat to the child. However, assessment to ensure that the sac covering is intact remains important. Assess neurologic status carefully. Most children will be asymptomatic, with no neurologic deficits (Kinsman & Johnston, 2007; Liptak, 2008). Before surgical correction the infant will be thoroughly examined to determine whether there is any neural involvement or associated anomalies. Diagnostic procedures such as computed tomography (CT), MRI, and ultrasound may be performed. Nursing Management If the skin covering the sac is intact and the child has normal neurologic functioning, surgical correction may be delayed (Kinsman & Johnston, 2007). However, as in a child with myelomeningocele, immediately report any evidence of leaking cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to ensure prompt intervention to prevent infection. Nursing management will be supportive. Provide preoperative and postoperative care similar to the child with myelomeningocele to prevent rupture of the sac, to prevent infection, and to provide adequate nutrition and hydration. Monitor for symptoms of constipation or bladder dysfunction that may result due to increasing size of the lesion. Resulting hydrocephalus has been associated with some cases of meningocele (Kinsman & Johnston, 2007). Therefore, monitor head circumference and watch for signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Myelomeningocele Myelomeningocele, the most severe form of neural tube defect, occurs in approximately 1 in 4,000 live births (Kinsman & Johnston, 2007). Myelomeningocele is a type of spina bifida cystica, and clinically the term \"spina bifida\" is often used to refer to myelomeningocele. It may be diagnosed in utero via ultrasound. Otherwise it is visually obvious at birth. The newborn withmyelomeningocele is at increased risk for meningitis, hypoxia, and hemorrhage. In myelomeningocele, the spinal cord often ends at the point of the defect, resulting in absent motor and sensory function beyond that point (see Fig. 22.5 ). Therefore, the long-term complications of paralysis, orthopedic deformities, and bladder and bowel incontinence are often seen in children with myelomeningocele. The presence of neurogenic bladder and frequent catheterization puts the child at an increased risk for urinary tract infections, pyelonephritis, and hydronephrosis, which may result in long-term renal damage if managed inappropriately. Accompanying hydrocephalus associated with type II Chiari defect is seen in 80% of children with myelomeningocele (Kinsman & Johnston, 2007). Due to the improper development and the downward displacement of the brain into the cervical spine, CSF flow is blocked, resulting in hydrocephalus. The lower the deformity is on the spine, the lower the risk of developing hydrocephalus (Kinsman & Johnston, 2007). Children with myelomeningocele usually require multiple surgical procedures. In addition, due to frequent catheterizations, these children are at an increased risk of developing a latex allergy (Kinsman & Johnston, 2007; Zak & Chan, 2010). Learning problems and seizures are more common in these children than in the general population, but 70% of those surviving with myelomeningocele have normal intelligence (Kinsman & Johnston, 2007). Ambulation is possible for some children, depending on the level of the lesion. Due to advances in medical treatment the life expectancy of children with this disorder has increased. For children born with a myelomeningocele who receive aggressive treatment, the mortality rate is 10% to 15%; most deaths occur before the age of 4 years (Kinsman & Johnston, 2007). FIGURE 22.5 Usually a sac covers the deformity of myelomeningocele and is visible at birth. Pathophysiology The cause of myelomeningocele is unknown, but risk factors are consistent with other neural tube defects, such as maternal drug use, malnutrition, and a genetic predisposition (Kinsman & Johnston, 2007). In myelomeningocele, the neural tube fails to close at the end of the fourth week of gestation. As a result, an external sac-like protrusion that encases the meninges, spinal fluid, and in some cases nerves is present on the spine (see Fig. 22.4 ). A myelomeningocele can be located anywhere along the spinal cord, but 75% are located in the lumbosacral region (Kinsman & Johnston, 2007). The degree of neurologic deficit will depend on the location (Kinsman & Johnston, 2007). An increase in neurologic deficit is seen as the myelomeningocele extends into the thoracic region. Therapeutic Management Surgical closure will be performed as soon as possible after birth, especially if a CSF leak is present or if there is a danger of the sac rupturing. The goal of early surgical intervention is to prevent infection and to minimize further loss of function, which can result from the stretching of nerve roots as the meningeal sac expands after birth. A new option is becoming available but remains experimental. In utero fetal surgery to repair the myelomeningocele has been performed in the United States, with the first randomized trial showing improved outcomes for the fetuses compared to postnatal surgery (Robinson, 2011). Ongoing management of this disorder remains complex. A multidisciplinary approach is needed, involving specialists in neurology, neurosurgery, urology, orthopedics, therapy, and rehabilitation along with intense nursing care. The chronic nature of this disorder necessitates lifelong follow-up.Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 797 . Assessment findings pertinent to myelomeningocele are discussed below. Health History High-risk deliveries should be identified. Explore the pregnancy history and past medical history for risk factors such as: Lack of prenatal care Lack of preconception and/or prenatal folic acid supplementation Previous child born with neural tube defect or family history of neural tube defects Maternal consumption of certain drugs that antagonize folic acid, such as anticonvulsants (carbamazepine and phenobarbital) The older infant or child with a history of myelomeningocele requires numerous surgical procedures and lifelong follow-up. In an infant or child returning for a clinic visit or hospitalization, the health history should include questions related to: Current mobility status and any changes in motor abilities Genitourinary function and regimen Bowel function and regimen Signs or symptoms of urinary infections History of hydrocephalus with presence of shunt Signs or symptoms of shunt infection or malfunction (refer to section on hydrocephalus in Chapter 16 ) Latex sensitivity Nutritional status, including changes in weight Any other changes in physical or cognitive state Resources available and used by the family Physical Examination Initial assessment after delivery will reveal a visible external sac protruding from the spinal area ( Fig. 22.5 ). Observe the baby's general appearance and assess whether the sac covering is intact. Assess neurologic status and look for associated anomalies. Assess for movement of extremities and anal reflex, which will help determine the level of neurologic involvement. Flaccid paralysis, absence of deep tendon reflexes, lack of response to touch and pain stimuli, skeletal abnormalities such as club feet, constant dribbling of urine, and a relaxed anal sphincter may be found. In the older infant or child, perform a thorough physical examination and focus on the functional assessment. Note the level of paralysis or paresthesia. Inspect skin for breakdown. Determine the child's motor capabilities. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests A myelomeningocele may be detected prenatally around 16 to 18 weeks' gestation by ultrasound, by a blood test that detects AFP increases, or by analysis of amniotic fluid for AFP increases. Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of myelomeningocele include: MRI CT Ultrasound Myelography These diagnostic tests are used to evaluate brain and spinal cord involvement (refer to Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 22.1 ). Nursing Management Initial nursing management of the child with myelomeningocele involves preventing trauma to the meningeal sac and preventing infection before surgical repair of the defect. Refer to the Nursing Care Plan Overview in this chapter. Additional considerations are reviewed below. Preventing InfectionRisk for infection related to the presence of the meningeal sac and potential for rupture is a central nursing concern in the newborn with myelomeningocele. Until surgical intervention occurs, the goal is to prevent rupture or leakage of CSF from the sac. Keeping the sac from drying out is important, as is preventing trauma or pressure on the sac. Use sterile saline-soaked nonadhesive gauze or antibiotic-soaked gauze to keep the sac moist. Immediately report any seepage of clear fluid from the lesion, as this could indicate an opening in the sac and provide a portal of entry for microorganisms. Position the infant in the prone position or supported on the side to avoid pressure on the sac. To keep the infant warm, place the infant in a warmer or isolette to avoid the use of blankets, which could exert too much pressure on the sac. Pay special attention while the infant is in a warmer or isolette because the radiant heat can cause drying and cracking of the sac. Keep the lesion free of feces and urine to help avoid infection. Position the infant so that urine and feces flow away from the sac (e.g., prone position, or place a folded towel under the abdomen) to help prevent infection. Placing a piece of plastic wrap below the meningocele is another way of preventing feces from coming into contact with the lesion. After surgery, position the infant in the prone or side-lying position to allow the incision to heal. Continue with precautions to prevent urine or feces from coming into contact with the incision. Promoting Urinary Elimination Children with myelomeningocele often have bladder incontinence, though some children may achieve normal urinary continence. The level of the lesion will influence the amount of dysfunction. Myelomeningocele remains one of the most common causes of neurogenic bladder in children. Therefore, evaluation of renal function by a pediatric urologist should be performed on each child with myelomeningocele. Neurogenic bladder refers to the failure of the bladder to either store urine or empty itself of urine. Children with neurogenic bladder have loss of control over voiding. The spastic type of neurogenic bladder is hyperreflexive and yields frequent release of urine, but with incomplete emptying. The hypotonic neurogenic bladder is flaccid and weak and becomes stretched out; it can hold very large amounts of urine, resulting in continuous dribbling of urine from the urethra. Urinary stasis and retention occur in both types, placing the child at risk for urinary tract infection as well as reflux of bladder contents back up into the ureters and kidneys, resulting in renal scarring and insufficiency. The goals of neurogenic bladder management are to promote optimal urinary continence and prevent renal complications. Interventions for neurogenic bladder include clean intermittent catheterization to promote bladder emptying; medications such as oxybutynin chloride (Ditropan) to improve bladder capacity; prompt recognition and treatment of infections; and in some children surgical interventions such as a continent urinary reservoir or vesicostomy to facilitate urinary elimination. Clean intermittent catheterization is addressed below. In the child with a spastic or rigid bladder, teach parents how to administer antispasmodic medications such as oxybutynin. Teach the parents that the medication is used to increase the bladder capacity and reduce the potential for reflux. Refer to Chapter 21 for additional information on nursing care related to the surgical procedures. ASSESSING URINARY FUNCTION Determine the child's pattern and success of toilet training, both for bladder and bowel. Assess the child's cognitive/developmental level. Observe the genital area for dribbling of urine from the urethra, noting odor of urine if present. Note redness of the urethra or excoriation in the diaper area. Inspect the abdomen for scars from prior surgeries and the presence of urinary diversion or continent stoma. Palpate the abdomen for presence of distended bladder, fecal mass, or enlarged kidneys. Determine the child's level of paralysis or paresthesia. PERFORMING CLEAN INTERMITTENT CATHETERIZATION Depending on the level of paralysis at birth in the child with myelomeningocele, clean intermittent catheterization may be started at that time. In other children with spina bifida and in children who suffer spinal cord injury, catheterization may be started at a later age. Teach parents the technique of clean intermittent catheterization via the urethra, unless a urinary diversion or continent stoma has been created ( Teaching Guidelines 22.1 ). Teaching Guidelines 22.1 CLEAN INTERMITTENT CATHETERIZATION Wash hands with soap and water or use waterless antibacterial cleanser. Have supplies within reach and place child on his or her back, on toilet, or in wheelchair. Clean genitalia with a washcloth or disposable wipe (on girls separate labia and wipe front to back; on boys clean the tip of the penis; if uncircumcised, pull back foreskin so tip of penis is visible). Apply generous amount of water-based lubricant to catheter. Perform catheterization. Insert catheter only as far as needed to obtain urine flow (about 2 to 3 inches for females, about 4 to 6 inches for males). Hold catheter there until urine flow stops. Move catheter slightly, press on lower abdomen, or have child lean forward to tense abdominals to ensure no more urine is in the bladder. Wash reusable catheter after use with soapy water inside and out; rinse well (a syringe can be used to flush the catheter) and allow to dry. When dry, store in zip-top plastic bag or other clean storage container. Sterilize daily (time frames and procedure may vary based on institution policy and procedures); soak the catheter in a 1:1 vinegar and water solution for about 30 minutes, rinsing well before next use, or place the catheter in boiling water for 10 minutes. Allow to dry very well before storing. Replace the catheter when it becomes cloudy, stiff, rough, cracked, or damaged. Teach the child to self-catheterize when he or she is developmentally ready. Adapted from Bozic, D., & Daniels, C. (2009). AboutKidsHealth clean intermittent catheterization (CIC): Step by step instructions for boys. Retrieved June 28, 2011, from http://www.aboutkidshealth.ca/HealthAZ/Clean-Intermittent-Catheterization-CIC-Step-By-Step-Instructions-for-Boys.aspx? articleID=10379&categoryID= Teaching the parents the techniques of clean intermittent catheterization is an important step in preserving renal functioning, preventing infection, and helping the family gain some control over the child's physical condition. Until the child is able to self- catheterize, the parents will be responsible for this procedure. Children with normal intelligence and upper extremity motor skills usually learn to self-catheterize at the age of 6 or 7 years (Zak & Chan, 2010). Urinary incontinence is associated with poor self- esteem, particularly as the child gets older (Moore, Kogan, & Parekh, 2004). Educating the child to self-catheterize the urethra or stoma as appropriate empowers the child, gives him or her a sense of control, and allows for appropriate urinary elimination when the child is away from the parents (e.g., at school). See Evidence-Based Practice 22.1 . Offer support and appropriate referrals to the child and family. Refer families to vendors in the local area for catheterization supplies. Promoting Bowel Elimination Children with myelomeningocele often have bowel incontinence as well; the level of the lesion affects the amount of dysfunction. Many children with myelomeningocele can achieve some degree of bowel continence. Bowel training with the use of timed enemas or suppositories along with diet modifications can allow for defecation at predetermined times once or twice a day. Although bowel incontinence can be difficult for children as they grow older due to social concerns and self-esteem and body image disturbances, it does not pose the same health risks as urinary incontinence. Take Note! Use only latex-free catheters and gloves for catheterization of children with myelomeningocele and/or neurogenic bladder, as these children exhibit a high incidence of latex allergy (Zak & Chan, 2010). Promoting Adequate Nutrition The risk for altered nutrition, less than body requirements, related to the restrictions on positioning of the infant before and after surgery is another nursing concern. Assist the family in assuming as normal a feeding position as possible. Preoperatively, the risk of rupture may be too high to warrant holding. Therefore, the infant's head can be turned to the side or the infant can be placed in the side-lying position to facilitate feeding. If the infant is held, special care needs to be taken to avoid pressure on the sac or postoperative incision. Encourage the parents to interact as much as possible with the infant by talking to and touching the infant during feeding to help promote intake. If the mother was planning on breastfeeding the infant, assist her in meeting this goal, if possible. If the infant can be held, encourage her to do this, or assist her in pumping and saving breast milk to be given to the infant via bottle until the infant is able to be held. Feeding an infant in an unusual position can be difficult, and it is the nurse's role to provide support, education, and modeling for the parents and family when needed.Preventing Latex Allergic Reaction Sensitivity to latex or natural rubber is very common among children with myelomeningocele. They are at an increased risk of developing an allergy to latex related to the multiple exposures to latex products during surgical procedures and bladder catheterizations. Research has shown that up to 73% of children who require repeat surgeries due to spina bifida are sensitive to latex (Spina Bifida Association, 2009b). A latex-free environment should be created for all procedures performed on children with myelomeningocele to prevent latex allergy. Also, children with a known latex allergy must be identified and managed in a latex-free environment. The nurse must ensure that these children do not come into direct contact with latex or equipment and supplies that contain latex. Be familiar with those products and equipment at your facility that contain latex and those that are latex-free. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) now requires that all medical supplies be labeled if they contain latex (FDA Talk Paper, 1997), but this is not the case for consumer products. Many resources exist that list products that are latex-free, and each hospital should have such a list readily available to health care professionals. For an updated list of latex-containing products and other helpful information for parents regarding consumer products, contact the Spina Bifida Association of America, a link to which can be found on . EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 22.1 SELF-INTERMITTENT CATHETERIZATION AMONG FEMALE CHILDREN WITH MYELOMENINGOCELE AND THE POTENTIAL FOR INCREASED COMPLICATIONS STUDY The authors reviewed the medical records of 31 females with myelomeningocele followed from the start of clean intermittent catheterization (CIC). Between all subjects, CIC was used for 459 patient-years. In all cases, the girls used noncoated polyvinyl chloride catheters. Findings Over the total 459 patient-years, 13 females experienced a total of 20 episodes of complications among them. These included hematuria, urethral polyps, and difficulties in catheterization. Complications were increased if assisted CIC was used or if a smaller-bore catheter was utilized. Nursing Implications There are few complications occurring in females with myelomeningocele who self-catheterize using clean technique. Encourage the use of large-size noncoated polyvinyl catheters. Teach females when developmentally capable to perform self-CIC. This function is safe and yields greater independence in this special population. Adapted from Lindehall, B., Abrahamsson, K., Jodal, U., Olsson, I., & Sillen, U. (2007). Complications of clean intermittent catheterization in young females with myelomeningocele: 10 to 19 years of followup. journal of Urology, 178(3), 1053-1055. Children who are at a high risk for latex sensitivity should wear medical alert identification. Education programs regarding latex sensitivity and ways to prevent it need to be directed at those who care for high-risk children, including teachers, school nurses, relatives, babysitters, and all health care professionals. Maintaining Skin Integrity Address the risk for altered skin integrity related to the infant's prone position and impaired mobility. The prone position puts constant pressure on the knees and elbows, and it may be difficult to keep the infant clean of urine and feces. Diapering may be contraindicated preoperatively to avoid pressure on the sac. Therefore, ensure that the infant is kept as clean and dry as possible. This is made more difficult by the constant dribbling of stool and urine that may be present. Placing a pad beneath the diaper area and changing it frequently is important. Perform meticulous skin care. Place the infant on a special care mattress and place synthetic sheepskin under the infant to help reduce friction. Special attention to the infant's legs needs to occur when positioning them, since paralysis may be present. Using a folded diaper between the legs can help reduce pressure and friction from the legs rubbing together. Educating and Supporting the Child and Family Myelomeningocele is a serious disorder that affects multiple body systems and produces varying degrees of deficits. It is a disorderthat has lifelong effects. Thanks to medical advances and technology most children born with myelomeningocele can expect to live a normal life, but challenges remain for the family and child as they learn to cope and live with this physical condition. Adjusting to the demands this condition places on the child and family is difficult. Parents may need time to accept their infant's condition, but as soon as possible they should be involved in the infant's care. Teaching should begin immediately in the hospital. Teaching should include positioning, preventing infection, feeding, promoting urinary elimination through clean intermittent catheterization, preventing latex allergy, and identifying the signs and symptoms of complications such as increased ICP. Due to the chronic nature of this condition, long-term planning needs to begin in the hospital. These children usually require multiple surgical procedures and hospitalizations, and this can place stress on the family and their finances. The nurse has an important role in providing ongoing education about the illness and its treatments and the plan of care. As the family becomes more comfortable with the condition, they will become the experts in the child's care. Respect and recognize the family's changing needs. Providing intense daily care can take its toll on a family, and continual support and encouragement are needed. Referral to the Spina Bifida Association and a local support group for families of children with myelomeningocele is appropriate. See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Consider This T urner Wilson was just born with an obvious defect on his spine.

Describe nursing care for this neonate. What teaching will the nurse do with this infant's family? Muscular Dystrophy Muscular dystrophy refers to a group of inherited conditions that result in progressive muscle weakness and wasting. The muscles affected are primarily the skeletal (voluntary) muscles. Nine types of muscular dystrophy exist. All include muscle weakness over the lifetime; it is progressive in all cases but more severe in others. The various muscular dystrophies are most often diagnosed in childhood and affect a variety of muscle groups. The inheritance pattern for muscular dystrophy differs for each type but may be X- linked, autosomal dominant, or recessive. The genetic mutation in muscular dystrophy results in absence or decrease of a specific muscle protein that prevents normal function of the muscle. The skeletal muscle fibers are affected, yet there are no structural abnormalities in the spinal cord or the peripheral nerves. Table 22.1 gives specifics related to the various types of muscular dystrophy. Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the most common neuromuscular disorder of childhood, is universally fatal (usually by age 20 to 25) (Sarant, 2007; Zak & Chan, 2010). The incidence is about 1 in 3,600 live male births (Sarant, 2007). For these reasons, this discussion will focus on Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Pathophysiology The gene mutation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy results in the absence of dystrophin, a protein that is critical for maintenance of muscle cells. The gene is X-linked recessive, meaning that mainly boys are affected and they receive the gene from their mothers(women are carriers but have no symptoms). Absence of dystrophin leads to generalized weakness of voluntary muscles, and the weakness progresses over time. The hips, thighs, pelvis, and shoulders are affected initially; as the disease progresses, all voluntary muscles as well as cardiac and respiratory muscles are affected. Rarely, males with Duchenne muscular dystrophy may survive beyond the early 30s (Muscular Dystrophy Association, 2009b). Boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy are often late in learning to walk. As toddlers, they may display pseudohypertrophy (enlarged appearance) of the calves. During the preschool years they fall often and are quite clumsy. The affected child has difficulty climbing stairs and running and cannot get up from the floor in the usual fashion. The school-age child walks on the toes or balls of the feet with a rolling or waddling gait. Balance is disturbed significantly, and the child's belly may stick out when the shoulders are pulled back to stay upright and keep from falling over. During the school-age years it also becomes difficult for the child to raise his or her arms. Sometime between the ages of 7 and 12 years nearly all boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy lose the ability to ambulate, and by the teen years any activity of the arms, legs, or trunk requires assistance or support (Muscular Dystrophy Association, 2009b). Most boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy have normal intelligence, but many may exhibit a specific learning disability (Sarant, 2007). Therapeutic Management There is no cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, the use of corticosteroids may slow the progression of the disease (Muscular Dystrophy Association, 2009b; Sarant, 2007; Zak & Chan, 2010). It is thought that prednisone helps by protecting muscle fibers from damage to the sarcolemma (defective in the absence of dystrophin). Numerous studies have shown that boys treated with prednisone demonstrate improved strength and function. The side effects of corticosteroids are many, including weight gain, osteoporosis, and mood changes (Palmieria & Sblendorio, 2007; Sarant, 2007). Calcium supplements are prescribed to prevent osteoporosis, and antidepressants may be helpful when depression occurs related to the chronicity of the disease and/or as an effect of corticosteroid use (Muscular Dystrophy Association, 2009b); see Healthy People 2020. Braces or orthoses and mobility and positioning aids are necessary. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Take Note! Gene therapy clinical trials for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy are in progress (Alton, Ferrari, & Griesenbach, 2007; Muscular Dystrophy Association, 2009b). As the muscles deteriorate, joints may become fixated, resulting in contractures . Contractures restrict flexibility and mobility and cause discomfort. Sometimes contractures require surgical tendon release. Spinal curvatures result over time. The boy with Duchenne muscular dystrophy who can still walk may develop lordosis. More frequently, scoliosis or kyphosis develops with this disorder. Surgical spinal fixation with rod implantation is often required by adolescence (Muscular Dystrophy Association, 2009b). Additional complications include pulmonary, urinary, or systemic infections; depression; learning or behavioral disorders; aspiration pneumonia (as oropharyngeal muscles become affected); cardiac dysrhythmias; and, eventually, respiratory insufficiency and failure (as weakness of the chest muscles and diaphragm progresses). Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 797 . Assessment findings pertinent to Duchenne muscular dystrophy are discussed below. Health History Examine the health history for a family history of neuromuscular disorders. Note pregnancy and delivery history, as this information may be useful in ruling out a pregnancy problem or birth trauma as a cause for the motor dysfunction. Determine status of developmental milestone achievement. Boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy learn to walk but over time become unable to do so. If the child was previously diagnosed with muscular dystrophy, determine progression of disease. Inquire about functional status and need for assistive or adaptive equipment such as braces or wheelchairs. Determine skills related to activities of daily living. Note history of cough or frequent respiratory infections, which occur as the respiratory muscles weaken. While talking with the child and family, determine whether psychosocial issues such as decreased self-esteem, depression, alterations in socialization, or altered family processes might be present. Physical Examination Perform a thorough physical examination on the child with suspected muscular dystrophy or the child with known history of the disorder. Particular findings related to inspection, observation, auscultation, and palpation are presented below. INSPECTION AND OBSERVATION Observe the child's ability to rise from the floor. A hallmark finding of Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the presence of the Gowerssign: the child cannot rise from the floor in standard fashion because of increasing weakness ( Fig. 22.6 ). Observe the child's gait. Determine effectiveness of cough. AUSCULTATION AND PALPATION Auscultate the heart and lungs. Note tachycardia, which develops as the heart muscle weakens. Note adequacy of breath sounds, which may diminish with decreasing respiratory function. Note muscle strength with resistance testing. Palpate muscle tone. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Electromyography (EMG) demonstrates that the problem lies in the muscles, not in the nerves. Serum creatine kinase levels are elevated early in the disorder, when significant muscle wasting is actively occurring. Muscle biopsy provides definitive diagnosis, demonstrating the absence of dystrophin. DNA testing reveals the presence of the gene. Nursing Management Nursing management is aimed at promoting mobility, maintaining cardiopulmonary function, preventing complications, and maximizing quality of life. Interventions directed at maintaining mobility and cardiopulmonary function also help to prevent complications. Refer to Nursing Care Plan 22.1 , and individualize nursing care based on the child's and family's response to the illness. Additional specifics related to care of the child with muscular dystrophy are discussed below. Promoting Mobility Administer corticosteroids and calcium supplements as ordered. Encourage at least minimal weight bearing in a standing position to promote improved circulation, healthier bones, and a straight spine. Boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy may use a standing walker or standing frame to maintain an upright position. Perform passive stretching or strengthening exercises as recommended by the physical therapist. These exercises preserve mobility and may help to prevent muscle atrophy. Use orthotic supports such as hand braces or ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) to prevent contractures of joints. Schedule activities during the part of the day when the child has the most energy. Teach parents the use of positioning, exercises, orthoses, and adaptive equipment. FIGURE 22.6 The Gower sign. (A) First the child must roll onto his hands and knees. (B) Then he must bear weight by using his hands to support some of his weight, while raising his posterior. (C-E) The boy then uses his hands to \"walk\" up his legs to assume an upright position. Maintaining Cardiopulmonary Function Assess respiratory rate, depth of respirations, and work of breathing. Auscultate the lungs to determine whether aeration is sufficient and to assess clarity of breath sounds. Position the child for maximum chest expansion, usually in the upright position. Teach the child and family deep-breathing exercises to strengthen or maintain respiratory muscles and encourage coughing to clear the airways. Perform chest physical therapy or assist with chest percussion. Monitor the results of pulmonary function testing. Use of intermittent positive-pressure ventilation and mechanically assisted coughing will become necessary in the teen years for some boys, possibly later for others. Teach parents monitoring of respiratory status and use of these modalities in conjunction with the respiratory therapist. Monitor cardiac status closely to identify heart failure early. Assess for edema, weight gain, or crackles. Strictly monitor fluid intake and output. Maximizing Quality of Life Long periods of bed rest may contribute to further weakness. Work with the family and child to develop a schedule for diversional activities that provide appropriate developmental stimulation but avoid overexertion or frustration (related to inability to perform the activity). Periods of adequate rest must be balanced with activities. Walking or riding a stationary bike is appropriate for the child who has upper extremity involvement. For the child with lower extremity involvement, a wheelchair may become necessary for mobility, and the child may participate in crafts, drawing, and computer activities. Participating in the Special Olympics may be appropriate for some children. Visit for a link to the Special Olympics website. Do not place limits on the child but encourage activities he or she is interested in that can be modified as needed to fit his or her abilities. Provide emotional support to the child and family. Long-term direct care is stressful for families and becomes more complex as the child gets older. Families often need respite from continual caregiving duties. When a child is hospitalized, the caregiver may feel comfortable allowing nurses and other health care professionals to assume more of the child's daily care; this can be an opportunity for the caregiver to obtain respite from daily care. Respite care may also be offered in the home by various community services, so explore these resources with families. Assess the child's educational status. Some children attend school; others may opt for home schooling. Administer antidepressants as ordered; managing depression may increase the child's desire to participate in activities and self-care. Refer the child and family to the Muscular Dystrophy Association (a link to which is located on ), which provides multidisciplinary care via clinics located throughout the United States. The association is also a clearinghouse for resources for individuals with muscular dystrophy. Ensure that families receive genetic counseling for family planning purposes as well as determining which family members may be carriers for muscular dystrophy. Spinal Muscular Atrophy Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic motor neuron disease that affects the spinal nerves' ability to communicate with the muscles. It is inherited via an autosomal recessive mechanism. The motor neuron protein SMN (survival of motor neurons) is deficient as a result of a faulty gene on chromosome 5. The motor neurons are located mostly in the spinal cord. Without adequate SMN, the signals from the neurons to the muscles instructing them to contract are ineffective, so the muscles lose function and over time atrophy. The proximal muscles, those closer to the body's center, are usually more affected than the distal muscles. Emotional and mental development as well as sensation are unaffected by the disease (Muscular Dystrophy Association, 2009c). There are several types of SMA, including type 1 (Werdnig-Hoffmann disease, infantile SMA), type 2 (intermediate), and type 3 (Kugelberg-Welander disease or juvenile SMA). Their usual progression and prognosis are compared in Table 22.2 .Respiratory muscle weakness may occur with all types of SMA and is usually the cause of death in type 1 and type 2 SMA (Muscular Dystrophy Association, 2009c). The increasing availability of more effective and more portable ventilation devices has led to some children with SMA living many years more than expected; some children even live into their teenage years (Muscular Dystrophy Association, 2009c). Upper respiratory tract infections and aspiration related to dysphagia or gastroesophageal reflux often develop into pneumonia and eventual respiratory failure, as the affected child cannot effectively cough independently in order to clear the airway. Many children with severe type 1 SMA are ventilator dependent. Pectus excavatum develops in children with type 1 and 2 SMA who exhibit paradoxical breathing (use of the diaphragm without intercostal muscle support). The chest becomes funnel shaped and the xiphoid process is retracted (pectus excavatum), further restricting respiratory development. Inability to appropriately suck and swallow leads to difficulty feeding in the child with type 1 SMA. Weak back muscles affect the developing spine, resulting in the complication of scoliosis, kyphosis, or both. Therapeutic management of SMA is supportive, aimed at promoting mobility, maintaining adequate nutrition and pulmonary function, and preventing complications. Spinal fusion may be performed in older children with significant scoliosis. Supplementation with creatine and/or coenzyme Q10 is under investigation (Muscular Dystrophy Association, 2009c). Since the discovery of the disease-causing gene for SMA, further research and improved diagnostic techniques have occurred. The Spinal Muscular Atrophy Project (2009) is a National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)-funded collaborative program focused on the development of drug therapies, potential leads for further drug discovery, and clinical testing. The International Standard of Care Committee for SMA published guidelines for care of the child with SMA in 2007 due to the wide variation of care and clinical outcomes seen in children with SMA (Wang et al., 2007). The guidelines discussed diagnostic testing and care of the child with newly diagnosed SMA, consensus on pulmonary care, consensus on gastrointestinal and nutritional care, consensus on orthopedic care, and rehabilitation and palliative care issues (Wang et al., 2007). Nursing Assessment Note history of attainment of developmental milestones, as well as loss of milestones. SMA should be suspected in a child showing symmetric weakness that is more proximal than distal and greater in the legs than arms, diminished or absent tendon reflexes, and preserved sensation (Wang et al., 2007). In the infant or child with known SMA, assess for recent hospitalizations or respiratory illness. Determine the respiratory support regimen used at home (if any). Note level of motor ability, and identify the orthoses or adaptive equipment used. Elicit history related to feeding patterns at home. Assess for floppy appearance in the infant with SMA. Note decreased ability to initiate spontaneous muscle movement. In the infant or young child with SMA, note narrow chest with decreased excursion, relatively protuberant abdomen, and paradoxical breathing pattern ( Fig. 22.7 ). Observe the chest for formation of pectus excavatum. Auscultate the lungs for diminished or adventitious breath sounds. Monitor laboratory testing, which may include:FIGURE 22.7 Note the very narrow chest, beginning xiphoid depression, and relatively enlarged appearance of the abdomen in this infant with type 1 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Creatine kinase (CK): elevated when muscular damage is occurring Genetic testing: identifies presence of gene for SMA Muscle biopsy: shows the muscle abnormality Nerve conduction velocity test and electromyelogram: to determine extent of involvement Nursing Management Nursing management of type 2 and type 3 SMA focuses on promoting mobility, maintaining pulmonary function, and preventing complications. Children with type 1 SMA need additional interventions related to prevention of complications from immobility and assistance with nutrition. Refer to Nursing Care Plan 22.1 for interventions related to these areas. Individualize the nursing plan of care based on the individual child's responses to the disorder.FIGURE 22.8 Use of noninvasive positive-pressure monitoring via a mask can maximize respiration and may help prevent pulmonary complications. Promote mobility through the use of range-of-motion exercises, lightweight orthotics, standing frames, and wheelchair use as appropriate. Support parents in their efforts to comply with physical and occupational therapy regimens. Older children may exercise with assistance in a warm pool. Position the child in a fashion that maintains appropriate body alignment. Provide airway clearance techniques such as manual or mechanical cough assistance, chest percussion, and postural drainage to assist with clearance of secretions. In collaboration with respiratory therapy, teach families the use of noninvasive ventilation support, in which positive pressure is delivered to the lungs through a mask or mouthpiece ( Fig. 22.8 ). Provide routine tracheostomy care if the child has a tracheostomy (refer to tracheostomy section of Chapter 18 ). Administer gastrostomy tube feedings if ordered, and teach families gastrostomy tube care. Use bracing as prescribed to prevent spinal curvature. Make frequent inspections for skin breakdown in areas affected by bracing. Cerebral Palsy Cerebral palsy is a term used to describe a range of nonspecific clinical symptoms characterized by abnormal motor pattern and postures caused by nonprogressive abnormal brain function. The majority of causes occur before delivery, but can also occur in the natal and postnatal periods (Johnston, 2007; Jones, Morgan, & Shelton, 2007a; Zak & Chan, 2010) ( Box 22.1 ); see Healthy People 2020. Many times no specific cause can be identified (Jones et al., 2007a). Cerebral palsy is the most common movement disorder of childhood; it is a lifelong condition and one of the most common causes of physical disability in children (Johnston, 2007; Jones et al., 2007a). The incidence is about 2.5 in every 1,000 live births (Hirtz et al., 2007). The incidence is higher in premature and low- birthweight infants (Hirtz et al., 2007; Jones et al., 2007a). HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Most affected children will develop symptoms in infancy or early childhood. There is a large variation in symptoms and disability. For some children it may be as mild as a slight limp; for others it may result in severe motor and neurologic impairments (NINDS, 2011a). Primary signs include motor impairments such as spasticity, muscle weakness, and ataxia , which is lack of coordination of muscle movements during voluntary movements such as walking or picking up objects. Complications include mental impairments, seizures, growth problems, impaired vision or hearing, abnormal sensation or perception, and hydrocephalus. Most children can survive into adulthood, but function and quality of life can vary from near normal to substantial impairments (NINDS, 2011a). Pathophysiology Cerebral palsy is a disorder caused by abnormal development of, or damage to, the motor areas of the brain, resulting in a neurologic lesion. It is difficult to establish an exact location of the neurologic lesion, but it causes a disruption in the brain's ability to control movement and posture. The lesion itself does not change over time; thus, the disorder is considered nonprogressive since the brain injury does not progress. However, the clinical manifestations of the lesion change as the child grows. Some children may improve, but many either plateau in their attainment of motor skills or demonstrate worsening of motor abilities because it is difficult to maintain the ability to move over time. BOX 22.1 CAUSES OF CEREBRAL PALSY Prenatal Congenital malformation Hypoxia Maternal fever Maternal seizures Maternal bleeding Exposure to radiation Environmental toxins Genetic abnormalities Metabolic disorders Intrauterine growth restriction Intrauterine infection, such as cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis Nutritional deficits Preeclampsia Multiple births Prematurity Low birthweight Malformation of brain structure Abnormalities of blood flow to the brain Abdominal insults Perinatal Prematurity (<32 weeks) Asphyxia Hypoxia Abnormal fetal presentation Sepsis or central nervous system infection Placental complications Electrolyte disturbance Cerebral hemorrhage Chorioamnionitis (infection of the placental tissues and amniotic fluid) Postnatal Kernicterus (a type of brain damage that may result from neonatal hyperbilirubinemia) Asphyxia Head trauma (e.g., motor vehicle accidents, abuse) Seizures Toxins Viral or bacterial infection of the central nervous system (e.g., meningitis) Cerebral infarcts Intraventricular hemorrhage Cerebral palsy is classified in several ways. One common way is by the type of movement disturbance ( Table 22.3 ). Therapeutic Management Management of cerebral palsy involves multiple disciplines, including a primary physician, specialty physicians such as a neurologist and an orthopedic surgeon, nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, dietitians, psychologists, counselors, teachers, and parents. There is no standard treatment for all children. The overall focus of therapeutic management will be to assist the child to gain optimal development and function within the limits of the disease. Treatment is mainly preventative, symptomatic, and supportive. Spasticity management will be a primary concern and will be determined by clinical findings. Medical management is focused on promoting mobility through the use of therapeutic modalities and medications. Surgical management is often required and is used to correct deformities related to spasticity. Physical, Occupational, and Speech Therapy The use of therapeutic modalities such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy will be essential in promoting mobility and development in the child with cerebral palsy. The earlier the treatment begins, the better chance the child has of overcoming developmental disabilities (NINDS, 2011a). Physical therapists work with children to assist in the development of gross motor movements such as walking and positioning, and they help the child develop independent movement. They also assist in preventing contractures, and they instruct children andcaregivers in the use of assistive devices such as walkers and wheelchairs. Occupational therapists may be responsible for fashioning orthotics and splints. AFOs are the most common orthotic used by children with cerebral palsy (Cervasio, 2011) ( Fig. 22.9 ). AFOs help prevent deformity from conditions such as contractures and help reduce the effects of existing deformities. They can help improve a child's mobility by assisting in control of alignment and helping to increase the efficiency of the child's gait. Spinal orthotics such as braces are used in young children with cerebral palsy to combat scoliosis that develops due to spasticity. These braces are used to delay surgical management of the scoliosis until the child reaches skeletal maturity. Splinting is used to maintain muscle length. Serial casting may also be used to increase muscle and tendon length. Occupational therapy also assists in the development of fine motor skills and will help the child to perform optimal self-care by working on skills such as activities of daily living. Speech therapy assists in the development of receptive and expressive language and addresses the use of appropriate feeding techniques in the child who has swallowing problems. Speech therapists may teach augmented communication strategies to children who are nonverbal or who have articulation problems. Many children may not communicate verbally but can use alternative means such as communication books or boards and computers with voice synthesizers to make their desires known or to participate in conversation. FIGURE 22.9 The child with cerebral palsy may benefit from wearing ankle-foot orthotics (AFOs) to provide support needed for independent or assisted walking. Pharmacologic Management Various pharmacologic options are available to manage spasticity (see Drug Guide 22.1 ). Oral medications used to treat spasticity include baclofen, dantrolene sodium, and diazepam. Children with athetoid cerebral palsy may be given anticholinergics to help decrease abnormal movements. Parenterally administered medications such as botulin toxins and baclofen are also used to manage spasticity. Botulinum toxin is injected into the spastic muscle to balance the muscle forces across joints and to decrease spasticity. It is useful in managing focal spasticity in which the spasticity is interfering with function, producing pain, or contributing to a progressive deformity. Botulin toxin injection is performed by the physician or nurse practitioner and can be done in the clinic or outpatient setting. Take Note! Pathologic drooling is a problem for many children with cerebral palsy. It can lead to dehydration, dental enamel erosion, and maceration of the skin, and an odor can result, along with social stigmatization. Recent research has shown that intraglandular injection of botulinum toxin type A can improve drooling with few side effects in children with neurologic disorders (Fairhurst & Cockerill, 2011; Ong, Wong, & Hamid, 2009). Intrathecal administration of baclofen has been shown to decrease tone, but it must be infused continuously due to its short half-life. Surgical placement of a baclofen pump will be considered in children with general spasticity that is limiting function, comfort, activities of daily living, and endurance. To test whether it is a suitable option, an intrathecal test dose of baclofen will be administered. If the trial is successful, a baclofen pump will be implanted. Once inserted, delivery of the drug can be individualized to meet the child's unique needs. The pump needs to be replaced every 5 to 7 years and must be refilled with medication approximately every 3 months, depending on the type of pump. Complications with baclofen pump placement include infection, rupture, dislodgement, or blockage of the catheter. Medications are also used to treat seizure disorders in children with cerebral palsy (refer to Chapter 16 for information related to seizure management). Surgical ManagementMany children will require surgical procedures to correct deformities related to spasticity. Multiple corrective surgeries may be required; they usually are orthopedic or neurosurgical. Surgery may be used to correct contractures that are severe enough to cause movement limitations. Common orthopedic procedures include tendon lengthening procedures, correction of hip and adductor muscle spasticity, and fusion of unstable joints to help improve locomotion, correct bony deformities, decrease painful spasticity, and maintain, restore, or stabilize a spinal deformity. Neurosurgical interventions may include placement of a shunt in children who have developed hydrocephalus, or surgical interventions to decrease spasticity. Selective dorsal root rhizotomy is used to decrease spasticity in the lower extremities by reducing the amount of stimulation that reaches the muscles via the nerves. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 797 . Assessment findings pertinent to cerebral palsy are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Obtain a detailed account of gestational and perinatal events (refer to Box 22.1 ). Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history of the undiagnosed child might include: Intrauterine infections Prematurity with intracranial hemorrhage Difficult, complicated, or prolonged labor and delivery Multiple births History of possible anoxia during prenatal life or birth History of head trauma Delayed attainment of developmental milestones Muscle weakness or rigidity Poor feeding Hips and knees feel rigid and unbending when pulled to a sitting position Seizure activity Subnormal learning Abnormal motor performance, scoots on back instead of crawling on abdomen, walks or stands on toes Children known to have cerebral palsy are often admitted to the hospital for corrective surgeries or other complications of the disease, such as aspiration pneumonia and urinary tract infections. The health history should include questions related to: Respiratory status: Has a cough, sputum production, or increased work of breathing developed? Motor function: Has there been a change in muscle tone or increase in spasticity? Presence of fever Feeding and weight loss Any other changes in physical state or medication regimen Physical Examination Observe general appearance. Pay close attention to the neurologic assessment and motor assessment. Assess for delayed development, size for age, and sensory alterations such as strabismus, vision problems, and speech disorders. Abnormal postures may be present. While lying supine, the infant may demonstrate scissor crossing of the legs with plantar flexion. In the prone position the infant may raise his or her head higher than normal due to arching of the back, or the opisthotonic position may be noted. The infant may also abnormally flex the arms and legs under the trunk. Primitive reflexes may persist beyond the point at which they disappear in a healthy infant. Evolution of protective reflexes may be delayed. Watch the infant or child play, crawl, walk, or climb to determine motor function and capability. Note any movement disorder. Infants with cerebral palsy may demonstrate abnormal use of muscle groups such as scooting on their back instead of crawling or walking. Assess active and passive range of motion. Pay particular attention to muscle tone. Though an increased or decreased resistance may be noted with passive movements, hypertonicity is most often seen. Increased resistance to dorsiflexion and passive hip abduction are the most common early signs. Sustained clonus may be present after forced dorsiflexion. Lift the child by placing your hands in the infant's or child's axillary area to assess shoulder girdle function and tone. Infants with cerebral palsy often demonstrate prolonged standing on their toes when supported in an upright standing position in this fashion. Lift the young child off the ground whilethe child holds your thumbs to test hand strength. Observe for presence of limb deformity, as decreased use of an extremity (as in the case of hemiparesis) may result in shortening of the extremity compared to the other one. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests A complete history, physical examination, and ancillary investigations are the primary modality for establishing a diagnosis of cerebral palsy. The following laboratory and diagnostic tests will help determine whether cerebral palsy is the likely cause or whether another condition may be the cause of the child's symptoms. These tests also will be important in evaluating the severity of the child's physical disabilities. Common supplementary laboratory and diagnostic tests ordered for the diagnosis and assessment of cerebral palsy include: Electroencephalogram: usually abnormal but the pattern is highly variable Cranial radiographs or ultrasound: may show cerebral asymmetry MRI or CT: may show area of damage or abnormal development but may be normal Screening for metabolic defects and genetic testing may be performed to help determine the cause of cerebral palsy. Nursing Management In addition to the nursing diagnoses and related interventions discussed in the Nursing Care Plan 22.1 , nursing management focuses on promoting growth and development by promoting mobility and maintaining optimal nutritional intake. Providing support and education to the child and family is also an important nursing function. Promoting Mobility Mobility is critical to the development of the child with cerebral palsy. Treatment modalities to promote mobility include physiotherapy, pharmacologic management, and surgery. Surgical procedures are discussed above. Physical or occupational therapy as well as medications may be used to address musculoskeletal abnormalities, to facilitate range of motion, to delay or prevent deformities such as contractures, to provide joint stability, to maximize activity, and to encourage the use of adaptive devices. The nurse's role in relation to the various therapies is to provide ongoing follow-through with prescribed exercises, positioning, or bracing. Take Note! Therapeutic horseback riding has been demonstrated to improve gross motor function in children with cerebral palsy. If available in the local area, refer the child and family to the North American Riding for the Handicapped Association (NARHA) (Sterba, 2004, 2007). When casting, splinting, or orthotics are used, assess skin integrity frequently. Pain management may also be necessary. Nursing management of children receiving botulin toxin focuses on assisting with the procedure and providing education and support to the child and family. Nursing interventions related to baclofen include assisting with the test dose and providing preoperative and postoperative care if a pump is placed, as well as providing support and education to the child and family. Teaching Guidelines 22.2 gives information related to baclofen pump insertion. Teaching Guidelines 22.2 BACLOFEN PUMP: CHILD/FAMILY EDUCATION Check the incisions daily for redness, drainage, or swelling. Notify the physician or nurse practitioner if the child has a temperature greater than 101.5\u00b0F, or if the child has persistent incision pain. Avoid tub baths for 2 weeks. Do not allow the child to sleep on the stomach for 4 weeks after pump insertion. Discourage twisting at the waist, reaching high overhead, stretching, or bending forward or backward for 4 weeks. When the incisions have healed, normal activity may be resumed. Wear loose clothing to prevent irritation at the incision site. Carry implanted device identification and emergency information cards at all times.Promoting Nutrition Children with cerebral palsy may have difficulty eating and swallowing due to poor motor control of the mouth, tongue, and throat. This may lead to poor nutrition and problems with growth. The child may require a longer time to eat because of poor motor control. Special diets, such as soft or pur\u00e9ed, may make swallowing easier. Proper positioning during feeding is essential to facilitate swallowing and reduce the risk of aspiration. Speech or occupational therapists can assist in working on strengthening swallowing muscles as well as assisting in developing accommodations to facilitate nutritional intake. Consult a dietitian to ensure adequate nutrition for children with cerebral palsy. In children with severe swallowing problems or malnutrition, a feeding tube such as a gastrostomy tube may be placed. Providing Support and Education Cerebral palsy is a lifelong disorder that can result in severe physical and cognitive disability. In some cases disability may require complete intensive daily care of the child. Adjusting to the demands of this multifaceted illness is difficult. Children are frequently hospitalized and need numerous corrective surgeries, which places strain on the family and its finances. From the time of diagnosis, the family should be involved in the child's care. It is important to include parents in the planning of interventions and care of this child. In most cases they are the primary caregivers and will assist the child in development of functioning and skills as well as providing daily care. They will provide essential information to the health care team and will be advocates for their child throughout his or her life. It is important that nurses provide ongoing education for the child and family. As the child grows, the needs of the family and child will change. Recognize and respect these needs. Providing daily intense care can be demanding and tiring. When a child with cerebral palsy is admitted to the hospital, this may serve as a time of respite for family and primary caregivers. Encourage respite care and provide support and encouragement. Because cerebral palsy is a lifelong condition, children will need meaningful education programs that emphasize independence in the least restrictive educational environment. Refer caregivers to local resources, including education services and support groups. Links to United Cerebral Palsy, a national organization, and Easter Seals, an organization that helps children with disabilities and special needs and provides support to families, can be accessed on . Refer children younger than age 3 years to the local early intervention service. Early intervention provides case management of developmental services for children with special needs. Each state has a coordinator for early intervention. The office of the early intervention coordinator can then direct the health care professional to the local or district early intervention office. The website 4MyChild (a link to which is available on ) provides a comprehensive list of contact information based on the state you live in. Additional links to resources for families of young children with special needs are available on . For additional reading, recommend the book Children With Cerebral Palsy: A Parent's Guide by E. Geralis (published by Woodbine House).ACQUIRED NEUROMUSCULAR DISORDERS A number of neuromuscular disorders may be acquired during childhood or adolescence. These include disorders resulting from trauma as well as those that are autoimmune and infectious in nature. Trauma or unintentional injury is a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009). The child is at increased risk for trauma based on the developmental factors of physical and emotional immaturity; additionally, adolescents often display belief of invincibility. The developing neuromuscular system, if injured, may be irreparable, so the injury may result in life-threatening or lifelong effects. Neuromuscular trauma includes spinal cord injury and birth trauma. Autoimmune neuromuscular disorders include Guillain- Barr\u00e9 syndrome, myasthenia gravis, and dermatomyositis. Botulism, though uncommon in developed countries, is an important neuromuscular disorder resulting from infection. Spinal Cord Injury Spinal cord injury is damage to the spinal cord that results in loss of function. Frequent causes are trauma, such as car accidents, falls, diving into shallow water, gunshot or stab wounds, sports injuries, child abuse, or birth injuries. Spinal cord injuries are relatively uncommon in children, but when they do occur they have a devastating impact on the child's physical and functional status, social and emotional development, and family functioning. More spinal cord injuries are seen in people 16 to 30 years of age due to their increased incidence of accidents, particularly motor vehicle accidents (Mayo Clinic Staff, 2009). Spinal cord injury is a medical emergency and immediate medical attention is required. Cervical traction is often used initially and surgical intervention is sometimes necessary. Ongoing medical treatment will be based on the child's age and overall health and the extent and location of the injury. Therapeutic management focuses on rehabilitation and prevention of complications. Spinal cord injury in children is managed similarly to that in adults. Nursing Assessment Symptoms vary based on the location and severity of the injury. Common signs and symptoms associated with spinal cord injury include: Inability to move or feel extremities Numbness Tingling Weakness Paralysis depends on the location of the injury to the spinal cord; the higher the injury in the spinal cord, the more extensive the damage and the greater the loss of function. High cervical injury will result in damage to the phrenic nerve, which innervates the diaphragm. Damage to this nerve will leave the child unable to breathe without assistance. The diagnosis of spinal cord injury is made by clinical signs and diagnostic tests, which may include radiographs, CT scans, and MRI. Nursing Management Any child who requires hospitalization due to trauma should be considered at risk for a spinal cord injury. Immobilization of the spine is essential until full evaluation of the injury is complete and spinal cord damage is ruled out. Nursing management will be similar to management of the adult with a spinal cord injury and will focus on optimizing mobility, promoting bladder and bowel management, promoting adequate nutritional status, preventing complications associated with extreme immobility such as contractures and muscle atrophy, managing pain, and providing support and education to the child and family. Refer to the myelomeningocele section of this chapter for information related to urinary and bowel elimination. The nurse plays an important role not only in the acute care of children with spinal cord injury but also during rehabilitation. Recovery from a spinal cord injury requires long-term hospitalization and rehabilitation. An interdisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, therapists, social workers, and case managers will work to manage the child's complex and long-term needs. Promoting communication among the interdisciplinary team is essential and will be a key nursing function. Rehabilitation will need to focus on the ever-changing developmental needs of the child as he or she grows. Prevention of spinal cord injuries is an important nursing consideration. Educate the public on vehicular safety, including seat belt use and the proper use of age-appropriate safety seats. Additional education topics include bicycle, sports, and recreation safety; prevention of falls; violence prevention including gun safety; and water safety, including the risk of diving. This education can helpdecrease the incidence of spinal cord injury in children. Birth Trauma Birth traumas are injuries sustained by the newborn during the birthing process. They may result from the pressure of birth, especially in a prolonged or abrupt labor, abnormal or difficult presentation, cephalopelvic disproportion, or mechanical forces, such as forceps or vacuum used during delivery. Newborns at risk include multiple fetus deliveries, large-for-gestational-age infants, infants born extremely premature, infants with large heads, or newborns with congenital anomalies. Most injuries are minor and resolve without treatment. See Table 22.4 for common types of birth trauma. Nursing Assessment Assess the eyes and face for facial paralysis, observing for asymmetry of the face with crying or appearance of the mouth being drawn to the unaffected side. Ensure that the infant spontaneously moves all extremities. Note any absence of or decrease in deep tendon reflexes or abnormal positioning of extremities. Nursing Management Nursing management will be mainly supportive and will focus on assessing for resolution of the trauma or any associated complications, along with providing support and education to the parents. Provide parents with an explanation and reassurance that these injuries are harmless. Parents are alarmed when their newborn cannot move an extremity or demonstrates asymmetric facial movement. Reassure parents and offer support. Provide parents with education regarding the length of time until resolution and when and if they need to seek further medical attention for the condition. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (also called acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy or polyneuropathy) is an uncommon disorder in which an immune response within the body attacks the peripheral nervous system but does not usually affect the brain or spinal cord. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome results in inflammation and demyelinization of the peripheral nerves. It is not fully understood why this occurs, but it is believed to be an autoimmune condition that most commonly is triggered by a previous viral or bacterial infection, usually described as an influenza-like upper respiratory tract infection or an acute gastroenteritis with fever (NINDS, 2011b; Sivadon-Tardy et al., 2009). In rare cases it has occurred after the child has had an immunization or surgery (NINDS, 2011b). In many cases the causative agent remains unidentified (Sivadon-Tardy et al., 2009).Therapeutic Management Treatment of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is symptomatic and focuses on lessening the severity and speeding recovery. Management may include plasma exchange and administration of intravenous immunoglobulins, especially in severe cases. The goal of treatment is to keep the body functioning until the nervous system recovers. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is a life-threatening condition, and some children will die during the acute phase due to respiratory failure. Most children will make a full recovery, but a few may have residual damage. Nursing Assessment Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are essential since the disorder can quickly lead to respiratory failure and death from muscle paralysis. For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 797 . Assessment findings pertinent to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. The clinical presentation of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is fairly similar in children and adults. It can occur a few days or weeks after the causative infection or event. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome has a quick onset and begins with muscle weakness and paresthesias such as numbness and tingling. Classically it initially affects the legs and progresses in an ascending manner. Occasionally it affects the arms or face first and proceeds in a descending manner. Progression is usually complete in 2 to 4 weeks, followed by a stable period leading to the recovery phase, which lasts for a few weeks to months in most cases but can take years. Severity of the disorder ranges from mild weakness to total paralysis. In children, pain, especially of the lower extremities, as the initial presentation preceding motor involvement has been reported. Other symptoms seen during the course of the illness include: Fairly symmetric flaccid weakness or paralysis Ataxia Sensory disturbances Physical Examination and Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Physical examination findings may include decreased or absent tendon reflexes. Facial weakness or difficulty swallowing may also be present. Diagnosis is usually based on clinical findings of paralysis. CSF analysis may reveal an increased level of protein, but this may not be evident until after the first week of the illness. Take Note! Tickling may be a successful technique for assessing the level of paralysis in the child with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, either initially or in the recovery phase. Nursing Management Nursing management is supportive. In severe cases the child may require intensive nursing care along with mechanical ventilation. Observe the child closely for the extent of paralysis and monitor for respiratory involvement. Nursing care focuses on the same concerns as in any child with extreme immobility or paralysis. Prevention of complications associated with immobility is a central concern and involves maintaining skin integrity, preventing respiratory complications and contractures, maintaining adequate nutrition, and managing pain. Interventions include turning and repositioning every 2 hours, assessing the skin for redness or breakdown, performing range-of-motion exercises, keeping the skin clean and dry, encouraging intake of fluids to maintain hydration status, and encouraging coughing and deep breathing every 2 hours and as needed. Enteral feeding or parenteral nutrition may be indicated if swallowing becomes impaired. Physical therapy may be helpful in preventing complications and promoting motor skill recovery. Provide support and education to the parent and child. The rapid onset and long recovery can be difficult and can cause strain on the family and its finances. If residual disability occurs, the family will need help adjusting and caring for their child. Take Note! Serial measurement of tidal volumes may reveal respiratory deterioration in the child with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.Myasthenia Gravis Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease that may be inherited as a rare genetic disease, may be acquired by infants born to mothers with myasthenia gravis, or may develop later in childhood. The cause is unclear but the thymus gland sometimes plays a role and it is suspected that viral or bacterial infection can trigger it (Muscular Dystrophy Association, 2009d). The acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction is affected, inhibiting normal neuromuscular transmission. The result is progressive weakness and fatigue of the skeletal muscles. Though no gene has been discovered as responsible for myasthenia gravis, autoimmune diseases do demonstrate a genetic predisposition. Myasthenia gravis usually reaches maximum severity within 1 to 3 years of onset, and with proper treatment children can remain physically active (Muscular Dystrophy Association, 2009d). However, there is no cure for myasthenia gravis. Symptoms can be controlled, but it is a lifelong condition, with early detection being the key to managing the disorder successfully. The disease may be aggravated by stress, exposure to extreme temperatures, and infections, resulting in a myasthenic crisis. Myasthenic crisis is a medical emergency with symptoms including sudden respiratory distress, dysphagia, dysarthria, ptosis, diplopia, tachycardia, anxiety, and rapidly increasing weakness. Therapeutic management generally involves the use of anticholinesterase medications such as pyridostigmine, which blocks the breakdown of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction and enhances neuromuscular transmission. If weakness is not controlled, additional medications may include corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants. Other treatments include plasmapheresis, which removes antibodies from the blood; intravenous immunoglobulin, and thymectomy (however, the role of the thymus gland in the disease process is unclear; therefore, this procedure may or may not improve the child's symptoms). Nursing Assessment Note history of fatigue and weakness; difficulty chewing, swallowing, or holding up the head; or pain with muscle fatigue. In the verbal child, note complaints of double vision. Observe the child for ptosis (droopy eyelids) or altered eye movements from partial paralysis. The neonate may display inadequate suck, weak cry, floppy extremities, and, possibly, respiratory insufficiency. Note increased work of breathing. Laboratory testing may involve the edrophonium (Tensilon) test, in which a short-acting cholinesterase inhibitor is used. Acetylcholine receptor (AchR) antibodies may be present in elevated quantities in the serum. Nursing Management The goals of nursing management include prevention of respiratory problems and providing adequate nutrition. Administer anticholinergic or other medications as ordered, teaching children and families about the use of these drugs. Anticholinergic drugs should be given 30 to 45 minutes before meals, on time and exactly as ordered. Encourage families to seek prompt medical treatment for suspected infections. Encourage appropriate stress management and avoidance of extreme temperatures. Teach families that physical activities should be performed during times of peak energy; rest periods are needed for energy conservation. Teach families to call their neurologist immediately if signs and symptoms of myasthenic crisis or cholinergic crisis, which results from overmedication with anticholinergic medications, appear. Myasthenic crisis and cholinergic crisis have a similar presentation: rapidly increasing muscle weakness with resultant respiratory distress. Encourage children to wear a medical alert bracelet. Take Note! Signs and symptoms of myasthenic crisis include severe muscle weakness, respiratory difficulty, tachycardia, and dysphagia. Signs and symptoms of cholinergic crisis include severe muscle weakness, sweating, increased salivation, bradycardia, and hypotension. Dermatomyositis Dermatomyositis is an autoimmune disease that results in inflammation of the muscles or associated tissues. It occurs more often in girls and is generally diagnosed between the ages of 5 and 14 years (Muscular Dystrophy Association, 2009a). The autoimmune response may be triggered by exposure to a virus or to certain medications (Muscular Dystrophy Association, 2009a). As with other autoimmune diseases, a genetic predisposition is present. The inflammatory cells of the immune system cause a vasculitis that affects the skin, muscles, kidneys, retinas, and gastrointestinal tract. Therapeutic management involving the use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants is necessary to prevent the complications of painful calcium deposits under the skin, as well as joint contractures. With appropriate treatment, children may recover completely, though some children experience relapses (Muscular Dystrophy Association, 2009a).Nursing Assessment Elicit a health history, which commonly involves history of fever, fatigue, and rash, usually followed by muscle pain and weakness. Determine onset and progression of muscle weakness. Inspect the skin for presence of rash involving the upper eyelids and extensor surfaces of the knuckles, elbows, and knees. The rash is initially a reddish-purplish color, and then progresses to scaling with resulting roughness of the skin. Test muscle strength, noting particularly weakness in the pelvic and shoulder girdles. Laboratory and diagnostic testing may include muscle enzyme levels, a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test, and an electromyelogram to distinguish muscular weakness from other causes. Nursing Management Administer medications as ordered and teach families about their use; instruct them to monitor for side effects. Educate the family about the importance of maintaining the medication regimen in order to prevent calcinosis (calcium deposits) and joint deformity in the future. Encourage compliance with physical therapy regimens. Ensure that children are excused from physical education classes while the disease is active.BOTULISM Botulism is a disease that is caused by a toxin produced in the immature intestines of young children resulting from infection with the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. It is rare but can cause serious paralytic illness. Botulism can be a food-borne infection but can also be contracted through wound infections or intestinal infections in infants, which is the most common form in the United States (Arnon, 2007). C. botulinum is common in soil and can also be found in a variety of foods, such as improperly preserved home- canned foods. It generally occurs in infants younger than 6 months of age (Arnon, 2007). It has been associated with feeding honey and corn syrup to infants; thus, these should be avoided in children younger than 1 year of age (Vorvick, Vyas, & Zieve, 2009). The disease is not infectious; to become infected, the child must ingest the bacterial spores. These spores then multiply in the intestinal tract and produce the toxin, which is absorbed in the immature intestines of the infant. It is generally not a problem for older children because the bacteria do not grow well in mature intestines due to the presence of the normal intestinal flora. Prognosis is good, but if treatment is not initiated, paralysis of the arms, legs, trunk, and respiratory system can develop. Therapeutic management is usually supportive but may involve administration of botulinum toxin. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 797 . Assessment findings pertinent to botulism are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Signs and symptoms usually occur soon after ingestion of the bacteria. Common signs and symptoms in infants reported during the health history might include: Constipation Poor feeding Listlessness Generalized weakness Weak cry Common signs and symptoms in older children reported during the health history might include: Double vision Blurred vision Drooping eyelids Difficulty swallowing Slurred speech Muscle weakness Physical Examination and Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Assess for a diminished gag reflex, which is indicative of botulism. Diagnostic tests include cultures of stool and serum. Botulism is a rare disease and is difficult to diagnose since its symptoms are similar to those of other neuromuscular diseases. Therefore, assessment may include diagnostic tests to help rule out other diseases, such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, stroke, and myasthenia gravis. Nursing Management Treatment is mainly supportive and focuses on maintaining respiratory status and nutritional status. If ordered, administer botulinum toxin early in the disease to reduce its severity and progression. KEY CONCEPTS Muscles, tendons, ligaments, and cartilage are all present and functional at birth, though intentional, purposeful movement develops only as the infant matures. The spine is very mobile in the newborn and infant, especially the cervical spine region, resulting in a high risk for cervical spine injury. The nurse's role in laboratory and diagnostic testing for neuromuscular disorders is mainly that of educating the child and family about and preparing the child for the test or procedure. Assessment of range of motion and muscle tone is critical in the child with a neuromuscular disorder. Hypertonia or hypotonia is an abnormal finding in the infant or child. Determining attainment of developmental milestones and subsequent progression or loss of those milestones is useful in distinguishing various neuromuscular disorders. The nurse reinforces and carries out the exercise plans and adaptive equipment use as prescribed by the physical or occupational therapist in order to maintain neuromuscular function and to prevent complications. Nursing management of a child with myelomeningocele focuses on preventing infection, promoting bowel and urinary elimination, promoting adequate nutrition, preventing latex allergy reaction, maintaining skin integrity, providing education and support to the family, and recognizing complications, such as hydrocephalus or increased ICP, associated with the disorder. Cerebral palsy may result in significant motor impairment. Children with cerebral palsy require ongoing physical therapy as well as nutritional intervention. Boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy initially learn to walk but later lose this ability. Respiratory compromise occurs in muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy and eventually leads to death. Children with spinal cord injury require intense nursing management and lengthy rehabilitation to maintain or regain function. Children with neuromuscular disorders often suffer depression related to the chronic nature of the disorder. School attendance and participation in activities such as the Special Olympics are important for children with neuromuscular dysfunction. REFERENCES Adzick, N. S. (2009).

Dakota Dawes, 2 years old, is brought to the clinic by his mother. She states, \"Last night Dakota said his arm hurt, but he didn't have any complaints during the day. Today when he was playing I noticed he wasn't using his right ar m.\"Musculoskeletal disorders in children may occur as a congenital malformation or a genetic disorder that is present from birth but may not be identified until later in childhood or adolescence. Other disorders are developmental and still others result from trauma. Infants and young children have resilient soft tissue, so sprains and strains are less common in this age group. Older school-age children and adolescents often participate in sports, resulting in an increased risk of injuries such as sprains, fractures, and torn ligaments. The immobility associated with most musculoskeletal disorders may affect the child's development and acquisition of motor skills, leading to motor dysfunction. Understanding the most common responses to these disorders gives the nurse the foundation required to plan care for any child with any musculoskeletal disorder.VARIATIONS IN PEDIATRIC ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY The musculoskeletal system provides the body with form, support, stability, protection, and the ability to move. It is made up of bones, muscles, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, joints, and connective tissue. The musculoskeletal system in infants and children is immature compared with adults; thus, when a musculoskeletal problem occurs in childhood, the child's growth and movement may be hindered. Myelinization Myelinization of the central nervous system continues to progress after birth and is complete by about 2 years of age. Myelinization proceeds in a cephalocaudal and proximal-distal fashion, allowing voluntary muscle control to progress as myelinization occurs. As myelinization proceeds, the speed and accuracy of nerve impulses increase. Primitive reflexes are replaced with voluntary movement. Muscle Development The muscular system, including tendons, ligaments, and cartilage, arises from the mesoderm in early embryonic development. At birth (term or preterm), the muscles, tendons, ligaments, and cartilage are all present and functional. The newborn infant is capable of spontaneous movement but lacks purposeful control. Full range of motion is present at birth. Healthy infants and children demonstrate normal muscle tone. As the infant matures and becomes mobile, the muscles develop further and become stronger and their mass increases. The infant's muscles account for approximately 25% of total body weight, as compared with the adult's muscle mass, which accounts for about 40% of total body weight (Bechard, Wroe, & Ellis, 2008). Muscles grow rapidly in adolescence; this contributes to clumsiness, which places the teen at increased risk for injury. In response to testosterone release, the adolescent boy experiences a growth spurt, particularly in the trunk and legs, and develops bulkier muscles. Female infants tend to have laxer ligaments than male infants, possibly due to the presence of female hormones, placing them at increased risk for developmental dysplasia of the hip (Hosalkar, Horn, Friedman, & Dormans, 2007). Skeletal Development The infant's skeleton is not fully ossified at birth. The infant and young child's bones are more flexible and more porous and have a lower mineral content than the adult's. These structural differences of a young child's bones allow for greater shock absorption, so the bones will often bend rather than break when an injury occurs. The thick, strong periosteum of the child's bones allows for a greater absorption of force than is seen in adults. As a result, the cortex of the bone does not always break, sometimes buckling or bending only. The skeleton contains increased amounts of cartilage compared with adolescents and adults. Ossification , the conversion of cartilage to bone, continues throughout childhood and is complete at adolescence. During fetal development the spine displays kyphosis , an outward curvature. Cervical lordosis , inward curvature, develops as the infant starts to hold the head up. When the infant or toddler assumes an upright position, the primary and secondary curves of the spine begin to develop. The balance of the curves allows the head to be centered over the pelvis. During the toddler years, the period of early walking, lumbar lordosis may be significant (also termed toddler lordosis), and the toddler appears quite swaybacked and potbellied. As the child develops, the spine takes on more adult-like curves. During adolescence thoracic kyphosis may become evident. This is most often a postural effect, and as the teen matures, the posture appears similar to that of an adult. Growth Plate The ends of the bones in young children are composed of the epiphysis , the end of a long bone, and the physis, in combination termed the growth plate. In infants, the epiphyses are cartilaginous and ossify over time. In children, the epiphysis is the secondary ossification center at the end of the bone. The physis is a cartilaginous area between the epiphysis and the metaphysis. Growth of the bones occurs primarily in the epiphyseal region. This area is vulnerable and structurally weak. Traumatic force applied to the epiphysis during injury may result in fracture in that area of the bone. Epiphyseal injury may result in early, incomplete, or partial closure of the growth plate, leading to deformity or shortening of the bone. Epiphyseal growth continues until skeletal maturity is reached during adolescence. Production of androgens in adolescence gradually causes the growth plates to fuse, and thus long bone growth is complete ( Fig. 23.1 ).FIGURE 23.1 Anatomic areas of growing bone. Bone Healing The child's bones have a thick, strong periosteum with an abundant blood supply. Bone healing occurs in the same fashion as in the adult, but because of the rich nutrient supply to the periosteum, it occurs more quickly in children. Children's bones produce callus more rapidly and in larger quantities than do adults'. As new bone cells quickly form, a bulge of new bone growth occurs at the site of the fracture. The younger the child, the more quickly the bone heals. Also, the closer the fracture is to the growth plate (epiphysis), the more quickly the fracture heals. The capacity for remodeling (the process of breaking down and forming new bone) is increased in children as compared with adults. This means that straightening of the bone over time occurs more easily in children. Positional Alterations The lower extremities of the infant tend to have a bowed appearance, attributed to in utero positioning. In utero, the fetus' hips are usually flexed, abducted, and externally rotated, with the knees also flexed and the lower limbs inwardly rotated. This normal developmental variation is termed internal tibial torsion. The legs straighten with passive motion, and internal tibial torsion should not be confused with \"bowlegs\" ( Fig 23.2 ). Internal tibial torsion usually resolves independently some time in the second or third year of life as the toddler bears weight and the lower extremity muscles and bones mature. The bowlegged appearance is sometimes also referred to as genu genu valgum (knock-knees) by the age of 2 to 3 years. In genu valgum, when the knees are touching, the ankles are significantly separated, with the lower portion of the legs angled outward ( Fig. 23.3 ). By age 7 or 8 years, genu valgum gradually resolves in most children.FIGURE 23.2 Internal tibial with metatarsus adductus\u2014normal findings in infant. The newborn's feet also display in-toeing (metatarsus adductus) as a result of in utero positioning (see Fig. 23.2 ). The feet remain flexible and may be passively moved to midline and in a straight position. This also resolves as the infant's musculoskeletal system matures. Pes planus (flat feet) is noted in infants when they begin to walk. The long arch of the foot is not yet developed and makes contact with the floor, resulting in a medial bulge. As the child grows and the muscles become less lax, the arch generally develops. Some children may continue with flexible flat feet, and this is considered a normal variation. FIGURE 23.3 Genu valgum (knock-knees): note knees touching at midline and outward angle of the lower half of the legs. Take Note! Fractures are rare in children younger than 1 year of age. Carefully evaluate the infant who presents with a fracture for child abuse or an underlying musculoskeletal disorder (Grewal & Ahier, 2010).COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS A variety of medications as well as other medical treatments are used to treat musculoskeletal disorders in children. Most of these treatments will require a physician's or nurse practitioner's order when the child is in the hospital. The most common treatments and medications are listed in Common Medical Treatments 23.1 and Drug Guide 23.1 . The nurse caring for the child with a musculoskeletal disorder should become familiar with what the procedures are, how they work, and common nursing implications related to use of these modalities. The treatment of musculoskeletal disorders often involves immobilization via casting, bracing, splinting, or traction to allow healing with the bones in appropriate alignment. The length of treatment with these immobilization methods varies from weeks to months depending on the type of disorder being treated and its severity. Complications related to casting and traction include neurovascular compromise, skin integrity impairment, soft tissue injury, compartment syndrome , and, with skeletal traction, pin site infection or osteomyelitis. Casts Casts are used to immobilize a bone that has been injured or a diseased joint. When a fracture has occurred, a cast serves to hold the bone in reduction, thus preventing deformity as the fracture heals. Casts are constructed of a hard material, traditionally plaster but now more commonly fiberglass. The hard nature of the cast keeps the bone aligned so that healing may occur more quickly. In a fracture that would heal on its own without specific immobilization, a cast may be used to reduce pain and to allow the child increased mobility. The choice of cast material and type of cast will be determined by the physician or nurse practitioner or orthopedic surgeon. Figure 23.4 shows selected casts used in children. Take Note! Gore-Tex is a special material that can be used to line casts and make them waterproof. These casts can get completely wet in the bath, in the shower, or during swimming. These casts cannot be used for all types of fractures, fractures where skin pins are in place under the cast, or recently manipulated fractures (Cincinnati's Children's, 2007). These casts also have an increased cost that may not be covered by insurance. Traction Traction , another common method of immobilization, may be used to reduce and/or immobilize a fracture, to align an injured extremity, and to allow the extremity to be restored to its normal length. Traction may also reduce pain by decreasing the incidence of muscle spasm. In running traction, the weight pulls directly on the extremity in only one plane. This may be achieved with either skin or skeletal traction. In balanced suspension traction, additional weights are used to provide a counterbalance to the force of traction. This allows for constant pull on the extremity even if the child changes position somewhat. Comparison Chart 23.1 discusses skin versus skeletal traction. External Fixation External fixation may be used for complicated fractures, especially open fractures with soft tissue damage. A series of pins or wires are inserted into bone and then attached to an external frame. The fixator apparatus may be adjusted as needed by the physician or nurse practitioner. Once the desired level of correction is achieved, no further adjustment occurs and the bone is allowed to heal. Advantages of external fixation include increased comfort for the injured child and improved function of muscles and joints when complicated fracture occurs. NURSING PROCESS OVERVIEW FOR THE CHILD WITH A MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDER Care of the child with a musculoskeletal disorder includes assessment, nursing diagnosis, planning, interventions, and evaluation. There are a number of general concepts related to the nursing process that may be applied to musculoskeletal dysfunction in children. The nursing care of immobilized children is similar to that of adults, yet developmental and age-appropriate effects must be taken into account. Prevention of complications is a key nursing function. Nursing Care Plan 23.1 gives interventions related to prevention of complications. Particular care related to casts, traction, and fixators is discussed below. Assessment Assessment of musculoskeletal dysfunction in children includes health history, physical examination, and laboratory and diagnostic testing. Remember Dakota, the 2-year-old with right arm pain and refusal to use his arm? What additional health history and physical examination assessment information should the nurse obtain? Health HistoryThe health history consists of the past medical history, family history, and history of present illness (when the symptoms started and how they have progressed), as well as treatments used at home. The past medical history might be significant for musculoskeletal congenital anomaly or orthopedic injury during the birthing process. Breech delivery may be associated with developmental dysplasia of the hip. Determine history related to attainment of developmental milestones, such as walking and whether or not the child participates in sports. Inquire about the child's usual level of physical activity, participation in sports, and use of protective equipment. Family history may be positive for orthopedic problems. When eliciting the history of the present illness, inquire about the following: Limp or other changes in gait Recent trauma (determine the mechanism of injury) Recent strenuous exercise Fever Weakness Alteration in muscle tone Areas of redness or swelling Physical Examination Physical examination of the musculoskeletal system consists of inspection, observation, and palpation. INSPECTION AND OBSERVATION Observe the child's posture and alignment of the trunk. Inspect the extremities for symmetry and positioning and for absence, duplication, or webbing of any digits. Note any obvious extremity deformity or limb-length discrepancy. Inspect the skin for redness, warmth, bruises, and puncture sites. Observe gait in the child who has achieved the developmental skill of walking. Note refusal to walk, limping, in-toeing, out-toeing, or foot slap. Inspect injured joints for ecchymosis or swelling. In the injured extremity, note the color of the fingertips or toes. Observe spontaneous range of motion. Perform scoliosis screening to determine spinal alignment. Note symmetry of thigh folds. PALPATION Palpate the clavicles in the newborn or young infant for tenderness or a bump that indicates callus formation with clavicle fracture. Perform active range of motion to determine if a joint position is fixed (e.g., clubfoot). Palpate the affected joint or extremity to detect warmth or tenderness. In the injured child or the child with a cast or splint, thoroughly assess the neurovascular status of the affected extremities. Palpate the fingers or toes for warmth. Determine the capillary refill time. Note the presence of sensation or motion. Evaluate muscle strength. Palpate pulses distal to the injury, noting their strength and quality. Perform the Ortolani and Barlow maneuvers (see section on developmental dysplasia of the hip later in this chapter) to assess for developmental dysplasia of the hip. Take Note! Assess the injured site last, and do so gently. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 23.1 explains the laboratory and diagnostic tests most commonly used when considering musculoskeletal disorders. The tests can assist the physician or nurse practitioner in diagnosing a disorder and/or be used as guidelines in determining ongoing treatment. Some of the tests are obtained by laboratory or nonnursing personnel, while others might be obtained by the nurse. In either instance the nurse should be familiar with how the tests are obtained, what they are used for, and normal versus abnormal results. This knowledge will also be necessary when providing child and family education related to the tests. Nursing Diagnoses, Goals, Interventions, and Evaluation Upon completion of a thorough assessment, the nurse might identify several nursing diagnoses, including: Pain (see Chapter 14 ) Impaired physical mobility Risk for constipation Self-care deficit (specify) Risk for impaired skin integrity Deficient knowledge (specify) Risk for delayed development After completing an assessment of Dakota, the nurse noted the following: the history revealed that he had been sledding with his older brother the day before. Upon examination, bruising and swelling of the right arm are noted, with point tenderness at the wrist. Based on the assessment findings, what would your top three nursing diagnoses be for Dakota? Nursing goals, interventions, and evaluation for the child with musculoskeletal dysfunction are based on the nursing diagnoses (see Nursing Care Plan 23.1 ). Nursing Care Plan 23.1 may be used as a guide in planning nursing care for the child with a musculoskeletal disorder. The care plan includes many nursing diagnoses that are applicable to the child or adolescent. Children's responses to musculoskeletal dysfunction and its treatment will vary, and nursing care should be individualized based on the child's and family's responses to illness. The nursing care of immobilized children is similar to that of adults, but developmental and age-appropriate effects must be taken into account. Prevention of complications is a key nursing function. Refer to Nursing Care Plan 23.1 for interventions related to prevention of complications. Additional information about nursing care related to certain disorders will be included later in the chapter as it relates to specific disorders. Refer to Chapter 14 for nursing interventions related to pain management. Particular care related to casts, traction, and external fixation is discussed below. Based on your top three nursing diagnoses for Dakota, describe appropriate nursing interventions.Assisting With Cast Application Before cast or splint application, perform baseline neurovascular assessment for comparison after immobilization. Include: Color (note cyanosis or other discoloration) Movement (note inability to move fingers or toes) Sensation (note whether loss of sensation is present) Edema Quality of pulses Enlist the cooperation of the child and reduce his or her fear by showing the child the cast materials and using an age-appropriate approach to describe cast application. Premedicate as ordered to reduce pain when manual traction is applied to align the bone. Use distraction throughout cast application and assist with application of the cast or splint ( Fig. 23.5 ). Take Note! Modern fiberglass cast materials are available in a variety of colors, as well as a few patterns. Allowing the child to choose the color will increase the child's cooperation with the procedure. After the cast or splint is applied, drying time will vary based on the type of material used. Splints and fiberglass casts usually take only a few minutes to dry and will cause a very warm feeling inside the cast, so warn the child that it will begin to feel very warm. Plaster requires 24 to 48 hours to dry. Take care not to cause depressions in the plaster cast while drying, as those may cause skin pressure and breakdown. Instruct the child and family to keep the cast still, positioning it with pillows as needed. Caring for the Child With a Cast Perform frequent neurovascular checks of the casted extremity to identify signs of compromise early. These signs include: Increased pain Increased edema Pale or blue color Skin coolness Numbness or tingling Prolonged capillary refill Decreased pulse strength (or absence of pulse) Notify the physician or nurse practitioner of changes in neurovascular status or odor or drainage from the cast. Fiberglass casts usually have a soft fabric edge, so they usually do not cause skin rubbing at the edges of the cast. On the other hand, plaster casts require special treatment of the cast edge to prevent skin rubbing. This may be accomplished through a technique called petaling: cut rounded-edge strips of moleskin or another soft material with an adhesive backing and apply them to the edge of cast, as shown in Figure 23.6 . Take Note! If a cast is lined with Gore-Tex do not petal it. Position the child with the casted extremity elevated on pillows. Ice may be applied during the first 24 to 48 hours after casting if needed. Teaching the child to use crutches is an important nursing intervention for any child with lower extremity immobilization so that the child can maintain mobility ( Fig. 23.7 ). Provide home care instructions to the family about cast care. (See Teaching Guidelines 23.1 .) Take Note! Persistent complaints of pain may indicate compromised skin integrity under the cast. Assisting With Cast Removal Children may be frightened by cast removal. Prepare the child using age-appropriate terminology: The cast cutter will make a loud noise ( Fig. 23.8 ). The skin or extremity will not be injured (demonstrate by touching the cast cutter lightly to your palm). The child will feel warmth or vibration during cast removal. Teaching Guidelines 23.2 gives instructions related to skin care after cast removal. Caring for the Child in Traction Nursing care of the child in any type of traction focuses not only on appropriate application and maintenance of traction but also on promoting normal growth and development and preventing complications (see Table 23.1 ). Apply skin traction over intact skin only so that the pull of the traction is effective. Prepare the skin with an appropriate adhesive before applying the traction tapes to ensure that the tapes adhere well, preventing skin friction. After application of the traction tapes, apply the elastic bandage or use the foam boot. Attach the traction spreader block and then apply the prescribed amount of weight via a rope attached to the spreader block. Ensure that the rope moves without obstruction and that the weights hang freely without touching the floor. In skeletal traction, apply weight via ropes attached to the skeletal pins. Treat the pin sites as surgical wounds (see section on pin site care). Protect the exposed ends of the pins to avoid injury. Whether skin or skeletal traction is used, be sure that constant and even traction is maintained. Take Note! Avoid sudden bumping or movement of the bed: this can disturb traction alignment and cause additional pain to the child as the weights are jostled. Preventing Complications Refer to Nursing Care Plan 23.1 for interventions related to pain management and prevention of complications of immobility such as skin integrity impairment. To prevent contractures and atrophy that may result from disuse of muscles, ensure that unaffected extremities are exercised. Assist the child to exercise the unaffected joints and to use the unaffected extremity if this does not disrupt traction alignment. Promote use of a trapeze if not contraindicated to involve the child in repositioning and assist with movement. Encourage deep-breathing exercises to prevent the pulmonary complications of long-term immobilization. Promote normal growth and development by: Placing age-appropriate toys within the child's reach Encouraging visits from friends Providing diversional activities such as drawing, coloring, or video games ( Fig. 23.9 ) Take Note! Ongoing, careful neurovascular assessments are critical in the child with a cast or in skeletal traction. Notify the physician or nurse practitioner immediately if these signs of compartment syndrome occur: extreme pain (out of proportion to the situation), pain with passive range of motion of digits, distal extremity pallor, inability to move digits, or loss of pulses. Caring for the Child With an External Fixator Care of an external fixator involves maintaining skin integrity, preventing infection, and preventing injury. Routine neurovascular and skin assessment is essential. Skin care is similar to a child in skeletal traction and includes pin care daily. Elevation of the extremity can help prevent swelling. The fixator may be moved by grasping the frame, as the fixator can tolerate ordinary movement. Encourage weight bearing as prescribed. Provide appropriate education to the child and family. Encourage the child to look at the apparatus. Teach the child not to pick or manipulate the pins. Baggy or loose clothing can be worn over the device. Velcro sewn into the seams can be helpful and allows clothes to slip over the device. Providing Pin Care Whether pins are inserted for skeletal traction or as part of an external fixator (see section on fractures), keeping the pin sites clean is important to prevent infection. (See Evidence-Based Practice 23.1 .) Cleaning of the pin sites prevents infection by promoting comfort and preventing healing skin from adhering to the metal pin. Notify the orthopedic surgeon if signs of pin site infection are present or if pin slippage occurs. Thus far, there is insufficient evidence that supports a particular strategy of pin care. More randomized trials are needed. The National Association of Orthopaedic Nurses has published minimal guidelines, which include: Perform pin care daily or weekly after the first 48 to 72 hours. The most effective solution for pin site care may be chlorhexidine 2 mg/mL. Teach children and their families pin site care along with instructions on the signs and symptoms of infection before discharge (Holmes, Brown, & Pin Site Care Expert Panel, 2005). Since the research available is minimal, these recommendations are made tentatively (Holmes et al., 2005). Therefore, interventions for pin care need to be individualized based on the child's condition and response to treatment and according to institutional policy or the physician's or nurse practitioner's orders. Certain physicians or nurse practitioners prefer the site to be cleaned with normal saline; others choose a solution with antibacterial properties. Some institutions recommend removal of all crusts formed on the skin around the pin; others do not. The rationale for crust removal is to promote free drainage and prevent the surrounding skin from adhering to the pin. A keyhole dressing may be necessary around the pin if drainage is present. No matter which procedure is ordered or preferred, perform pin care as necessary to prevent infection at the pin site. The Ilizarov fixator uses wires that are thinner than ordinary pins, so simply cleansing by showering is usually sufficient to keep the pin site clean. If drainage is present, cleanse the skin around the wires with a dry gauze pad.CONGENITAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS Congenital anomalies of the musculoskeletal system are usually readily identified at birth. Congenital structural anomalies involving the skeleton include pectus developmental anomaly that may be diagnosed at birth or later in life is developmental dysplasia of the hip. A muscular condition, torticollis, most often presents as a congenital condition but may also develop after birth. Tibia vara is a developmental disorder affecting young children. Rarely, a developmental positional alteration such as genu varum, genu valgum, or pes planus will persist past the usual age of resolution or cause the child pain. If those situations occur, bracing, orthotics, or surgical correction may become necessary.

NURSING CARE PLAN 23.1 Overview for the Child With a Musculoskeletal Disorder NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Impaired physical mobility related to injury, pain, or weakness as evidenced by inability to move an extremity, to ambulate, or to move without limitations Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will engage in physical activities within limits of injury or disease: child will assist with transfers and positioning in bed and/or participate in prescribed bed exercises. Intervention: Maximizing Physical Mobility Assess child's ability to move based on injury or disease and within limits of prescribed treatment to determine baseline. Prior to prescribed exercise or major position changes, ensure that pain medication is given: relief of pain increases child's ability to tolerate and participate in activity. Use passive and active range-of-motion exercises and teach child and family how to perform them to facilitate joint mobility and muscle development (active ROM) and to help increase mobility (within limits of restrictions related to injury or prescribed treatment). Collaborate with physical therapy and occupational therapy as needed to provide child and family with appropriate exercises and methods to promote mobility. Support therapy activities by using same equipment and technique to help rehabilitate musculoskeletal deficits, improve mobility, and allow for maximum functioning. Praise accomplishments and emphasize child's abilities to improve self-esteem and encourage feelings of confidence and competence. Teach child and family necessary care related to mobility issues so the family can continue with these measures at home. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Risk for constipation related to immobility and/or use of narcotic analgesics Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will demonstrate adequate stool passage, will pass soft, formed stool every 1 to 3 days without straining or other adverse effects. Intervention: Promoting Appropriate Bowel Elimination Assess usual pattern of stooling to determine baseline and identify potential problems with elimination. Palpate for abdominal fullness and auscultate for bowel sounds to assess for bowel function and presence of constipation. Encourage fiber intake to increase frequency of stools. Ensure adequate fluid intake to prevent formation of hard, dry stools. Encourage activity within child's limits or restrictions as even minimal activity increases peristalsis. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Self-care deficit related to immobility as evidenced by inability to perform hygiene care and transfer self independently Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will demonstrate ability to care for self within age parameters and limits of disease: child is able to feed, dress, and manage elimination within limits of injury or disease and age. Intervention: Maximizing Self-Care Introduce child and family to self-help methods as soon as possible to promote independence from the beginning. Encourage family and staff to allow child to do as much as possible to allow child to gain confidence and independence. Collaborate with physical therapy and occupational therapy as needed to provide child and family with appropriate tools to modify environment and methods to promote transferring and self-care to allow for maximum functioning. Praise accomplishments and emphasize child's abilities to improve self-esteem and encourage feelings of confidence and competence. Balance activity with periods to rest to reduce fatigue and increase energy available for self-care. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Risk for impaired skin integrity related to immobility, casting, traction, use of braces or adaptive devices Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child's skin will remain intact, without evidence of redness or breakdown. Intervention: Promoting Skin Integrity Monitor condition of entire skin surface at least daily to provide baseline and allow for early identification of areas at risk. Avoid excessive friction or harsh cleaning products that may increase risk of breakdown in child with susceptible skin. Keep child's skin free from stool and urine to decrease risk of breakdown. Keep linen clean, dry, and free from food crumbs and wrinkles to prevent pressure areas from forming. Change child's position frequently to decrease pressure on susceptible areas. Monitor condition of skin affected by braces or adaptive equipment frequently to prevent skin breakdown related to poor fit. For the child in traction: Pad bony prominences with cotton padding before applying traction to protect skin from injury. Gently massage child's back and sacrum with lotion to stimulate circulation. For the child in a spica cast: Apply plastic wrap to the perineal edges of the cast to prevent soiling of cast edges, which can contribute to cast breakdown. Use a fracture bedpan to facilitate toileting without soiling cast. For the child still in diapers, tuck a smaller diaper under the perineal edges of cast and cover with a larger diaper to prevent cast soiling. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Deficient knowledge related to cast care, activity restrictions, or other prescribed treatment as evidenced by verbalization, questions, or actions demonstrating lack of understanding regarding child's condition or care Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child and family will demonstrate accurate understanding about condition and course of treatment through verbalization and return demonstration. Intervention: Providing Child and Family Teaching Assess child's and family's willingness to learn: child and family must be willing to learn for teaching to be effective. Provide teaching at an appropriate level for the child and family (depends on age of child, physical condition, memory) to ensure understanding. Teach in short sessions: many short sessions are more helpful than one long session. Repeat information to give family and child time to learn and understand. Provide reinforcement and rewards to facilitate the teaching/learning process. Use multiple modes of learning involving many senses (provide written, verbal, demonstration, and videos) when possible: child and family are more likely to retain information when presented in different ways using many senses. NURSING DIAGNOSIS Risk for delayed development related to immobility, alterations in extremities Outcome Identification and Evaluation Development will be enhanced: child will make continued progress toward developmental milestones and will not show regression in abilities. Intervention: Promoting Development Screen for developmental capabilities to determine child's current level of functioning. Offer age-appropriate toys, play, and activities (including gross motor) to encourage further development. Perform exercises or interventions as prescribed by physical or occupational therapist: repeat participation in those activities helps to promote function and acquisition of developmental skills. Provide support to families: immobility and extremity deficits may lead to slow progress in achieving developmental milestones, so ongoing motivation is needed.FIGURE 23.7 Reinforce appropriate crutch walking for children with lower extremity immobilization. Teaching Guidelines 23.1 HOME CAST CARE For the first 48 hours, elevate the extremity above the level of the heart and apply cold therapy for 20 to 30 minutes, then off 1 hour, and repeat. Assess for swelling, and have the child wiggle the fingers or toes hourly. For itching inside the cast: Never insert anything into the cast for the purposes of scratching. Blow cool air in from a hair dryer set on the lowest setting or tap lightly on the cast. Do not use lotions or powders. Protect the cast from wetness. Apply a plastic bag around cast and tape securely for bathing or showering. Continue to avoid placing the cast directly in water (unless it is Gore-Tex lined). Cover it when your child eats or drinks. If a cast become soiled it can be wiped clean with a slightly damp clean cloth. If the cast gets wet, dry it with a blow dryer on the cold setting (if warm setting is used the child could get burned). If the child has a large cast, change position every 2 hours during the day and while sleeping change position as often as possible. Check the skin for irritation. Press the skin back around edges of the cast. Use a flashlight to look for reddened or irritated areas. Feel for blisters or sores. Call the physician or nurse practitioner if: The casted extremity is cool to the touch, pale, blue, or very swollen. The child cannot move the fingers or toes. Severe pain occurs when the child attempts to move the fingers or toes. Persistent numbness or tingling occurs. Drainage or a foul smell comes from under the cast. Severe itching occurs inside the cast. The child runs a fever greater than 101.5\u00b0F for longer than 24 hours. Skin edges are red and swollen or exhibit breakdown. Child complains of rubbing or burning under cast. The cast gets wet or is cracked, split, or softened. Adapted from Bowden, V. R., & Greenberg, C. S. (2008). Pediatric nursing procedures.

Teaching Guidelines 23.2 SKIN CARE AFTER CAST REMOVAL Brown, flaky skin is normal and occurs as dead skin and secretions accumulate under the cast. New skin may be tender. Soak with warm water daily. Wash with warm soapy water, avoiding excessive rubbing, which may traumatize the skin. Discourage the child from scratching the dry skin. Apply moisturizing lotion to relieve dry skin. Encourage activity to regain strength and motion of extremity.FIGURE 23.9 Provide age-appropriate diversional activities and schoolwork for children confined to bed in traction. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 23.1 PIN SITE CLEANING METHODS AND INFECTION PREVENTION STUDY External fixation (metal pins) is used to immobilize bones while fractures heal. By the nature of pin insertion into the bone, pin sites place the child at risk for development of an infection. Numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of pin site care. To date, pin site care is usually determined by physician, nurse practitioner, or institution preference. The authors reviewed randomized controlled studies that evaluated the effect on infection and other complication rates of different methods of cleansing or dressing of pin sites. The interventions reviewed compared any type of cleaning method versus no cleaning, different cleansing solutions, site care performed daily or weekly, and varying dressing regimens. Findings The results were inconclusive. No particular method of pin site care was determined to be statistically significant in reducing infection or other complication rates from orthopedic pins. Nursing Implications Despite the lack of clear insight from this study, it remains important for nurses to continue vigilance regarding pin site care. Ongoing assessment of pin sites for signs of infection and monitoring of the child's temperature are particularly important. Provide pin site care according to the physician's or nurse practitioner's preference or institution's protocol. With the lack of conclusive evidence related to pin site care, nurses caring for orthopedic children with orthopedic disorders are in a prime position to develop and execute a well-designed research study related to pin site care.Adapted from Lethaby, A., Temple, J., & Santy, J. (2008). Pin site care for preventing infections associated with external bone fixators and pins. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 4. Retrieved July 31, 2010, from http://www2.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab004551.html Pectus Excavatum Pectus a funnel-shaped chest, accounts for 90% of all congenital chest wall deformities (Boas, 2007). A depression that sinks inward is apparent at the xiphoid process ( Fig. 23.10 ). Pectus carinatum, a protuberance the chest wall, accounts for only 5% to 15% of anterior chest wall deformities (Boas, 2007). The remainder are mixed deformities. Male predominance is evident in both types (Boas, 2007). Pectus excavatum does not resolve as the child grows; rather, it progresses with growth. The chest depression may be minimal or marked. When the pectus is more pronounced, cardiac and pulmonary compression occurs. Symptoms of this compression most often present during puberty, when the pectus quickly worsens. Children may complain of shortness of breath, withdraw from physical activities, and have a poor body image. Therapeutic Management Therapeutic management of pectus excavatum is based on the severity and physiologic compromise. Options include observation, use of physical therapy to work on musculoskeletal compromise, and surgical correction, preferably before puberty, when the skeleton is more pliable. Various surgical techniques may be used and generally involve either the placement of a surgical steel bar or using a piece of bone in the rib cage to lift the depression. This discussion will focus on care of the child who undergoes surgical steel bar placement for pectus correction. FIGURE 23.10 Pectus excavatum: note the depression in the chest wall at the xiphoid process. Nursing Assessment Elicit the health history, noting progression of the defect and effects on the child's cardiopulmonary function. Note shortness of breath, exercise intolerance, or chest pain. Observe the child's chest for anterior wall deformity, noting depth and severity. Auscultate the lungs to determine the adequacy of aeration. Radiographs, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to determine the extent of the anomaly and compression of inner structures. Nursing ManagementPrepare the child preoperatively by allowing a tour of the surgical area and the pediatric intensive care unit. Introduce the child to the pain scale that will be used in the postoperative period. Postoperatively, nursing management focuses on assessment, protection of the surgical site, and pain management. Auscultate lung sounds frequently to determine the adequacy of aeration and to monitor for development of the complication of pneumothorax. Assess for signs of wound infection that would necessitate removal of the curved bar. During the first few postoperative days positioning is challenging; do not allow the child to roll in bed, lie on either side, or rotate or flex the spine (these positions may disrupt the bar's position). Administer analgesics as needed either intravenously or via the epidural catheter. Teach families that the child will not be allowed to lie on his or her side at home for 4 weeks after the surgery to ensure that the band does not shift. Encourage aerobic activity at home after being cleared by the surgeon (this will increase the child's vital capacity, previously hindered by the pectus). The bar will be removed 2 to 4 years after the initial placement. Limb Deficiencies Limb deficiencies, either complete absence of a limb or a portion of it or deformity, occur as the fetus is developing. These defects are attributed to an amniotic band constricting the limb, resulting in either incomplete development or amputation of the limb. Many children born with limb deformities also have congenital anomalies such as craniofacial abnormalities and and (Morrissy, Giavedoni, & Coulter-O'Berry, 2006; Polousky & Eilert, 2009). Therapeutic management is aimed at improving the child's functional ability. Physical therapy and occupational therapy may be helpful. Adaptive equipment such as a prosthesis may also be prescribed. Nursing Assessment Note the extent of limb deformity, providing an accurate description of the presence or absence of a portion of the arm or leg, or missing fingers or toes. Assess the child's ability to use the extremity as a helper (arms) or in ambulation (legs). Determine status of acquisition of developmental skills. Nursing Management Reinforce prescribed activities that are meant to improve the child's function. Provide activities in which the child is capable of participating. If the limb deficiency is significant, refer the infant to the local early intervention office as soon as possible after birth. Early intervention, available in all 50 states, is designed to promote development from birth to age 3 years. Absence of a limb or a significant portion of a limb will have a considerable impact on the child's ability to meet developmental milestones as expected. Polydactyly/Syndactyly Polydactyly is the presence of extra digits on the hand or foot ( Fig. 23.11 ). It affects African Americans more frequently (Kaneshiro & Zieve, 2009). One third of the time, polydactyly occurs in both the hand and foot (Hosalkar, Spiegel, & Davidson, 2007). It usually involves digits at the border of the hand or foot, but can also occur by a central digit (Hosalkar, Spiegel, et al., 2007). Syndactyly is webbing of the fingers and toes. Both polydactyly and syndactyly can be inherited and associated with other genetic syndromes (Cornwall, 2007; Hosalkar, Spiegel, et al., 2007; Kaneshiro & Zieve, 2009).FIGURE 23.11 Note additional digits (toes) of polydactyly. Therapeutic management includes tying off the additional digit until it falls off or surgical removal of the digit. No treatment is usually required for syndactyly, though surgical repair is sometimes performed for cosmetic reasons. Nursing Assessment Inspect the hands and feet for the presence of extra digits. Note whether the additional digits are soft (without bone) or are full or partial digits with bone present. Note location of webbing. Nursing Management If the digit is tied off, observe for expected necrosis of tissue and eventually loss of the extra digit. When surgical removal is necessary, provide routine pre- and postoperative care as appropriate. Metatarsus Adductus Metatarsus adductus, a medial deviation of the forefoot, is one of the most common foot deformities of childhood ( Fig. 23.12 ). It occurs most commonly as a result of in utero positioning (Hosalkar, Spiegel, et al., 2007). Half of all cases occur bilaterally (Hosalkar, Spiegel, et al., 2007). The degree of flexibility is important and determines treatment. If the forefoot is flexible past neutral manipulation passively, observation is often sufficient. If the forefoot is flexible only to neutral manipulation, stretching exercises may be beneficial. If the forefoot is rigid and is not flexible to neutral manipulation, serial casting, preferably before the age of 8 months, may be required (Hosalkar, Spiegel, et al., 2007). Surgical intervention is rarely needed.FIGURE 23.12 Metatarsus adductus: note medial deviation of the forefoot Nursing Assessment The deformity is usually noted at birth. Note inward deviation of the forefoot. The great and second toes might be separated. Determine forefoot flexibility. Range of motion of the ankle, hindfoot, and midfoot is normal in all three types. Accompanying hip dysplasia may be seen; therefore, careful examination of the hips is warranted (Hosalkar, Gholve, & Wells, 2007). Nursing Management Nursing care for children with type I and II metatarsus adductus is aimed at education and reassurance of the parents. Nursing care for the child with type III metatarsus adductus is similar to that of the child with clubfoot (see below). Congenital Clubfoot congenital anomaly that occurs in 1 of 1,000 live births (Hosalkar, Spiegel, et al., 2007). Clubfoot consists (plantarflexion of the foot; the heel is raised and would not strike the ground in a standing position) Cavus (plantarflexion of the forefoot on the hindfoot) Forefoot adduction with supination (the forefoot is inverted and turned slightly upward) The foot resembles the head of a golf club ( Fig. 23.13 ). Half of all cases occur bilaterally (Hosalkar, Spiegel, et al., 2007). Males are affected more frequently than females (Gunta, 2009; Hosalkar, Spiegel, et al., 2007). The exact etiology of clubfoot is unknown.FIGURE 23.13 Note inverted heel, ankle equinus, and forefoot adduction in this infant with bilateral clubfoot. may idiopathic. Postural clubfoot short series of manipulative casting. Neurogenic clubfoot occurs in infants with myelomeningocele. Clubfoot in association with other syndromes (syndromic) is often resistant to treatment. Idiopathic clubfoot occurs in otherwise normal healthy infants. The approach to treatment is similar regardless of the classification. Therapeutic Management The goal of therapeutic management of clubfoot is achievement of a functional foot; treatment starts as soon after birth as possible. Weekly manipulation with serial cast changes is performed; later, cast changes occur every 2 weeks. Other infants require corrective shoes or bracing. In some infants surgical release of soft tissue may be necessary. Following surgery, the foot is immobilized with a cast for up to 12 weeks, and then ankle-foot orthoses or corrective shoes are used for several years. Complications of clubfoot and its treatment include residual deformity, rocker-bottom foot, awkward gait, weight bearing on the lateral portion of the foot if uncorrected, and disturbance to the epiphysis. Nursing Assessment Note family history of foot deformities and obstetric history of breech position. Inspect the foot for position at rest. Perform active range of motion, noting inability to move foot into normal positioning at midline. Radiographs are obtained to determine bony abnormality and note progress during treatment. Nursing Management Perform neurovascular assessment and cast care for infants requiring casting. Provide emotional support, as treatment often begins in the newborn period and families may have a difficult time adjusting to the diagnosis and treatment required for their new baby. Teach families cast care and about the use of orthotics or braces as prescribed. Osteogenesis Imperfecta Osteogenesis imperfecta is a genetic bone disorder that results in low bone mass, increased fragility of the bones, and other connective tissue problems such as joint hypermobility, resulting in instability of the joints. All of these contribute to fracture occurrence. Dentinogenesis imperfecta may also occur. This is characterized by the tooth enamel wearing easily and brittle and discolored teeth. The disorder usually occurs as a result of a defect in the collagen type 1 gene, usually through an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern but some types are inherited in a recessive manner (Gunta, 2009). The types of osteogenesis imperfecta range from mild to severe connective tissue and bone involvement ( Table 23.2 ). Subtypes A and B exist depending on (A) the absence or (B) thepresence of dentinogenesis imperfecta (Marini, 2007). In children with moderate to severe disease, fractures are more likely to occur, and short stature is common. In addition to multiple fractures, additional complications include early hearing loss, acute and chronic pain, scoliosis, and respiratory problems. Take Note! Blue sclera is not diagnostic of osteogenesis imperfecta, but it is a common finding (Gunta, 2009). However, there are some individuals with blue sclerae who do not have osteogenesis imperfecta. Keep in mind that the sclerae of newborns tend to be bluish, progressing to white over the first few weeks of life. Therapeutic Management The goal of medical and surgical management is to decrease the incidence of fractures and maintain mobility. Bisphosphonate administration is used for moderate to severe disease. Fracture care is often required. Physical therapy and occupational therapy prevent contractures and maximize mobility. Standing with bracing is encouraged. Lightweight splints or braces may allow the child to bear weight earlier. Severe cases may require surgical insertion of rods into the long bones. Nursing Assessment Elicit a health history, which may reveal a family history of osteogenesis imperfecta, a pattern of frequent fractures, or screaming associated with routine care and handling of the newborn. Inspect the eyes for sclerae that have a blue, purple, or gray tint. Note abnormalities of the primary teeth. Inspect skin for bruising and note joint hypermobility with active range of motion. Laboratory tests may include a skin biopsy (which reveals abnormalities in type 1 collagen) or DNA testing (locating the genetic mutation). Nursing ManagementHandle the child carefully and teach the family to avoid trauma ( Teaching Guidelines 23.3 ). Refer families to the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation (a link to which can be found on ), which provides access to multiple resources as well as clinical trials. An excellent book for families of children with osteogenesis imperfecta is Children With OI: Strategies to Enhance Performance by H. L. Cintas and L. H. Gerber. Teaching Guidelines 23.3 PREVENTING INJURY IN CHILDREN WITH OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA Never push or pull on an arm or leg. Do not bend an arm or leg into an awkward position. Lift a baby by placing one hand under the legs and buttocks and one hand under the shoulders, head, and neck. Do not lift a baby's legs by the ankles to change the diaper. Do not lift a baby or small child from under the armpits. Provide supported positioning. If fracture is suspected, handle the limb minimally. Encourage safe mobility. Reinforce physical and occupational therapists' recommendations for promotion of fine motor skills and independence in activities of daily living, as well as use of adaptive equipment and appropriate promotion of mobility. Adapted physical education is important to promote mobility and maintain bone and muscle mass. If the child is ambulatory, even with adaptive equipment use, walking is a good form of exercise. Swimming and water therapy are appropriate, allowing independent movement with little fracture risk. Take Note! Use caution when inserting an intravenous line or taking a blood pressure measurement, as pressure on the arm or leg can lead to bruising and fractures. Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) refers to abnormalities of the developing hip that include dislocation, subluxation, and dysplasia of the hip joint. In DDH, the femoral head has an abnormal relationship to the acetabulum. Frank dislocation of the hip may occur, in which there is no contact between the femoral head and acetabulum. Subluxation is a partial dislocation, meaning that the acetabulum is not fully seated within the hip joint. Dysplasia refers to an acetabulum that is shallow or sloping instead of cup shaped. DDH may affect just one or both hips. The dysplastic hip may be provoked to subluxation or dislocated and then reduced again ( Fig. 23.14 ). Pathophysiology While dislocation may occur during a growth period in utero, the laxity of the newborn's hip allows dislocation and relocation of the hip to occur. The hip can develop normally only if the femoral head is appropriately and deeply seated within the acetabulum. If subluxation and periodic or continued dislocation occur, then structural changes in the hip's anatomy occur. Continued dysplasia of the hip leads to limited abduction of the hip and contracture of muscles. DDH is more common in females, probably due to the greater susceptibility of the female newborn to maternal hormones that contribute to laxity of the ligaments (Hosalkar, Horn, et al., 2007). Mechanical factors such as breech positioning or the presence of oligohydramnios also contribute to the development of DDH. Genetic factors also play a role: there is an increased incidence of DDH among persons of Native American and Eastern Europe descent, with very low rates among people of African or Chinese heritage (Hosalkar, Horn, et al., 2007). Complications of DDH include avascular necrosis of the femoral head, loss of range of motion, recurrently unstable hip, femoral nerve palsy, leg-length discrepancy, and early osteoarthritis.FIGURE 23.14 Developmental dysplasia of the hip. Therapeutic Management The goal of therapeutic management is to maintain the hip joint in reduction so that the femoral head and acetabulum can develop properly. Treatment varies based on the child's age and the severity of DDH. Infants younger than 4 to 6 months of age may be treated with a Pavlik harness, which reduces and stabilizes the hip by preventing hip extension and adduction and maintaining the hip in flexion and abduction (Hosalkar, Horn, et al., 2007; Polousky & Eilert, 2009). The Pavlik harness is successful in the treatment of DDH in the majority of infants younger than 6 months of age if it is used on a full-time basis and applied properly (Weinstein, 2006). Children from 4 months to 2 years of age often require closed reduction (Hosalkar, Horn, et al., 2007; Polousky & Eilert, 2009). Skin or skeletal traction may be used first to gradually stretch the associated soft tissue structures. Closed reduction occurs under general anesthesia, with the hip being gently maneuvered back into the acetabulum. A spica cast worn for 12 weeks maintains reduction of the hip. After the cast is removed, the child must wear an abduction brace full time (except for baths) for 2 months (Hosalkar, Horn, et al., 2007). Then the brace is worn at night and during naps until development of the acetabulum is normal. Children older than 2 years of age or those who have failed to respond to prior treatment require an open surgical reduction followed by a period of casting (Hosalkar, Horn, et al., 2007; Weinstein, 2006). Follow-up continues until the age of skeletal maturity. Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment of children with DDH includes obtaining a health history and inspecting, observing, and palpating for findings common to DDH. Health History Assess the health history for risk factors such as: Family history of DDH Female gender Oligohydramnios or breech birth Native American or Eastern European descent Associated lower limb deformity, metatarsus adductus, hip asymmetry, torticollis, or other congenital musculoskeletal deformity Previously undiagnosed older children may complain of hip pain. Physical Assessment The physical examination for DDH includes inspection, observation, and palpation. Since DDH is a developmental process, ongoing screening assessments are required throughout at least the first several months of the infant's life.INSPECTION AND OBSERVATION Ensure that the infant is on a flat surface and is relaxed. Note asymmetry of thigh or gluteal folds with the infant in a prone position. Document shortening of the affected femur observed as limb-length discrepancy. Older children may exhibit Trendelenburg gait . Figure 23.15 illustrates these assessments. PALPATION Note limited hip abduction while performing passive range of motion. Abduction should ordinarily occur to 75 degrees and adduction to within 30 degrees with the infant's pelvis stabilized (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2000). Perform Barlow and Ortolani tests, feeling for, or noting, a \"clunk\" as the femoral head dislocates (positive Barlow) or reduces (positive Ortolani) back into the acetabulum. Force is not necessary when performing the Barlow and Ortolani maneuvers (see Fig. 23.15 and Nursing Procedure 23.1 ). Take Note! A higher-pitched \"click\" may occur with flexion or extension of the hip. When assessing for DDH, do not confuse this benign, adventitial sound with a true \"clunk.\" Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Ultrasound of the hip allows for visualization of the femoral head and the outer edge of the acetabulum. Plain hip radiographs may be used in the infant or child older than 6 months of age. Nursing Management Earlier recognition of hip dysplasia with earlier harness use results in better correction of the anomaly (Hosalker, Horn, Friedman, & Dormans, 2007). Excellent assessment skills and reporting of any abnormal findings are critical. Initially, the infant will need to wear the Pavlik harness continuously ( Fig. 23.16 ). The physician or nurse practitioner makes all appropriate adjustments to the harness when applied so that the hips are held in the optimal position for appropriate development. Teach parents use of the harness and assessment of the baby's skin. If started early, harness use usually continues for about 3 months ( Teaching Guidelines 23.4 ). Breastfeeding can continue throughout the harness treatment period, but creative positioning of the infant may be needed.FIGURE 23.15 Assessment techniques for developmental dysplasia of the hip. (A) Assess for asymmetry of thigh and gluteal folds. (B) Assess for unequal knee height related to femur shortening. (C) Note limitation in hip abduction. (D) Positive Trendelenburg sign: note pelvis/hip drops when leg is raised. (E) Feel for \"clunk\" when adduction and depression of femur dislocates hip (Barlow's test). Assess for \"clunk\" when the dislocated hip is abducted and relocated (Ortolani sign). Teaching Guidelines 23.4 CARING FOR A CHILD IN A PAVLIK HARNESS Do not adjust the straps without checking with the physician or nurse practitioner first. Until your physician or nurse practitioner instructs you to take the harness off for a period of time each day, it must be used continuously (for the first week or sometimes longer). Change your baby's diaper while he or she is in the harness. Place your baby to sleep on his or her back. Check skin folds, especially behind the knees and diaper area, for redness, irritation, or breakdown. Keep these areas clean and dry. Once the baby is permitted to be out of the harness for a short period, you may bathe your baby while the harness is off. Long knee socks and an undershirt are recommended to prevent rubbing of the skin against the brace. Note location of the markings on the straps for appropriate placement of the harness. Wash the harness with mild detergent by hand and air dry. If using the dryer, use only the air fluffing setting (no heat). Call the doctor if: Your baby's feet are swollen or bluish. The harness appears too small. Skin is raw or a rash develops. Your baby is unable to actively kick his or her legs. For infants or children diagnosed later than 6 months of age or those who do not improve with harness use, surgical reduction may be performed after a period of traction (Hosalkar, Horn, et al., 2007). Postoperative casting followed by bracing or orthotic use is common. Caring for the child in the postoperative period is similar to care of any child in a cast. Pain management and monitoring for bleeding are priority activities. Teach families care of the cast at home. NURSING PROCEDURE 23.1 Performing Ortolani and Barlow Maneuvers Purpose: To Detect Congenital Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip Ortolani Maneuver 1. Place the newborn in the supine position and flex the hips and knees to 90 degrees at the hip. 2. Grasp the inner aspect of the thighs and abduct the hips (usually to approximately 180 degrees) while applying upward pressure. 3. Listen for any sounds during the maneuver. There should be no \"clunk\" heard or felt when the legs are abducted. Such a sound indicates the femoral head hitting the acetabulum as the femoral head reenters the area. This suggests developmental hip dysplasia. Barlow Maneuver 1. With the newborn still lying supine and grasping the inner aspect of the thighs (as just mentioned), adduct the thighs while applying outward and downward pressure to the thighs.2. Feel for the femoral head slipping out of the acetabulum; also listen and feel for a \"clunk.\" FIGURE 23.16 Pavlik harness used to keep the knees flexed and hips abducted to allow the hips to grow normally in a child with developmental dysplasia of the hip. Tibia Vara (Blount Disease) Tibia vara (Blount disease) is a developmental disorder affecting young children. There are three types: infantile (1 to 3 years), juvenile (4 to 10 years), and adolescent (11 years or older) (Hosalkar, Gholve, et al., 2007). Infantile is the most common and is discussed here (Hosalkar, Gholve, et al., 2007). The normal physiologic bowing or genu varum becomes more pronounced in the child with tibia vara. The cause of tibia vara is unknown, but it is considered to be a developmental disorder because it occurs most frequently in children who are early walkers. Most cases occur in African American females and both extremities are affected (Hosalkar, Gholve, et al., 2007). In addition to early walking, obesity is also a risk factor. If left untreated, the growth plate of the upper tibia ceases boneproduction. Asymmetric growth at the knee then occurs and the bowing progresses. Severe degenerative arthritis of the knee is an additional long-term complication. FIGURE 23.17 Note extreme bowing of the legs in tibia vara. Therapeutic management is aimed at stopping the progression of the disease through bracing or surgical treatment. Medical or surgical treatment should begin early, before 4 years of age. Nursing Assessment Elicit a health history and determine the age at which the child started walking. Assess growth parameters to determine whether the risk factor of obesity is present. Note significant bowing of the legs while the child is standing and ambulating ( Fig. 23.17 ). Nursing Management Bracing may include a modified knee-ankle-foot orthosis that relieves the compression forces on the growth plate, allowing bone growth resumption and correction of bowlegs. To be successful, bracing must be continued for months to years and the brace must be worn 23 hours per day. Compliance is the most significant barrier to successful treatment. Parents have a difficult time forcing their toddler to stay in a brace that inhibits mobility for the bulk of the day (particularly a bilateral brace). Support parents by encouraging and praising their compliance with bracing. Teach parents to assess for potential skin impairment from brace rubbing. When surgical treatment is required, the leg(s) will be immobilized in a long-leg bent knee or spica cast after the osteotomy is performed. Perform routine cast care. Refer to Nursing Care Plan 23.1 for additional interventions related to care of the immobilized child. TorticollisTorticollis is a painless muscular condition presenting in infants or in children with certain syndromes. Congenital muscular torticollis may result from in utero positioning or difficult birth. Preferential turning of the head to one side while in the supine position after birth may also lead to torticollis. Torticollis results from tightness of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, resulting in the infant's head being tilted to one side. Therapeutic management involves passive stretching exercises. These exercises should be effective in 90% of cases of congenital torticollis, especially if treatment is started within the first 3 months of life (Spiegel, Hosalkar, Dormans, & Drommond, 2007). Physical therapy may be prescribed and a tubular orthosis for torticollis (TOT) collar may also be used. Medications used include baclofen and injection of botulinum toxin, which can provide temporary relief with repeat injections needed every 3 months (Vorvick & Zieve, 2010). Surgery is not common but may be done in the preschool years if other methods have been unsuccessful. Plagiocephaly may result from the continued pressure on the side of the skull to which the neck is turned. Nursing Assessment Note history of head tilt and infant's lack of desire to turn the head in the opposite direction. Observe the infant for wryneck (tilting of the head to one side; Fig. 23.18 ). Note limited movement of the neck while performing passive range of motion. Palpate the neck, noting a mass in the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the affected side. Examine the head for evidence of plagiocephaly. Accompanying hip dysplasia is seen in 20% of cases. Therefore, careful examination of the hips is warranted (Polousky & Eilert, 2009). Nursing Management Teach parents gentle neck-stretching exercises to be performed several times a day. While immobilizing the shoulder on the affected side, gently sustain a side-to-side stretch toward the unaffected side, holding the stretch for 10 to 30 seconds. Repeat 10 to 15 times per session. Perform an ear-to-shoulder stretch in a similar fashion. To prevent the development of torticollis in the unaffected infant, prevent positional plagiocephaly. Prevent flatness of one side of the head by varying the infant's head position, and do not always turn the infant's head to one side while he or she is in the infant seat, in the swing, or lying supine. Refer families to the Infant Torticollis Organization, a parent support network, and Torticollis Kids, links to which can be found on .FIGURE 23.18 Note wryneck or head tilt in the infant with torticollis.ACQUIRED DISORDERS Several acquired musculoskeletal disorders may affect children. Nutritional deficits or malabsorption of fats may lead to rickets. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis and Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease affect mainly school-age and adolescent boys. Osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and toxic synovitis are common infectious musculoskeletal disorders. Spinal curvature may occur as a result of a neuromuscular disorder or idiopathically. Rickets Rickets is a condition in which there is softening or weakening of the bones. Childhood rickets may occur as a result of nutritional deficiencies such as inadequate consumption of calcium or vitamin D or limited exposure to sunlight (required for adequate production of vitamin D). Rickets caused by vitamin D deficiency is a preventable condition but cases continue to be reported in infants, children, and adolescents (Wagner, Greer, & the Section on Breastfeeding and Committee on Nutrition, 2008). Rickets may also occur if the body cannot regulate calcium and phosphorus in the appropriate balance, such as in chronic renal disease. Gastrointestinal disorders in which fat absorption is altered (e.g., Crohn disease, celiac disease, and cystic fibrosis) may lead to rickets, as vitamin D is a fat- soluble vitamin. Calcium is primarily laid down in the bones of the fetus during the third trimester. Premature infants miss this period of calcium accumulation and also suffer from inadequate calcium intake in the neonatal period. Thus, premature infants often demonstrate rickets of prematurity. Regardless of the underlying cause, rickets is most likely to occur during periods of rapid growth. Vitamin D regulates calcium absorption from the small intestine and levels of calcium and phosphate in the bones. When calcium and phosphate levels in the blood are imbalanced, then calcium is released from the bones into the blood, resulting in loss of the supportive bony matrix. Therapeutic Management Treatment of rickets is aimed at correcting the calcium imbalance so that the skeleton may develop properly and without deformity. Calcium and phosphorus supplements are given, and some children also require vitamin D supplements. If rickets is not corrected while the child is still growing, permanent skeletal deformities and short stature may result. Take Note! The Academy of Pediatrics currently recommends all infants and children, including adolescents, have a minimum daily intake of 400 IU of vitamin D beginning soon after birth (Wagner et al., 2008). Nursing Assessment Obtain a health history, determining risk factors such as: Limited exposure to sunlight Strict vegetarian diet or lactose intolerance (either one without milk product ingestion) Exclusive breastfeeding by a mother who has a vitamin D deficiency Dark-pigmented skin Prematurity Malabsorptive gastrointestinal disorder Chronic renal disease Note history of fractures or bone pain. Observe for dental deformities and bowlegs. Decreased muscle tone may also be present. Note low serum calcium and phosphate levels and high alkaline phosphatase levels. Radiographs may show changes in the shape and structure of the bone. Nursing Management Administer calcium and phosphorus supplements at alternate times to promote proper absorption of both of these supplements. Encourage exposure to moderate amounts of sunlight and administer vitamin D supplements as prescribed. Teach families that good dietary sources of vitamin D are fish, liver, and processed milk.Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis Nursing Management Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is a condition in which the femoral head dislocates from the neck and shaft of the femur at the level of the epiphyseal plate. The epiphysis slips downward and backward. SCFE occurs most frequently in obese males, 12 to 15 years of age, and is more common in African American boys compared to Caucasians (Hosalkar, Horn, et al., 2007). The left hip is more often affected (Hosalkar, Horn, et al., 2007). The exact cause is unknown, but it is thought that during the teenage growth spurt the femoral growth plate weakens and becomes less resistant to stressors. Hormonal alterations during this period may also play a role (Horsalker, Horn, Friedman, & Dormans, 2007). SCFE is classified based on its severity and whether the slip is acute or chronic. Chronic SCFE may lead to shortening of the affected leg and thigh atrophy. Therapeutic Management Promptly refer the child with SCFE to an orthopedic surgeon, as early surgical intervention will decrease the risk of long-term deformity. The goals of therapeutic management are to prevent further slippage, minimize deformity, and avoid the complications of cartilage necrosis (chondrolysis) and avascular necrosis of the femoral head. Surgical intervention may include in situ pinning, in which a pin or screw is inserted percutaneously into the femoral head to hold it in place. Osteotomy may be used for more severe cases. Osteoarthritis may be a long-term complication of SCFE. Nursing Assessment Elicit a health history, determining the onset and extent of pain. In acute SCFE, the pain is usually sudden in onset and results in inability to bear weight. Chronic SCFE may present with an insidious onset of pain and limp. Note risk factors for SCFE, including age 9 to 16 years, African American race, sedentary lifestyle, rapid growth spurt, and being overweight or obese (Grewal & Ahier, 2010; Hosalkar, Horn, et al., 2007). Observe ambulation, noting Trendelenburg gait. Assess for pain that is in the hip or that is referred to the groin, medial thigh, or knee. Note decreased range of motion in the affected hip with external rotation. Radiographs will be obtained to confirm the diagnosis (anteroposterior and lateral frog-leg views of hips). Bone scan can rule out avascular necrosis, and CT scan helps define the extent of slippage. Take Note! Do not attempt to perform passive range of motion to determine the extent of limitation in the child with SCFE; this may cause worsening of the condition. Nursing Management Enforce bed rest and activity restriction. If traction is used for a period before surgery, perform routine traction care and neurovascular assessments. If surgery is performed, provide routine preoperative and postoperative care. Assess pain and administer analgesics as needed. After in situ pinning, assist the child with crutch walking. Teach the family that weight bearing is usually resumed about a week after the surgery and that the pin will be removed later. Prolonged immobility may isolate the adolescent from usual peer interactions, so encourage phone calls and visits with friends. Provide books, games, electronic devices, and magazines for distraction during the period of immobility. Provide education and support to the child and family. Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes Disease Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease is a self-limiting condition that involves avascular necrosis of the femoral head. It most often affects children between 4 and 8 years of age, but it can occur as early as 18 months and up until skeletal maturity (Hoffmeister, 2008). The disease affects males more often (Grewal & Ahier, 2010). The etiology is unknown, but interruption of the blood supply to the femoral head results in bone death, and the spherical shape of the femoral head may be lost. Swelling of the soft tissues around the hip may occur. As new blood vessels develop, the area is supplied with circulation, allowing bone resorption and deposition to take place. During this period of revascularization, which takes 18 to 24 months, the bone is soft and more likely to fracture. Over time, the femoral head reforms. Therapeutic Management The goal of therapeutic management is to maintain normal femoral head shape and to restore appropriate motion. Treatment of Legg- Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease includes anti-inflammatory medication to decrease muscle spasms around the hip joint and to relieve pain.Activity limitation may be prescribed, and sometimes bracing, casting, or traction is recommended to contain the femoral head. Serial x-ray follow-up determines progress of the disease. If surgery becomes warranted, which is rarely done, then osteotomy may be performed. Complications include joint deformity, early degenerative joint disease, persistent pain, loss of hip motion or function, and gait disturbance. Nursing Assessment Explore the health history for short stature, delayed bone maturation, related trauma, or a family history of Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease. Note painless limp, which may be intermittent over a period of months. Mild hip pain may result and may be referred to the knee or the thigh. Pain may be aggravated by exercise. Observe the child walking and note Trendelenburg gait. Perform range of motion, noting internal rotation of the hip and limited abduction. Muscle spasm may result with hip extension and rotation. Hip radiographs are obtained to evaluate the extent of epiphyseal involvement. MRI or bone scan may also be used to differentiate Legg- Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease from other disorders. Ultrasound and arthrograms may also be useful. Nursing Management Nursing care of Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease is highly variable and depends on the stage of the disease and its severity. Administer anti-inflammatory medications, noting their effect on pain. If activities are restricted, exercise the unaffected body parts. Assist families with use of the brace if prescribed. The brace may be wiped with a damp cloth if it becomes dirty. Some children will be prescribed no treatment other than avoidance of contact or high-impact sports. Swimming and bicycle riding help to maintain range of motion with little risk. If mobility equipment is needed, educate the child and family on its use. If osteotomy is performed, provide routine postoperative care, including education and support of the child and family. Osteomyelitis Osteomyelitis is a bacterial infection of the bone and soft tissue surrounding the bone. The long bone metaphysis is the most common location (Grewal & Ahier, 2010). Staphylococcus aureus is the most common infecting organism with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections on the rise (Grewal & Ahier, 2010; Polousky & Eilert, 2009). Additional causes in infants include group B streptococcus and Escherichia coli ; in children, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenza (which is now rare due to improvements in immunizations) are also implicated. Children usually present for evaluation within a few days to a week of onset of symptoms, though some may present later.FIGURE 23.19 In osteomyelitis, bacterial invasion leads to infection within the bone. Osteomyelitis is acquired hematogenously. Bacteria from the bloodstream mainly invade the most rapidly growing portion of the bone. The invading bacteria trigger an inflammatory response, formation of pus and edema, and vascular congestion. Small blood vessels thrombose and the infection extends into the metaphyseal marrow cavity. As the infection progresses the inflammation extends throughout the bone and blood supply is disrupted, resulting in death of the bone tissues ( Fig. 23.19 ). Therapeutic Management Aspiration is necessary to confirm diagnosis and identify specific microorganisms. Treatment includes a 4- to 6-week course of antibiotics. Some children may receive 1 to 2 weeks of intravenous antibiotics and then be switched to oral antibiotics for the remainder of the course. Surgical d\u00e9bridement is rarely necessary. Early treatment may prevent the complications of bone destruction, fracture, and growth arrest. Additional complications include recurrent infection, septic arthritis, and systemic infection. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 836 . Assessment findings pertinent to osteomyelitis are discussed here. Explore the health history for risk factors and symptoms. Risk factors include impetigo, infected varicella lesions, furunculosis, recent trauma, infected burns, and prolonged intravenous line use. Obtain history of current or recent antibiotic therapy and response. Note history of irritability, lethargy, possible fever, and onset of pain or change in activity level. The child usually refuses to walk and demonstrates decreased range of motion in the affected extremity. Inspect the affected extremity for swelling. Palpate for local warmth and tenderness. Note point tenderness over affected bone. Laboratory and diagnostic testing may reveal: Elevated white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein level Positive blood cultures Deep soft tissue swelling on radiography Changes on ultrasound or CT scan Nursing Management Nursing management of the child with osteomyelitis focuses on assessment, pain management, and maintenance of intravenous access for administration of antibiotics. Individualize care based on the child's and family's response to the illness; see Nursing Care Plan 23.1 . Maintain bed rest initially to prevent injury and promote comfort. Administer antipyretics as ordered if the child is febrile in the initial stage of the illness. Encourage the use of unaffected extremities by providing developmentally appropriate toys and games. Instruct the child and family on safe and proper use of crutches or walker if prescribed. Some children will be discharged home on intravenous antibiotics, while others will finish an oral antibiotic course. Teach parents proper administration of medications and maintenance of a peripherally inserted central catheter or central line at home if the child is finishing the antibiotic course intravenously. Septic Arthritis Acute septic arthritis is a condition in which bacteria invade the joint space, most often the hip or knee. It can occur at any age but usually occurs in children younger than 3 years old (Dugdale, Vyas, & Zieve, 2009). Usually bacteria gain access to the joint through the bloodstream but can be due to direct puncture from injections, venipuncture, wound infection, surgery, or injury. S. aureus is the most common causative organism with community-acquired MRSA on the Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and Enterobacter species are also responsible organisms. Haemophilus influenza used to be a common cause, but is now rare due to improvements in immunizations (Schwentker, 2009). Sepsis of the hip joint may cause avascular necrosis of the femoral head due to pressure on blood vessels and cartilage within the joint space. Septic arthritis is considered a medical emergency, as destruction of the joint cartilage may occur within just a few days. Additional complications of septic arthritis include permanent deformity, leg-length discrepancy, and long-term decreased range of motion and disability. The goals of treatment of septic arthritis are to prevent destruction of the joint cartilage and maintain function, motion, and strength. Septic arthritis is treated rapidly with joint aspiration or arthrotomy, followed by intravenous antibiotic therapy while in the hospital and oral antibiotics at home. Nursing Assessment Note history of predisposing factors such as respiratory infection or otitis media, skin or soft tissue infections, or, in the neonate, traumatic puncture wounds and femoral venipunctures. The history is usually significant for sudden onset of fever and moderate to severe pain. Upon physical examination, the infant or child appears ill. Note extent of fever, reports of pain, refusal to bear weight or straighten the joint, and limited range of motion (the child usually maintains the joint in flexion and will not allow the leg to be straightened). The child will generally hold the joint in a position of comfort and the child or infant will appear without pain as long as the joint is immobile. Any attempt at passive range of motion will reveal pain. Palpate the affected joint for warmth and swelling. Laboratory findings may include: White blood cell count normal or elevated with elevated neutrophil counts Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels Fluid from joint aspiration demonstrates elevated white blood cell count; culture determines responsible organism. Joint radiograph may show subtle soft tissue changes or increase in the joint space. Positive blood culture for the causative organism (15% of cases) Nursing Management Refer to Nursing Care Plan 23.1 for interventions related to musculoskeletal disorders. Assess aspiration wound for signs of infection. Monitor vital signs for resolution of fever. Pain management with ibuprofen or acetaminophen will be sufficient for some children; others may initially require codeine or morphine. Assess the affected joint for a decrease in swelling, increasing range of motion, and decreasing or absent pain. The child may be discharged after 72 hours of intravenous antibiotics following joint aspiration if he or she is improving and can tolerate oral antibiotics. At discharge, if the child cannot ambulate, physical therapy may be consulted for short- term use of crutches or a wheelchair. Teach families how to assess for signs and symptoms of wound infection, how to administer oral antibiotics and pain medication, and how to assist their child with crutch walking.Transient Synovitis of the Hip Transient synovitis of the hip (also termed toxic synovitis) is the most common cause of hip pain and limping in children in the United States (Polousky & Eilert, 2009). It occurs in children as young as 9 months of age through adolescence, most commonly affecting children between 3 and 8 years old (Hosalkar, Horn, et al., 2007). Boys are affected twice as often as girls (Polousky & Eilert, 2009). The exact cause is unclear, but it is thought to be associated with recent or active infection, trauma, or allergic hypersensitivity (Hosalkar, Horn, et al., 2007). It is a self-limiting disease and most cases resolve within a week, but it may last as long as 4 weeks. Usually septic arthritis and osteomyelitis must be excluded before diagnosis can be confirmed. Therapeutic management involves nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, analgesics, and bed rest to relieve weight bearing on the affected hip joint. Nursing Assessment Explore the health history for risk factors such as antecedent trauma, concurrent or recent upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, or otitis media. Note sudden acute onset of moderate to severe pain of one hip. Sometimes pain is referred to the anterior thigh or knee. Pain is usually the worst upon arising in the morning, and the child refuses to walk; pain then decreases throughout the day. Temperature will be normal or low grade (less than 38\u00b0C). Observe for a limp or for refusal to bear weight. Observe position of the affected hip: it will be held in a flexed and externally rotated position. Note restricted range of motion for abduction and internal rotation. Nursing Management Nursing care focuses on educating the family including instructions on administering nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, analgesics, and bed rest. Parents are very concerned when their child refuses to walk; therefore, provide significant support and reassure the child and family of the self-limiting nature of the disease. Scoliosis Scoliosis is a lateral curvature of the spine that exceeds 10 degrees. It may be congenital, associated with other disorders, or idiopathic. Table 23.3 explains the types of scoliosis. Idiopathic scoliosis, with the majority of cases occurring during adolescence, is the most common scoliosis (Spiegel, Hosalkar, & Dormans, 2007). Hence, this discussion will focus on adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The etiology of idiopathic scoliosis is not known, but genetic factors, growth abnormalities, and bone, muscle, disc, or central nervous system disorders may contribute to its development. Early screening and detection of scoliosis result in improved outcomes. Pathophysiology In the rapidly growing adolescent, the involved vertebrae rotate around a vertical axis, resulting in lateral curvature. The vertebrae rotate to the convex side of the curve, with the spinous processes rotating toward the concave side. Wedge-shaped vertebral bodies and discs develop because growth is suppressed on the concave side of the curve (Grewal & Ahier, 2010). As the curve progresses, the shape of the thoracic cage changes and respiratory and cardiovascular compromise may occur (the main complications of severe scoliosis). Therapeutic Management Treatment of scoliosis is aimed at preventing progression of the curve and decreasing the impact on pulmonary and cardiac function. Treatment is based on the age of the child, expected future growth, and severity of the curve. Observation with serial examinations and spine radiographs is used to monitor curve progression. For curves of 25 to 40 degrees, bracing may be sufficient to decrease progression of the curve (Grewal & Ahier, 2010). Box 23.1 describes types of scoliosis braces and Figure 23.20 shows examples of braces. The choice of brace will depend on the location and severity of the curve. Some curves will progress despite appropriate bracing and compliance.BOX 23.1 TYPES OF BRACES USED TO TREAT conspicuous, no visible neckpiece Milwaukee: for thoracic or major double curves; traditional, standard, has a visible neckpiece with chin rest Nighttime bending (Charleston): creates a curve so severe that walking is not possible, so can be worn only at night Surgical correction is often required for curves greater than 45 degrees; it is achieved with rod placement and bone grafting (Grewal & Ahier, 2010; Spiegel, Hosalkar, & Dormans, 2007). Partial spinal fusion accompanies many of the corrective surgeries. Multiple surgical approaches and techniques with various instrumentation methods exist for fusion and rod placement. The surgical approach may be anterior, posterior, or both. Traditional rod placement (Harrington rod) involved a single rod fused to the vertebrae, resulting in curve correction but also a flat-backed appearance. Newer rod instrumentations allow for scoliosis curve correction with maintenance of normal back curvature. The rods are shorter, and several are wired or grafted to the appropriate vertebrae to achieve correction. Figure 23.21 shows one example of surgical rod instrumentation. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 836 . Assessment findings pertinent to scoliosis are discussed below. Health History Determine why the child is presenting for evaluation of scoliosis. Commonly the child or adolescent will not report back pain; only mild discomfort is associated with idiopathic scoliosis until the curve becomes severe. Often the family recognizes asymmetry in the hips or shoulders or the child is screened for scoliosis at school and determined to be at risk. Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as: Family history of scoliosis Recent growth spurt Physical changes related to puberty Determine the age of development of secondary sex characteristics and the age of menarche, as these signs of pubertal development indicate the expected velocity and length of remaining growth.FIGURE 23.20 (A) Boston brace. (B) Milwaukee brace. (C) Nighttime bending brace. FIGURE 23.21 Rods are fused to the vertebrae and connected to a distracting rod to rotate the vertebral column (Cotrel-Dubousset method is shown). Physical Examination The physical assessment of a child with possible or actual scoliosis involves mainly inspection and observation. Auscultate the heart and lungs to determine compromise related to severe curvature. Observe the child at rest, sitting, and standing for evidence of poor posture. Inspect the child's back in a standing position. Note asymmetries such as shoulder elevation, prominence of one scapula, uneven curve at the waistline, or a rib hump on one side. Measure shoulder levels from the floor to the acromioclavicular joints. Note the difference between the height of the high and low shoulder in centimeters. Measure heights of anterior and posterior iliac spines and note the difference in centimeters. View the child from the side, noting abnormalities in the spinal curve. With the child bending forward, arms hanging freely, note asymmetry of the back (pronounced hump on one side). Figure 23.22 shows scoliosis noted upon visual inspection. Note leg-length discrepancy ifpresent. During the neurologic examination, balance, motor strength, sensation, and reflexes should all be normal. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Full-spine radiographs are necessary to determine the degree of curvature. The radiologist will determine the extent of the curve based on specific formulas and techniques of measurement. Nursing Management Nursing Care Plan 23.1 lists general interventions. Tailor nursing care based on the adolescent's response to the disease and its treatment. Additional nursing interventions specific to scoliosis are discussed here. Encouraging Compliance With Bracing Bracing is intended to prevent progression of the curve but does not correct the current curve. Although modern braces display an improved appearance, with no visible neckpiece, and can be worn under clothes, many adolescents are not compliant with brace wear. The brace must be worn 23 hours per day to prevent curve progression. Many factors may contribute to noncompliance, including the discomfort associated with brace wear such as pain, heat, and poor fit. The family environment may not be conducive to compliance with brace wear, and teenagers are very concerned about body image. FIGURE 23.22 ( A ) Note right shoulder, scapula, and hip elevation as well as discrepancy in waist curvature. ( B ) Note right upper back hump. Inspect the skin for evidence of rubbing by the brace that may impair skin integrity. Teach families appropriate skin care and recommend they check the brace daily for fit and breakage. Encourage the teen to shower during the 1 hour per day that the brace is off and to ensure that the skin is clean and dry before putting the brace back on. Wearing a cotton T-shirt under the brace may decrease some of the discomfort associated with brace wear. Exercises to strengthen back muscles may prevent muscle atrophy from prolonged bracing and maintain spine flexibility. Promoting Positive Body Image Encourage the teen to express his or her feelings or concerns about wearing the brace. Give the teen ways to explain scoliosis and its treatment to his or her peers. Wearing stylish baggy clothes may help the teen to conceal the brace if desired. Refer teens and theirfamilies to the National Scoliosis Foundation for additional support. A link to the National Scoliosis Foundation is provided on . Providing Preoperative Care If the curve progresses despite bracing or causes pulmonary or cardiac compromise, surgical intervention will be warranted. In the preoperative period, teach the teen the importance of turning, coughing, and deep breathing in the postoperative period. Explain the tubes and lines that will be present immediately after the surgery. Review positioning guidelines: back flexion or extension will not be allowed. Introduce the child to the patient-controlled analgesia pump and explain pain scales. There is a high risk for significant blood loss with spinal fusion and instrumentation, so if possible arrange for preoperative autologous blood donation. Providing Postoperative Care The goal of nursing management in the postoperative period after spinal fusion with or without instrumentation is to avoid complications. Perform neurovascular checks with each set of vital signs. When turning the child, use the log-roll technique to avoid flexion of the back ( Fig. 23.23 ). Provide proper pain management and medicate for pain before repositioning and ambulation. Administer prophylactic intravenous antibiotics if ordered. Assess for drainage from the operative site and for excess blood loss via the Hemovac or other drainage tube. Maintain Foley patency, as the child will be confined to bed for the first couple of days. Maintain strict recording of fluid intake and output. Administer transfusions of packed red blood cells if ordered. Ambulation, once ordered, should be done slowly to avoid orthostatic hypotension. Assist the family with arrangements to continue the teen's schoolwork while hospitalized and/or arrange for home tutoring during the several-week recovery period. FIGURE 23.23 Log-roll the postoperative spinal fusion child to prevent spine flexion. Consider This A ngela Hernandez, a 15-year-old girl, is being seen in the clinic after she was found to be at high risk for scoliosis during a school screening. Upon assessment the nurse notes asymmetry of the hips, with shoulder elevation and prominence of one scapula. She is visibly upset and wants to know what caused this and what can be done. How would you address her concerns? Angela's plan of care will include wearing of a brace. What education will be necessary and how can you promote compliance? Describe nursing care for Angela if surgical correction becomes necessary.INJURIES Injuries throughout childhood are inevitable. Trauma often occurs as a result of motor vehicle injury. The bulk of trauma resulting from physical activity or sports in children is due to running, skateboarding, and climbing trees. Only about one third of sports injuries in children occur during organized sports; the rest occur in physical education class or nonorganized sports (Busch, 2006). Younger children tend to suffer contusions, sprains, and simple upper extremity fractures; adolescents more frequently experience lower extremity trauma. As the number of children participating in youth sports increases and the intensity of training and the level of competition also increase, the incidence of injury is also likely to increase. Many types of musculoskeletal injuries exist. This discussion will focus on fractures, sprains, overuse syndromes, and dislocated radial head. Fracture Fractures occur frequently in children and adolescents; 42% of boys and 27% of girls will suffer a fracture during childhood (Grewal & Ahier, 2010). The most common fractures in children occur in the forearm and wrist (Grewal & Ahier, 2010). Greenstick and buckle fractures account for about half of pediatric fractures, and only about 20% of childhood fractures require reduction (Price, Phillips, & Devito, 2006). Midclavicular, humerus, or femur fractures can occur as a result of birth trauma. They typically heal well but may require limiting mobility or splinting. Fractures in children result most frequently from accidental trauma (Grewal & Ahier, 2010). Nonaccidental trauma (child abuse) and other disease processes are the other causes of fractures. In children younger than 2 years, most fractures that occur are the result of another person causing the injury (Grewal & Ahier, 2010). Take Note! Fracture in the newborn (with the exception of birth trauma) or infant should raise a high index of suspicion for abuse, as fractures are very unusual in children who cannot yet walk (Grewal & Ahier, 2010). Pathophysiology The growth plate is the most vulnerable portion of the child's bone and is frequently the site of injury. The Salter-Harris classification system is used to describe fractures involving the growth plate ( Table 23.4 ). The thicker, more elastic periosteum in children yields to the force encountered with trauma, resulting more frequently in nondisplaced fractures in children. The increased vascularity and decreased mineral content make the child's bones more flexible. Plastic or bowing deformities and buckle and greenstick fractures are the result. Complete fractures do occur in children, but they tend to be more stable than in the adult, resulting in improved healing and function. Spiral, pelvic, and hip fractures are rare in children. Table 23.5 explains common types of fractures in children. Fractures in children heal more rapidly and result in less disability and deformity than adults. The younger the child, the more quickly the bone heals. However, plastic deformity and Salter-Harris type IV fractures may result in an angular deformity. Though healing of fractures is usually quick and without incident in children, delayed union, nonunion, or malunion can occur. Additional complications include infection, avascular necrosis, bone shortening from epiphyseal arrest, vascular or nerve injuries, fat embolism, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and compartment syndrome, which is an orthopedic emergency. Later in life, osteoarthritis may occur as a long-term complication from childhood fracture (Dugdale & Zieve, 2010). Take Note! Any type of fracture can be the result of child abuse but spiral femur fractures, rib fractures, and humerus fractures, particularly in the child younger than 2 years of age, should always be thoroughly investigated to rule out the possibility of abuse (Gholve, Hosalkar, & Wells, 2007). Therapeutic Management The vast majority of childhood fractures would heal well with splinting only, but casting of these fractures is performed to provide further comfort to the child and to allow for increased activity while the fracture is healing. Displaced fractures require manual traction to align the bones, followed by casting. More severe fractures may require traction for a period of time, usually followed by casting. Severe or complicated fractures may alternatively require open reduction and internal fixation for healing to occur. Complex fractures are often treated with external fixation ( Fig. 23.24 ). Take Note! Significant swelling may occur initially after immobilization with a splint. Delaying casting for a few days provides time for some of the swelling to subside, allowing for successful casting a few days after the injury. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 836 . Assessment findings pertinent to fractures are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include recent injury, trauma, or fall; complaint of pain; difficulty bearing weight; limp; or refusal to use an extremity. Young children often demonstrate sudden onset of irritability and refusal to bear weight. Ask about the mechanism of injury and obtain a description of the traumatic event. Be alert to inconsistencies between the history and the clinical picture or mechanism of injury; inconsistency may be an indicator of child abuse. Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as: FIGURE 23.24 (A) External fixation is required for complicated fractures. (B) The Ilizarov fixator is a circular apparatus usually used for complicated lower extremity fractures. The pins are smaller in diameter, more like wires, than those used in other fixators. Rickets Renal osteodystrophy Osteogenesis imperfecta Participation in sports, particularly contact sports Failure to use protective equipment as recommended for various physical activities and sports (e.g., wrist guards while rollerblading) Physical Examination Perform the physical examination of the child with a potential fracture carefully, so as not to cause further pain or trauma. The physical examination particular to fractures includes inspection, observation, and palpation. Take Note! Do not attempt to straighten or manipulate an injured limb. INSPECTION AND OBSERVATION Inspect the skin for bruising, erythema, or swelling. Observe the extremities for deformity. Note neglect of an extremity or an inability to bear weight. If ambulating, note any limp. PALPATION Carefully palpate the joint or injured part. Distract the young child with a toy or activity while palpating. Note point tenderness, which is a reliable indicator of fracture in children. Assess neurovascular status, noting distal extremity temperature, spontaneous movement, sensation, numbness, capillary refill time, and quality of pulses. The neurovascular assessment is critical to providing a baseline so that any changes associated with compartment syndrome can be identified quickly.Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Usually plain x-ray films are all that is required to identify a simple fracture. Complicated fractures that require surgical intervention may require further evaluation with CT or MRI. Nursing Management Immediately after the injury, immobilize the limb above and below the site of injury in the most comfortable position with a splint. Use cold therapy to reduce swelling in the first 48 hours after injury. Elevate the injured extremity above the level of the heart. Perform frequent neurovascular checks. Take Note! Assess the injured, splinted, or casted extremity frequently for the \"5 P's,\" which may indicate compartment syndrome: pain (increased out of proportion), pulselessness, pallor, paresthesia, and paralysis. Report these findings immediately. Assess pain level and administer pain medications as needed. Utilize nonpharmacologic methods of pain relief as needed. Administer tetanus vaccine in the child with an open fracture if he or she has not received a tetanus booster within the past 5 years. Additional nursing interventions include providing family education and teaching on fracture prevention. Providing Family Education Unless bed rest is prescribed, children with upper extremity casts and \"walking\" leg casts can resume increased levels of activity as the pain subsides. Children who require crutches while in a cast may return to school, but those in spica casts will be at home for several weeks. Providing distraction and finding ways to keep up with school work are important. Teach families to care for the cast (see Teaching Guidelines 23.1 ). Preventing Fractures Discourage risky behavior such as climbing trees and performing tricks on bicycles. Provide appropriate supervision, particularly with outdoor activity. Encourage appropriate use of protective equipment, such as wrist guards with rollerblading and shin guards with soccer. Ensure that playground equipment is in good working order and intact; there should not be protruding screws or unbalanced portions of equipment, which may increase the risk for falling. Sprains Sprains result from a twisting or turning motion of the affected body part. The tendons and ligaments stretch excessively and may tear slightly. They are uncommon in young children as their growth plates are weaker than their muscles and tendons, making them more prone to fracture. They may occur at any joint, but the most common are ankle and knee sprains. Therapeutic management of sprains includes rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE). Other treatment options may include activity restrictions, splints or casts, crutches or wheelchair, and physical therapy. On initial evaluation, sprains need to be differentiated from torn ligaments and meniscal tears, as those conditions are more serious and may require surgical intervention. Nursing Assessment Elicit a health history, determining the mechanism of injury (whether it occurred during sports or simply a misstep or fall). Determine what treatment the family has used so far. Inspect the affected body part for edema, which is frequently present, and bruising, which sometimes occurs. Note limp or inability to bear weight. Do not attempt to perform passive range of motion on the affected body part. Assess neurovascular status distal to the injury (usually normal). Nursing Management Instruct the child and family in appropriate treatment of sprains, which includes: Rest: limit activity. Ice: apply cold packs for 20 to 30 minutes, remove for 1 hour, and repeat (for the first 24 to 48 hours). Compression: apply an Ace wrap or other elastic bandage or brace; check skin for alterations when rewrapping. Elevation: elevate the injured extremity above the level of the heart to decrease swelling ( Fig. 23.25 ).The child may require instruction in crutch walking as well. Teach families that to prevent sprains during sports, it is important for the child to perform appropriate stretching and warm-up activities. FIGURE 23.25 RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation) is the appropriate treatment for sprains. Take Note! If the child's fingers or toes become increasingly swollen or discolored, remove the Ace wrap immediately. Overuse Syndromes The term \"overuse syndrome\" refers to a group of disorders that result from repeated force applied to normal tissue. The connective tissues fail in response to repetitive stress, leading to a small amount of tissue breakdown. They develop over the course of weeks to months. There is usually no identifiable injury associated with overuse syndromes. Pain is usually associated with the activity and worsens with continued participation in the activity. The incidence of overuse injuries in the young athlete has increased as participation of youths in organized sports has grown along with children today participating in sports year-round and sometimes in multiple sports simultaneously (Brenner & the Council on Sports Medicine and Fitness, 2007). The young athlete is at risk for more serious overuse injuries due to the following: The growing bones of the young athlete cannot handle as much stress as mature bones in adults. The child is just learning the proper mechanisms for skills, such as throwing a baseball. The child is unable to recognize vague signs of injury such as fatigue and poor performance (Brenner & the Council on Sports Medicine and Fitness, 2007). Table 23.6 gives details on several common overuse syndromes. Therapeutic management is aimed at reassurance, pain management, and limiting rather than eliminating activity. Nursing Assessment Elicit a health history to determine the extent of involvement in sports. Note onset of pain, duration, intensity, aggravating factors, and treatments used at home. Examine the painful part, noting findings similar to those noted for each syndrome in Table 23.6 . Nursing Management Initially, apply ice when pain is severe. Anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen may be helpful. Encourage the child to limit exercise and participate in a different activity. After a few weeks, most overuse syndromes resolve; at that point, the athlete may resume the prior activity. Osgood-Schlatter disease is the exception and may require 12 to 24 months to resolve (Gunta, 2009). Using pads or braces that are appropriate to the painful body part is also helpful. Supporting the arm with a sling may relieve stress on the proximal humerus when epiphysiolysis occurs. Heel cups used in athletic shoes help relieve stress on the heels associated with Sever disease. To prevent overuse syndromes, encourage athletes to perform appropriate stretching exercises during a 20- to 30-minute warm-up period before each practice or game. Also encourage several weeks of conditioning training before the season begins. There is currently limited research pertaining to overuse injuries in the young athlete. The American Academy of Pediatrics has developed some guidelines to help prevent these injuries such as the following: encourage 1 to 2 days off per week of competitive athletics, sports training, and competitive practice; encourage 2 to 3 months away from a specific sport during the year; and educate to increase weekly training time, number of repetitions, or total distance by no more than 10% a week (Brenner & the Council on Sports Medicine and Fitness, 2007). Take Note! \"Energy healing\" such as therapeutic touch and Reiki may provide a nonpharmacologic adjunct to pain management for musculoskeletal injuries. Radial Head Subluxation Subluxation of the radial head (\"nursemaid's elbow\") occurs when a pulling motion on the arm causes the annular ligament surrounding the radial head to stretch or tear, therefore displacing the radial head. The ligament becomes entrapped within the joint, preventing spontaneous reduction. It usually occurs in children younger than 7 years of age and is a common injury in children aged 2 to 5 years (Rodts, 2009). In most cases a parent, sibling, or caregiver inadvertently injures the child while holding or pulling on a pronated upper extremity. Radiologic examination may be done, especially if the mechanism of injury is not clear, to rule out fracture or dislocation. To reduce the injury, the elbow is flexed to 90 degrees and then the forearm is fully and firmly supinated, causing the ligament to snap back into place. With appropriate reduction of the radial head, no complications result. Nursing Assessment Elicit a health history to help determine the mechanism of injury. Common precipitators of this injury include pulling on the child's arm while leading him or her in one direction, helping the child up the stairs, a child dropping or falling to the ground while an adult is holding the hand, or swinging or lifting the child by the hands. Assess neurovascular status and examine the extremity. The child will hold the arm slightly flexed at the side or across the abdomen and refuse to move it. When the arm is still, the child apparently has no discomfort. Neurovascular status is normally intact with no bruising or swelling present. Nursing ManagementAfter treatment, usually hyperpronation to reduce the dislocation, assess the child's ability to use the arm without pain. Typically after reduction the child will demonstrate less pain almost immediately. Educate parents that once a radial head subluxation occurs it may recur. Teach parents to avoid excessive pulling or pulling up on the child's arm, particularly in an abrupt jerking fashion, to prevent recurrence. Encourage parents and caregivers to always lift the child under the arms. KEY CONCEPTS At birth, muscles, tendons, ligaments, and cartilage are all present and functional. Rapid muscle growth in the adolescent years places the teenager at increased risk for injury compared with other age groups. The bones of the infant and young child are more flexible and have a thicker periosteum and more abundant blood supply than the adult's; as a result, bending occurs more frequently than breaking of the bone, and the fractured bone heals more quickly. The epiphysis of long bones is the growth center of the bones in children. Injury to this area may result in long-term extremity deformity. Plain radiographs are usually sufficient for diagnosing injuries in children. If CT or MRI scans are required, the nurse may need to help the child stay calm and still during the procedure. Apply a pressure dressing following joint aspiration to prevent hematoma formation or fluid recollection. Perform frequent assessments of pain status and the effect of pain medication in the child with a musculoskeletal disorder. Diazepam (Valium) may be helpful in relieving muscle spasm associated with traction. Maintain traction and the appropriate amount of weight as ordered. The bulk of cast care occurs in the home. Teach the family of a child with a cast to perform neurovascular assessments, prevent the cast from getting wet, and care for the skin appropriately. Assessment of neurovascular status is an essential component of care for a child with a neuromuscular disorder. Children with chronic disorders such as osteogenesis imperfecta may demonstrate slower or lesser growth than other children and may also be unable to participate in certain activities because of bone fragility. Congenital or developmental disorders such as DDH or clubfoot require bracing or casting for correction and to prevent deformity later in life. Fractures may occur as a result of unintentional or intentional injury, or because the bones are fragile, as in rickets or osteogenesis imperfecta. Sprains, fractures, and overuse syndromes occur frequently in young athletes. Appropriate warm-up and stretching may help prevent some of these injuries. Rest, ice, compression, and elevation is the appropriate treatment for sprains. Torticollis may be treated by teaching the family to perform daily neck muscle stretching exercises. To prevent complications after a spinal fusion for scoliosis correction, use the log-roll method for turning the child so that back flexion is avoided.

KEY TERMS annular dermatitis erythema macule papule pruritus scaling vesicle Learning Objectives Upon completion of the chapter, you will be able to: 1. Compare anatomic and physiologic differences of the integumentary system in infants and children versus adults. 2. Describe nursing care related to common laboratory and diagnostic tests used in the medical diagnosis of integumentary disorders in infants, children, and adolescents. 3. Distinguish integumentary disorders common in infants, children, and adolescents. 4. Identify appropriate nursing assessments and interventions related to pediatric integumentary disorders. 5. Develop an individualized nursing care plan for the child with an integumentary disorder. 6. Describe the psychosocial impact of a chronic integumentary disorder on children or adolescents. 7. Develop child/family teaching plans for the child with an integumentary disorder. Eva Lopez, 1 year old, is brought to the clinic by her mother, who states, \"Eva has dry patches of skin, her wrists bleed from her scratching, and she's having trouble sleeping at night.\" Integumentary disorders occur often in children and are caused by exposure to infectious microorganisms, hypersensitivity reactions, hormonal influences, and injuries. Some integumentary disorders are as mild and self-limited as a minor abrasion. Others, such as atopic dermatitis, are chronic and must be managed consistently. Finally, some integumentary disorders can be severe and even life-threatening, such as full-thickness burns. If the integumentary disorders are chronic or severe, they can have a major impact on the child's physiologic or psychological status (Magin, Adams, Heading, Pond, & Smith, 2008). Nurses who care for children need to be familiar with common skin disorders of infancy, childhood, and adolescence so they can effectively intervene with children and their families.VARIATIONS IN PEDIATRIC ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY Skin is the largest organ of the body and serves to protect the underlying tissues from trauma and invasion by microorganisms. The skin's health reflects the internal well-being of the body (Burns, Dunn, Brady, Starr, & Blosser, 2009). The skin is also important for the perception of pain, heat, and cold and for the regulation of body temperature. Differences in the Skin Between Children and Adults The infant's epidermis is thinner than the adult's, and the blood vessels lie closer to the surface because there is a decreased amount of subcutaneous fat. Thus, the infant loses heat more readily through the skin's surface than the older child or adult does. The thinness of the infant's skin also allows substances to be absorbed through the skin more readily than they would be in an adult. Bacteria can gain access via the infant's and younger child's skin more readily than they can through the adult's skin. The infant's skin contains more water than the adult's, and the epidermis is loosely bound to the dermis. This means that friction may easily cause separation of the layers, resulting in blistering or skin breakdown. The infant's skin is also less pigmented than that of the adult (in all races), placing the infant at increased risk of skin damage from ultraviolet radiation. Over time, the infant's skin toughens and becomes less hydrated and thus is less susceptible to microorganism invasion. The skin thickness and characteristics reach adult levels in the late teenage years. Differences in Dark-Skinned Children Children with dark skin tend to have more pronounced cutaneous reactions compared to children with lighter skin. Hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation in the affected area following healing of a dermatologic condition is common in dark-skinned children. This change in pigmentation may be temporary (a few months following a superficial skin disorder) or permanent (following a more involved skin condition). Dark-skinned children tend to have more prominent papules (rounded, nonpustular elevation on the skin), follicular responses, lichenification, and vesicular or bullous reactions than lighter-skinned children with the same disorder. Hypertrophic scarring and keloid formation ( Fig. 24.1 ) occur more often in dark-skinned children (Burns et al., 2009). FIGURE 24.1 Keloid formation is more common in dark-skinned than light-skinned children. Sebaceous and Sweat Glands Sebaceous glands function immaturely at birth. The sebum secreted serves to lubricate the skin and hair. Sebum production increases in the preadolescent and adolescent years, which is why acne develops at that time. The infant's eccrine sweat glands are somewhat functional and will produce sweat as a response to emotional stimuli and heat. They become fully functional in the middle childhood years. Until that time, temperature regulation is less effective compared to older children and adults. The apocrine sweat glands are small and nonfunctional in the infant. They mature during puberty, at which time body odor develops in response to the fluid secreted by these glands.COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS A variety of medications as well as other medical treatments are used to treat integumentary disorders in children. Most of these treatments will require a physician's or nurse practitioner's order when the child is in the hospital. The most common treatments and medications are listed in Common Medical Treatments 24.1 and Drug Guide 24.1 . The nurse caring for the child with an integumentary disorder should be familiar with the procedures and medications, how they work, and common nursing implications related to their use. COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS 24.1 DRUG GUIDE 24.1 COMMON DRUGS FOR INTEGUMENTARY DISORDERS NURSING PROCESS OVERVIEW FOR THE CHILD WITH AN INTEGUMENTARY DISORDER Nursing management of the child with an integumentary disorder requires astute assessment skills, development of accurate nursing diagnoses and expected outcomes, implementation of appropriate interventions, and evaluation of the entire process. Many skin rashes may be associated with other, often serious illnesses, so the nurse must use comprehensive and excellent assessment skills when evaluating rashes in children. Certain integumentary conditions are chronic and require ongoing care related to health maintenance, education, and psychosocial needs. Assessment Nursing assessment of the child with an integumentary disorder includes obtaining the health history and performing a physical examination. Assisting with or obtaining laboratory tests may also be necessary. Remember Eva, the 1-year-old with the dry patches, itching, and trouble sleeping? What additional health history and physical examination assessment information should the nurse obtain? Health History Determine the child's or parent's chief complaint, which is most often related to pruritus, scaling (dry, flaky skin), or a cosmetic disruption. Document the history of the present illness, noting onset, location, duration, characteristics, other symptoms, and relieving factors, particularly as related to a rash or lesion. Also ask about the quantity and quality of any discharge from the rash or lesions. Document accompanying symptoms. Note the child's general state of health, history of chronic medical conditions, recent surgeries, hospitalizations, medications, or immunizations. Has there been a recent change in the child's food intake or environment? Is there a family history of chronic or acute skin conditions? Does anyone in the home have a similar concern at this time? Does the family have pets that go outdoors? Does the child play in the woods or garden? Note usual skin care routines, as well as types of soaps, cosmetics, or other skin care products used. Determine the amount of daily sun exposure and whether the child consistently uses sunscreen. Physical Examination Perform a complete physical examination, noting any abnormalities. Perform a focused and thorough examination of the skin. The best lighting for examination of the skin is natural daylight. Look at the skin in general, noting distribution of any obvious rashes or lesions. Inspect the mucous membranes, noting and describing lesions if present. Examine all surfaces of the skin and scalp carefully. Note temperature, moisture, texture, and fragility of the skin. If a rash or lesions are present, note their location and provide a detailed description of them. Describe whether a rash is macular, papular, pustular, or vesicular. Provide a description of vascular lesions if present. If lesions are present on the scalp, has hair loss in that region occurred? Describe lesions according to the following criteria: Linear: in a line Shape: are the lesions round, oval, or annular (ring around central clearing)? Morbilliform: a rosy, maculopapular rash Target lesions: like a bull's-eye If drainage is present, describe it as clear, purulent, honey colored, or otherwise. Note scaling or lichenification of the skin. Palpate for regional lymphadenopathy. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 24.1 details the laboratory and diagnostic tests most commonly used when considering integumentary disorders. The tests can assist the physician or nurse practitioner in diagnosing the disorder or can be used as guidelines in determining ongoing treatment. Some of the tests are obtained by laboratory or nonnursing personnel, while others might be obtained by the nurse. In either instance the nurse should be familiar with how the tests are obtained, what they are used for, and normal versus abnormal results. This knowledge will also be necessary when providing child and family education related to the testing. Nursing Diagnoses and Related Interventions Upon completion of a thorough assessment, the nurse might identify several nursing diagnoses, such as: Impaired skin integrity Pain Risk for infection Disturbed body image Risk for fluid volume deficit Altered nutrition After completing an assessment of Eva, the nurse noted the following: hypopigmentation of the skin behind her knees, dry patches on her wrists and face, and slight wheezing heard bilaterally on auscultation. Based on these assessment findings, what would your top three nursing diagnoses be for Eva? Desired outcomes and interventions are based on the nursing diagnoses. Nursing Care Plan 24.1 can be used as a guide in planning nursing care for the child with an integumentary disorder. Individualize the plan of care based on the child's and family's responses to the health alteration. See Chapter 14 for information about pain management. Additional information will be included later in the chapter as it relates to specific disorders. Based on your top three nursing diagnoses for Eva, describe appropriate nursing interventions. COMMON LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS 24.1 INFECTIOUS DISORDERS Infectious disorders of the skin include those caused by viral, bacterial, or fungal infection. The viral exanthems are discussed in Chapter 15 . Bacterial and fungal infections of the skin are discussed below. Bacterial Infections Bacterial infections of the skin include bullous and nonbullous impetigo, folliculitis, cellulitis, and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. These bacterial skin infections are often caused by Staphylococcus aureus and group A -hemolytic streptococcus, which are ordinarily normal flora on the skin. Impetigo, folliculitis, and cellulitis are usually self-limited disorders that rarely become severe. Impetigo is a readily recognizable skin rash ( Fig. 24.2 ). Nonbullous impetigo generally follows some type of skin trauma or may arise as a secondary bacterial infection of another skin disorder, such as atopic dermatitis. Bullous impetigo demonstrates a sporadic occurrence pattern and develops on intact skin, resulting from toxin production by S. aureus. NURSING CARE PLAN 24.1 Overview for the Child With an Integumentary Disorder NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Impaired skin integrity related to infectious process, hypersensitivity reaction, injury, or mechanical factors as evidenced by rash, inflammation, abrasion, laceration, or disrupted epidermis Outcome Identification and Evaluation Integrity of skin surface will be restored: rash, abrasion, laceration, or other skin disruption will heal. Interventions: Restoring Skin Integrity Assess site of skin impairment to determine extent of involvement and plan care. Monitor skin impairment every shift for changes in color, warmth, redness, or other signs of infection to identify problems early. Determine the child's and family's skin care practices to establish need for education related to skin care. Individualize the child's skin care regimen depending on the child's particular skin condition to most appropriately care for skin in light of the child's disorder. In the immobile child, use a risk assessment tool (such as a modified Norton or Braden scale) to identify risk for skin breakdown. Position the child on the opposite side of the skin impairment to avoid further skin breakdown. Encourage appropriate nutritional intake as adequate nutrients are necessary for appropriate immune function and skin healing. Consult the wound and ostomy care nurse specialist to determine the best approach for individualized wound care. Provide dressing change and wound care as prescribed to promote wound or burn healing. NURSING DIAGNOSIS Risk for infection related to disruption in protective skin barrier Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will remain free from local or systemic infection, will remain afebrile, without additional redness or warmth at skin disruption site. Interventions: Preventing Infection Use appropriate hand hygiene to decrease transmission of infectious organisms. Assess the skin impairment site for increased warmth, redness, discharge, or new purulence to identify infection early. Assess temperature every 4 hours or more frequently if needed, as children develop fever quickly in response to infection. Note white blood cell (WBC) count and culture results, reporting unexpected values to the physician or nurse practitioner so that appropriate treatment may be started. Follow prescribed therapies for skin alteration to maintain skin moisture and prevent further breakdown, which may lead to infection. Encourage appropriate nutritional intake as adequate nutrients are necessary for appropriate immune function and skin healing. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS: Disturbed body image related to chronic skin changes caused by disease process, burns, or other skin alteration as evidenced by child's verbalization, reluctance to participate in activities, or social withdrawal Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will verbalize or demonstrate acceptance of alteration in body, will return to previous level of social involvement. Interventions: Promoting Appropriate Body Image Assess child or teen for feelings about alteration in skin to determine baseline. Acknowledge feelings of anger or depression related to skin changes to provide an outlet for feelings. Encourage the child or teen to participate in skin care to give some sense of control over what is occurring. Help the child or teen to accept self as the perception of self is tied to knowing oneself and identifying what the self values. NURSING DIAGNOSIS Risk for deficient fluid volume related to burnsOutcome Identification and Evaluation Fluid volume status will be balanced, child will maintain urine output of 1 to 2 mL/kg/hour, oral mucosa will be moist and pink, heart rate will remain within age- and situation-specific parameters. Interventions: Promoting Fluid Balance Assess fluid volume status at least every shift, more frequently if disrupted, to obtain baseline for comparison. Strictly monitor intake and output to detect imbalance or need for additional fluid intake. Weigh the child daily on the same scale, at the same time, in the same amount of clothing as changes in weight are an accurate indicator of fluid volume status in children. Provide intravenous fluid resuscitation in initial period, followed by encouragement of oral fluid intake in the burned child, to compensate for fluid loss through burned areas. NURSINGDIAGNOSIS : Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to increased metabolic state (burns) as evidenced by poor wound healing, difficulty gaining or maintaining body weight Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will demonstrate balanced nutritional state, will maintain or gain weight as appropriate for situation, will demonstrate improvement in wound healing. Interventions: Promoting Nutrition Assess the child's food preferences and ability to eat to provide a baseline for planning nursing care. Consult the nutritionist because nutritional needs are increased related to altered metabolic state as a result of burns. Collaborate with the nutritionist, child, and parents to plan meals that appeal to the child to increase the child's intake. Administer vitamin and mineral preparations as prescribed to supplement nutrients. Provide smaller, more frequent meals and snacks to promote increased intake. Weigh the child daily to determine progress. FIGURE 24.2 Note honey-colored crusting with impetigo. Folliculitis, infection of the hair follicle, most often results from occlusion of the hair follicle. It may occur as a result of poor hygiene, prolonged contact with contaminated water, maceration, a moist environment, or use of occlusive emollient products. Cellulitis is a localized infection and inflammation of the skin and subcutaneous tissues and is usually preceded by skin trauma of some sort ( Fig. 24.3 ). Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome results from infection with S. aureus that produces a toxin, which then causes exfoliation. It has an abrupt onset and results in diffuse erythema (reddening of the skin) and skin tenderness ( Fig. 24.4 ). Scalded skin syndrome is most common in infancy and rare beyond 5 years of age (Marino & Fine, 2009).FIGURE 24.3 Note erythema and edema associated with cellulitis. FIGURE 24.4 Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) with ruptured bullae. (Used with permission from Goodheart, H.P. Goodheart's photoguide to [3rd ed.]. Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2009.) Of particular concern are community-acquired bacterial skin infections caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) (So & Farrington, 2008). CA-MRSA most commonly occurs as a skin or soft tissue infection, such as cellulitis or an abscess. Risk factors for CA-MRSA are turf burns, towel sharing, participation in team sports, or attendance at day care or outdoor camps. If the child presents with a moderate to severe skin infection or with an infection that is not responding as expected to therapy, it is important to culture the infected area for MRSA. Therapeutic management of bacterial skin infections includes topical or systemic antibiotics and appropriate hygiene ( Table 24.1 ). Nursing Assessment Obtain the history as noted in the nursing process overview section. Note history of skin disruption such as a cut, scrape, or insect or spider bite (nonbullous impetigo and cellulitis). Note body piercing in the adolescent, which can lead to impetigo or cellulitis. Measure the child's temperature. Fever may occur with bullous impetigo or cellulitis and is common with scalded skin syndrome. Inspect the skin, noting abnormalities, documenting their location and distribution, and describing drainage if present. Table 24.1 gives specific clinical manifestations of the various bacterial skin infections. Palpate for regional lymphadenopathy, which may be present withimpetigo or cellulitis. Blood cultures are indicated in the child with cellulitis with lymphangitic streaking and in all cases of periorbital or orbital cellulitis. Nursing Management Administer antibiotics topically or systemically as prescribed. Teach the family about antibiotic administration and care of the lesions or rash. Soak impetiginous lesions with cool compresses or Burow solution to remove crusts before applying topical antibiotics. Though impetigo is considered a contagious disorder among vulnerable populations, removal from school or day care is not necessary unless the condition is widespread or actively weeping. Prevent transmission of nosocomial MRSA by appropriately isolating children according to the institution's policy when the child is hospitalized. In children with scalded skin syndrome, reduce the risk of scarring by minimal handling, avoiding corticosteroids, and applying soothing ointments as the skin heals. Educate the family about prevention of bacterial skin infections. Stress the importance of cleanliness and hygiene. Teach the family to keep the child's fingernails cut short and to clean the nails with a nail brush at bath time. When a skin disruption such as a cut, scrape, or insect bite occurs, teach the family to clean the area well to prevent the development of cellulitis. Folliculitis may be prevented with diligent hygiene and avoidance of occlusive emollients. Table 24.1 gives additional information about specific treatments for bacterial skin infections. Fungal Infections Fungi also cause infections on children's skin. Tinea is a fungal disease of the skin occurring on any part of the body. The part of the body affected determines the second word in the name. Examples of tinea infections occurring on various parts of the body include: Tinea pedis: fungal infection on the feet Tinea on the arms or legs Tinea versicolor: fungal infection on the trunk and extremities Tinea capitis: fungal infection on the scalp, eyebrows, or eyelashes Tinea cruris: fungal infection on the groinThe three organisms most often responsible for tinea are albicans may cause an infection of the skin, particularly in a warm, moist area such as the diaper area. In fact, 80% of diaper rashes lasting longer than 4 days are colonized with C. albicans (Marino & Fine, 2009). All fungal skin infections may occur year-round, but tinea versicolor is more common in warm weather. Therapeutic management of fungal infections involves appropriate hygiene and administration of an antifungal agent. Table 24.2 gives further information about treatment. See EBP 24.1 Nursing Assessment Elicit the health history, noting exposure to another person with a fungal infection or exposure to a pet (fungi are often carried by pets). Note onset of the rash and whether it is itchy. Determine if the child has recently visited the barber (tinea capitis). Note contact with damp areas such as locker rooms and swimming pools, use of nylon socks or nonbreathable shoes, or minor trauma to the feet (tinea pedis). Document a history of wearing tight clothing or participating in a contact sport such as wrestling (tinea cruris). Inspect the skin and scalp, noting the location, description, and distribution of the rash or lesions ( Figs. 24.5 , 24.6 , 24.7 , 24.8 , and 24.9 ). Table 24.2 describes the clinical findings associated with various types of tinea. Scraping and KOH preparation show branching hyphae. For tinea capitis, the Wood lamp will fluoresce yellow-green if it is caused by Microsporum, but not with Trichophyton. A fungal culture of a plucked hair is more reliable for diagnosis of tinea capitis. Nursing Management Maintain appropriate hygiene and administer antifungal agents as prescribed (see Table 24.2 ). Additional specifics related to the individual fungal disorders are as follows: Tinea corporis is contagious, but the child may return to day care or school once treatment has begun. Identify and treat family members or other contacts.FIGURE 24.5 Tinea corporis: note raised scaly border with clearing in center. FIGURE 24.6 Note hair breakage and loss with tinea capitis.FIGURE 24.7 Tinea versicolor. Hypopigmented scaly lesions on the back of a darkly pigmented adolescent.

The interdigital pattern of tinea pedis with permission from Goodheart, H.P. Goodheart's photoguide to common [3rd ed.]. Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2009.) Counsel the child with tinea capitis and parents that hair will usually regrow in 3 to 12 months. Wash sheets and clothes in hot water to decrease the risk of the infection spreading to other family members. Instruct the child with tinea pedis to keep the feet clean and dry. Rinse feet with water or a water/vinegar mixture and dry them well, especially between the toes. Encourage the child to wear cotton socks and shoes that allow the feet to breathe. Going barefoot at home is allowed, but flip-flops should be worn around swimming pools and in locker rooms. Inform the child with tinea versicolor that return to normal skin pigmentation may take several months. Counsel the child or adolescent with tinea cruris to wear cotton underwear and loose clothing. It is important to maintain good hygiene, particularly after sports practice or a sporting event. For management of diaper candidiasis, follow the suggestions listed below in the section on diaper dermatitis.FIGURE 24.9 A bright red rash with satellite lesions occurs with diaper candidiasis. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 24.1 EFFECTIVENESS OF VARIOUS SYSTEMIC ANTIFUNGAL DRUGS IN TREATING TINEA CAPITIS IN CHILDREN STUDY Tinea capitis (fungal infection of the scalp) affects a large number of children. Traditionally, a 6- to 8-week course of oral griseofulvin was required to eradicate the infection. The authors evaluated 21 randomized controlled studies that included a total of 1,812 participants. The studies determined the effectiveness of terbinafine, itraconazole, fluconazole, and griseofulvin at eradicating dermatophytes in tinea capitis. Findings The authors found that shorter courses (2 to 4 weeks) with terbinafine, itraconazole, or fluconazole were as effective at treating tinea capitis as the traditional longer course with griseofulvin. Nursing Implications Shorter courses of treatment will improve compliance, although the drugs may be more expensive. Educate families that the shorter course will be simpler to complete and result in fewer side effects and decreased need for laboratory evaluation of their child. Assist families with any paperwork needed to encourage insurance coverage for these drugs if needed. Adapted from Gonzalez, U., Seaton, T., Bergus, G., Jacobson, J., & Mart\u00ednez-Monz\u00f3n, C.

Acute hypersensitivity reactions may cause diaper dermatitis, contact dermatitis, disorder. Seborrhea and psoriasis are chronic inflammatory skin disorders that do not occur as a result of hypersensitivity. Diaper Dermatitis Dermatitis refers to an inflammatory reaction of the skin. Diaper dermatitis refers to an inflammatory reaction of the skin in the area covered by a diaper. It is a nonimmunologic response to a skin irritant that results in skin cell hydration disturbance. Prolonged exposure to urine and feces may lead to skin breakdown ( Fig. 24.10 ). Diaper wearing increases the skin's pH, activating fecal enzymes that further contribute to skin maceration. FIGURE 24.10 Diaper dermatitis. Nursing Assessment Determine from the history whether the infant or child wears diapers. Ask about the onset and progression of the rash, as well as any treatments and response. Inspect the skin in the diaper area for erythema and maceration (see Fig. 24.10 ). Ordinary diaper dermatitis does not usually result in a bumpy rash, but starts as a flat red rash in the convex skin creases. It may appear red and shiny and may or may not also have papules. Untreated, it may become more widespread or severe. Some cases of diaper dermatitis are caused by overgrowth of C. albicans (see Fig. 24.9 and the section on fungal infections). Nursing Management Prevention is the best management of diaper dermatitis. Topical products such as ointments or creams containing vitamins A, D, and E; zinc oxide; or petrolatum are helpful to provide a barrier to the skin. Teaching Guidelines 24.1 gives further information on prevention and management of diaper dermatitis. See above for treatment of diaper rash caused by C. albicans infection. Teaching Guidelines 24.1 PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF DIAPER DERMATITIS Change diapers frequently. Change stool-soiled diapers as soon as possible. Avoid rubber pants. Gently wash the diaper area with a soft cloth, avoiding harsh soaps. Use baby wipes in most children, but avoid wipes that contain fragrance or preservatives. Once a rash has occurred, follow all the prevention tips above and add the following: Allow the infant or child to go diaperless for a period of time each day to allow the rash to heal. Blow-dry the diaper area/rash area with the dryer set on the warm (not hot) setting for 3 to 5 minutes. Take Note! Discourage parents from using any type of baby powder to avoid the risk of aspiration; inhalation of talcum-containing powders may result 2011). Atopic Dermatitis Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is one of the disorders in the atopy family (along with asthma and allergic rhinitis). Atopic dermatitis affects 10% to 20% of U.S. children and up to 90% of children with atopic dermatitis develop symptoms before 5 years of age (Tofte, 2008). About half of the children who have atopic dermatitis will also develop allergic rhinitis and/or asthma (Marino & Fine, 2009; Ogles, 2008). The chronic itching associated with atopic dermatitis causes a great deal of psychological distress. The child's self-image may be affected, particularly if the rash is extensive. Difficulty sleeping may occur because of the itching. The child is irritable and has difficulty concentrating, and family life is disrupted. Parents' stress related to the child's condition may increase the child's anxiety and lead to an increase in itching and scratching. The child may outgrow atopic dermatitis, its severity may decrease as the child approaches adulthood, or the child may continue to have difficulties into the adult years. Bacterial superinfection may occur as a complication. Therapeutic management includes good skin hydration, application of topical corticosteroids or immune modulators, oral antihistamines for sedative effects, and antibiotics if secondary infection occurs. Pathophysiology Atopic dermatitis is a chronic disorder characterized by extreme itching and inflamed, reddened, and swollen skin. It has a relapsing and remitting nature. The skin reaction occurs in response to specific allergens, usually food (especially eggs, wheat, milk, and peanuts) or environmental triggers (e.g., molds, dust mites, and cat dander). Other factors, such as high or low ambient temperatures, perspiring, scratching, skin irritants, or stress, may contribute to flare-ups. When the child encounters a triggering antigen, antigen- presenting cells stimulate interleukins to begin the inflammatory process. The skin begins to feel pruritic and the child starts to scratch. The sensation of itchiness comes first, and then the rash becomes apparent. The scratching causes the rash to appear. Sweating causes atopic dermatitis to worsen, as does excessively humid or dry environments. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 880 . Assessment findings pertinent to atopic dermatitis are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Wiggling or scratching Dry skin Scratch marks noticed by the parents Disrupted sleep Irritability Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as: Family history of atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, or asthma Child's history of asthma or allergic rhinitis Food or environmental allergies Determine the onset of the rash; its location, progression, and severity; and response to treatments used so far. Note medicationsused to treat the rash, as well as other medications the child may be taking. Physical Examination Physical examination consists of inspection and observation and auscultation. INSPECTION AND OBSERVATION Observe whether the infant is wiggling or the child is actively scratching. Carefully inspect the skin. Document dry, scaly, or flaky skin, as well as hypertrophy and lichenification ( Fig. 24.11 ). If lesions are present they may be dry lesions or weepy papules or vesicle s (fluid-filled lesions). In children younger than 2 years old, the rash is most likely to occur on the face, scalp, wrists, and extensor surfaces of the arms or legs. In older children it may occur anywhere on the skin, but is found more commonly on the flexor areas. Note erythema or warmth, which may indicate associated secondary bacterial infection. Document areas of hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation, which may have resulted from a prior exacerbation of atopic dermatitis or its treatment. Inspect the eyes, nose, and throat for symptoms of allergic rhinitis. FIGURE 24.11 Atopic dermatitis rash is red, dry, and scaly. AUSCULTATION AUSCULTATION Auscultate the lungs for wheezing (commonly found in the associated condition of asthma). Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels may be elevated in the child with atopic dermatitis. Skin prick allergy testing may determine the food or environmental allergen to which the child is sensitive. Nursing Management Nursing management of the child with atopic dermatitis focuses on promoting skin hydration, maintaining skin integrity, and preventing infection. Promoting Skin Hydration First and foremost, avoid hot water and any skin or hair product containing perfumes, dyes, or fragrance. Bathe the child twice daily in warm (not hot) water. Use a mild soap to clean only the dirty areas. Recommended mild soaps or cleansing agents include: Unscented Dove or Dove for sensitive skin Tone Caress Oil of Olay Cetaphil Aquanil Slightly pat the child dry after the bath, but do not rub the skin with the towel. Leave the child moist. Apply prescribed topical ointments or creams to the affected area. Apply fragrance-free moisturizer over the prescribed topical medication and all over the child's body. Recommended moisturizers include: Eucerin, Moisturel, Note! Vaseline or generic petrolatum is an inexpensive, readily available moisturizer. Apply moisturizer multiple times throughout the day. Avoid clothing made of synthetic fabrics or wool. Avoid triggers known to exacerbate atopic dermatitis. Taking evening primrose oil and other essential fatty acids as an oral supplement over a period of at least 6 weeks may produce an improvement in the atopic dermatitis (Senapati, Banerjee, & Gangopadhyay, 2008). If not initially recommended by the physician or nurse practitioner, the parent should consult with him or her first before starting these supplements. Headache and nausea are rare adverse effects of these supplements and, if they occur, are usually mild. Chamomile preparations for topical use may also be effective and are generally considered safe. Maintaining Skin Integrity and Preventing Infection Cut the child's fingernails short and keep them clean. Avoid tight clothing and heat. Use 100% cotton bed sheets and pajamas. In addition to keeping the child's skin well moisturized, it is extremely important to prevent the child from scratching. Scratching causes the rash to appear and further scratching may lead to secondary infection. Antihistamines given at bedtime may sedate the child enough to allow him or her to sleep without awakening because of itching. During the waking hours, behavior modification may help to keep the child from scratching. Have the parent keep a diary for 1 week to determine the pattern of scratching. Help the parent to determine specific strategies that may raise the child's awareness of scratching. A hand-held clicker or counter may help to identify the scratching episode for the child, thus raising awareness. The use of diversion, imagination, and play may help to distract the child from scratching. The parent and child may create a game together that results in the child participating in a behavior rather than scratching. Pressing the skin or clenching the fist may replace scratching. It is important for the child to stay active to distract his or her mind from the itching. It is important for the parent to positively reinforce and reward the desired behaviors. Contact Dermatitis Contact dermatitis is a cell-mediated response to an antigenic substance exposure. The first exposure is the sensitization phase. The antigen attaches to cells that migrate to regional lymph nodes and have contact with T lymphocytes, where recognition of antigen is developed. During the second phase, elicitation, contact with the antigen results in T-lymphocyte proliferation and release of inflammatory mediators. An allergic response occurs within 24 to 48 hours after contact with the substance. Contact dermatitis may occur as a result of allergy to nickel or cobalt found in clothing hardware and dyes, and chemicals found in many hygiene products and cosmetics. One of the more common causes of contact dermatitis in children results from exposure to highly allergenic plants such as Toxicodendron radicans (poison ivy), Toxicodendron quercifolium (Eastern poison oak), (Western poison oak), and Toxicodendron vernix (poison sumac). Direct or indirect contact with the plant's oleoresin found in the leaves, stems, and roots results in an allergic reaction. Even contact with dormant plants or plants perceived to be dead may cause an allergic response. The rash is extremely pruritic and may last for 2 to 4 weeks; lesions continue to appear during the illness. Contact dermatitis is not contagious and does not spread either to other parts of the affected child's skin or to other people. Scratching does not spread the rash, but it may cause skin damage or secondary infection. Complications of contact dermatitis include secondary bacterial skin infections and lichenification or hyperpigmentation,particularly in dark-skinned people. Therapeutic management is directed toward management of itching and the use of topical corticosteroids. Moderate-potency topical glucocorticoid cream or ointment is used for mild to moderate contact dermatitis, and high-potency preparations are used for more severe cases. Some severe cases of contact dermatitis may require the use of systemic steroids. Nursing Assessment Elicit the health history, noting onset, description, location, and progression of the rash, which may be intensely pruritic and vesicular if caused by allergenic plant exposure (see Fig. 24.12 ). Rashes caused by other allergic exposure may be quite variable in their appearance and intensity of pruritus. Document treatment used thus far, and the child's response to it. Examine the skin, noting rash that may vary from maculopapular in nature to an erythematous papulovesicular rash at the site of contact. Some lesions may be weeping; others may erupt and form a crust. The lesions are often distributed in an asymmetric linear pattern on exposed body parts if caused by allergenic plant exposure. If the child's shirt came in contact with the plant and then the shirt was removed by pulling it over the head, there may be widespread lesions over both sides of the face. Lesions near the eyes often cause significant eyelid edema. FIGURE 24.12 Note vesicular rash in linear formation characteristic of poison ivy. Take Note! Nickel dermatitis may occur from contact with jewelry, eyeglasses, belts, or clothing snaps. Infants may display a small red circle with scaling at the site of contact with sleeper snaps. Nursing Management Contact dermatitis may be prevented by avoiding contact with the allergen. When the condition does occur, nursing management focuses on relieving the discomfort associated with the rash. Administer topical or systemic corticosteroids as prescribed and teach the family about use of the medications. Teaching Guidelines 24.2 gives more information about the treatment and prevention of contact dermatitis. Teaching Guidelines 24.2PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF CONTACT DERMATITIS Prevention Wear long sleeves and long pants on outings in the woods. Identify and remove offending plants in the yard by using a commercial weed or underbrush killer. Vinyl gloves (not rubber or latex) are an effective barrier. The plant's oil residue may be on clothes, pets, garden and sports equipment, and toys; wash those well with soap and water. If contact occurs, wash vigorously with soap and water within 10 minutes of contact. Zanfel and Tecnu Oak-N-Ivy Outdoor Skin Cleanser (both soap mixtures) may prevent rash if used to wash the skin soon after exposure. Ivy Block (an organoclay) is the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved preventive treatment for contact dermatitis related to poison ivy, oak, or sumac. (Visit for web links that will provide additional information.) It is applied to the skin before possible exposure. Treatment Wash lesions daily with mild soap and water. Mildly d\u00e9bride crusted lesions. Tepid baths (colloidal oatmeal such as Aveeno) are helpful to decrease itching. Avoid hot baths or showers, as they aggravate itching. Apply corticosteroid preparations topically as directed (if using high-potency preparations, do not cover with an occlusive dressing). Weeping lesions may be wrapped lightly; avoid occlusion. Burow or Domeboro solutions with a dressing applied twice daily for 20 minutes may help to dry weepy lesions. Over-the-counter preparations such as calamine lotion or Ivy Rest may reduce itching and help the lesions to dry. Do not use topical antihistamines, benzocaine, or neomycin because of the potential for sensitization. Erythema Multiforme Erythema multiforme, though uncommon in children, is an acute, self-limiting hypersensitivity reaction. It may occur in response to viral infections, such as adenovirus or Epstein-Barr virus; Mycoplasma pneumoniae penicillins, or immunizations) or food reaction. Stevens-Johnson syndrome is the most severe form of erythema multiforme and most often occurs in response to certain medications or to Mycoplasma infection ( Box 24.1 ). Therapeutic management of erythema multiforme is generally supportive because it resolves on its own. Nursing Assessment Note history of fever, malaise, and achiness (myalgia). Determine onset and progression of rash, and presence of pruritus (itchiness) and burning. Document the child's temperature upon assessment. Inspect the skin for lesions, which most commonly occur over the hands and feet and extensor surfaces of the extremities, with spread to the trunk. Lesions progress from erythematous macules (flat reddened areas) to papules, plaques, vesicles, and target lesions over a period of days (hence the name multiforme ) ( Fig. 24.13 ). BOX 24.1 STEVENS-JOHNSON SYNDROME 1- to 14-day history of fever, malaise, headache, generalized aching, emesis, and diarrhea Sudden onset of high fever with rash appearing Rash is characteristic of erythema multiforme with the addition of inflammatory bullae on at least two types of mucosa (lips, oral mucosa, bulbar conjunctivae, or anogenital region). Mortality rate of 10% (Marino & Fine, 2009), particularly when the genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and respiratory tracts are involved Treatment: hospitalization, isolation, fluid and electrolyte support, treatment of secondary infection of the lesions Ophthalmologic consult to determine if corneal ulceration, keratitis, uveitis, or panophthalmitis is presentNursing Management Discontinue the medication or food if it is identified as the cause. Ensure that treatment for Mycoplasma is instituted if present. Encourage oral hydration. Administer analgesics and antihistamines as needed to promote comfort. If oral lesions are present, encourage soothing mouthwashes or use of topic oral anesthetics in the older child or teen. Oral lesions may be d\u00e9brided with hydrogen peroxide. Urticaria Urticaria, commonly called hives, is a type I hypersensitivity reaction caused by an immunologically mediated antigen-antibody response of histamine release from mast cells. Vasodilation and increased vascular permeability result, and erythema and wheals then occur. Urticaria usually begins rapidly and may disappear in a few days or may take up to 6 to 8 weeks to resolve. The most common causes of this reaction are foods, drugs, animal stings, infections, environmental stimuli (e.g., heat, cold, sun, tight clothes), and stress. Therapeutic management focuses on identifying and removing the cause as well as providing antihistamines or steroids. FIGURE 24.13 Erythema multiforme. Nursing Assessment Obtain a detailed history of new foods, medications, symptoms of a recent infection, changes in environment, or unusual stress. Inspect the skin, noting raised, edematous hives anywhere on the body or mucous membranes ( Fig. 24.14 ). The hives are pruritic, blanch when pressed, and may migrate. Angioedema may also be present and is identifiable as subcutaneous edema and warmth, occurring most frequently on the extremities, face, or genitalia. Carefully assess airway and breathing, as hypersensitivity reactions may affect respiratory status. Nursing Management Identify and remove the offending trigger. Discontinue antibiotics. Administer antihistamines, corticosteroids, and topical antipruritics as prescribed. Inform the child and family that the episode should resolve within a few days. If it lasts up to 6 weeks, the child should be reevaluated (Burns et al., 2009). Advise the family to obtain a medical alert bracelet for the child if the reaction is severe.FIGURE 24.14 Ill-appearing child with urticaria. (Used with permission from Fleisher GR, Ludwig S, Baskin MN. Atlas of pediatric emergency medicine. Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2004:88). Take Note! In an emergency situation when airway and breathing are compromised, subcutaneous epinephrine followed by intravenous (IV) diphenhydramine and corticosteroids is necessary. Seborrhea Seborrhea is a chronic inflammatory dermatitis that may occur on the skin or scalp. In infants it occurs most often on the scalp and is commonly referred to as cradle cap. Infants may also manifest seborrhea on the nose or eyebrows, behind the ears, or in the diaper area. It usually resolves over a period of weeks to months (Shelov & Altman, 2009). Adolescents manifest seborrhea on the scalp (dandruff) and on the eyebrows and eyelashes, behind the ears, and between the shoulder blades. It is thought that seborrhea is an inflammatory reaction to the fungus Pityrosporum ovale and is worsened by sebaceous involvement related to maternal hormones in the infant and androgens in the adolescent. Therapeutic management includes treating the skin lesions with corticosteroid creams or lotions. Antidandruff shampoos containing selenium sulfide, ketoconazole, or tar are used to treat the scalp. Nursing Assessment Elicit the health history, determining onset and progression of skin and scalp changes. Note response to treatment used so far. In the infant, inspect the scalp and forehead, behind the ears, and the neck, trunk, and diaper area for thick or flaky greasy yellow scales ( Fig. 24.15 ). In the adolescent, note mild flakes in the hair with yellow greasy scales on the scalp, forehead, and eyebrows; behind the ears; or between the scapulae.FIGURE 24.15 Severe cradle cap (yellow, greasy-appearing plaques). Nursing Management Wash or shampoo the affected areas with a mild soap. Apply anti-inflammatory cream to skin lesions if prescribed. In the infant, apply mineral oil to the scalp, massage it in well with a washcloth, and then shampoo 10 to 15 minutes later, using a brush to gently lift the crusts; do not forcibly remove the crusts. If needed, selenium sulfide shampoo may safely be used on the infant, following the aforementioned procedure. The adolescent may require daily shampooing with an antidandruff shampoo. Psoriasis Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with periods of remission and exacerbation; control is possible with conscientious therapy. The incidence of psoriasis depends on climate and genetics. For example, it is less common in tropical areas and dark- skinned people. About 10% to 15% of new cases are diagnosed in children younger than 10 years of age annually (Meffert, Arffa, & Gordon, 2011). Hyperproliferation of the epidermis occurs, with a rash developing at sites of mechanical, thermal, or physical trauma. Therapeutic management includes skin hydration, use of tar preparations, ultraviolet light, or tazarotene (a topical retinoid). Narrow-band ultraviolet light has been used with some success in children with severe psoriasis. Nursing Assessment Note family history of psoriasis. Determine onset and progression of rash, as well as treatments used and the response to treatment. Question the child about pruritus, which is usually absent with psoriasis. Inspect the skin for erythematous papules that coalesce to form plaques, most frequently found on the scalp, elbows, genital area, and knees ( Fig. 24.16 ). Facial plaques may also occur and are more common in children than adults. The plaques have a silvery or yellow-white scale and sharply demarcated borders. Layers of scale may be present, which, when removed, result in pinpoint bleeding (referred to as the Auspitz sign). Plaques on the scalp may result in alopecia. Examine the palms and soles, noting fissures and scaling. Skin biopsy, though rarely needed for diagnosis, will show hyperplastic epidermis, with thinning of the papillary [3rd ed.]. Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2009.) Nursing Management Exposure to sunlight may promote healing, but take care not to allow the child to become sunburned. Apply skin moisturizers or emollients daily to prevent dry skin and flare-ups. Apply topical anti-inflammatory creams as prescribed during flare-ups. Apply tar shampoos or skin preparations. Use mineral oil and warm towels to soak and remove thick plaques. Thinking About Development E mily Wilson is a 15-year-old female with a history of moderate psoriasis. She experiences significant scaling along her hairline, forehead, scalp, and arms. Hypopigmentation and striae are beginning to occur on her arms as a result of topical medication use. She is a talented ballerina but expresses increasing concerns about her skin alterations showing while she is performing. How does Emily's developmental stage affect self-care related to her psoriasis? What is the most appropriate approach for the nurse to take to educate Emily about control of her psoriasis? How will the nurse best promote an appropriate body image for Emily?ACNE Acne, the most common skin condition occurring in childhood (Burch & Morelli, 2011), is a disorder that affects the pilosebaceous unit. It affects males and females, as well as all ethnic groups. Overall, males tend to have more severe disease than females, probably because of the androgen influence (Burch & Morelli, 2011). Acne that persists past the usual course of time for infantile or adolescent acne may be caused by endocrine abnormalities. It may also occur in response to the use of certain types of drugs such as corticosteroids, androgens, phenytoin, and others. The usual presentation and nursing management of acne neonatorum and acne vulgaris is presented below. Acne Neonatorum Acne neonatorum occurs as a response to the presence of maternal androgens and affects about 20% of newborns (O'Connor, McLaughlin, & Ham, 2008). It generally appears between 2 and 4 weeks of age and lasts up to 4 to 6 months, sometimes lasting until 2 to 3 years of age (O'Connor et al., 2008). Neonatal acne affects boys more often than girls and tends to be more severe in boys. Usually no treatment is necessary, but in severe cases there is a risk of scarring, so a topical preparation may be prescribed. Nursing Assessment Note oily face or scalp. Examine the face (especially the cheeks), upper chest, and back for inflammatory papules and pustules. Document absence of fever. Nursing Management Instruct parents to avoid picking or squeezing the pimples; to do so places the infant at risk for secondary bacterial infection and cellulitis. Teach parents to wash the affected areas daily with clear water. Avoid using fragranced soaps or lotions on the area with acne. Inform the parents that as the newborn's hormones stabilize over time, the acne usually resolves without additional intervention. Acne Vulgaris Acne vulgaris affects 50% to 85% of adolescents between the ages of 12 and 16 years, and endogenous androgens play a role in its development (Burch & Morelli, 2011). It occurs most frequently on the face, chest, and back. Risk factors for the development of acne vulgaris include preadolescent or adolescent age, male gender (due to the presence of androgens), an oily complexion, Cushing syndrome, or another disease process resulting in increased androgen production. Pathophysiology The sebaceous gland produces sebum and is connected by a duct to the follicular canal that opens on the skin's surface. Androgenous hormones stimulate sebaceous gland proliferation and production of sebum. These hormones exhibit increased activity during the pubertal years. Abnormal shedding of the outermost layer of the skin (the stratum corneum) occurs at the level of the follicular opening, resulting in a keratin plug that fills the follicle. The sebaceous glands increase sebum production. Bacterial overgrowth of Propionibacterium acnes occurs because the presence of sebum and keratin in the follicular canal creates an excellent environment for growth. Inflammation occurs as the follicular wall perforates, allowing the contents to leak into nearby tissue. Therapeutic Management Therapeutic management focuses on reducing P. acnes, decreasing sebum production, normalizing skin shedding, and eliminating inflammation. Teach the adolescent to cleanse the skin gently twice a day. Medication therapy may include a combination of benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, retinoids, and topical or oral antibiotics. Isotretinoin (Accutane) may be used in severe cases. Drug Guide 24.1 gives further information on these medications. In girls, oral contraceptives may help lessen acne by decreasing the effects of androgens on the sebaceous glands. Diode laser or blue ultraviolet light therapy may also be used. CO 2 lasers and dermabrasion may be used to treat pitted scarring. Nursing Assessment Note history of onset of acne lesions, as well as family history of acne. Determine medication use; certain medications may hasten the onset of acne or worsen it when already present. In particular, note use of corticosteroids, androgens, lithium, phenytoin, andisoniazid. Document history of an endocrine disorder, particularly one that results in hyperandrogenism. In girls, note worsening of acne 2 to 7 days before the start of the menstrual period. Inspect the skin for lesions (particularly on the face and upper chest and back, which are the areas of highest sebaceous activity). Note presence, distribution, and extent of noninflammatory lesions, such as open and closed comedones, as well as inflammatory lesions such as papules, pustules, nodules, or cysts (open comedones are commonly referred to as blackheads and closed comedones as whiteheads; see Fig. 24.17 ). Examine the skin for hypertrophic scarring resulting from inflammatory lesions. Table 24.3 explains the acne classification. Note oily skin and oily hair, which result from increased sebum production. Determine remedies that have been used and the extent of success of those treatments. Assess the child's or teen's feelings about the disorder. FIGURE 24.17 Acne vulgaris. Nursing Management Avoid oil-based cosmetics and hair products, as their use may block pores, contributing to noninflammatory lesions. Look for cosmetic products labeled as noncomedogenic. Headbands, helmets, and hats may exacerbate the lesions by causing friction. Dryness and peeling may occur with acne treatment, so encourage the child to use a humectant moisturizer. Mild cleansing with soap and water twice daily is appropriate. Avoid excessive scrubbing and harsh chemical or alcoholbased cleansers. Avoid picking or squeezing the lesions. Using a noncomedogenic sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher may reduce the risk of postinflammatory discoloration from acne lesions (Burns et al., 2009). Teach adolescents that the prescribed topical medications must be used daily and that it may take 4 to 6 weeks to see results. Avoid the use of over-the-counter preparations because they are irritating and aggravate the drying effect of prescription acne treatments. Instruct boys to shave gently and avoid using dull razors, so as not to further irritate the condition. Adolescent girls taking isotretinoin (Accutane) who are sexually active must be on a pregnancy prevention program because the drug causes defects in fetal development (Fulton, 2011) ( Box 24.2 ).BOX 24.2 DECREASING RISK OF FETAL EXPOSURE TO ISOTRETINOIN: iPLEDGE As of 2006, physicians, pharmacists, and patients are required to register in the iPLEDGE program before they prescribe, dispense, or receive isotretinoin (Accutane). The iPLEDGE program is a central registry requiring monthly input as noted below in order to continue isotretinoin treatment.

What education will be important for Paxton?INJURIES Children, by their inquisitive natures, developmental immaturity, and skin's properties, are prone to experience a variety of skin injuries. Pressure ulcers are most likely to occur in hospitalized or otherwise immobile children. Typical healthy, active children are likely to suffer cuts, abrasions, foreign body penetration, burns and other thermal injuries, bites, and stings. Pressure Ulcers Skin breakdown involves changes in intact skin, which may range from blanchable erythema to deep pressure ulcers. The term \"pressure ulcer\" refers to damage to the skin resulting in skin loss and development of a crater that may range from mild to deep. The incidence of pressure ulcers in critically ill children is 18% to 27% (Schindler et al., 2011). Pressure ulcers develop from a combination of factors, including immobility or decreased activity, decreased sensory perception, increased moisture, impaired nutritional status, inadequate tissue perfusion, and the forces of friction and shear. Common sites of pressure ulcers in hospitalized children include the occiput and toes, while children who require wheelchairs for mobility have pressure ulcers in the sacral or hip area more frequently. Nursing Assessment Note history of immobility (chronic, related to a condition such as paralysis) or lengthy hospitalization, particularly in intensive care. Inspect the skin for areas of erythema or warmth. Note ulceration of the skin. Use the facility's wound assessment scale to document the extent of the ulcer. Take a photo of the ulcer if possible. Nursing Management Position the child to alleviate pressure on the area of the ulcer. Use specialized beds or mattresses to prevent further pressure areas from developing. Perform prescribed wound care meticulously, noting the formation of granulation tissue as the ulcer begins to heal. Prevent pressure ulcers in the child who is hospitalized for long periods of time by turning the child frequently, assessing the entire surface of the child's skin at least every shift, using pressure-alleviating beds and mattresses, and maintaining the child's nutritional status. Minor Injuries Children suffer minor injuries very frequently. Because of their developmental immaturity and inquisitive nature, children often attempt tasks they are not yet capable of or take risks that an adult would not, often resulting in a fall or other accident. Minor injuries include minor cuts and abrasions, as well as skin penetration of foreign bodies such as splinters or glass fragments. The break in the skin allows an entry point for bacteria, and the complication of cellulitis may occur. Treatment is directed at cleaning the wound and preventing infection. Nursing Assessment Obtain the history from the child or caregiver to determine whether dirt or a foreign object may be present in the wound. Inspect the wound, noting depth of injury, a foreign body, and bleeding. Nursing Management Cleanse the wound with mild soap and water or with an antibacterial cleanser. Wet gauze helps to scrub away fine and large sand particles. Remove pieces of loose skin with sterile scissors, foreign particles with sterile forceps, and road tar with petrolatum. Small abrasions and minor, well-approximated cuts may be left open to the air. Apply a small amount of antibacterial ointment and cover large abrasions with a loose dressing. Change the dressing 12 hours later and redress after cleaning the wound. Leave it open to air after 24 hours have passed from the time of injury. Calendula preparations are presumed to be safe for topical use and may speed wound healing. Chamomile may help to dry a weeping wound, and allergic reactions to the herb are rare (Ehrlich, 2008). Assess the wound daily for signs of infection, which include purulence, warmth, edema, increasing pain, and erythema that extends past the margin of the cut or abrasion. BurnsBurns are a common preventable mechanism of injury among children and adolescents. Young children are at highest risk for burns and the mortality rate from burns is highest in children younger than 6 years of age (Bergen, Chen, Warner, & Fingerhut, 2008). Specifically, burns are the third-leading cause of death from unintentional injury in children between 1 and 4 years of age (Bergen et al., 2008). Most pediatric burn-related injuries do not result in death, but injuries from burns often cause extreme pain and extensive burns can result in serious disfigurement. Children younger than 10 years of age are at highest risk of scald and contact burns (accidental touching or intentional child abuse) and from burns related to fire (Quilty, 2010). Children 10-to-18 years of age often suffer scald burns when cooking or fire-related burns due to lack of judgment based on developmental level (Quilty, 2010). Carbon monoxide poisoning often occurs in conjunction with burns as a result of smoke inhalation, and infants and children are at greater risk for carbon monoxide poisoning than adults. See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Great advances have been made in the care of children with serious burns. As a result of improved burn care, children who in the past would have died as a result of burns over large body surface areas have a much greater chance of survival (Quilty, 2010). Conventional wisdom is that children with severe burns should be transferred to a specialized burn unit. The Committee on Trauma of the American College of Surgeons has developed the following criteria for referral of burned persons to a burn unit: Partial thickness burns greater than 10% of total body surface area Burns that involve the face Burns that involve the hands and feet, genitalia, perineum, or major joints Electrical burns, including lightning injury Chemical burns Inhalation injury Burn injury in children who have preexisting conditions that might affect their care Persons with burns and traumatic injuries Persons who will require special social, emotional, or long-term rehabilitative care Burned children in a hospital without qualified personnel or equipment for the care of children (Gamelli, 2007) The old terms used to describe the depth of burns as first, second, and third degree have been replaced by contemporary terminology. Burns are now classified according to the extent of injury and the terminology used to describe each type includes superficial, partial thickness, deep partial thickness, and full thickness (Quilty, 2010). Superficial burns involve only epidermal injury and usually heal without scarring or other sequelae within 4 to 5 days. In partial-thickness burns, injury occurs not only to the epidermis but also to portions of the dermis. These burns usually heal within about 2 weeks and carry a minimal risk of scar formation. Deep partial-thickness burns take longer to heal, may scar, and result in changes in nail and hair appearance as well as sebaceous gland function in the affected area. They may require surgical intervention. Full-thickness burns result in significant tissue damage as they extend through the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis. Extensive scarring results, as hair follicles and sweat glands are destroyed. Full-thickness burns require a significant time to heal. If underlying tendons and/or bone are involved, the burn may be termed fourth degree. Contractures and limited function may occur as a complication of full-thickness burns. Skin grafting is usually necessary. Full or partially circumferential burns may result in ischemia from loss of blood flow related to progressive swelling of the area. PathophysiologyBurned tissue begins to coagulate after the injury, and direct coagulation and microvascular reactions in the adjacent dermis may extend the burn. The blood vessels demonstrate increased capillary permeability, resulting in vasodilatation. This leads to increased hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries, causing water, electrolytes, and protein to leak out of the vasculature and result in significant edema. Edema forms very rapidly in the first 18 hours after the burn, peaking at around 48 hours. Capillary permeability then returns to normal between 48 and 72 hours after the burn and the lymphatics can reabsorb the edema fluid. Diuresis occurs, ridding the body of the excess fluid. Fluid loss from burned skin occurs at an amount that is 5 to 10 times greater than that from undamaged skin, and this fluid loss continues until the damaged surface is healed or grafted. Initially, the severely burned child experiences a decrease in cardiac output, with a subsequent hypermetabolic response during which cardiac output increases dramatically. During this heightened metabolic state, the child is at risk for insulin resistance and increased protein catabolism. Children who are burned during an indoor or chemical fire are at an increased risk of respiratory injury. Children who have aspirated hot liquids are particularly at risk for airway-altering edema. Therapeutic Management Therapeutic management of burns focuses on fluid resuscitation, wound care, prevention of infection, and restoration of function. Burn infections are treated with antibiotics specific to the causative organism. If invasive burn damage occurs, surgery may be necessary. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 880 . Upon arrival, evaluate the child with burns to determine if he or she will require intensive management. Remove any smoldering clothing. Obtain a brief history of the burn circumstances while you are assessing the child and providing care. Health History If the burn is severe or there is a potential for respiratory compromise, obtain a brief history while simultaneously evaluating the child and providing emergency care. If the burn does not appear to pose an immediate life-threatening risk, obtain an in-depth history. Elicit a description of how the burn occurred, noting date, time, and cause. Determine if smoke inhalation or an associated fall may have occurred. Document treatment that the parent or caregiver has provided to the child's burn so far. Note the child's recent health status, current medications, recent or chronic illness, and immunization status, in particular noting the date of the most recent tetanus vaccination. Determine whether the history being given sounds consistent with the type of burn injury that has occurred. Inquire about what caused the burn and if the event was witnessed by anyone. Spatter-type burns resulting from the child pulling a source of hot fluid onto himself or herself usually yield a nonuniform, asymmetric distribution of injury. In contrast, intentional scald injuries usually yield a uniform \"stocking\" or \"glove\" distribution when the child's extremity is held under very hot water as punishment (Giardino & Giardino, 2011). It is important for the nurse to pick up on clues in the health history that may indicate that the burn is a result of child abuse, rather than an accident ( Box 24.3 ). Children are also burned by curling irons, gasoline, fireworks, room heaters, ovens, and ranges. Obtain a detailed history about the circumstances surrounding these types of burns. Ask the parent what the home hot water heater temperature is. Physical Examination Emergency examination of the burned child consists of a primary survey followed by a secondary survey. The primary survey includes evaluation of the child's airway, breathing, and circulation. The secondary survey focuses on evaluation of the burns and other injuries. Box 24.4 gives information about emergency assessment of the burned child. Inspect the child's skin, noting erythema, blistering, weeping, or eschar (charred skin). BOX 24.3 SIGNS OF CHILD ABUSE-INDUCED BURNS Inconsistent history given when caregivers are interviewed separately Delay in seeking treatment by caregiver Uniform appearance of the burn, with clear delineation of burned and nonburned area (as with a hot object applied to the skin) In the case of a scald-induced burn, lack of spattering of water but evidence of so-called \"porcelain-contact sparing,\" where theportion of the child's skin that was in contact with the tub or sink is not burned (commonly seen with a forced immersion in extremely hot water used as punishment) Flexor-sparing burns or burns that involve the dorsum of the hand A stocking/glove pattern on the hands or feet (circumferential ring appearing around the extremity, resulting from a caregiver forcefully holding the child under extremely hot water) Adapted from Giardino, A. P., & Giardino, E. R. (2011). Physical child abuse clinical presentation. Retrieved June 5, 2011, from http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/915664-overview Classify the burn according to its severity. Superficial burns are painful, red, dry, and possibly edematous ( Fig. 24.18 ). Partial- thickness and deep partial-thickness burns are very painful and edematous and have a wet appearance or blisters ( Fig. 24.19 ). Full- thickness burns may be very painful or numb or pain-free in some areas. They appear red, edematous, leathery, dry, or waxy and may display peeling or charred skin ( Fig. 24.20 ). Note whether the burn is circumferential (encircling a body part) or partially circumferential. Take Note! Due to overlying blistering, it is difficult to accurately distinguish between partial- and full-thickness burns. In addition, in the case of third-degree burns, it is difficult to estimate burn depth during the initial evaluation. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests In the child with more extensive burns, electrolytes and complete blood count are used to measure fluid and electrolyte balance and to determine the possibility of infection, respectively. If wound infection is suspected, culture of the drainage will determine the particular bacteria. Nutritional indices such as albumin, transferrin, carotene, retinol, copper, cholesterol, calcium, thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, and iron may be evaluated when the child has severe or extensive burns. Pulmonary status may be evaluated via pulse oximetry and end-tidal CO 2 monitoring, arterial blood gases, and chest radiography. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy and xenon ventilation-perfusion scanning may be used to evaluate inhalation injury. Electrocardiographic monitoring is important for the child who has suffered an electrical burn to identify cardiac arrhythmias, which can be noted for up to 72 hours after a burn injury. BOX 24.4 EMERGENCY ASSESSMENT OF THE BURNED CHILD Primary Survey Assess the child's airway, noting whether it is patent, maintainable, or unmaintainable. Suspect airway injury from burn or smoke inhalation if any of the following are present: burns around the mouth, nose, or eyes; carbonaceous (black-colored) sputum; hoarseness or stridor. Evaluate the child's skin color, respiratory effort, symmetry of breathing, and breath sounds. Determine the pulse strength, perfusion status, and heart rate. Note extent and location of edema. Secondary Survey Determine burn depth. Estimate burn extent by determining the percentage of body surface area affected. Use a chart for estimation (see Fig. 24.21 ) or rapidly estimate by using the child's palm size, which is equivalent to about 1% of the child's body surface area. Inspect the child for other traumatic injuries (children who have jumped or fallen from a house fire may suffer cervical spine or internal injuries). Adapted from Jenkins, J. A. & Schraga, E. D.

FIGURE 24.19 Partial-thickness burn\u2014very painful, with blistering. Nursing Management Nursing management of the child who has been burned focuses first on stabilizing the child. Place the child on a cardiac/apnea monitor, measure the child with the Broselow tape, monitor pulse oximetry, and apply an end-tidal CO 2 monitor if the child is ventilated. Further management focuses on cleansing the burn, pain management, and prevention and treatment of infection. Fluid status and nutrition are important components of burn care, particularly in the early stages. Rehabilitation of the child with severe burnsis also an important nursing function. Providing child and family education about the prevention of burns as well as care of burns at home is critical. Nursing Care Plan 24.1 gives additional interventions related to fluid and nutritional management. FIGURE 24.20 Full-thickness burn\u2014color ranges from red to charred, or white, minimal pain, marked edema. Promoting Oxygenation and Ventilation Institute emergency airway management as needed. If the child requires intubation, make sure that the tracheal tube is taped in a very secure manner, as reintubations in these children will become increasingly difficult as the edema spreads. The burned child's respiratory status warrants vigilant evaluation and reevaluation, as airway edema that is secondary to a burn may not become evident until 2 days after the injury. Administer 100% oxygen via nonrebreather mask or bag-valve-mask ventilation to all children with severe burns. Continue to reassess the child's pulmonary status, adjusting the interventions as necessary (refer to Chapter 31 for further information about respiratory emergency care). Take Note! High levels of carboxyhemoglobin as a result of smoke inhalation may contribute to falsely high pulse oximetry readings (Jenkins & Schraga, 2011). Restoring and Maintaining Fluid Volume Several formulas are available for the calculation of resuscitative fluids in children. Most experts recommend that pediatric burn therapy include: Fluid calculation based on the body surface area burned ( Fig. 24.21 ) Use of a crystalloid (Ringer lactate) during the first 24 hours; in smaller children, a small amount of dextrose may be addedFIGURE 24.21 Calculate total body surface area (TBSA) affected by using the child's age and the area affected, as well as whether the burned area is second degree (partial thickness) or third degree (full thickness). Administration of most of the volume during the first 8 hours (amounts and timing of fluid volume resuscitation will vary from child to child) Reassessment of the child and adjustment of the fluid rate accordingly; fluid requirements greatly decrease after 24 hours and should be adjusted to reflect this. Administration of a colloid fluid later in therapy once capillary permeability is less of a concern Monitoring of the child's urine output as part of ongoing assessment of response to therapy, expecting at least 1 mL/kg/hour Daily weights obtained at the same time each day (the best indicator of fluid volume status) Monitoring of electrolyte levels (particularly sodium and potassium) for their return to normal levels Preventing Hypothermia Due to the loss of the protective dermis, children who are burned are at high risk for hypothermia and secondary infection. Therefore, take care to keep the child warm. Warm intravenous fluids before administration. Maintain a neutral thermal environment and monitor the child's temperature frequently. Cleansing the Burn Initially, it is very important to stop the burning. Therefore, remove charred clothing. Wash and rinse the burn thoroughly with mild soap and cool water from the tap. Never apply ice. Children who are burned with tar require special care. Remove tar with cool water and mineral oil. Do not routinely remove blisters because they provide a protective barrier; however, d\u00e9bridement isrecommended in certain cases where large blisters impede wound care. Wounds that are open require d\u00e9bridement. D\u00e9bridement involves the removal of loose skin and eschar (dead, charred skin). This procedure is usually performed with sterile scissors and a pair of forceps or with a gauze sponge. Gently cleanse the burned area; there is no advantage to aggressive scrubbing, and this technique only makes the pain more intense for the child. Wear a gown, mask, head covering, and gloves during dressing changes. D\u00e9bridement is a necessary, but often excruciatingly painful, procedure. Thus, pain management needs of the child are of utmost importance (refer to the pain management section below). When children return for evaluation of a wound that was previously seen in your facility, remove the dressing. Soak the dressing in lukewarm tap water to ease the removal of gauze, which may be stuck to the wound. The nurse plays an important role in ensuring that the dressing change goes smoothly. Be sure to: Have all dressing supplies ready. Provide pain medication as ordered. Promote good infection control technique among your colleagues. Assist with restraining young children, using the positions of comfort previously discussed in relation to atraumatic care. Encourage participation by the child's parents. Talk soothingly to the child, explain what you are going to do, and provide distraction during the procedure. Preventing Infection Prevention of infection is critical to successful outcomes for burned children. If the child's immunization status is unknown or if it has been 5 years or longer since the last tetanus vaccine, administer the tetanus vaccine (Jenkins & Schraga, 2011). If the child has never received tetanus vaccination, also give 250 units tetanus human immunoglobulin intravenously. Apply antibiotic ointment in conjunction with burn dressing changes. Refer to Drug Guide 24.1 for information about topical antibiotics. Membrane dressings such as biosynthetic, hydrocolloid, and antibiotic-impregnated foam dressings are alternatives to topical antibiotics and sterile dressings. Evaluate the child's wound during dressing changes, looking for wound redness, swelling, odor, or drainage. Strictly adhere to infection control procedures and hand hygiene to decrease the risk of burn infection. Maximize the child's nutritional status to decrease his or her susceptibility to a burn infection. Monitor the child's temperature for the development of fever. Upon discharge, instruct the parents about the signs of a wound infection. Managing Pain Pain management is of the utmost importance, and several options are available for the treatment of burn-related pain. Local anesthesia, sedatives, and systemic analgesics are commonly used. Children who have less severe burns that are managed at home can be given oral medications such as acetaminophen with codeine 30 to 45 minutes before dressing changes. In burns that result in more severe pain, the child should be hospitalized and given intravenous pain control with medications such as morphine sulfate. Midazolam (a sedative) may be used in conjunction with pain medication for pain reduction during dressing changes. Pain may also occur at any time of the day or night, not just in relation to dressing changes. Assess the child's pain status frequently using an age-appropriate pain assessment scale. Administer pain medications as prescribed and/or use nonpharmacologic techniques to alleviate or decrease the child's perception of pain. Atraumatic Care Immersion in virtual reality computer games before and during burn dressing changes provides an exceptionally powerful form of cognitive distraction. It appears to be most useful if instituted early in the child's course of treatment (Sharar et al., 2008). Treating Infected Burns The potential for burn infection increases if the child has a large, open burn wound and if there are other sources of infection, such as multiple intravenous lines. In addition, children who are immunocompromised have an increased risk of burn infection. S. aureus is the usual bacterium implicated in burn cellulitis and burn impetigo (Quilty, 2010). In burn wound cellulitis, the area around the burn becomes increasingly red, swollen, and painful early in the course of burn management. With invasive burn cellulitis, the burn develops a dark brown, black, or purplish color, with a discharge and foul odor. Burn impetigo is characterized by multifocal small superficial abscesses. Burn impetigo causes marked destruction of skin-grafted areas. Extensive infected burns may also become infected with a fungus.When an infection is suspected, antibiotics are usually started, pending wound culture results. Administer antibiotics as prescribed or antifungals if necessary. Providing Burn Rehabilitation Children who have suffered a significant burn injury face myriad physical and psychological challenges that extend well beyond the acute injury phase. Burned children most often exhibit anxiety and attention or behavioral problems (Pardo, Garcia, & Gomez-Cia, 2010). Skin grafting or special burn dressings are required for some children ( Box 24.5 ). Children who have suffered extensive burns often require multiple skin-grafting surgeries. Figures 24.22 and 24.23 show healed skin grafts. Extensive burns may also result in the need for pressure garments to decrease the risk of extensive scarring. Pressure garments are not comfortable and they must be worn continuously for at least 1 year, sometimes 2, but they have been shown to be very effective in reducing hypertrophic scarring resulting from significant burn injury. Physical therapy will usually be initiated in the critical care setting and will continue long after hospital discharge, sometimes throughout life. Positioning, exercise, and range of motion are necessary to maintain joint flexibility. Nurses play a key role in smoothing the transition from the acute care phase of life-saving interventions and frequent dressing changes to normal activities such as school and play. Body image considerations may have a significant impact on the child when he or she returns to school and should be addressed. Children with altered body image as a result of a burn might benefit from regular counseling and group therapy. Parents often need assistance with the behavioral challenges of caring for a child who is recovering from a burn injury. Various websites are available for support of persons who are burned. Links to websites are available on . BOX 24.5 SPECIAL BURN CARE AND SKIN GRAFTING To prevent infection and promote healing: Biosynthetic skin coverings such as Biobrane (silicone film bonded to flexible nylon fabric and purified collagen peptides) and Mepilex Ag (soft silicone soaked with silver) Kaltostat (calcium alginate dressing) is a brown seaweed extract that is spun into a fiber that is highly absorbent. It reacts with exudate on the wound to form a protective gel. Autograft allows for permanent coverage of a deep partial-thickness or full-thickness burn. Consists of child's own skin Split thickness consists of epidermis and superficial layers of dermis. The donor site heals completely. Full thickness consists of full dermal thickness. Cover the donor site with fine-mesh gauze or synthetic wound coverings to allow the site to heal. Adapted from Quilty, J. (2010). Pediatric burn management. Presented at meeting of the Florida Chapter of the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, Orlando, FL. Navigating through life after suffering a serious burn injury can be difficult for the child and family, and a skilled nurse can provide valuable assistance to families during the equally important, but less acute, phase of the journey.FIGURE 24.22 Healed mesh graft. FIGURE 24.23 Extensive grafting to the face. Preventing Burns and Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Instruct parents about prevention of burns. Explain that all homes should have working smoke detectors, and batteries should be changed yearly. Instruct families that all homes should be equipped with fire extinguishers, and adults and older teenagers should be taught how to operate them. Explain that children should sleep in fire-retardant sleepwear, parents should not smoke in the house or the car, and parents should keep lighters and matches out of children's reach. Young children are particularly susceptible to burns thatoccur in the kitchen, such as scalds from hot liquids and foods and burns from contact with hot burners or oven doors. Caution parents about the extreme danger that fireworks present to children. Teaching Guidelines 24.3 gives additional information for parents related to burn prevention. The booklet \"Burn Prevention Tips,\" which includes a coloring book, is available from the Shriners Hospitals for Children. A link to their website is provided on . Teaching Guidelines 24.3 BURN PREVENTION Keep hot water heater temperature lower than 120\u00b0F. Test bath water temperature before bathing children. Keep children away from open flames, stoves, and candles. Cook with pots on the inside of the stove with the handles turned in. Keep children away from the stove while cooking. Place hot liquids out of reach of children. Avoid drinking hot beverages while holding a child. Keep curling irons out of reach of children. Teach older children how to safely get out of the house in case of fire. Practice fire drills. Teach children to \"stop, drop, and roll\" if their clothes catch on fire. Children are at significant risk for burns related to hot water. Scald burns can occur when hot water comes into contact with the child's skin, even for a relatively short time. Since hot water presents such a serious risk to children, the temperature on all hot water heaters should be 120\u00b0F or lower. Figure 24.24 is a graph that shows how long a child can be exposed to water of various temperatures before a burn occurs. For example: If the water is 150\u00b0F, a child can receive a third-degree burn within 2 seconds. If the water is 140\u00b0F, it takes 6 seconds of exposure to cause a significant burn. If the water is 130\u00b0F, a child can be burned significantly in only 30 seconds. At 120\u00b0F, the recommended maximal home hot water heater temperature, it takes as long as 5 minutes of exposure to burn a person (plenty of time to get out of the tub!) (Accurate Building Inspectors, 2011). Instruct parents about prevention of carbon monoxide poisoning. All homes should have working carbon monoxide detectors, and batteries should be changed yearly. Teach parents the signs of carbon monoxide poisoning: headaches, dizziness, disorientation, and nausea. If the carbon monoxide detector sounds, turn off any potential sources of combustion, if possible, and evacuate all occupants immediately. Do not attempt to reenter the home until a qualified professional repairs the source of the carbon monoxide leak. Providing Burn Care at Home Teach parents about proper burn care in the home. Seek medical attention for burns when: The child has a second- or third-degree burn. Burns result from a fire, an electrical wire or socket, or chemicals. The child has a burn on the face, scalp, hands, feet, or genitals or over the joints. The burn appears to be infected. The burn is causing prolonged and significant pain. Concern exists that the burn was a result of abuse. If the burn is very extensive, even if it appears to be a first-degree burn, seek medical attention immediately. Teaching Guidelines 24.4 gives specific information about burn care at home.FIGURE 24.24 Length of hot water exposure that results in significant burns based on water temperature. (Used with permission of Accurate Building Inspectors. [2011]. Water temperature thermometry. Retrieved June 5, 2011, from http://www.accuratebuilding.com/services/legal/charts/hot_water_burn_scalding_graph.html ) Teaching Guidelines 24.4 PROVIDING BURN CARE AT HOME For First-Degree (Superficial) Burns Run cool water over the burned area until the pain lessens. Do not apply ice to the skin. Do not apply butter, ointment, or cream. Cover the burn lightly with a clean, nonadhesive bandage. Administer acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain. Have the child seen by the physician or nurse practitioner within 24 hours. Ongoing care: clean in tub or shower with fragrance-free mild soap; pat or air dry. Apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment. Cover with a nonadherent dressing such as Adaptic, and then cover with dry gauze. For More Extensive Burns Remove clothing only if it comes off easily or if it is still smoldering. Check the child's ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation) and perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if necessary. Do not apply butter, ointment, or any other type of cream. Cover the burn with a clean, lint-free bandage or sheet. Avoid applying large, wet sheets, as this can cause the child to become too cold. Do not attempt to break any blisters. If the child appears to be in shock, elevate the legs while protecting the burn and call 911. SunburnSunburn occurs as a result of overexposure to the ultraviolet (UV) rays of the sun. The erythema and eventual blisters occur as a result of the skin's blood flow changes as well as alterations in cell kinetics and pigment products in response to UV exposures. Erythema may occur within 4 hours and blisters within 6 hours. Excessive sun exposure has been linked to the development of skin cancer later in life (Burns et al., 2009). See Healthy People 2020. Sunburn is usually treated with cool compresses, cooling lotions, and oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Nursing Assessment Obtain the health history, noting recent sun exposure. Determine length of exposure and whether any type of sunscreen or sun block product was used. Note redness of the skin on the exposed areas. More severe areas will have a darker red, slightly purple hue. Blisters may be noted with more severe sunburn. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Nursing Management Cool compresses may help to cool the burn. Aloe vera gel applied topically may provide significant soothing. Rarely are adverse effects reported with the use of aloe vera gel. Administer a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory such as ibuprofen. Discourage hot showers or baths. Instruct the child to wear loose clothing and to ensure that burned areas are covered when going outside (until they are healed). If skin flaking occurs, discourage the child from \"peeling\" the flaked skin in order to prevent further injury. Refer to Chapter 9 for further information about safe sun exposure. Cold Injury The term \"frostbite\" implies freezing of the tissues. It is described on a continuum from first to fourth degree. When a child is exposed to an extremely cold environment, changes in cutaneous circulation help to maintain the core body temperature. Because circulation is shunted to the core, the most peripheral body parts are those at highest risk for frostbite. Local damage occurs when the tissue temperature drops to 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C). Initially skin sensation is lost, the vasculature constricts, and plasma leakage occurs. Ice crystals develop in the extracellular fluid, and eventually vascular stasis leads to endothelial cell damage, necrosis, and sloughing of dead tissue. Nursing Assessment Note history of cold exposure. Inquire about pain or numbness. Examine the skin for indications of frostbite. First-degree frostbite results in superficial white plaques with hemorrhagic blisters progressing tissue necrosis and sloughing in fourth-degree frostbite. Nursing ManagementRemove wet or tight clothing. Avoid vigorous massage to decrease the chance of damaging the skin further. Immerse the affected part in 104\u00b0F water for 15 to 30 minutes. Thawing may cause significant pain, so administer analgesics. Keep the thawed part loosely covered, warm, and dry. Splinting may be used to help decrease associated edema. Consult the wound care specialist or plastic surgeon for further management. Prevent frostbite by: Dressing warmly in layers, and keeping warm and dry Avoiding exertion Not playing outside when wind chill advisories are in effect, and locking doors with high locks to prevent toddlers from going outside Human and Animal Bites Yearly, significant emergency room visits occur as a result of bites from mammals. Dog bites account for the majority of injuries, but children may be bitten by other children, cats, or rodents (Hansen & Ahmed, 2010). The hand and face are common locations for animal bites. A dog is most often provoked to bite a child when the child is playing with the dog or when the child hits, kicks, hugs, grabs, or chases the dog. Therapeutic management involves cleansing and irrigating the wound, wound suturing or stapling if necessary, and administering topical and/or systemic antibiotic therapy. Rabies prophylaxis is indicated if the rabies status of the dog is unknown. Secondary bacterial infection of the bite wound with streptococci, staphylococci, or Pasteurella multocida may occur. Cat and human bites are the most likely to become infected (Hansen & Ahmed, 2010). Nursing Assessment Determine the history of the attack and whether it was provoked. Determine the child's tetanus vaccination status. Inspect the bite to determine the extent of laceration, avulsion, or crushing injury. Nursing Management Provide rabies immunoprophylaxis and a tetanus booster vaccination if indicated. Thoroughly cleanse the wound with soap and water or a povidone-iodine solution. Irrigate the wound well with normal saline after cleansing. If the animal may be rabid, cleanse the wound for at least 10 minutes with a virucidal agent such as povidone-iodine solution. Administer antibiotics as prescribed. Prevention of animal bites is important. Teach children the following: Never provoke a dog with teasing or roughhousing. Get adult permission before interacting with a dog, cat, or other animal that is not your pet. Do not bother an eating, sleeping, or nursing dog. Avoid high-pitched talking or screaming around dogs. Display a closed fist first for the dog to sniff. Keep ferrets away from the face. If a cat hisses or lashes out with the paw, leave it alone Never leave a child younger than 5 years of age alone with a dog (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009). Contact the local humane society for a dog bite prevention program that is appropriate for school-age children. Children may suffer significant emotional distress after being bitten. Nightmares and increased anxiety are common (National Health Service, 2010). Help children through this period by talking about the incident or reading books about this type of event. Insect Stings and Spider Bites Members of the Hymenoptera class of insects sting. This class includes bees, wasps, ants, yellow jackets, and hornets. Spiders inject their venom when they bite. Stings and bites usually result in a local reaction. A systemic or anaphylactic reaction to a Hymenoptera sting may also occur, possibly resulting in airway compromise (refer to Chapter 26 for additional information on anaphylaxis). Serious reactions may occur with brown recluse or black widow spider bites. This discussion will focus on local reactions. Local reactions to insect stings and spider bites include pruritus, pain, and edema. A hypersensitivity reaction thought to be mediated by IgE occurs in response to the venom. This may be a physiologic response to the antigens present in the insect's or spider's saliva and other fluids that are transmitted during stinging or biting. Bacterial superinfection may occur as a complication and as a result of scratching. Therapeutic management includes antihistamines to decrease itching and in some cases corticosteroids todecrease inflammation and swelling. Nursing Assessment Obtain the history of the bite or sting. Children are usually acutely aware when they have been stung by an insect, but spiders are generally not observed before the bite. Inspect the bite or sting, noting an urticarial wheal or papular reaction. A large local reaction may be mistaken for cellulitis. Note whether a stinger remains present. Assess the child's work of breathing to determine if a systemic reaction or anaphylaxis is occurring (refer to Chapter 26 ). Nursing Management Remove jewelry or constrictive clothing if the sting is on an extremity. Cleanse the wound with mild soap and water. If the stinger is present, scrape it away with your fingernail or a credit card. Apply ice intermittently to decrease pain and edema. Administer diphenhydramine as soon as possible after the sting in an attempt to minimize the reaction. Prevent insect stings and spider bites by wearing protective clothing and shoes when outdoors. Use insect repellants (with a maximum concentration of 30% N , N -diethyl-meta-toluamide [DEET] in infants and children older than 2 months) (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2010a). Teach children never to disturb a bee or wasp nest or an ant hill. KEY CONCEPTS The infant's epidermis is thinner, loses heat more readily, absorbs substances more easily, and is more accessible to bacterial invasion than the skin of the adult. The increased water content of the infant's skin compared with the adult's places the infant at increased risk of blister development and other skin alterations. The child's skin thickness and characteristics reach adult levels in the late teenage years. Children with dark skin tend to have more pronounced cutaneous reactions than children with lighter skin. Sebum production increases in the preadolescent and adolescent years, contributing to the development of acne at that time. Most bacterial skin infections are caused by Staphylococcus aureus and group A -hemolytic streptococcus. Skin scrapings placed on a slide and prepared with potassium chloride may be evaluated microscopically to determine the presence of fungus. Fungal skin infections, referred to collectively as tinea, may require up to several weeks of treatment. Contact dermatitis and atopic dermatitis both present as pruritic rashes, whereas Hypersensitivity responses may result in erythema multiforme or urticaria. occur with atopic whereas honey-colored crusting is common with impetigo. Erythema is a common finding with many skin disorders in children. Burns may result in significant weeping and fluid loss. Keeping the skin well moisturized is a key intervention in the management of atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Appropriate hygiene is of particular importance in integumentary disorders. Pain management, prevention of infection, and rehabilitation are the focus of nursing management for the burned child. The constant itch-rash-itch cycle of atopic dermatitis may have a considerable impact on the child's sleep, school functioning, and self-esteem. Acne vulgaris, particularly if moderate or severe, may have a significant negative effect on the teen's self-esteem. Teach children with chronic disorders such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and acne (and their parents) to cleanse and moisturize the skin properly, avoid particular skin irritants, and use medications appropriately. Many skin disorders are preventable. Teach families how to prevent contact dermatitis, burns, sunburn, frostbite, and bites and stings. Educate children and families about the importance of good soap-and-water cleansing of all minor skin injuries. REFERENCES Accurate Building Inspectors. (2011). Water temperature thermometry.

KEY TERMS anemia anisocytosis cell (RBC) splenomegaly white blood cell (WBC) Learning Objectives Upon completion of the chapter, you will be able to: 1. Identify major hematologic disorders that affect children. 2. Determine priority assessment information for children with hematologic disorders. 3. Analyze laboratory data in relation to normal findings and report abnormal findings. 4. Provide nursing diagnoses appropriate for the child and family with hematologic disorders.5. Identify priority interventions for children with hematologic disorders. 6. Develop a teaching plan for the family of children with hematologic disorders. 7. Identify resources for children and families with hematologic disorders or nutrition deficits. Shaun O'Malley, 10 months old, is being admitted to the pediatric unit after being brought to the clinic by his father for a small laceration that he thought needed stitches. His father states, \"I didn't think the cut was very deep. I was surprised by how long it bled.\" The hematologic system consists of the blood and blood-forming tissues of the body. These typically function together in a balance that affects the metabolism of the body. The three categories of cells are erythrocytes, or red blood cells (RBCs); thrombocytes, or platelets ; and leukocytes, or white blood cells (WBCs). RBCs are responsible for transporting nutrients and oxygen to the body tissues and waste products from the tissues. The platelets are responsible for clotting. WBCs are responsible for fighting infection. WBCs are further divided into granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils) and agranulocytes (lymphocytes and monocytes). All blood cells originate from a single type of cell called a multipotent stem cell, which goes on to differentiate into the various types of blood cells. Thrombopoietin (TPO) and interleukin-7 (IL-7) act on the cell and differentiate the cell into either myeloid or lymphoid progenitor cells. The lymphoid cells either, under the influence of IL-6, become B lymphocytes or change directly into T lymphocytes. The myeloid cells are differentiated in one of two ways, either by the action of erythropoietin (EPO) or granulocyte-monocyte colony- stimulating factor (GM-CSF). When the cell is acted upon by EPO, which is produced by the kidneys, the cell becomes the megakaryocyte, also known as the erythroid progenitor cell. The megakaryocyte is acted on by either EPO, to become the red blood cell, or TPO and IL-11, to become a megakaryocyte that goes on to form platelets. GM-CSF influences the cell to become the granulocyte, also known as the macrophage progenitor cell. These cells further differentiate under various influences to become the WBCs ( Fig. 25.1 ). Certain conditions may cause problems to develop within this system. These problems are related to either the production of the blood cells (too much or too little) or loss and destruction of these cells. Many factors are involved in the development of hematologic disorders, ranging from genetic causes to disorders resulting from injury, infection, or nutritional deficit. Nursing care for the child with a hematologic disorder is often multifaceted. A child who has iron-deficiency anemia requires adequate oxygenation and may require packed red blood cells; a child with hemophilia requires factor replacement and monitoring for safety. Nurses who care for children need to be familiar with common hematologic disorders of infancy, childhood, and adolescence so they can effectively intervene with children and their families. FIGURE 25.1 Process of blood cell formation.VARIATIONS IN PEDIATRIC ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY In the absence of a congenital defect, the hematologic system is intact and functional at birth. RBC and hemoglobin production as well as iron stores undergo changes in the first few months of life; after this time, hematologic function is stable. Red Blood Cell Production The production of blood cells in the embryo begins by 8 weeks' gestation. In the embryo, blood cells primarily form in the liver; this continues until a few weeks before delivery. Some cell production, lymphoid cells in particular, takes place in the spleen of the embryo, and the thymus is a site for some transient lymphocyte production. EPO, the hormone that regulates RBC production, is derived primarily from the liver in the fetus, and after birth the kidneys take over this production. Hemoglobin Three types of normal hemoglobin (Hgb) are present at any given time in the blood: Hgb A, Hgb F or fetal, and Hgb A 2 . After 6 months of age, Hgb A is the predominant type. In the neonatal period, the largest difference is with the RBCs. Fetal hemoglobin, which has a much shorter cell life, is present in higher quantities, putting the infant at risk for anemia and leading to problems with the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. As the production of the cells transfers from the liver to the bone marrow of the long and flat bones, the balance between oxygenation and production is affected. Iron The fetus receives iron through the placenta from the mother. The preterm infant misses out on the final weeks or months of transplacental iron transfer, putting him or her at increased risk for anemia (Cunningham et al., 2010). In the term infant, a period of physiologic anemia occurs between the age of 2 and 6 months. This is due to the fact that the infant demonstrates rapid growth and an increase in blood volume over the first several months of life, and maternally derived iron stores are depleted by 4 to 6 months of age. Sufficient iron intake is critical for the appropriate development of hemoglobin and RBCs. Therefore, the infant must ingest adequate quantities of iron either from breast milk or from iron-fortified formula in early infancy and other food sources in later infancy (Bryant, 2010). Adolescence is also a time of rapid growth, and intake of iron must increase.COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS Various medications as well as other medical treatments are used to treat hematologic disorders in children. Most of these treatments will require a physician's or nurse practitioner's order when the child is in the hospital. The most common treatments and medications are listed in Common Medical Treatments 25.1 and Drug Guide 25.1 . The nurse caring for the child with a hematologic disorder should be familiar with the procedures used, how the medications work, and common nursing implications related to their use. NURSING PROCESS OVERVIEW FOR THE CHILD WITH A HEMATOLOGIC DISORDER Care of the child with a hematologic disorder includes assessment, nursing diagnosis, planning, interventions, and evaluation. There are a number of general concepts related to the nursing process that may be applied to hematologic dysfunction in children. Development of a plan of care will depend on which component of the blood is altered. A decrease in hemoglobin will necessitate evaluation of oxygen-carrying capacity and effects of hypoxia on the tissues. A reduction in platelet production will lead the nurse to evaluate for prolonged bleeding, hemorrhage, and shock. An elevation in WBCs would require an evaluation for infection. Remember Shaun, the 10-month-old with the laceration and prolonged bleeding? What additional health history and physical examination assessment information should you obtain? Assessment Signs of changes in the hematologic system are often insidious and overlooked. Skin color changes such as pallor, bruising, and flushing are often the first signs that a problem is developing. Changes in mental status such as lethargy can indicate a decrease in Hgb and a decreased amount of oxygen being delivered to the brain. Nursing assessment must include a thorough approach. Health History Elicit the birth and maternal history, noting low birthweight or gestational diabetes and ascertaining whether vitamin K was given after birth. The past medical history might be significant for recent illnesses that may contribute to a change in blood cell distribution. Determine the child's sleep/wake patterns and bowel elimination patterns, which may be affected by alterations in circulating blood volume or changes in oxygenation. Explore the family history for inherited disorders such as hemophilia, sickle cell disease, and thalassemia. Evaluate the child's typical diet for nutritional deficits. Determine risk for lead exposure based on the use of a standard questionnaire. When eliciting the history of the present illness, inquire about: Fatigue or malaise Pallor of the skin Unusual bruising Excessive bleeding or difficulty stopping bleeding Pain: location, onset, duration, quality, and relieving factors Physical Examination A child's general appearance gives great insight into his or her health and can indicate problems such as malnutrition or lead poisoning. Physical examination of the child with a hematologic disorder includes inspection and observation, palpation, and auscultation. INSPECTION AND OBSERVATION Note the child's color and general appearance, including thin or emaciated appearance or obesity. Measure weight and height (or length) and plot on standardized growth charts. Observe the nail beds, palms, and soles for pallor. Evaluate the fingertips for clubbing, which occurs with chronic hypoxemia. Document the location and extent of bruises, petechiae, or purpura. Count the respiratory rate and observe for work of breathing. Obtain a pulse oximeter reading to determine oxygen saturation of tissues. Note conjunctival color as well as color and moisture of oral mucosa. Determine urinary output, which may be altered with decreases in circulatory blood volume or inadequate oxygenation. Note the child's responsiveness to stimuli, movement of extremities, and quality of gait. AUSCULTATION Auscultate breath sounds, noting adequacy of air movement and depth of respiration. Note adventitious sounds or absence of breath sounds (which would occur in an area of the lung filled with blood). Auscultate heart sounds, listening closely for murmurs (which can develop with changes in blood viscosity and volume). Note the rate and rhythm of the heart tones. Auscultate bowel sounds, noting presence and normalcy. PALPATION Measure blood pressure, which may change with alterations in blood volume. Palpate the peripheral pulses for strength and equality. Determine capillary refill time, which may be prolonged when the circulating blood volume is decreased. Carefully palpate the abdomen for tenderness, hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly (increased spleen size). Note temperature of the skin. Determine elasticity of skin, noting decreased turgor. Palpate the joints for tenderness. Assess range of motion. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing The nurse must understand the main elements of the complete blood count (CBC; hemogram) to recognize critical values and intervene as appropriate. The components of the CBC are: RBC count: the actual number of counted RBCs in a certain volume of blood Hemoglobin (Hgb): measure of the protein made up of heme (iron surrounded by protoporphyrin) and globin, - and -polypeptide chains, primarily responsible for the transport of nutrients and oxygen to the tissues Hematocrit (Hct): an indirect measure of red blood cells (number and volume) RBC indices Mean corpuscular volume (MCV): average size of the RBC Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH): a calculated value of the oxygen-carrying capacity of the Hgb in the RBCs Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC): a calculated value that reflects the concentration of Hgb inside the RBC Red cell distribution width (RDW): a calculated value that is a measure of the width of RBCs WBC count: actual count of the number of WBCs in a volume of blood Platelet count: number of platelets per blood volume Mean platelet volume (MPV): a measurement of the size of the platelets Tables 25.1 and 25.2 provide age-related values for the CBC and leukocyte count. When evaluating the CBC, the nurse must take into account the presenting clinical picture of the child. For instance, the RBC count may be truly elevated (erythrocytosis or polycythemia ) in certain diseases or in the case of dehydration from diarrhea or burns. When anemia is present, the RBC count is low. When the MCV is elevated, the RBCs are larger than normal ( macrocytic ). When the MCV is decreased, the RBCs are smaller than normal ( microcytic ). A decrease in the MCHC means that the Hgb is diluted in the cell and less of the red color is present ( hypochromic ). When the Hgb concentration is increased in the RBC, then the pigmentation (red color) is increased (hyperchromic). Alterations in these red blood cell indices assist the physician or nurse practitioner with diagnosis. WBCs are the body's defense against infection or injury. The specific types of WBCs are discussed in Chapter 15 . Platelets are necessary for clot formation, and if changes occur, problems may develop. Elevations in platelet levels can indicate an increase in clotting, while decreases can put the child at risk for increased bleeding. Decreases can result if the platelets are being used up when bleeding is present, if an inherited disorder is present, or if the spleen holds them, as in hypersplenism. Platelets are larger when they are new; thus, an elevation in the mean platelet volume indicates that an increased number of platelets are being produced in the bone marrow. Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 25.1 explains the most commonly used laboratory and diagnostic tests for children with hematologic disorders. The tests can assist the physician or nurse practitioner in diagnosing the disorder and/or be used as guidelines in determining ongoing treatment. Laboratory or nonnursing personnel obtain some of the tests, while the nurse might obtain others. In either instance the nurse should be familiar with how the tests are obtained, what they are used for, and normal versus abnormal results. This knowledge will also be necessary when providing child and family education related to the testing. Nursing Diagnoses, Goals, Interventions, and Evaluation Upon completion of a thorough assessment, the nurse might identify several nursing diagnoses, including: Fatigue Pain Impaired physical mobility Ineffective health maintenance Anxiety Ineffective family coping You have finished assessing Shaun and your findings include the following. The health history revealed he bled with all four of the teeth he has cut. Upon physical examination numerous bruises are noted. Based on the assessment findings, what would your top three nursing diagnoses be for Shaun? Nursing goals, interventions, and evaluation for the child with hematologic dysfunction are based on the nursing diagnoses. Nursing Care Plan 25.1 may be used as a guide in planning nursing care for the child with a hematologic disorder. Refer to Chapter 14 for additional information related to pain management. Children's responses to hematologic disorders and their treatments will vary, and nursing care should be individualized based on the child's and family's responses to illness. Other conditions may contribute to these nursing diagnoses and must also be considered when prioritizing care. Additional information about nursing management will be included later in the chapter as it relates to specific disorders. Based on your top three nursing diagnoses for Shaun, describe appropriate nursing interventions. COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS 25.1DRUG GUIDE 25.1 COMMON DRUGS FOR HEMATOLOGIC DISORDERS ANEMIA Anemia is a condition in which levels of RBCs and Hgb are lower than normal. Hgb levels vary throughout childhood. Therefore, it is important to monitor them to ensure that adequate growth and development will be achieved. Anemia may develop as a result of decreased production of RBCs or loss and destruction of RBCs. The loss of production can be related to lack of dietary intake of the nutrients needed to produce the cells, alterations in the cell structure, or malfunctioning tissues (e.g., bone marrow). Anemia related to nutritional deficiency includes iron deficiency, folic acid deficiency, and pernicious anemia. Anemia may also result from toxin exposure (lead poisoning) or as an adverse reaction to a medication (aplastic anemia). Blood loss may result from surgery or trauma. Alteration or destruction of cells occurs in certain genetic and cellular development disorders (Bryant, 2010). COMMON LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS 19.1 NURSING CARE PLAN 25.1 Overview for the Child With a Hematologic Disorder NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Fatigue related to decreased oxygen supply in the body as evidenced by lack of energy, increased sleep requirements, or decreased interest in play Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will display increased endurance, desire to play without developing symptoms of exertion. Intervention: Decreasing Fatigue Cluster nursing care activities and plan for periods of rest before and after exertion to decrease oxygen need and consumption. Encourage activity or ambulation per physician's orders: early mobilization results in better outcomes. Observe child for signs of activity intolerance such as pallor, nausea, lightheadedness, or dizziness or changes in vital signs to determine level of tolerance. If child is on bed rest, perform range-of-motion exercises and frequent position changes: negative changes to the musculoskeletal system occur quickly with inactivity and immobility. Refer the child to physical therapy for exercise prescription to increase skeletal muscle strength. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Impaired physical mobility related to pain from sickle cell crisis or acute bleeds or imposed activity restrictions, as evidenced byguarding of painful extremity, resistance to activity Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will be able to engage in activities within age parameters and limits of disease: child is able to move extremities, move about environment, and participate in exercise programs within limits of age and disease. Interventions: Promoting Physical Mobility Encourage gross and fine motor activities as able within constraints of pain/bleed to facilitate motor development. Collaborate with physical therapy to strengthen muscles and promote mobility to facilitate motor development. Use passive and active range-of-motion (ROM) exercises and teach the child and family how to perform them to prevent contractures and facilitate joint mobility and muscle development (active ROM) to help increase mobility. Praise accomplishments and emphasize child's abilities to improve self-esteem and encourage feelings of confidence and competence. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Ineffective health maintenance related to knowledge and skill acquisition regarding nutritional and medical treatment of anemia, prevention of infection, home administration of intravenous clotting factors, or protection from injury as evidenced by new diagnosis and inability to verbalize appropriate treatment regimen or demonstrate medication administration skills Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child's health will be maintained: child will receive supplements, medications as prescribed and will eat an appropriate diet. Intervention: Educating Parents About Effective Health Maintenance Educate the family about iron-rich foods to be promoted in the child with iron-deficiency anemia and limited in the child with thalassemia. Limit cow's milk intake in the child with iron-deficiency anemia to decrease risk of microscopic gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and increase appetite for other foods. Provide ongoing evaluation of nutritional intake to ensure that appropriate dietary restrictions are followed. Ensure that parents can verbalize understanding of home medication regimen: iron or folic acid supplementation for anemia, prophylactic antibiotics for sickle cell anemia, chelation for thalassemia, and factor replacement for hemophilia. Have parents provide return demonstration of subcutaneous infusion of deferoxamine or intravenous factor as appropriate to ensure accuracy and independence in the home environment. Educate families about when to call or visit physician or nurse practitioner to ensure timely intervention when signs and symptoms develop. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Anxiety related to diagnostic testing as evidenced by parent verbalization, child resistance or crying with procedures Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child's anxiety will be minimized: child will verbalize less fear, experience less pain with procedures. Intervention: Relieving Anxiety Use topical anesthetic creams or agents for nonemergency laboratory draws to decrease stress related to needlesticks or venipunctures. Maintain a quiet and calm environment to reduce the child's stress. Educate the child, as appropriate, and the family regarding the need for laboratory specimens to alleviate anxiety related to the unknown. Identify the need for the specific test and explain the procedure before obtaining the specimen to decrease the anxiety and time required for the procedure. Provide developmentally appropriate activities for the child: activities can reduce stress and also provide stimulus for children; serves as a model for the family. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Ineffective family coping related to hospitalization of child or chronic, possibly life-threatening genetic disorder as evidenced by excessive tearfulness or denial statements, withdrawal, or verbalization of inadequate coping skills Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child and/or family will demonstrate adequate coping skills, will verbalize feeling supported and demonstrate healthy family interactions. Intervention: Promoting Effective Family Coping Provide emotional support to the child and family to improve coping abilities. Actively listen to the child's and family's concerns to validate their feelings and establish trust. Encourage parents to talk about their child and the illness to bring feelings out in the open. Validate feelings of guilt, shock, frustration, resentment, or depression to promote trust and begin appropriate coping. Provide open communication with the child and siblings: children appreciate honesty about their illness, and coping is improved. Refer families to community resources such as parent support groups and grief counseling to improve coping abilities. Encourage role-playing and play activities to identify the child's fears and work through feelings. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for injury related to alteration in peripheral sensory perception, decreased platelet count, deficient coagulation factor, or excessive iron load Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will not experience hemorrhage: will experience decreased bruising or episodes of prolonged bleeding. Intervention: Preventing Injury Assess for petechiae, purpura, bruising, or bleeding to provide baseline data for comparison; if present, may warrant intervention. Encourage quiet activities or play to avoid trauma with active play. Avoid rectal temperatures and examinations. Post sign at head of bed \"no rectal temperatures or medications\" to avoid rectal mucosa damage resulting in bleeding. Avoid intramuscular injections and lumbar puncture if possible to decrease risk of bleeding from a puncture site. If bone marrow aspiration must be performed, apply pressure dressing to site to prevent bleeding. Teach families about preferred physical activities for the child with idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) or hemophilia to provide safe physical activities and decrease risk for injury. Anemia caused by the alteration or destruction of the RBCs is termed hemolytic anemia. There are several types of hemolytic anemia, such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia; these two disorders are discussed under the section on hemoglobinopathies. Anemia related to insufficient intake of specific nutrients is the most common type of anemia in children. Nutrient intake may be reduced in children due to food dislikes or conditions that produce malabsorption. Iron-Deficiency Anemia Iron-deficiency anemia occurs when the body does not have enough iron to produce Hgb. In the United States, iron-deficiency anemia has a peak prevalence in children between the ages of 6 and 20 months, and again at the age of puberty (Borgna-Pignatti & Marsella, 2008). Cow's milk consumption contributes to iron-deficiency anemia in older infants and young children due to its poor iron availability (Bryant, 2010). The heme portion of Hgb consists of iron surrounded by protoporphyrin. When not enough iron is available to the bone marrow, Hgb production is reduced. Adequate dietary intake of iron is required for the body to make enough Hgb. As Hgb levels decrease, the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is decreased, resulting in weakness and fatigue. In addition to delayed growth, iron- deficiency anemia has been associated with cognitive delays and behavioral changes. Take Note! For appropriate growth to occur in adolescence, increased amounts of iron must be consumed and absorbed. Therapeutic Management Iron supplements are usually provided in the form of ferrous sulfate or ferrous fumarate and are available over the counter. Dosage is based on the amount of elemental iron. The recommended amounts of elemental iron are: For prophylaxis: 1 to 2 mg/kg/day, up to a maximum of 15 mg elemental iron per day Mild to moderate iron deficiency: 3 mg/kg/day of elemental iron in one or two divided doses Severe iron-deficiency anemia: 4 to 6 mg/kg/day of elemental iron in three divided doses (Borgna-Pignatti & Marsella, 2008) In more severe cases, blood transfusions may be indicated. Transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) is reserved for the most severe cases (Bryant, 2010). When PRBC administration is warranted, follow specific blood bank guidelines for administration. Monitor subsequent laboratory results for improvement. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 913 . Assessment findings pertinent to iron- deficiency anemia are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the current illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history may include irritability, headache, dizziness, weakness, shortness of breath, pallor, and fatigue. Other symptoms may be subtle and difficult for the clinician to identify; these include difficulty feeding, pica, muscle weakness, or unsteady gait. Explore the health history for risk factors such as: Maternal anemia during pregnancy Poorly controlled diabetes during pregnancy Prematurity, low birthweight, or multiple birth Cow's milk consumption before 12 months of age Excessive cow's milk consumption (greater than 24 ounces a day) Infant consumption of low-iron formula Lack of iron supplementation after age 6 months in breastfed infants Excessive weight gain Chronic infection or inflammation Chronic or acute blood loss Restricted diets Use of medication interfering with iron absorption, such as antacids Low socioeconomic status Recent immigration from a developing country (Borgna-Pignatti & Marsella, 2008; Bryant, 2010) Evaluate the child's diet for adequate intake of iron-rich foods. Recommended dietary daily intake for iron in children is: 0 to 6 months: 0.27 mg 6 to 12 months: 3 mg 1 to 3 years: 7 mg 4 to 8 years: 11 mg 9 to 13 years: 8 mg Boys 14 to 18 years: 11 mg Girls 14 to 18 years: 15 mg (Krebs, Primark, & Haemer, 2011) Physical Examination Observe the child for fatigue and lethargy. Inspect the skin, conjunctivae, oral mucosa, palms, and soles for pallor. Note spooning of the nails (concave shape) ( Fig. 25.2 ). Obtain a pulse oximeter reading. Evaluate the heart rate for tachycardia. Auscultate the heart for a flow murmur. Palpate the abdomen for splenomegaly. FIGURE 25.2 Note the concave shape of nails (\"spooning\") that occurs with iron-deficiency anemia. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Laboratory evaluation will reveal decreased Hgb and Hct, decreased reticulocyte count, microcytosis, hypochromia, decreased serum levels, and an increased free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP) level. Nursing Management Nursing management of the child with iron deficiency focuses on promoting safety, ensuring adequate iron intake, and educating the family. Promoting Safety The child with anemia is at risk for changes in neurologic functioning related to the decreased oxygen supply to the brain. This can lead to fatigue and inability to eat enough. Neurologic effects may be manifested when the child's ability to sit, stand, or walk is impaired. Provide close observation of the anemic child. Assist the older child with ambulation. Educate the parents on how to protect the child from injury due to an unsteady gait or dizziness. Providing Dietary Interventions Ensure that iron-deficient infants are fed only formulas fortified with iron. Interventions for breastfed infants include beginning iron supplementation around the age of 4 or 5 months. Iron supplementation may range from adding iron-fortified cereals to the child's dietto giving iron-containing drops. Encourage breastfeeding mothers to increase their dietary intake of iron or take iron supplements when breastfeeding so that the iron may be passed on to the infant. For children over 1 year of age, limit cow's milk intake to 24 ounces per day. Limit fast-food consumption and encourage intake of iron-rich foods such as red meats (iron from red meat is the easiest for the body to absorb), tuna, salmon, eggs, tofu, enriched grains, dried beans and peas, dried fruits, leafy green vegetables, and iron-fortified breakfast cereals. Teach the parents about dietary intake of iron. Encourage parents to provide a variety of foods for iron support and vitamins and other minerals necessary for growth. A big problem for toddlers is their picky eating. This often becomes a means of control for the child, and parents should guard against getting involved in a power struggle with their child. Referring parents to a developmental specialist who can assist them in their approach to diet may prove beneficial. Refer families who meet the financial limits and who have children age 5 and younger to the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program, which provides for supplementation of infants' and children's diets. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Take Note! Parents are often concerned that a diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia or referral to the WIC program may lead to interventions from children's services. Assure the family that as long as appropriate measures are taken to address the anemia, referrals of this nature are not generally made. Teaching About Iron Supplement Administration The use of iron supplements in infants begins with the use of formula fortified with iron in the formula-fed infant. Oral supplements may also be necessary if the baby's iron levels are extremely low. Oral supplements or multivitamin formulas that contain iron are often dark in color because the iron is pigmented. Teach parents to precisely measure the amount of iron to be administered. Parents should place the liquid behind the teeth, as iron in liquid form can stain the teeth. Iron supplementation can also cause constipation. In some cases reducing the amount of iron can resolve this problem, but stool softeners may be necessary to control painful or difficult-to-pass stools. Encourage parents to increase their child's fluid intake and include adequate dietary fiber to avoid constipation. Take Note! Teach parents to keep iron-containing supplements out of the reach of young children in order to prevent accidental ingestion leading to overdose or poisoning. COMPARISON CHART 25.1 FOLIC ACID DEFICIENCY VERSUSPERNICIOUS ANEMIA Other Nutritional Causes of Anemia Other forms of anemia related to nutritional deficit include folic acid deficiency and pernicious anemia. Comparison Chart 25.1 discusses the causes, assessment, and management of these disorders. Lead Poisoning Elevated lead levels are found annually in about 250,000 U.S. children between 1 and 5 years of age (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011). Lead exerts toxic effects on the bone marrow, erythroid cells, nervous system, and kidneys. The presence of lead in the bloodstream interferes with the enzymatic processes of the biosynthesis of heme. The process results in hypochromic, microcytic anemia, and children may exhibit classic signs of anemia. Risk factors for lead poisoning are related to lead exposure in the home, school, or local environment. Sources of lead include: Paint in homes built before 1978, at which time lead was banned as an additive to paint used in houses Dust from windowsills, walls, and plaster in older homes Soil where cars that used leaded gas have been in the past (lead was removed from all gasoline in the United States as of 1996) Glazed pottery Stained glass products Lead pipes supplying water to the home On the clothing of parents who work in certain manufacturing jobs (battery makers, cable makers) Certain folk remedies, such as greta or arzacon Old painted toys or furniture (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009) Complications of lead poisoning include behavioral problems and learning difficulties and, with higher lead levels, encephalopathy, seizures, and brain damage. Therapeutic management for high blood levels of lead involves chelation therapy (removal of heavy metals from the body via chelating agents), either orally or intravenously. Drug Guide 25.1 gives further information on chelating agents. Nursing Assessment Explore the health history for subtle signs such as anorexia, fatigue, or abdominal pain. Determine whether behavioral problems, irritability, hyperactivity, or lack of ability to meet developmental milestones have occurred in recent months. Screen children for risk of exposure to lead in the home. Refer to Chapter 9 for a simple screening questionnaire that can be used to determine the need for lead screening in young children. Blood levels of lead greater than 10 mcg/dL require conscientious follow-up. Note pallor of the skin. Nursing Management Prevention of elevated lead levels is critical. Screen children for lead exposure risk. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends screening in high-risk children at ages 12 and 24 months (AAP, 2009). Table 25.3 gives recommendations for appropriate follow-up depending on lead levels.Removing old paint is the best way to eliminate the most significant source of lead exposure for a large number of children. If the family rents or lives in public housing, the landlord or owner is responsible for following the guidelines set forth by local and state governmental agencies to correct the problem. Educate families about how to prevent exposure to lead, particularly in young children. Additional resources for families are located on . If the child is undergoing chelation therapy, ensure adequate fluid intake and monitor intake and output closely. Refer children with elevated lead levels and developmental or cognitive deficits to developmental centers. These children may need an early intervention program for further evaluation and treatment of developmental delays. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Aplastic AnemiaAplastic anemia (failure of the bone marrow to produce cells) is characterized by bone marrow aplasia and pancytopenia (decreased numbers of all blood cells). Most cases are acquired, but there are a few rare types of inherited aplastic anemias (Bryant, 2010). The inherited types present as congenital bone marrow failure; the best known is Fanconi anemia, an autosomal recessive disorder. Acquired aplastic anemia is thought to be an immune-mediated response. Most cases are idiopathic, meaning the trigger remains unidentified. Other causes include exposure to environmental toxins, viruses, myelosuppressive drugs, or radiation. Aplastic anemia may be classified as severe or nonsevere. In the severe form, the granulocyte count is less than 500, the platelet count is less than 20,000, and the reticulocyte count is less than 1%. In nonsevere aplastic anemia, the granulocyte count is about 500, the platelet count is over 20,000, and the reticulocyte count is over 1% (Ambruso, Hays, & Goldenberg, 2011). Complications of aplastic anemia include severe overwhelming infection, hemorrhage, and death. Therapeutic management of aplastic anemia in children involves hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor; if one is not available, immunosuppressive therapy or high-dose cyclophosphamide can be given. Nursing Assessment Determine history of exposure to myelosuppressive medications or radiation therapy. Obtain a detailed family, environmental, and infectious disease history. Note history of epistaxis, gingival oozing, or increased bleeding with menstruation. Anemia may lead to headache and fatigue. On physical examination, note ecchymoses, petechiae or purpura, oral ulcerations, tachycardia, or tachypnea. In addition to suppression of all blood cells, laboratory and diagnostic testing may reveal: Guaiac-positive stool Blood in the urine Severe decrease in or absence of hematopoietic cells on bone marrow aspiration Nursing Management Safety is of the utmost concern in children with aplastic anemia. It is important to prevent injury in order to avoid hemorrhage. Stool softeners may be used to prevent anal fissures associated with constipation. Administer only irradiated and leukocyte-depleted packed red blood cells or platelet transfusions as necessary. This limits exposure to HLA antigens should the child require bone marrow transplantation in the future. If the child does require hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, refer to Chapter 28 for additional nursing management information. Refer families whose child has only mild or moderate disease to the Aplastic Anemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome International Foundation, a link to which can be found on . Hemoglobinopathies Hemoglobinopathy is a condition in which abnormal hemoglobin is present. A large percentage of the newborn's hemoglobin is fetal hemoglobin (Hgb F). Hgb F can exchange oxygen molecules at lower oxygen tensions compared to adult hemoglobin. Over the first several months of life, Hgb F levels fall as it is replaced with Hgb A (adult hemoglobin). The healthy older infant then displays Hgb AA. In hemoglobinopathies, this normal hemoglobin configuration is disturbed. Causes of hemoglobinopathies are genetic and include sickle cell anemia, hemoglobin SC disease, -thalassemia, and -thalassemia. This discussion will focus on sickle cell disease and - thalassemia (Cooley anemia). Sickle Cell Disease Sickle cell disease is a group of inherited hemoglobinopathies in which the RBCs do not carry the normal adult hemoglobin, but instead carry a less effective type. In the United States, the most common types of sickle cell disease are hemoglobin SS disease (sickle cell anemia), hemoglobin SC disease, and hemoglobin sickle- -thalassemia. Among the sickle cell diseases, sickle cell anemia is the most common and will be the focus of this discussion (Bryant, 2010). Sickle cell anemia is a severe chronic blood disorder that affects 2,000 infants born in the United States each year (Ambruso et al., 2011). It is most common in individuals of African, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Indian decent (Ambruso et al., 2011). One in 400 African Americans has sickle cell anemia (Ambruso et al., 2011). Instead of Hgb AA, individuals with sickle cell anemia have Hgb SS. In hemoglobin S, glutamic acid is replaced with valine in the hemoglobin molecule. This results in an elongated RBC with a shortened life span. The elongated cell is more rigid than a normal cell and becomes sickled in shape ( Fig. 25.3 ). Persons with heterozygous representation (Hgb AS) are said to have sickle cell trait and are carriers for the disorder; about 8% of African Americans have sickle cell trait (Ambruso et al., 2011). Generally, persons with sickle cell trait have only minimal health problems.FIGURE 25.3 This peripheral blood smear demonstrates the elongated sickle-shaped red blood cell seen in sickle cell disease. The recessive genes for sickle cell are passed on from both parents who have the gene or trait. Each parent has the gene Hgb AS. Hgb A refers to normal adult hemoglobin and Hgb S refers to sickle hemoglobin. These recessive genes for sickle cell may be passed on to the child. The risk for developing Hgb SS is one in four, or 25%, in each child from this union. With each pregnancy the risk is 25% that the child will have disease, 25% that the child will have normal hemoglobin, and 50% that the child will have the trait (Hgb AS) and will be a carrier (Pitts & Record, 2010). Figure 25.4 illustrates the inheritance probability. Infants with sickle cell anemia are usually asymptomatic until 3 to 4 months of age because Hgb F protects against sickling. Complications of sickle cell anemia include recurrent vaso-occlusive pain crises, stroke, sepsis, acute chest syndrome, splenic sequestration, reduced visual acuity related to decreased retinal blood flow, chronic leg ulcers, cholestasis and gallstones, delayed growth and development, delayed puberty, and priapism (the sickled cells prevent blood from flowing out of an erect penis). Children with sickle cell anemia have an increased incidence of enuresis because the kidneys cannot concentrate urine effectively (Pitts & Record, 2010). As children reach adulthood, multiple organ dysfunction is common. FIGURE 25.4 Simplified genetic scheme for sickle cell disease. A denotes adult hemoglobin; S denotes sickle hemoglobin. Hemoglobin AA, normal hemoglobin; hemoglobin AS, sickle cell trait; hemoglobin SS, sickle cell disease. Pathophysiology Significant anemia may occur when the RBCs sickle. Sickling may be triggered by any stress or traumatic event, such as infection,fever, acidosis, dehydration, physical exertion, excessive cold exposure, or hypoxia (Ambruso et al., 2011). As the cells sickle, the blood becomes more viscous because the sickled cells clump together and prevent normal blood flow to the tissues of that area. The sickle-shaped RBCs cannot pass through the smaller capillaries and venules of the circulatory system ( Fig. 25.5 ). This vaso-occlusive process leads to local tissue hypoxia followed by ischemia and may result in infarction. Pain crisis results as circulation is decreased to the area. Pain can occur in any part of the body but is most common in the joints. Pain causes increased metabolic need by resulting in tachycardia and sometimes tachypnea, which leads to further sickling. Clumping of cells in the lungs (acute chest syndrome) results in decreased gas exchange, producing hypoxia, which leads to further sickling. Sequestration of blood in the spleen leads to splenomegaly and abdominal pain. Hemolysis follows sickling and leads to further anemia. The increased activity of the spleen related to RBC hemolysis leads to splenomegaly, then fibrosis and atrophy. Functional asplenia may develop as early as 6 months of age, and occurs by age 9 years in 90% of children with sickle cell disease (Pitts & Record, 2010). FIGURE 25.5 Clumping of sickle-shaped cells. Therapeutic Management The therapeutic management of children with sickle cell anemia focuses on preventing sickling crisis and infection as well as other complications. Prevention of infection is critical because the child with sickle cell anemia is at increased risk for serious infection related to alterations in splenic function. Functional asplenia (decrease in the ability of the spleen to function appropriately) places the child at significant risk for serious infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae or other encapsulated organisms. Prophylactic antibiotics in the young child and appropriate immunization in all children with sickle cell anemia can reduce the risk of serious infection (Pitts & Record, 2010). Treatment of sickle cell crisis focuses on pain control. Oxygen administration is necessary during episodes of crisis to prevent additional cell sickling. Adequate hydration with intravenous fluids is critical. Close monitoring of Hgb, Hct, and reticulocytes determines the point at which transfusion of packed red blood cells becomes necessary. Electrolyte analysis is also necessary to ensure that appropriate amounts of electrolytes are present in the serum. When RBCs are administered, there is the potential for hemolysis of the cells, thus increasing the potassium level in the serum. Antibiotic therapy is necessary when infection is present. Box 25.1 describes additional medical treatments that are needed in some children. Nursing Assessment Children with sickle cell anemia experience a significant number of acute and chronic manifestations of the condition ( Comparison Chart 25.2 ). For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 913 . Assessment findings pertinent to sickle cell anemia are discussed below. Health HistoryElicit the health history, noting growth and development, frequency and extent of vaso-occlusive crises, past hospitalizations, and treatment for pain crises. Note history of immunizations, including pneumococcal, flu, and meningococcal vaccinations. Determine history of blood transfusions. Document the current medication regimen. Note history of recurrent infections. Determine history of the present illness that results in a precipitating event, such as hypoxia, infection, or dehydration. Note onset, character, and quality of pain, as well as relieving factors. COMPARISON CHART 25.2 ACUTE VERSUS CHRONIC MANIFESTATIONS OF SICKLE CELL ANEMIA BOX 25.1 ADDITIONAL MEDICAL TREATMENTS FOR SOME CHILDREN WITH SICKLE CELL ANEMIA Cholecystectomy may become necessary if gallstones develop. Splenectomy may be performed to prevent recurrence of splenic sequestration if it is life-threatening. Considered investigational, administration of hydroxyurea may increase the percentage of fetal hemoglobin; a large clinical trial in children is ongoing. Blood transfusions, though not routinely given to children with sickle cell disease, are indicated in children with prolonged or widespread pain, aplastic crisis, or splenic sequestration. Partial exchange transfusion may be used to rapidly lower the circulating amount of Hgb SS in the event of stroke or acute chest syndrome. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is usually reserved for children with an identical HLA-matched sibling (risk of death and incidence of graft-versus-host disease is high) (Pitts & Record, 2010). Physical Examination Perform a thorough physical examination, because sickling, hypoxia, and tissue ischemia affect most areas of the body ( Fig. 25.6 ). Note the physical findings discussed below that may be detected using inspection, observation, auscultation, and palpation. INSPECTION AND OBSERVATION Inspect the conjunctivae, palms, and soles for pallor and the skin for pallor, lesions, or ulcers. Note jaundice of the skin or scleral icterus. Document color and moisture of oral mucosa. Measure temperature to evaluate for infection (which can precipitate a sickling crisis). Note blood pressure, which may be decreased with severe anemia or increased with sickle cell nephropathy. Determine baseline mental status. Perform a neurologic assessment frequently, as about 30% of children with sickle cell anemia experience a stroke (Inati, Koussa, Taher, & Perrine, 2008). AUSCULTATION Auscultate heart sounds for a murmur. The heart rate is often elevated with pain, hyperthermia, or dehydration. Listen to breathsounds, noting the rate and depth of respiration as well as the adequacy of aeration. Adventitious breath sounds may be present if a respiratory infection has triggered the sickle cell crisis or in the case of acute chest syndrome. FIGURE 25.6 Effects of sickle cell anemia on various parts of the body. PALPATION Palpate the joints for warmth, tenderness, and range of motion. Palpate the abdomen for areas of tenderness. Note hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. Take Note! Immediately report symmetric swelling of the hands and feet in the infant or toddler. Termed dactylitis, aseptic infarction occurs in the metacarpals and metatarsals. Occurrence before age 1 year is predictive of severity of illness (Arnold et al., 2011) ( Fig. 25.7 ). Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Newborn screening for sickle cell anemia is required by law or rule in all of the 50 United States (National Newborn Screening and Genetics Resource Center, 2011). Screening by Sickledex or sickle cell prep does not distinguish between sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait. If the screening test result indicates the possibility of sickle cell anemia or sickle cell trait, Hgb electrophoresis is performed promptly to confirm the diagnosis. Hgb electrophoresis is the only accurate test for sickle cell disease. Hgb electrophoresis will demonstrate the presence of Hgb S and Hgb F only in the young infant; in the older infant or child, the result will be Hgb SS.FIGURE 25.7 Swelling of the hands (dactylitis) in a toddler. Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of sickle cell anemia include: Hemoglobin: baseline is usually 7 to 10 mg/dL; will be significantly lower with splenic sequestration, acute chest syndrome, or aplastic crisis Reticulocyte count: greatly elevated Peripheral blood smear: presence of sickle-shaped and target cells Platelet count: increased Erythrocyte sedimentation rate: elevated Abnormal liver function tests with elevated bilirubin X-ray studies or other scans may be performed to determine the extent of organ or tissue damage resulting from vaso-occlusion. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Nursing Management Nursing care of the child with sickle cell anemia focuses on preventing vaso-occlusive crises, providing education to the family and child, managing pain episodes, and providing psychosocial support to the child and family. All children with sickle cell anemia need ongoing evaluation of growth and development to maximize their potential in those areas. Monitor school performance to detectneurodevelopmental problems and seek intervention early. The nursing diagnoses and interventions provided in Nursing Care Plan 25.1 should be individualized based on the child's and family's response to the disorder. Specifics related to sickle cell disease are discussed below. Educating the Family and Child Begin child and family education immediately after the diagnosis of sickle cell anemia is confirmed. Initially, teach the family about the genetics of the disease and encourage family members to be tested for carrier status. Educate families about the disease process. Emphasize the importance of regularly scheduled health maintenance visits and immunizations. Teach families how to administer prophylactic penicillin. Encourage families to seek medical evaluation urgently for any febrile illness. Educate families about how to prevent and recognize vaso-occlusive events ( Teaching Guidelines 25.1 ). Discuss complications such as delayed growth and development, delayed puberty, stroke, cholelithiasis, retinopathy, avascular necrosis, priapism, and leg ulcers. Teaching Guidelines 25.1 PREVENTION OR EARLY RECOGNITION OF VASO-OCCLUSIVE EVENTS Seek immediate attention for ANY febrile illness. Obtain vaccinations and penicillin prophylaxis. Encourage adequate fluid intake daily. Avoid temperatures that are too hot or too cold. Avoid overexertion or stress. Have 24-hour access to physician, nurse practitioner, or facility familiar with sickle cell care. Contact medical provider promptly if you suspect a pain crisis is developing. Seek medical attention immediately if any of the following develop: Child is pale and listless Abdominal pain Limp or swollen joints Cough, shortness of breath, chest pain Increasing fatigue Unusual headache, loss of feeling, or sudden weakness Sudden vision change Painful erection that won't go down (priapism) Atraumatic Care Teach the child with sickle cell anemia age-appropriate distraction and coping skills to assist the child to relieve stress related to his or her disease and/or recurrent crises. Managing Pain Crisis Initiate pain assessment with a standardized pain scale upon admission. Provide frequent evaluations of pain. Always believe the child's report of pain; only the person suffering the pain knows what it feels like. Moderate to severe pain usually requires opioid medication. To bring the pain under control, initially administer analgesics routinely rather than on an \"as needed\" (PRN) basis. Once the pain is better managed, medications may be moved to PRN status. Monitor patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) in the child or adolescent. Addiction to narcotics is rarely a concern in the child with sickle cell anemia if the narcotic is used to alleviate severe pain (Pitts & Record, 2010). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and acetaminophen are often used for less severe pain. Adequate pain management helps to decrease the child's stress level; elevated stress may contribute to further sickling and additional pain. Use nonpharmacologic pain management techniques such as relaxation or hypnosis, music, massage, play, guided imagery, therapeutic touch, or behavior modification to augment the pain medication regimen. Box 25.2 provides a summary of sickle cell pain management.BOX 25.2 ABCs OF MANAGING SICKLE CELL PAIN A: Assess the pain (use a pain assessment tool). B: Believe the child's report of pain. C: Complications or cause of pain (look for complications) D: Drugs and distraction: pain medication (opiates and NSAIDs, if no contraindications); use fixed dosing; give on a timed schedule; no PRN dosing for pain medications; distraction with music, TV, and relaxation techniques E: Environment (rest in quiet area with privacy) F: Fluids (hypotonic\u2014D 5 W or D 5 with 0.25% normal saline solution) Adapted from Platt, A., Eckman, J. R., Beasley, J., & Miller, G. (2002). Treating sickle cell pain: An update from the Georgia Comprehensive Sickle Cell Information Center. Journal of Emergency Nursing, 28(4), 297-303, with permission. Take Note! Avoid repeated use of meperidine (Demerol) for pain management during sickle cell crises because it has been associated with an increased risk of seizures when used in children with sickle cell anemia (Sickle Cell Information Center [SCIC], 2010). Managing Sickle Cell Crisis Treat any underlying conditions such as infection or injury. Deficient fluid volume occurs as a result of decreased intake, increased fluid requirements during sickle cell crisis, and the kidney's inability to concentrate urine. Increasing fluid intake will dilute the blood and decrease its viscosity. To promote hemodilution, provide 150 mL/kg of fluids per day or as much as double maintenance, either orally or intravenously. Maintain appropriate electrolyte and pH balance. Risk for ineffective tissue perfusion related to the effects of RBC sickling and infarction of tissues is another concern. Frequently evaluate respiratory and circulatory status. Administer supplemental oxygen if the pulse oximetry reading is 92% or less to promote adequate oxygenation (SCIC, 2010). Supplementation with oxygen in the absence of hypoxia is unnecessary and may inhibit erythropoiesis. Monitor level of consciousness and immediately report changes. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Take Note! Maintain the child's temperature as close to normal as possible without the use of cooling mattresses, as sudden temperature change can further precipitate sickling of the red blood cells (Eckman, 2010). Preventing Infection To prevent severe infection in the child with sickle cell anemia, a variety of interventions are necessary. By 2 months of age, begin administration of oral penicillin V potassium as prophylaxis against pneumococcal infection. In the penicillin-allergic child, erythromycin may be used. Continue prophylaxis until at least age 5 years. Administer childhood immunizations according to the currently recommended schedule. To prevent overwhelming sepsis or meningitis as a result of infection with S. pneumoniae , the child should receive not only the 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine series in infancy but also the 23-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine annuallyafter age 2 years. Meningococcal vaccination is also warranted (refer to Chapter 9 for additional information on these vaccines). Provide influenza immunization annually before the onset of flu season (after 6 months of age) (Pitts & Record, 2010). (See Evidence- Based Practice 25.1 .) EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 25.1 PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS AND PNEUMOCOCCAL INFECTION IN CHILDREN WITH SICKLE CELL DISEASE Children with sickle cell disease are prone to infection, particularly respiratory infections and sepsis. Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the most common causes of respiratory infection and sepsis in all young children. Though pneumococcal vaccines are available, they do not prevent infection by all strains of pneumococci. Prophylactic antibiotics are routinely prescribed for infants and young children (younger than 5 years of age) with sickle cell disease in an attempt to prevent overwhelming pneumococcal infection STUDY To determine the effect that prophylactic antibiotic treatment has on the prevention of pneumococcal infection in children with sickle cell disease, the authors of this review searched for randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing prophylactic antibiotics to no treatment or placebo. Three trials were analyzed, consisting of just under 900 young children. Both authors independently reviewed the studies and documented the results. Findings In all three trials, the incidence of pneumococcal infection was reduced in young children with sickle cell disease who received prophylactic penicillin. Overall pneumococcal infection rates were reduced by 50% to 100% in treated children. Adverse drug reactions were rare and minor. No deaths occurred in any of the trials as a result of pneumococcal infection. The authors concluded that antibiotic prophylaxis for pneumococcal infection in children younger than 5 years of age with sickle cell disease is an appropriate approach to treatment and recommend its continuation as standard of practice. Nursing Implications Nurses are in an optimal position to educate parents about the importance of daily administration of antibiotic prophylaxis of pneumococcal infection in young children with sickle cell anemia. The occurrence of antibiotic resistance was minimal in the trials but did exist, so providers must weigh the risks and benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis. Review the medication regimen at each clinic visit and with each hospitalization. Ensure that prescriptions are being filled; if insurance or payment is an issue, refer the family for financial assistance. Educate families about the need to continue antibiotic prophylaxis even if the child has been immunized against S. pneumoniae. Encourage families to comply with the recommendations for 7-valent conjugate vaccine in children younger than 2 years of age and 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine after 2 years of age. Educate families and provide reassurance about the decreased risk for overwhelming pneumococcal infection after age 5 years, as they may be fearful of discontinuing the antibiotics at that time.

Retrieved November 2, 2007, from Ovid-EBM Review Database. Supporting the Family and Child As with any chronic illness, families of children with sickle cell anemia need significant support. They often feel guilty or responsible for the disease. Reassure the family and provide education. Refer families to a regional sickle cell disease center for multidisciplinary care. Web links for additional resources for families are included on . Consider This A 3-year-old boy with sickle cell disease is being admitted to the pediatric unit. He has had a runny nose, slight fever, and vomiting over the past 2 to 3 days. He has not been eating well and is complaining of pain in the right leg and refusing to walk. On assessment you find his vital signs to be temperature 101.7\u00b0F, pulse 132, respirations 32, and blood pressure 88/52. He is coughing, he has slightly dusky mucous membranes, and his capillary refill is 4 seconds. 1. List nursing assessment findings in order of priority. 2. Identify at least three nursing interventions, prioritize them, and list the rationale for the prioritization and the intervention itself.3. List teaching you will perform with this family. Thalassemia Thalassemia is a genetic disorder that most often affects those of African descent, but it also affects individuals of Caribbean, Middle Eastern, South Asian, and Mediterranean descent (Bryant, 2010). The genetics of thalassemia are similar to those of sickle cell disease in that it is inherited via an autosomal recessive process. Children with thalassemia have reduced production of normal hemoglobin. There are two basic types of thalassemia, and . In -thalassemia, synthesis of the chain of the hemoglobin protein is affected. Problems with the chain occur more often, and the condition -thalassemia can be divided into three subcategories based on severity: Thalassemia minor (also called -thalassemia trait): leads to mild microcytic anemia; often no treatment is required. Thalassemia intermedia: child requires blood transfusions to maintain adequate quality of life. Thalassemia major: to survive the child requires ongoing medical attention, blood transfusions, and iron removal (chelation therapy). The focus of this discussion will be on -thalassemia major (Cooley anemia). In -thalassemia major, the -globulin chain in hemoglobin synthesis is reduced or entirely absent. A large number of unstable globulin chains accumulate, causing the RBCs to be rigid and hemolyzed easily. The result is severe hemolytic anemia and chronic hypoxia. In response to the increased rate of RBC destruction, erythroid activity is increased. The increased activity causes massive bone marrow expansion and thinning of the bony cortex. Growth retardation, pathologic fractures, and skeletal deformities (frontal and maxillary bossing) result. Hemosiderosis (excessive supply of iron) is an additional complication of significant concern. It occurs as a result of rapid hemolysis of RBCs, the decrease in hemoglobin production, and the increased absorption of dietary iron in response to the severely anemic state. The excess iron is deposited in the body's tissues, causing bronze pigmentation of the skin, bony changes, and altered organ function, particularly in the cardiac system. Additional complications include splenomegaly, endocrine abnormalities, osteoporosis, liver and gallbladder disease, and leg ulcers. Left untreated, -thalassemia major is fatal, but the use of blood transfusions and chelation therapy has increased the life expectancy of these children to beyond their teen years (Yaish, 2010). Therapeutic Management The therapeutic management for children with -thalassemia includes monitoring hemoglobin and hematocrit and transfusing packed red blood cells at regular intervals. Blood iron levels are also monitored and iron chelation therapy is provided. Nursing Assessment Infants are usually diagnosed by 1 year of age and have a history of pallor, jaundice, failure to thrive, and hepatosplenomegaly (Yaish, 2010). Determine the history of the present illness or whether the child is presenting for a routine blood transfusion. Note medications taken at home and any concerns that have arisen since the last visit. Inspect the skin, oral mucosa, conjunctivae, soles, and/or palms for pallor. Note icteric sclerae or jaundice of the skin. Measure weight and height (or length) and plot on an appropriate growth chart. Observe the child for bony deformities and frontal bossing (prominent forehead) ( Fig. 25.8 ). Measure oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry. Evaluate neurologic status, determining level of consciousness and developmental abilities.FIGURE 25.8 Iron overload related to thalassemia leads to bony changes such as frontal bossing and maxillary prominence. Laboratory testing may reveal the following: Hemoglobin and hematocrit are significantly decreased. Peripheral blood smear shows prominence of target cells, hypochromia, microcytosis, and extensive anisocytosis and poikilocytosis (variation in the size and shape of the RBCs, respectively). Bilirubin levels are elevated. Hgb electrophoresis shows presence of Hgb F and Hgb A 2 only. Iron level is elevated. Nursing Management The nursing care of the child with thalassemia is primarily aimed at supporting the family and minimizing the effects of the illness. This includes administering blood transfusions and educating the family. Administering Packed Red Blood Cell Transfusions Administer packed red blood cell transfusions as prescribed to maintain an adequate level of hemoglobin for oxygen delivery to the tissues and to suppress erythrocytosis in the bone marrow. Monitor for reactions to the transfusions. Excess iron (hemosiderosis) is removed by chelation therapy. Administer the chelating agent Desferal (deferoxamine) with the transfusion. Deferoxamine binds to the iron and allows it to be removed through the stool or urine. Oral deferasirox (Exjade) may also be prescribed and is generally well tolerated, with minimal gastrointestinal side effects. Educating the Family Educate the child and family about the recommended regimen. Ensure that families understand that adhering to the prescribed blood transfusion and chelation therapy schedule is essential to the child's survival. Chelation therapy must be maintained at home to continuously decrease the iron levels in the body. Teach family members to administer deferoxamine subcutaneously with a smallbattery-powered infusion pump over a several-hour period each night (usually while the child is sleeping). If oral deferasirox is prescribed, instruct the family to dissolve the tablet in juice or water and administer it once daily. Refer the family for genetic counseling and family support as needed. A good resource for families of children with thalassemia is the Cooley's Anemia Foundation, a link to which can be found on . A group of young adults with Cooley anemia started the Thalassemia Action Group (TAG) (a subgroup of the Cooley's Anemia Foundation) to provide a forum for communication and information, promote a positive outlook on living with the disease, and raise awareness of the importance of continuing therapy for the disease. TAG is part of the Cooley anemia website and more information about the group can be found by calling (510) 409-9664. Atraumatic Care When a child is receiving blood transfusion every few weeks, he or she must experience at least two venipunctures each time, one for the type and crossmatch and other relevant laboratory tests on the day before transfusion, and the intravenous (IV) insertion for the actual transfusion. Minimize trauma by teaching the parent to apply EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetic) cream at home just before leaving for the blood draw or transfusion appointment. Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is an enzyme that is responsible for maintaining the integrity of RBCs by protecting them from oxidative substances. G6PD deficiency is an X-linked recessive disorder that occurs when the RBCs have insufficient G6PD, or the enzyme is abnormal and does not function properly. The RBCs are then affected by oxidative stress more easily. Triggers that may result in oxidative stress and hemolysis include bacterial or viral illness or exposure to certain substances such as medications (e.g., sulfonamides, sulfones, malaria-fighting drugs [such mothballs), or fava beans. G6PD deficiency occurs most commonly in children of African, Mediterranean, or Asian descent (Ambruso et al., 2011). Complications include prolonged neonatal jaundice and life-threatening acute episodes of hemolysis. Therapeutic management is primarily aimed at avoiding triggers that cause oxidative stress. Nursing Assessment Note health history, including fatigue. Determine the parents' understanding of the disorder and the medications and foods to avoid. Inspect the skin for pallor or jaundice. Evaluate neurologic status, which may also be affected. Measure heart rate and respiratory rate, noting elevations. Determine oxygen saturation via pulse oximeter or blood gas analysis. Note tea-colored urine. Palpate the abdomen for splenomegaly. Laboratory studies will reveal anemia. Nursing Management Administer oxygen and treat the symptoms. Once the triggering agent is removed or the child recovers from an illness, the child will improve. Provide further education to the child and family about triggers and advise them that the child should avoid contact with these agents.CLOTTING DISORDERS Clotting of blood is a process that occurs after injury. The blood clotting system requires certain factors in the blood and platelets to perform adequately. Individuals with deficiencies of these factors or platelets tend to bleed; they do not bleed more easily than people without these conditions, but it is just more difficult for the clot to form, and bleeding cannot be stopped easily. Factors that are most often involved in problems with clotting include factor VIII, factor IX, and factor XI. Each plays a role in clot formation. Platelets also play a role in the clotting cascade and are necessary for clot formation. Some processes can lead to destruction of the platelets and may lead to a reduction in clotting. Bleeding times are prolonged when a clotting disorder is present. Table 25.4 provides usual values for clotting studies. Conditions affecting clotting include idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura, disseminated intravascular hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency), von Willebrand disease, hemophilia B (Christmas disease, factor IX deficiency), and hemophilia C (factor XI deficiency). Table 25.5 reviews the Thrombocytopenia Purpura Idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) is thought to be an immune response following a viral infection that produces antiplatelet antibodies. These antibodies destroy platelets, which then leads to the development of petechiae, purpura, and excessive bruising.Petechiae are pinpoint hemorrhages that occur anywhere on the body and do not blanch to pressure ( Fig. 25.9 ). Purpura are larger areas of hemorrhage in which blood collects under the tissues; they are purplish (see Fig. 25.9 ). ITP usually develops about 1 to 4 weeks after a viral infection and is most common in young children (Ambruso et al., 2011). Within a few months, most children will recover spontaneously (Ambruso et al., 2011). Complications include severe hemorrhage and bleeding into vital organs and intracranial hemorrhage, although these rarely occur. For children with platelet below 20,000/mm 3 , corticosteroids or intravenous (Ambruso et al., 2011). Prednisone or prednisolone is administered for 2 to 3 weeks, or until platelet counts increase above 30,000/mm 3 . IVIG will be infused for 1 to 3 days. Platelet transfusions are not indicated unless a life-threatening condition such as intracranial hemorrhage is present. Refer the child for follow-up care with a pediatric hematologist. ITP is usually self-limiting, but if it persists for a year or longer, splenectomy may be indicated. Nursing Assessment Elicit the child's health history (usually a previously healthy child who recently has developed increased bruising, epistaxis, or bleeding of the gums). Note history of blood in the stool. Note risk factors such as recent viral illness, recent MMR immunization, or ingestion of medications that can cause thrombocytopenia. Inspect for petechiae, purpura, and bruising, which may progress rapidly within the first 24 to 48 hours of the illness. Document the size and location of each lesion. Inspect the lips and buccal mucosa for petechiae. The remainder of the physical examination is usually within normal limits. FIGURE 25.9 Pinpoint hemorrhages (petechiae) and large purplish areas infant with idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP). Usual laboratory findings include an extremely low platelet count (less than 50,000), normal WBC count and differential, and normal hemoglobin and hematocrit unless hemorrhage has occurred (this is rare). Bone marrow aspiration may be performed to rule out leukemia. Nursing Management Many children require no medical treatment except observation and reevaluation of laboratory values. Educate the family about avoiding aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and antihistamines because these medications may precipitate the development of anemia in these children. The use of acetaminophen for pain control is more appropriate when necessary. Teach the family to prevent trauma by avoiding activities that may cause injury, such as contact sports. Instead, encourage activities, such as swimming, that provide physical activity with less risk of trauma. Explain to parents the signs and symptoms of serious bleeding and whom to call if it is suspected. Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein Purpura Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura is a condition that, in children, develops in association with a viral or bacterial infection (Barillas-Arias,Adams, & Lehman, 2008). In adults the condition is usually caused by drugs or toxins. The classic presentation is vasculitis with immunoglobulin A (IgA)-dominant immune deposits affecting small vessels. These small vessels are generally in the skin, gut, and kidney. In most children the course of the disease is benign and the prognosis is good. In a few children, however, ongoing nephrotic syndrome may occur as a result of renal injury, and those children may have hypertension. Pulmonary, cardiac, and neurologic complications can also occur. No specific treatment exists for Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura, since most of the cases resolve without treatment. Treatment with corticosteroids, such as prednisone, is reserved for children with persistent symptoms (Barillas-Arias et al., 2008). If renal injury occurs, children may require renal function testing, and evaluation for hypertension and treatment when present. Nursing Assessment Note history of viral or bacterial infection. Determine the onset of the complaint and how it has progressed or changed. Note history of joint or abdominal pain. Measure blood pressure. Inspect the skin for a purpuric palpable rash, and document the size and location of lesions. Palpate the rash to determine its extent ( Fig. 25.10 ). Gently palpate the joints for tenderness. Palpate the abdomen for tenderness. Note visible or occult blood in the stool. Note cherry- or tea-colored urine, indicating the presence of blood in the urine; urinalysis can verify the amount of blood present in the urine. Serum IgA levels may be elevated. FIGURE 25.10 Palpable purpura on an adolescent's arm. Nursing Management Treatment of the symptoms is the focus. In children with severe joint or abdominal pain, administer analgesics as prescribed and note the response to pain medications. If the child has normal renal function, maintaining hydration is the most important intervention. Monitor intake and output. Note the color of urine. Administer corticosteroids and anticoagulants, alone or together, if ordered to reduce renal impairment. Teach the child and family about the therapy, such as management of hypertension with medications, and sodium restriction. Teach them about signs of renal injury, such as blood in the urine and changes in weight, as well as frequency and volume of urine output. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a complex condition that leads to activation of coagulation; it usually occurs in critically ill children. Common triggers of DIC include septic shock, presence of endotoxins and viruses, tissue necrosis or injury, andcancer treatment (Becker & Wira, 2011). In DIC, thrombin is generated, fibrin is deposited in the circulation, and platelets are consumed. Deficiencies of coagulation and anticoagulation pathways occur. Hemorrhage and organ tissue damage result and can be irreversible if not recognized and treated immediately. Therapeutic management of children with DIC requires careful consideration of the etiology. Initial treatment focuses on treating the underlying cause. For example, if DIC occurs secondary to an infection, appropriate antibiotics would be used to treat the infection. Heparin is also used at lower doses to counteract the deficiency in the coagulation/anticoagulation pathway. Heparin reduces consumption of the platelets, resulting in improved platelet counts. Since heparin is an anticoagulant, there is an increased risk of bleeding. Nursing Assessment Because DIC occurs as a secondary condition, it may occur in a child hospitalized for any reason. DIC may affect any body system, so a thorough physical examination is warranted. Inspect for signs of bleeding such as petechiae or purpura, blood in the urine or stool, or persistent oozing from venipuncture or from the umbilical cord in the newborn. Evaluate respiratory status and determine the level of tissue oxygenation via pulse oximetry. Perform a complete circulatory assessment and note signs of circulatory collapse such as poor perfusion, tachycardia, prolonged capillary refill, and weak distal pulses. Note altered level of consciousness and decreased urine output. Careful abdominal palpation may reveal hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. Laboratory testing may reveal prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), bleeding time, and thrombin time and decreased levels of fibrinogen; platelets; clotting factors II, V, VIII, and X; and antithrombin III. Increases will be noted in levels of fibrinolysin, fibrinopeptide A, positive fibrin split products, and D- dimers. Nursing Management Continue to provide nursing care related to the triggering event. Assess the child's status frequently. If bleeding is observed, apply pressure to the area along with cold compresses. Elevate the affected body part if this does not affect the child's overall stability. If neurologic deficits are assessed, report the findings immediately so that treatment to prevent permanent damage can be started. Administer anticoagulation therapy (even though hemorrhage is a concern) to interrupt the coagulation process that is present in this condition. Provide ventilatory support as needed and provide continuous cardiac monitoring. Administer clotting factors, platelets, and cryoprecipitate as prescribed to prevent severe hemorrhage. Report changes in laboratory values to the physician or nurse practitioner. Changes can occur rapidly, and vigilance is necessary to prevent further tissue damage to the affected system. Hemophilia Hemophilia is a group of X-linked recessive disorders that result in deficiency in one of the coagulation factors in the blood. X-linked recessive disorders are transmitted by carrier mothers to their sons, so usually only males are affected by hemophilia. The coagulation factors in the blood are essential for clot formation either spontaneously or from an injury, and when factors are absent bleeding will be difficult to stop. There are several types of hemophilia, including factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia A), factor IX deficiency or Christmas disease (hemophilia B), and factor XI deficiency (hemophilia C). The most common, hemophilia A, will be the focus of this discussion (Karp & Riddell, 2010). Hemophilia A occurs when there is a deficiency of factor VIII in an individual. Factor VIII is essential in the activation of factor X, which is required for the conversion of prothrombin into thrombin, resulting in an inability of the platelets to be used in clot formation. Hemophilia is classified according to the severity of the disease, ranging from mild to severe. The more severe the disease, the more likely it is that there will be bleeding episodes. When bleeding occurs the vessels constrict and a platelet plug forms, but because of the deficient factor the fibrin will not solidify, and thus bleeding continues. Therapeutic Management The primary goal of managing hemophilia is to prevent bleeding. This is best accomplished by instructing the child to avoid activities with a high potential for injury (e.g., football, riding motorcycles, skateboarding). Instead, encourage the child to participate in activities with the least amount of contact (e.g., swimming, running, tennis). Limiting activities does not mean the child should do nothing; activities that promote health without increased exposure to injury are best. If bleeding or injury occurs, factor administration is prescribed; this practice has been common in outpatient facilities or the child's home for many years. Once the deficient factor is replaced, clotting factors return to fairly normal levels for a period of time. Factorreplacement should be given before any surgeries or other procedures that can lead to bleeding, such as intramuscular injections and dental care. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 913 . Assessment findings pertinent to hemophilia in children are discussed below. Health History Elicit the health history, determining the nature of the bleeding episode or bruise. Include in the history any hemorrhagic episodes in other systems, such as the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., black tarry stools, hematemesis) or as a result from injury resulting in joint hemorrhage, or hematuria ( Fig. 25.11 ). Inquire about length of bleeding and amount of blood loss. Because hemophilia A results in difficulty with clotting, the child may bleed for a longer period when injury occurs. Physical Examination Focus the physical examination on identification of any bleeding. This is of particular concern after injury, but a nosebleed or other spontaneous bleed can occur if factor levels are extremely low. Assess circulation by evaluating pulses and heart sounds if severe or prolonged bleeding is identified. Without intervention, hypovolemia could follow, leading to shock. Note chest pain or abdominal pain, which may indicate internal bleeding. Report these findings immediately so that the underlying condition can be diagnosed and treated rapidly. FIGURE 25.11 Significant swelling and discoloration associated with a bleeding episode in a hemophiliac's knee. Laboratory and Diagnostic TestingLaboratory findings may include decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit if bleeding is prolonged or severe. Factor levels may be quantified with blood testing. Nursing Management Nursing management includes preventing bleeding episodes, managing bleeding episodes, and providing education and support. Preventing Bleeding Episodes All children with hemophilia should attempt to prevent bleeding episodes. Major bleeds into the joints may limit range of motion and function, eventually decreasing physical abilities and crippling some boys (Karp & Riddell, 2010). Teach children and families that regular physical activity or exercise helps to keep the muscles and joints stronger, and children with stronger joints and muscles have fewer bleeding episodes (see Teaching Guidelines 25.2 ). Refer the child with moderate to severe hemophilia to a pediatric hematologist and/or a comprehensive hemophilia treatment center. Teaching Guidelines 25.2 PREVENTING BLEEDING IN THE CHILD WITH HEMOPHILIA Protect toddlers with soft helmets, padding on the knees, carpets in the home, and softened or covered corners. Children should stay active: swimming, baseball, basketball, and bicycling (wearing a helmet) are good physical activities. Avoid intense contact sports such as football, wrestling, soccer, and high diving. Avoid trampoline use and riding all-terrain vehicles (ATVs). Arrange premedication with Amicar if oral surgery is indicated. Managing a Bleeding Episode Administer factor VIII replacement as prescribed. Factor replacement is pooled from multiple blood donors, so families may be concerned about transmission of viruses via the product (specifically hepatitis and HIV). Several methods of viral inactivation (solvent detergent, dry heat, and monoclonal purification) have been used to treat factors VIII and IX since 1986, so since that time there has been no risk of HIV transmission via factor infusion (National Hemophilia Foundation, 2009). Administer factor replacement by slow IV push. Document the product name, number of units, lot number, and expiration date. Doses are based on the severity of the bleeding and the weight of the child. Specific dosing guidelines can be obtained from the product insert. In mild cases of hemophilia A, desmopressin may be effective in stopping bleeding (see below in the nursing management section of von Willebrand disease for additional information). If external bleeding develops, apply pressure to the area until bleeding stops. If it is inside a joint, apply ice or cold compresses to the area and elevate any injured extremities, except when contraindicated by further injury. Make sure that all cases of bleeding are followed up to identify whether factor replacement is necessary. Providing Education Inform the family that the child should wear a medical alert bracelet. Families should notify the school nurse and teachers of the child's diagnosis and share precautions with them. Instruct all school personnel to call the parent immediately if the child sustains a head, abdominal, or orbit injury at school. Teach parents and caregivers how to administer the intravenous infusion of factor VIII. Administration in the home is the preferred method for factor infusion, as the child will be able to receive treatment in the most timely and efficient manner when a bleeding episode occurs. Alternatives to the parent giving the infusion are to arrange for a home care nursing visit or for the family to keep their own supply of factor VIII that they take to the local emergency room for infusion if bleeding occurs. Involve children as developmentally appropriate in the infusion process. Young children may hold and apply the Band-Aid; older children may assist with dilution and mixing of the factor. Teach teenagers to administer their own factor infusions. Children with severe hemophilia may need factor infusions so often that implantation of a central venous access port is warranted. Teach the family access, care, and flushing of the implanted port. Thinking About Development T oby Henderson is an 18-month-old male with a history of moderate hemophilia. He is a very active child; his mother calls him a \"typical boy.\" Considering Toby's developmental stage, how will his diagnosis impact his ability to accomplish toddler developmental milestones? Develop a teaching plan for Toby's parents related to safety for Toby. Incorporate age-appropriate activities that would be safe for Toby in the plan. Providing Support Children with hemophilia may be able to lead a fairly normal life, with the exception of avoiding a few activities. However, accepting the diagnosis of a bleeding disorder in their child is very difficult for parents. They fear the worst (bleeding that won't stop) as well as complications such as infection with blood-borne viruses. Reassure parents that since 1986, when factor replacement began to be treated with heat, there have been no reports of virus transmission from factor infusion (National Hemophilia Foundation, 2009). Educate and support the parents. Factor replacement is expensive and bleeding episodes often cause parents to miss work, both of which create financial strains. Refer families to the National Hemophilia Foundation and NHF Youthworld, which offer support, education, youth leadership, scholarships, and a directory of camps for children with hemophilia and other bleeding disorders. Links to these and other helpful resources are located on . Von Willebrand disease Von Willebrand disease (vWD) is a genetically transmitted bleeding disorder that may affect both genders and all races. The disorder is a deficiency in von Willebrand factor (vWF). Under ordinary circumstances vWF serves two functions: to bind with factor VIII, protecting it from breakdown, and to serve as the \"glue\" that attaches platelets to the site of injury. Deficiency in this factor results in a mild bleeding disorder. Children with vWD bruise easily, have frequent nosebleeds (epistaxis), and tend to bleed after oral surgery. Pubescent girls often have menorrhagia. Therapeutic management of vWD is similar to that of hemophilia. Prevention of injury is important. When bleeding or injury does occur, vWF is administered. Desmopressin may also be used to release the factors necessary for clotting. Desmopressin (DDAVP) raises the plasma level from stores in the endothelium of blood vessels; this releases factor VIII and vWF from these stores into the bloodstream. These may also be administered before dental work or surgery. Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment of the child with vWD is similar to the assessment of the child with hemophilia, though severe bleeding occurs much less frequently. Nursing Management Nursing management is also similar to the management of the child with hemophilia. The major difference is the administration of desmopressin. Administer desmopressin nasal spray as prescribed when a bleeding episode occurs. Desmopressin may also be given via an intravenous infusion or subcutaneously (less common). Stimate is the only brand of desmopressin nasal spray that is used for controlling bleeding; the other brands are used for homeostasis and enuresis. Desmopressin is an antidiuretic hormone, so closely monitor fluid balance. Twenty-four hours should lapse between doses, as lessening of the response (tachyphylaxis) occurs with more frequent use (Karp & Riddell, 2010). vWD may also be treated with intravenous infusion of vWF, similar to factor VIII infusion for hemophilia A. Teach children and their families how to avoid or minimize bleeding episodes (see Teaching Guidelines 25.2 ). KEY CONCEPTS The major forms of anemia affecting children are iron-deficiency anemia, lead poisoning, folic acid deficiency, pernicious anemia, sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, and G6PD deficiency. The major bleeding disorders affecting children are purpura, Willebrand disease. Assess for hypoxia, fatigue, and pallor in the child with anemia. Nursing assessment for the child with a bleeding disorder focuses on determining its extent and severity. Supplementation with iron is the key intervention for the child with iron-deficiency anemia. All young children should be screened for lead exposure. Prevention of infection and vaso-occlusive episodes takes priority in children with sickle cell anemia. Multimodal pain management and astute physical assessment for serious complications are critical in the nursing care of the child having a sickle cell crisis. The priority intervention for management of thalassemia is chronic transfusion of packed red blood cells and chelation of iron. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura are usually self-limiting diseases. Administration of factor VII or desmopressin is the key nursing intervention when a bleeding episode occurs in the child with hemophilia or von Willebrand disease. Significant anemia may result in hypoxia to the tissues. Prolonged bleeding times place the child at risk for hemorrhage. Prevention of injury is key for all children with hematologic disorders. Child and family teaching for anemias resulting from nutritional deficiencies focuses on promotion of a diet high in the deficient nutrients. Child and family teaching for bleeding disorders focuses on the prevention of injury. Numerous nationwide and local resources are available to children with hematologic disorders or nutritional deficits. These organizations offer a wide range of services, including education, support, multidisciplinary care (as appropriate), and financial assistance in caring for the disease. REFERENCES Ambruso, D.

Lakeisha Harris, 15 years old, is brought to the clinic by her mother. She presents with complaints of pain and swelling in her joints, weight gain, and fatigue. Lakeisha states, \"I'm just very tired all the time, and my knees and ankles ache.\" Immunodeficiency (incapacity to mount an appropriate immune response), autoimmune, and allergic disorders have a significant impact on the lives of affected children. Infants and children are exposed to many infectious microorganisms and allergens and thus need a functional immune system to protect themselves. Temporary immune deficiencies may follow a common viral infection, surgery, or blood transfusion, and may also be caused by malnutrition or the use of certain medications (Nield, Troischt, & Kamat, 2009). Temporary immune depression resolves over a period of time. Primary or secondary immune deficiencies are the focus of this discussion, along with allergy and anaphylaxis. These immune disorders are chronic, and affected children have more infections compared with healthy children. Recurrent viral or bacterial infections may cause the child to miss significant amounts of school or playtime with other children. Many immunodeficiencies require chronic and frequent clinic visits as well as daily medications. This can be a stress on the family as well. Autoimmune disorders are also chronic, causing significant disruption to the child's and family's life. Allergic disorders in some children may cause significant stress for the child and family. Nurses who care for children need to be familiar with common immunodeficiencies, autoimmune disorders, and allergies to intervene effectively with children and their families.VARIATIONS IN PEDIATRIC ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY Normal immune function is a complex process involving phagocytosis (process by which phagocytes swallow up and break down microorganisms), humoral immunity (immunity mediated by antibodies secreted by B cells), cellular immunity (cell-mediated immunity controlled by T cells), and activation of the complement system. The lymphatic system and the white blood cells (WBCs) are the primary \"players\" in the immune response. Though these structures and cells are present at birth, the healthy full-term infant's immune system is still immature. The newborn exhibits a decreased inflammatory response to invading organisms, and this increases his or her susceptibility to infection. Cellular immunity is generally functional at birth, and as the infant is exposed to various substances over time, humoral immunity develops. Comparison Chart 26.1 provides more information on humoral and cellular immunity. Lymph System Lymph nodes in the newborn are relatively small, soft, and difficult to palpate. As the infant is exposed to various germs or illnesses, the lymph system passively filters plasma for bacteria or other foreign material before returning it to the bloodstream and back to the heart. As WBCs infiltrate the lymph nodes to attack the foreign substance, the nodes enlarge. Young children have frequent episodes of localized enlarged lymph nodes because of their repeated exposure to viral illnesses (Tosi, 2009). The spleen is functional at birth and also filters the blood for foreign cells. The thymus, responsible for the production of lymphocyte T cells as well as for the development and maturation of peripheral lymphoid tissue, is quite enlarged at birth and remains so until about 10 years of age. It then involutes slowly throughout adulthood. The tonsils are also often enlarged throughout early childhood. The bone marrow is functional at birth, producing stem cells capable of differentiating into various blood cells. Phagocytosis Under conditions of stress, the newborn and infant exhibit decreased phagocytic activity. The complement system, which is responsible for opsonization (process of making microorganisms more susceptible to phagocytosis) and chemotaxis (movement of neutrophils toward microorganisms), is immature in the newborn but reaches adult levels of activity by 3 to 6 months of age. The infant's phagocytic cells (neutrophils and monocytes) demonstrate decreased chemotaxis, reaching adult levels when the child is several years old. With complement levels being only 50% to 75% of adult levels in the full-term infant, decreased opsonization may be responsible for decreased phagocytic activity compared with adults. COMPARISON CHART 26.1 HUMORAL VERSUS CELLULAR IMMUNITY Cellular Immunity Maternal T cells do not cross the placenta, so the fetal thymus begins production of T cells early in gestation, and the newborn demonstrates a relative lymphocytosis compared with the adult, probably due to increased amounts of T-cell lymphocytes. Though cellular immunity does not cross the placenta, the fetal T cells may become sensitized to antigens that do cross the placenta. Viral infection, hyperbilirubinemia, and drugs taken by the mother late in pregnancy may contribute to depressed T-cell function in the newborn. Since delayed hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by T cells rather than antibodies, skin test responses (such as purified protein derivative [PPD] for tuberculosis detection) are diminished until about 1 year of age, probably due to the infant's decreased ability to mount an inflammatory response. Humoral Immunity The newborn's B cells do not respond as well to infection as do adults. B cells are responsible for the formation of antibodies (specific immunity). The antibodies bind to the antigen (substance stimulating an immune response), thus disabling the specific toxin.The fetus is normally in an antigen-free environment and so produces only trace amounts of immunoglobulins (Ig; gammaglobulin antibody proteins), specifically IgM. Most of the newborn's IgG is acquired transplacentally from the mother. Hence, the newborn exhibits passive immunity to antigens to which the mother had developed antibodies. These antibodies wane over the first months of life as the transplacental IgG is catabolized, having a half-life of only about 25 days. The newborn begins to make IgG but ordinarily experiences a physiologic hypogammaglobulinemia between 2 and 6 months of age until self-production of IgG reaches higher levels. The breastfed infant will acquire passive transfer of maternal immunity via the breast milk and will be better protected during the physiologic hypogammaglobulinemia phase. By 1 year of age IgG is 70% of the adult level, and by 8 years of age it should reach the adult level. IgA, IgD, IgE, and IgM do not cross the placenta; they require an antigenic challenge for production. IgD and IgE constitute a very small percentage of the immunoglobulins in all ages. IgA increases slowly to about 30% of the adult level at 1 year of age, reaching the adult level by age 11 years. IgM is close to the adult level by 1 year of age (Lederman, 2006).COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS A variety of medications and other medical treatments are used to treat immune deficiencies and autoimmune problems in children. Most of these treatments will require a physician's or nurse practitioner's order when the child is in the hospital. The most common treatments and medications are listed in Common Medical Treatments 26.1 and Drug Guide 26.1 . The nurse caring for the child with an immune deficiency or autoimmune disorder should be familiar with what the procedures and medications are, how they work, and common nursing implications related to use of these modalities. COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS 26.1 DRUG GUIDE 26.1 COMMON DRUGS FOR COMMUNICABLE DISORDERS A traumatic Care When a child requires repeat injections related to an immune or allergic disorder, use a local anesthetic such as EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetic) cream or a numbing spray to reduce the amount of associated pain. NURSING PROCESS OVERVIEW FOR THE CHILD WITH AN IMMUNOLOGIC DISORDER Care of the child with an immunologic or allergic disorder includes assessment, nursing diagnosis, planning, interventions, and evaluation. There are a number of general concepts related to the nursing process that may be applied to immunodeficiencies and autoimmune disorders. From a general understanding of the care involved for a child with immune dysfunction, the nurse can then individualize the care based on the particular child's specifics. Assessment Assessment of children with immunodeficiency, autoimmune disorders, or allergy includes health history, physical examination, and laboratory and diagnostic testing. Remember Lakeisha, the 15-year-old with joint pain and swelling, fatigue, and weight gain? What additional health history and physical examination assessment information should you obtain? Health History The health history consists of past medical history, including the mother's pregnancy history; family history; and history of present illness (when the symptoms started and how they have progressed), as well as medications and treatments used at home. The past medical history may be significant for: Maternal HIV infection Frequent, recurrent infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, or pneumonia Chronic cough Recurrent low-grade fever Two or more serious infections in early childhood Recurrent deep skin or organ abscesses Persistent thrush in the mouth Extensive eczema Growth failure Family history may be positive for primary immune deficiency or autoimmune disorder. Document history of known allergy. Note the response that occurs when the child encounters the allergen. Physical Examination Physical examination of the child with immunodeficiency or autoimmune disorder includes inspection and observation, auscultation, percussion, and palpation.INSPECTION AND OBSERVATION Plot weight and length or height on appropriate growth charts. Inspect the oropharynx for tonsillar size. Note eczematous or other skin lesions, which may occur with allergic diseases or Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Document the presence of thrush, which occurs frequently in children with immunodeficiency. Observe gait for unexplained ataxia (neurologic alterations occur with HIV infection). AUSCULTATION, PERCUSSION, AND PALPATION Auscultate the lungs for adventitious sounds, which may be present with a concurrent respiratory infection. Note any wheezing that may occur with an allergic reaction. Percuss the abdomen and determine liver span. Palpate for unusually enlarged lymph nodes, particularly in nonadjacent locations. Palpate the abdomen for an enlarged spleen or liver. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 26.1 explains the laboratory and diagnostic tests most commonly used when considering immune disorders. Results of these tests may assist the physician or nurse practitioner in diagnosing the disorder and/or be used as guidelines in determining ongoing treatment. Laboratory or nonnursing personnel obtain some of the tests, while the nurse might obtain others. In either instance it is important for the nurse to be familiar with how the tests are obtained, what they are used for, and normal versus abnormal results. This knowledge will also be necessary when providing child and family education related to the testing. Nursing Diagnoses and Related Interventions Upon completion of a thorough assessment, the nurse might identify several nursing diagnoses. These may include: Ineffective protection Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements Pain Impaired skin integrity Activity intolerance Delayed growth and development After completing an assessment of Lakeisha, you note the following: alopecia, abdominal tenderness, and oral ulcers. Based on these assessment findings, what would your top three nursing diagnoses be for Lakeisha? Nursing goals, interventions, and evaluation for the child with an immunologic disorder are based on the nursing diagnoses. Nursing Care Plan 26.1 can be used as a guide in planning nursing care for the child with an immunologic disorder, autoimmune disorder, or allergic response. It should be individualized based on the child's symptoms and needs. Refer to Chapter 14 for thorough information related to pain management. Additional information will be included later in the chapter as it relates to specific disorders. Based on your top three nursing diagnoses for Lakeisha, describe appropriate nursing interventions. COMMON LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS 26.1PRIMARY IMMUNODEFICIENCIES Many primary immunodeficiencies have been identified. They are mostly hereditary or congenital. Primary immunodeficiencies may be related to humoral deficiencies, cellular immunity deficiencies, or a combination of the two; phagocytic system defects; or complement deficiencies. This discussion will focus on a few of the more common and/or severe primary immunodeficiencies in children. Box 26.1 lists 10 warning signs that a child may need further evaluation for the possibility of primary immunodeficiency. Hypogammaglobulinemia Hypogammaglobulinemia refers to a variety of conditions in which the child does not form antibodies appropriately. It results in low or absent levels of one or more of the immunoglobulin classes or subclasses. BOX 26.1 TEN WARNING SIGNS OF PRIMARY IMMUNODEFICIENCY Four or more new episodes of acute otitis media in 1 year Two or more episodes of severe sinusitis in 1 year Treatment with antibiotics for 2 months or longer with little effect Two or more episodes of pneumonia in 1 year Failure to thrive in the infant Recurrent deep skin or organ abscesses Persistent oral thrush or skin candidiasis after 1 year of age History of infections requiring IV antibiotics to clear Two or more serious infections such as sepsis Family history of primary immunodeficiency Adapted from Jeffrey Modell Foundation.

Retrieved July 3, 2011, from http://www.info4pi.org/aboutPI/index.cfm?section=aboutPI&content=warningsigns NURSING CARE PLAN 26.1 Overview for the Child With an Immunologic Disorder NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Ineffective protection related to inadequate body defenses, inability to fight infection as evidenced by deficient immunity Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will not experience overwhelming infection: will be infection-free or able to recover if he or she becomes infected. Intervention: Preventing Infection Maintain meticulous hand-washing procedures (include family, visitors, staff) to minimize spread of infectious organisms. Maintain isolation as prescribed to minimize exposure to infectious organisms. Clean frequently touched surfaces with an appropriate cleanser to minimize spread of infectious organisms. Educate family and visitors that child should be restricted from contact with known infectious exposures (in hospital and at home) to encourage cooperation with infection control. Strictly observe medical asepsis to avoid unintentional introduction of microorganisms. Promote nutrition and appropriate rest to maximize body's potential to heal. Educate family to contact physician or nurse practitioner if child has known exposure to chickenpox or measles so that preventive measures (e.g., varicella zoster immunoglobulin [VZIG]) can be taken. Administer vaccines (not live) as prescribed to prevent common childhood communicable diseases. Administer prophylactic antibiotics as prescribed to prevent infection with opportunistic organisms. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to poor appetite, chronic illness, debilitated state, concurrent illness as evidenced by poor growth, weight gain and stature increases less than expected, poor head growth Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will consume adequate intake: will demonstrate appropriate weight gain and growth of length/height and/or head circumference. Intervention: Promoting Adequate Nutritional Intake Monitor growth (weight and height/length weekly) to determine progress toward goal. Determine realistic goal for weight gain for age (consulting dietitian if necessary) to have a specific outcome to work toward. Observe child's physical ability to eat (if pain from candidiasis or motor impairment is present, will need additional interventions). Provide nutrient-rich meals and snacks to maximize caloric intake. Supplement milkshakes with protein powder or other additives to maximize caloric intake. Provide child's favorite foods to encourage increased intake. Provide smaller, more frequent meals to reduce sensation of fullness and increase overall intake. If vomiting is an issue, administer antiemetics as ordered prior to meals to provide optimal state for success at mealtime. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Impaired skin integrity related to disease process or photosensitivity as evidenced by skin rash or alopecia Outcome Identification and Evaluation Skin integrity will be maintained: secondary infection will not occur, rash will not increase. Intervention: Preventing Skin Impairment Assess and monitor extent and location of rash to provide baseline information and evaluate success of interventions. Keep skin clean and dry to prevent secondary infection. For the child with eczema, apply topical medications as ordered to decrease inflammatory response. For the child with limited mobility, turn frequently and use specialty mattress or bed to prevent pressure ulcers. Implement a written plan of care directed toward topical treatment of skin integrity impairment to provide consistency of care and documentation. Educate child and family to limit direct sun exposure and use sunscreen to prevent sun damage. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Activity intolerance related to joint pain, fatigue or weakness, concurrent illness as evidenced by dyspnea, lack of desire to participate in play, inability to maintain usual routine Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will participate in activities: will demonstrate easy work of breathing and participate in daily routine and play. Intervention: Promoting Activity Cluster care to decrease disturbances and allow for longer uninterrupted rest periods. Pace activities and encourage regular rest periods to conserve energy. Administer early morning warm bath to ease a.m. stiffness (juvenile arthritis). Use assistive devices such as splints and orthotics to improve physical function. Plan developmentally appropriate activities that the child can participate in while in bed to encourage play and continued development. Schedule activities for the time of day the child usually has the most energy to encourage successful participation. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Delayed growth and development related to physical effects of chronic illness, or physical disability (juvenile arthritis) as evidenced by delay in meeting expected milestones Outcome Identification and Evaluation Development will be enhanced: child will make continued progress toward expected developmental milestones. Intervention: Enhancing Growth and Development Screen for developmental capabilities to determine child's current level of functioning. Offer age-appropriate toys, play, and activities (including gross motor) to encourage further development. Encourage peer contact through telephone, e-mail, or letters to promote/continue socialization. Perform interventions as prescribed by physical or occupational therapist: repeat participation in those activities helps child improve function and acquire developmental skills. Provide support to families of children with developmental delay: progress in achieving developmental milestones can be slow, and ongoing motivation is needed. Encourage child to continue schoolwork so that child will not fall behind. Reinforce positive attributes in the child to maintain motivation. Table 26.1 provides an overview of several types of hypogammaglobulinemia. Therapeutic management of most types of hypogammaglobulinemia is periodic administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Nursing Assessment Note history of recurrent respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary infections. Palpate for enlarged lymph nodes and spleen in the child with X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome. In children presenting for routine administration of IVIG, determine whether any infections have occurred since the previous infusion.Nursing Management Nursing management of hypogammaglobulinemia involves IVIG administration and the provision of education and support to the child and family. Administering Intravenous Immunoglobulin Determine the amount of IVIG to be given and reconstitute the product according to the manufacturer's directions (available on the package insert). Some IVIG preparations are provided as a solution, requiring no reconstitution ( Fig. 26.1 ). Others are packaged as two vials, one of IVIG powder and one of sterile diluent. After the diluent is added to the powder, gently roll the vial between your hands to mix. Reconstituted IVIG may be refrigerated overnight but should be brought to room temperature prior to infusion. Assess baseline serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, as acute renal insufficiency may occur as a serious adverse reaction. Though less common in children than adults, assess for risk factors associated with an increased risk for a thromboembolic event, such as history of stroke, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, impaired cardiac output, monoclonal gammopathy, clotting disorder, obesity, (Kirmse, 2009).FIGURE 26.1 Intravenous administration of exogenous immunoglobulin every several weeks can decrease the frequency and severity of infections in children with various forms of hypogammaglobulinemia. Take Note! Do not shake the IVIG, as this may lead to foaming and may cause the immunoglobulin protein to degrade (Kirmse, 2009). Ensure that the child is well hydrated before the infusion to decrease the risk for rate-related reactions and aseptic meningitis after the infusion. Premedication with diphenhydramine or acetaminophen may be indicated in children who have never received IVIG, have not had an infusion in more than 8 weeks, have had a recent bacterial infection, have a history of serious infusion-related adverse reactions, or are diagnosed with agammaglobulinemia or hypogammaglobulinemia (Taketokmo, Hodding, & Kraus, 2010). The rate for infusion of IVIG is generally prescribed as milligrams of IVIG per kilogram of body weight per minute. Carefully calculate the infusion rate. Obtain a baseline physical assessment and set of vital signs. Begin the infusion slowly, increasing to the prescribed rate as tolerated (see Fig. 26.1 ). Assess vital signs and check for adverse reactions every 15 minutes for the first hour, then every 30 minutes throughout the remainder of the infusion (the frequency of assessments may vary according to institutional protocol). IVIG is a plasma product, so observe closely for signs of anaphylaxis such as headache, facial flushing, urticaria, dyspnea, shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, increased anxiety, or hypotension. If these symptoms occur, discontinue the infusion and notify the physician or nurse practitioner. The infusion may be restarted after the symptoms have subsided. Have oxygen and emergency medications such as epinephrine, diphenhydramine, and intravenous corticosteroids available in case of anaphylactic reaction. If the child complains of discomfort at the intravenous site, a cold compress may be helpful. Take Note! Many children who have had previous reactions to IVIG can tolerate the infusion without reaction if they are premedicated and if the infusion is given at a slower rate (Taketokmo et al., 2010). Providing Education and Support Provide education and support to the child and family. An excellent book for children with an immune deficiency is Our ImmuneSystem (1993) by Sara le Bien (available from the Immune Deficiency Foundation, a link to which can be found on ). Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked genetic disorder that results in immunodeficiency, eczema, and thrombocytopenia. It affects males only. The defective gene responsible for this disorder has been identified recently and is called the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp). Complications include autoimmune hemolytic anemia, neutropenia, skin or cerebral vasculitis, arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and renal disease (Dibbern & Routes, 2010). Autoimmune disease may require high-dose steroids, azathioprine, or cyclophosphamide. Splenectomy may be performed to correct thrombocytopenia. The only cure is bone marrow or cord blood stem cell transplantation. Nursing Assessment Note history of petechiae, bloody diarrhea, or bleeding episode in the first 6 months of life. Note any history of hematemesis or intracranial or conjunctival hemorrhages. Observe the skin for eczema, which usually worsens with time and tends to become secondarily infected ( Fig. 26.2 ). Laboratory findings include low IgM concentration, elevated IgA and IgE concentrations, and normal IgG concentrations. Take Note! An episode of prolonged bleeding, such as after circumcision, may be the first sign of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome in the male infant (Dibbern & Routes, 2010). FIGURE 26.2 Boys with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome often have worsening of eczema over time. Nursing Management Administer IVIG as ordered to help decrease the frequency of bacterial infections. Perform good skin care and frequently assess eczematous areas to detect secondary infection (refer to Chapter 24 for care of eczema). If the child undergoes splenectomy, in addition to providing routine postoperative care, be aware of the additional risk for development of infection in the asplenic child. Explain to the child and family that severe cutaneous human papillomavirus infection may occur after stem cell transplantation (even years later) (Neven et al., 2009). Severe Combined Immune DeficiencySevere combined immune deficiency (SCID) is a rare X-linked or autosomal recessive disorder; it can occur in girls or boys. SCID is characterized by absent T-cell and B-cell function. There are at least five types of SCID, classified according to the exact genetic defect. Infants with SCID normally demonstrate symptoms by 2 months of age on average (Secord & Oren, 2009). SCID is a potentially fatal disorder requiring emergency intervention at the time of diagnosis (Secord & Oren, 2009). Gene therapy provides some promise for the future treatment of SCID, but until then bone marrow or stem cell transplantation is necessary (Secord & Oren, 2009). Take Note! Use only cytomegalovirus (CMV)-negative, irradiated blood or platelets if transfusion is necessary in the infant with SCID. CMV-positive blood could cause an infection in the infant, and T lymphocytes in blood products may cause fatal graft-versus-host disease to occur (Norville & Tomlinson, 2010). IVIG infusions may help decrease the number of infections until bone marrow or stem cell transplantation can be done (Secord & Oren, 2009). Certain children with SCID (adenosine deaminase enzyme deficiency) may benefit from lifelong subcutaneous adenosine deaminase enzyme replacement. In addition, long-term antibiotic therapy helps to contain chronic infections in some children with SCID. Nursing Assessment Note history of chronic diarrhea and failure to thrive. Note history of severe infections beginning early in infancy. Inspect the mouth for persistent thrush. Auscultate the lungs, noting adventitious sounds related to pneumonia. Laboratory findings include very low levels of all of the immunoglobulins. Nursing Management Preventing infection is critical. Teach the family to practice good hand washing. The child must not be exposed to persons outside the family, particularly young children. Instruct families to administer prophylactic antibiotics if prescribed. Educate families that the child should not receive live vaccines. Encourage adequate nutrition; supplemental enteral feedings may be necessary in the child with poor appetite. Administer IVIG infusions as prescribed and monitor for adverse reactions (refer to the nursing management section for hypogammaglobulinemia for further information related to IVIG administration). If the child receives a bone marrow transplant (human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-matched sibling is preferred), provide posttransplant care as outlined in Chapter 28 . Teach the family that severe cutaneous human papillomavirus infection may occur after stem cell transplantation (even years later). Refer the family for genetic counseling. Provide ongoing support; this is a difficult disease for families to cope with and the therapy required is lifelong. Take Note! Monitor the child who had a bone marrow or stem cell transplant closely for a maculopapular rash that usually starts on the palms and soles; this is an indication that graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is developing. GVHD is a life-threatening condition in which donor cells attack host cells (Norville & Tomlinson, 2010).SECONDARY IMMUNODEFICIENCIES Secondary immunodeficiency may occur as a result of chronic illness, malignancy, use of immuno-suppressive (lowering the immune response) medication, malnutrition or protein-losing state, prematurity, or HIV infection. This discussion will focus on HIV infection. HIV Infection Worldwide, 2.1 million children younger than 18 years old are living with HIV infection and about 1,200 become infected with HIV each day (UNAIDS, 2009). Children acquire HIV either vertically or horizontally. Vertical transmission refers to perinatal (in utero or during birth) transmission or via breast milk. Horizontal transmission refers to transmission via nonsterile needles (as in intravenous drug use or tattooing) or via intimate sexual contact. With nationwide screening of blood products, HIV transmission via transfused blood products has become rare (Fahrner & Romano, 2010). HIV infection in children may be further classified depending on severity of immune suppression. This classification may serve to guide health care planning. Infants primarily become infected through their mothers, whereas adolescents primarily contract HIV infection through sexual activity or intravenous drug use (Fahrner & Romano, 2010). In the United States, perinatal transmission of HIV infection has declined dramatically due to improved maternal detection and treatment, as well as newborn treatment (Fahrner & Romano, 2010). Data available from 34 states indicate that current incidence is 612 per 100,000 infants (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2010b). Nearly 2000 new cases of HIV infection were reported in 2008 among adolescents 13 to 19 years of age (CDC, 2010a). Currently, there is no cure for HIV infection, though survival has improved since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (see Evidence-Based Practice 26.1 ). In addition to improved survival, improved growth, neurodevelopment, and immune function occur with HAART (Fahrner & Romano, 2010). See EBP 26.1 Pathophysiology HIV affects immune function via alterations mainly in T-cell function, but it also affects B cells, natural killer cells, and monocyte/macrophage function. HIV infects the CD4 (T-helper) cells. The virus replicates itself via the CD4 cell and renders the cell dysfunctional. Immune deficiency results as the number of normal, functioning CD4 cells drops. Initially, as CD4 counts decrease, the T-suppressor (CD8) counts increase, but as the disease progresses, CD8 counts also fall. The helper T-cell function declines even in asymptomatic infants and children who have not experienced significant decreases in the CD4 cell count. The T cells lose response to recall antigens, and this loss is associated with an increased risk of serious bacterial infection (Farland, 2011). B-cell defects also occur in HIV-infected children, contributing to high rates of serious bacterial infections. The B cells demonstrate impaired response to mitogens and antigens. They also exhibit defective antibody production in response to antigen exposure or vaccination. Also, infants lack a pool of memory B cells for recall antigens (simply from lack of exposure). Natural killer cells also are affected by HIV infection, as they are dependent on cytokines secreted by the CD4 cells for development of functionality. Functional killer cells play a role in fighting viruses and are critical to immunity in the newborn while the T-cell line develops. Decreased function of the natural killer cells then contributes to increased severity of viral infection in the HIV-infected child or infant. Though the virus does not destroy monocytes and macrophages, their function is affected. Macrophages in the HIV-infected child exhibit decreased chemotaxis and the antigen-presenting capability of the monocytes is defective. Without appropriate T-cell, B-cell, natural killer cell, monocyte, and macrophage function, the infant's or child's immune system cannot fight infections it ordinarily could. Recurrent infection with ordinary organisms occurs more frequently in children with HIV infection, and the infections are more severe than in noninfected children. Opportunistic infections also occur in HIV-infected children, similar to those in adults with HIV infection. HIV rapidly invades the central nervous system in infants and children and is responsible for progressive HIV encephalopathy. As a result of encephalopathy, acquired microcephaly, motor deficits, or loss of previously achieved developmental milestones may occur. In children with progressive HIV encephalopathy, neurologic symptoms may present before immune suppression. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 26.1 DOES PATIENT EDUCATION AND SUPPORT PROMOTE ADHERENCE TO HIGHLY ACTIVE ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY (HAART) FOR HIV/AIDS? STUDYThe key determinant of degree and length of viral suppression in HIV infection is high adherence to HAART. Conversely, poor adherence leads to treatment failure. Children potentially have a significant number of years of life for which they will need to remain compliant with HAART. Each period of noncompliance further contributes to cross-resistance, limiting future treatment options. The authors evaluated a large number of randomized controlled trials that examined the effectiveness of patient education and support in improving HAART adherence. Findings Education and support interventions are effective in improving HAART adherence. The most effective interventions are those delivered over a 12-week period or longer, targeting individuals rather than groups, and that provide practical medication management skills. Nursing Implications HAART adherence is critical to the potential life of an HIV-infected child. Despite numerous medication side effects and the stigma associated with HIV infection, nurses can make a difference in these children's lives. Educate parents at every opportunity about the importance of HAART adherence. Provide families with ideas for managing unpleasant side effects of antiretroviral drugs. Involve children in medication administration. Provide developmentally appropriate education to children and adolescents. Praise families' and children's efforts at HAART adherence. Adapted from Reuda, S., Park-Wyllie, L. Y., Bayoumi, A. M., Tynan, A. M., Antoniou, T. A., Rourke, S. B., et al. (2007). Patient support and education for promoting adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS. The Cochrane Library 2007, 4. Indianapolis, IN: John Wiley & Sons. Therapeutic Management Current recommendations for treatment of HIV infection in children include the use of a combination of antiretroviral drugs (Fahrner & Romano, 2010). Medication therapy ranges from single-drug therapy in the asymptomatic HIV-exposed newborn to highly active antiretroviral therapy, consisting of a combination of antiretroviral drugs. Medications are prescribed based on the severity of the child's illness. One of the goals of HAART is to prevent or arrest progressive HIV encephalopathy (Fahrner & Romano, 2010). Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 949 . Assessment findings pertinent to HIV infection in children are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Failure to thrive Recurrent bacterial infections Opportunistic infections Chronic or recurrent diarrhea Recurrent or persistent fever Developmental delay Prolonged candidiasis These signs and symptoms may be present in either the child who is undergoing initial diagnosis or the child with known HIV infection. Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as maternal HIV infection or AIDS, receipt of blood transfusions in a developing country (without adequate screening measures), adolescent or childhood sexual abuse, substance use or abuse (including intravenous drug use), or participation in vaginal or anal sex without the use of a condom. Document who the primary caregiver is, as many children with HIV have lost their parents to the disease. In addition, for the child with known HIV infection, determine the child's medications and dosages as well as the outcome of any recent health care visits or hospitalizations. Physical Examination Perform a thorough and complete physical examination on the child with suspected or known HIV infection.BOX 26.2 VIROLOGIC TESTING FOR HIV-EXPOSED INFANTS (WITH POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION) At birth 4 to 7 weeks of age 8 to 16 weeks of age Serologic testing at 12 months of age or older to document disappearance of the HIV-1 antibody INSPECTION AND OBSERVATION Note presence of fever. Measure weight, height or length, and head circumference (in children younger than 3 years old) and plot this information on standard growth charts, noting whether the measurements fall within the average or below the lower percentiles. Perform a developmental screening test to detect developmental delay. Inspect the oral cavity for candidiasis. Observe work of breathing (may be increased if pneumonitis or pneumonia is present). Determine level of consciousness (may be depressed if HIV encephalopathy is present). AUSCULTATION AND PALPATION Auscultate the lungs, noting adventitious breath sounds associated with pneumonia or pneumonitis. Palpate for the presence of enlarged lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) or swollen parotid glands. Palpate the abdomen, noting hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of HIV infection include: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test: positive in infected infants older than 1 month of age. PCR is the preferred test to determine HIV infection in infants and to exclude HIV infection as early as possible. Box 26.2 gives recommendations for testing. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test: positive in infants of HIV-infected mothers because of transplacentally received antibodies. These antibodies may persist and remain detectable up to 24 months of age, making the ELISA test less accurate at detecting HIV infection in infants and toddlers than the PCR. Platelet count: above 500,000 (in severe HIV infection) CD4 counts (low in HIV infection) Nursing Management Nursing care of the child with HIV infection is directed at avoiding infection, promoting compliance with the medication regimen, promoting nutrition, providing pain management and comfort measures, educating the child and caregivers, and providing ongoing psychosocial support. Children with HIV infection may access health services through funding provided by the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act (Health Resources and Services Administration, the HIV/AIDS Program, 2011). This federal funding provides for primary health care and other services to persons with HIV infection. Nursing Care Plan 26.1 lists appropriate nursing diagnoses and interventions. In addition, nursing management specific to HIV infection is covered below. Preventing HIV Infection in Children It is important to offer all pregnant women routine HIV counseling and voluntary testing. Depending on the stage of pregnancy, the mother should be treated with an antiretroviral drug if she is HIV positive. Children born to HIV-positive mothers should receive a 6- week course of zidovudine (ZDV) therapy (Fahrner & Romano, 2010). Discourage breastfeeding in the HIV-infected mother and instruct her about safe alternatives to breastfeeding. Early recognition of infection is crucial so that treatment can begin, HIV encephalopathy may be prevented, and progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome can be prevented. Educate sexually active adolescents about HIV transmission and urge them to use condoms. Counsel teens about the increased risk of HIV transmission with all forms of sexual activity, explaining that vaginal and anal sex are even riskier than oral sex. Urge teens to limit the number of sexual partners. Discourage substance use, as the effects of drugs and alcohol often impair the teen's ability to make wise choices about sexual conduct. Warn teens of the risk of contracting HIV infection via shared needles (as with intravenous drug use or via unclean needles used in tattooing). See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Promoting Compliance With Antiretroviral Therapy Before HAART was available as a treatment option, progressive HIV encephalopathy was inevitably fatal, usually within 2 years of diagnosis (Fahrner & Romano, 2010). To prevent progression of HIV disease and prevent encephalopathy, compliance with the HAART regimen is required. Educate the family about the importance of complying with the medication regimen. Help the caregivers develop a schedule for medication administration that is compatible with the family's home routine. See Healthy People 2010. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov .Reducing Risk for Infection In the newborn whose mother is infected with tuberculosis, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B or C, or herpes simplex virus, provide testing and treatment. To prevent infection with Pneumocystis jiroveci , administer prophylactic antibiotics as prescribed in any HIV-exposed infant in whom HIV infection has not yet been excluded. Provide tuberculosis screening and childhood immunization in accordance with national guidelines. Thinking About Development J asmine Smith is a 5-year-old female with HIV infection. She fights taking her antiretroviral medications because of the nausea and vomiting associated with them. Lucy Panco is a 15-year-old female also with HIV infection. She is noncompliant with her antiretroviral medications, also because of the associated nausea and vomiting. How will the nurse teach Jasmine about the medications? How will she foster compliance in Jasmine? What is the most appropriate approach for the nurse to take to educate Lucy about compliance with medications? How will the approaches to education and encouragement of compliance be different for these two children? How will they be similar? Take Note! Do not administer live vaccines to the immunocompromised child without the express consent of the infectious disease or immunology specialist. Immunosuppression is a contraindication to vaccination with live vaccines (Nield et al., 2009). Promoting Nutrition For the infant, provide increased-calorie formula as tolerated. For the child, provide high-calorie, high-protein meals and snacks. Supplements may be added to milkshakes to increase the protein intake. Ensure that the child is able to choose foods that he or she prefers from the hospital menu. Document growth through weekly measurements of weight and height/length. Promoting Comfort Children with HIV infection experience pain from infections, encephalopathy, adverse effects of medications, and the numerous procedures and treatments that are required, such as venipuncture, biopsy, or lumbar puncture. Refer to Chapter 14 for detailed information about pain assessment and management. Take Note! Family-centered care of the HIV-exposed child and HIV-infected mother may involve a multidisciplinary approach and can result in improved outcomes for both the mother and the child (Fahrner & Romano, 2010). Providing Family Education and Support Educate caregivers about the medication regimen, the ongoing follow-up that is needed, and when to call the infectious disease provider. Families of HIV-infected children experience a significant amount of stress from many sources: the diagnosis of an incurable disease, financial difficulties, multiple family members with HIV, HIV-associated stigmas, desire to keep HIV infection confidential, and multiple medical appointments and hospitalizations. Parents of HIV-infected children often die of AIDS themselves, leaving care of the child to another relative or foster parent. The day care center or school that the child attends will need education about HIV, which can be provided only if the parent or caretaker consents to divulging the child's diagnosis to that agency. Provide education to the school or day care center about how the infection is transmitted (i.e., not through casual contact). Disclosure of the diagnosis of HIV to the child is another source of stress for the family. The timing of this disclosure will vary considerably depending on the child's and family's situation. Generally, children older than 6 years of age will eventually need to have their diagnosis disclosed to them in an age-appropriate manner. They begin to ask questions and often seem to sense that something is going on other than what they've been told so far. When made aware of the diagnosis and educated about the disease, the child may exhibit a variety of reactions. Anger, depression, or school problems may occur. The child may experience a spiritual dilemma. The nurse should continue to provide emotional support to the child and family. If the disclosure results in significant emotional turmoil, refer the child and caregivers to a counselor, social worker, or psychologist. Anticipatory grieving also may occur. Parents or caregivers may express guilt or anger over the diagnosis of HIV infection. At theother end of the spectrum, families may use denial as their method for coping. Use therapeutic communication with open-ended questions to discover the family's thoughts and fears. Provide emotional support and allow for crying and verbalization. If needed, refer the caregivers to the appropriate professional for additional psychological and emotional intervention. Many children with HIV have psychosocial, emotional, and cognitive problems. These contribute to a lower quality of life. They are affected by the stigma of their diagnosis and often by the social isolation associated with it. They may suffer multiple losses within the family related to deaths caused by HIV infection. Children with HIV infection need significant psychosocial support and intervention.

His aunt has recently taken over the care of Jake since his mother is too ill with HIV infection to care for him. What education will be important for Jake's aunt and her family? Discuss some of the psychosocial issues and concerns that face a child with HIV and his or her family.AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS Autoimmune disorders result from the immune system's malfunction. The body manufactures T cells and antibodies against its own cells and organs ( autoantibodies ). The development of an autoimmune disorder is thought to be multifactorial. Potential influencing factors include heredity, hormones, self-marker molecules, and environmental influences such as viruses and certain drugs. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disorder that affects both humoral and cellular immunity. SLE can affect any organ system, so the onset and course of the disease are quite variable. SLE is usually diagnosed after age 5 years (usually between 15 and 45 years of age), but onset can occur at any age (Mina & Brunner, 2010). The female-to-male ratio for persons affected by SLE is 4:1 in childhood and 9:1 in adolescence (Mina & Brunner, 2010). SLE is more common in non-Caucasians, and typically African American and Hispanic children and adolescents experience more severe effects from SLE than other racial or ethnic groups (Mina & Brunner, 2010). Pathophysiology In SLE, autoantibodies react with the child's self-antigens to form immune complexes. The immune complexes accumulate in the tissues and organs, causing an inflammatory response resulting in vasculitis. Injury to the tissues and pain occur. Since SLE may affect any organ system, the potential for alterations or damage to tissues anywhere in the body is significant. In some cases, the autoimmune response may be preceded by a drug reaction, an infection, or excessive sun exposure. In children, the most common initial symptoms are hematologic, cutaneous, and musculoskeletal in origin. The disease is chronic, with periods of remission and exacerbation (flares). Common complications of SLE include ocular or visual accident (CVA), transverse myelitis, immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis, pericarditis, valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease, seizures, and psychosis. Therapeutic Management Therapeutic management focuses on treating the inflammatory response. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and antimalarial agents are often prescribed for the child with mild to moderate SLE. The child with severe SLE or frequent flare-ups of symptoms may require high-dose (pulse) corticosteroid therapy or immunosuppressive drugs. When end-stage renal failure develops as a result of glomerulonephritis, dialysis becomes necessary. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 949 . Assessment findings pertinent to SLE in children are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history are history of fatigue, fever, weight changes, pain or swelling in the joints, numbness, tingling or coolness of extremities, or prolonged bleeding. Assess for risk factors, which include female sex; family history; African, Native American, or Asian descent; recent infection; drug reaction; or excessive sun exposure. Physical Examination Measure temperature and document the presence of fever. Observe the skin for malar rash (a butterfly-shaped rash over the cheeks); discoid lesions on the face, scalp, or neck; changes in skin pigmentation; or scarring ( Fig. 26.3 ). Document alopecia. Inspect the oral cavity for painless ulcerations and the joints for edema. Measure blood pressure, as hypertension may occur with renal involvement. Auscultate the lungs; adventitious breath sounds may be present if the pulmonary system is involved. Palpate the joints, noting tenderness. Palpate the abdomen and note areas of tenderness (abdominal involvement is more common in children with SLE than in adults). Box 26.4 lists common clinical findings in SLE.FIGURE 26.3 The malar or butterfly rash (erythema over the cheeks in the shape of a butterfly) is typical in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). antinuclear antibody (ANA) is usually positive in children with SLE. Laboratory and Diagnostic Findings Laboratory findings may include decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, decreased platelet count, and low WBC count. Complement levels, C3 and C4, will also be decreased. Though not specific to SLE, the antinuclear antibody (ANA) is usually positive in children with SLE. BOX 26.4 MOST COMMON CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF SYSTEMIC LUPUS rash Stomatitis Thrombocytopenia Nursing Management Nursing management of the child or adolescent with SLE is long term and supportive. Management focuses on preventing and monitoring for complications. Educate the child and family about the importance of a healthy diet, regular exercise, and adequate sleep and rest. Administer NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and antimalarial agents as ordered for the child with mild to moderate SLE and pulse corticosteroid therapy or immunomodulators to the child with severe SLE or frequent flare-ups. Refer families to support services such as the Lupus Alliance of America and the Lupus Foundation of America, links to which can be found on . Preventing and Monitoring for Complications Teach families to apply sunscreen (minimum SPF 15) to their child's skin daily to prevent rashes resulting from photosensitivity. Instruct the child and family to protect against cold weather by layering warm socks and wearing gloves when outdoors in the winter. If the child is outside for extended periods during the winter months, inspect the fingers and toes for discoloration. Watch for thedevelopment of nephritis by evaluating blood pressure, serum BUN and creatinine levels, and urine output and monitoring for hematuria or proteinuria. Ensure that yearly vision screening and ophthalmic examinations are performed to preserve visual function should changes occur. Take Note! Avascular necrosis (lack of blood supply to a joint, resulting in tissue damage) may occur as an adverse effect of long-term or high-dose corticosteroid use. Teach families to report new onset of joint pain, particularly with weight bearing, or limited range of motion to their physician or nurse practitioner (Tofferi & Gilliland, 2009). Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an autoimmune disorder in which the autoantibodies mainly target the joints. Inflammatory changes in the joints cause pain, redness, warmth, stiffness, and swelling. Stiffness usually occurs after inactivity (as in the morning, after sleep). Some forms also affect the eyes or other organs. Table 26.2 explains the three most common types. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a chronic disease; the child may experience healthy periods alternating with flare-ups. In some children the disease resolves as they approach adolescence or adulthood, while others will have more severe disease that continues throughout the adult years (Jones & Higgins, 2010). Juvenile idiopathic arthritis was formerly termed \"juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,\" but unlike adult rheumatoid arthritis, few types of juvenile arthritis actually demonstrate a positive rheumatoid factor. Therapeutic management focuses on inflammation control, pain relief, promotion of remission, and maintenance of mobility. NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and antirheumatic drugs such as methotrexate and etanercept are prescribed, depending on the type and severity of the disease. NSAIDs are helpful with pain relief, but disease-modifying (antirheumatic) drugs are necessary to prevent disease progression. Nursing Assessment Note history of irritability or fussiness, which may be the first sign of this disease in the infant or very young child. Note complaints of pain, though children do not always communicate this. Document history of withdrawal from play or difficulty getting the child out of bed in the morning (joint stiffness after inactivity). Inquire about history of fever (above 39.5\u00b0C for 2 weeks or more in systemic disease). Measure temperature (fever is present with systemic disease). Inspect skin for evanescent, pale red, nonpruritic macular rash, which may be present at diagnosis of systemic disease. Observe the gait, noting limping or guarding of a joint or extremity. Document growth, which may be delayed. Inspect and palpate each joint for edema, redness, warmth, and tenderness ( Fig. 26.4 ). Note positioning of joints (usually flexed in position of comfort). Mild to moderate anemia and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate are common. Young children with the pauciarticular form may demonstrate a positive antinuclear antibody, and adolescents with polyarticular disease may have a positive rheumatoid factor. Nursing ManagementNursing management focuses on managing pain, maintaining mobility, and promoting a normal life. Refer the child to a pediatric rheumatologist to ensure that he or she receives the most up-to-date treatment. Disease-modifying medications approved for use in children may produce better long-term outcomes than were possible in the past. Clinical research trial information is available through the Childhood Arthritis & Rheumatology Research Alliance. Encourage regular eye examinations and vision screening to allow for early treatment of visual changes and to prevent blindness. FIGURE 26.4 Note the swollen, reddened joints of this child with juvenile arthritis. Managing Pain and Maintaining Mobility Administer medications as prescribed to control inflammation and prevent disease progression. Refer to Drug Guide 26.1 for information related to NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Maintain joint range of motion and muscle strength via exercise (physical or occupational therapy). Swimming is a particularly useful exercise to maintain joint mobility without placing pressure on the joints. Teach families appropriate use of splints prescribed to prevent joint contractures. Monitor for pressure areas or skin breakdown with splint or orthotic use. Promoting Normal Life Chronic pain and decreased mobility may impact the child's psychological and emotional status significantly, during both childhood and adulthood. Providing adequate pain relief and promoting compliance with the disease-modifying medication regimen may allow the child to have a more normal life in the present as well as in the future. In addition to measures described in the previous section, encourage adequate sleep to allow the child to cope better with symptoms and to function better in school. Sleep may be promoted by a warm bath at bedtime and warm compresses to affected joints or massage. To prevent social isolation, encourage the child to attend school and ensure that teachers, the school nurse, and classmates are educated about the child's disease and any limitations on activity. Having two sets of books (one at school and one at home) allows the child to do homework without having to carry heavy books home. Modifications such as allowing the child to leave the classroom early in order to get to the next class on time may seem small but can have a significant impact on the child's life. Encourage children and families to become involved with local support groups so they can see that they are not alone. Assist children to set and achieve goals to increase their sense of hopefulness. Special summer camps for children with juvenile arthritis allow the child to socialize and belong to a group and have been shown to promote self-esteem in the child with chronic illness. Encourage appropriate family functioning and refer the family to support groups such as those sponsored by the American Juvenile Arthritis Organization.ALLERGY AND ANAPHYLAXIS Allergy is an immune-mediated response resulting in an adverse physiologic event or reaction. Allergy affects up to 25% of the pediatric population (Sloand & Caschera, 2010). The extent of the allergic response is determined by the duration, rate, and amount of exposure to the allergen as well as environmental and host factors. IgE-mediated allergy will be the focus of this discussion. This type of allergic response is mediated by antigen-specific IgE antibodies. When the antibody is exposed to the antigen (allergen), rapid cell activation occurs and potent mediators and cytokines are released, resulting in changes in the blood vessels, bronchi, and mucus- secreting glands. In addition to the (asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis), urticaria, digestive allergy, and systemic anaphylaxis are also IgE mediated. Though any allergen has the potential to trigger an anaphylactic response, food and insect sting allergies are most common (Sloand & Caschera, 2010). Food Allergies A true food hypersensitivity or allergy is defined as an immunologic reaction resulting from the ingestion of a food or food additive. This type of reaction is an IgE-mediated response to a particular food. Food allergy affects approximately 2% to 8% of children and can lead to significant medical complications (Sloand & Caschera, 2010). During the first few years of life, the most common food allergens are milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish and shellfish, wheat, and soy. Typically, allergies to these foods are acquired in childhood. For most children only allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, and fish and shellfish persist into adulthood (Sloand & Caschera, 2010). Most reactions occur within minutes of exposure, but they may occur up to 2 hours after ingestion. Signs and symptoms of a food allergy reaction include hives, flushing, facial swelling, mouth and throat itching, and runny nose. Many children also have a gastrointestinal reaction, including vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. In extreme cases, swelling of the tongue, uvula, pharynx, or upper airway may occur. Wheezing can be an ominous sign that the airway is edematous. Rarely, cardiovascular collapse occurs. Though the risk for anaphylaxis is small, parents, caregivers, and physicians and nurse practitioners should be vigilant when caring for children with food allergies. Therapeutic Management Therapeutic management involves verifying the food allergy, avoiding the allergen, and treating the reaction with medications, including antihistamines and epinephrine (in the case of an anaphylactic reaction). Discerning a true food allergy from intolerance to certain foods is an important part of therapeutic management. \"Food intolerance\" is a general term that describes an abnormal physiologic response to an ingested food or food additive that has not been proven to be immunologic. Often a milk allergy is confused with lactose intolerance. Therefore, a detailed dietary history is important when distinguishing a true allergy versus intolerance. Preventing the development of food allergies is also a key intervention. To prevent the development of food allergies, infants should be breastfed for at least the first 6 months of life and the following common food allergens should be avoided in children younger than 1 year of age: Cow's milk Eggs Peanuts Tree nuts Citrus Fish and shellfish (Burns, Dunn, Brady, Starr, & Blosser, 2009) Nursing Assessment It is important to accurately assess children with food allergy reactions. In the initial nursing assessment, immediately assess the child for airway, breathing, or circulation problems (see Chapter 31 ). If the child's condition is stable, finish the assessment. Make sure that the health history includes a detailed food history and documentation of the reaction, including the food suspected of causing the reaction, the quantity of food ingested, the length of time between ingestion and development of symptoms, the symptoms, what treatment has been administered, and the subsequent response. Note gastrointestinal symptoms such as: Burning in the mouth or throat Bloating Nausea DiarrheaAssess for risk factors such as previous exposure to the food, history of poorly controlled asthma, or an increase in atopic dermatitis flare-ups in relation to food intake. Inspect the skin for color, rash, hives, or edema. Auscultate the heart and lungs to determine heart rate and to assess for wheezing. Allergy skin-prick tests and radioallergosorbent blood tests (RASTs) are used widely by physicians and nurse practitioners to look for allergic reactions. However, these tests may have false-positive results, and children may need to avoid many foods unnecessarily (Sloand & Caschera, 2010). Food-specific IgE testing is recommended if the child has a history of food allergy. If the child has episodic symptoms, an oral challenge in a controlled setting may be appropriate. For an oral challenge, the child slowly eats a serving of the offending food over the period of 1 hour. Record vital signs and note the presence or absence of allergic symptoms. If symptoms are chronic, a trial elimination diet may be indicated. If symptoms resolve without the food, true allergy may be present. On an elimination diet, the child should stop eating all suspicious foods for 1 to 2 weeks and then retry the foods one at a time, over a period of several days, to see whether a similar reaction occurs. Oral challenge testing and retrying of foods after an elimination diet are often done in the physician's or nurse practitioner's office or hospital setting if severe reactions have occurred in the past. If a similar reaction to a previous reaction to a certain food or foods occurs with the oral challenge or elimination diet testing, it is very suggestive of a food allergy. Food avoidance is recommended for those who have a highly predictive reaction to testing or a history of anaphylactic response. Nursing Management Initial nursing management is aimed at stabilizing the child's condition if an acute reaction to a food allergen is present (see Chapter 31 ). As stated above, medications used in the treatment of a food allergy reaction include histamine blockers and, in anaphylactic reactions, epinephrine. Teach the child (if appropriate) and the parents how and when to use these medications during an allergic reaction. The child who has been prescribed an EpiPen should carry the pen with him or her at all times. Since these reactions can be so sudden (unknown ingestion of allergen) and severe, it is helpful for the family to have a written emergency plan in case of a reaction. Managing the Child's Diet Aim dietary teaching at educating the child and family on how to avoid the offending foods. Families should be extremely careful when reading food labels. A dietitian may be helpful in this teaching process. Teaching Guidelines 26.1 gives information about hidden allergens in food. Teach the parents what \"safe\" foods can be substituted for offensive ones ( Box 26.5 ). Children with peanut allergy should also avoid tree nuts. Teaching Guidelines 26.1 ALLERGENS HIDDEN IN FOOD Adapted from The Food Allergen and Anaphylaxis Network. (2011). Allergens. Retrieved July 3, 2011, from http://www.foodallergy.org/section/allergens Having a child with a food allergy can be very anxiety producing for parents; they often live in fear that the child may accidentally ingest an allergen. Educate the child and family about allergic reactions to help decrease their anxiety. Teach the child and family how to recognize the signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction. It may be necessary to provide information to day care providers as well as schoolteachers, staff, and camp counselors. Refer families to the Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network. A link to this website can be found on .Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is an acute IgE-mediated response to an allergen that involves many organ systems and may be life-threatening. In addition to nuts, shellfish, eggs, and bee or wasp stings, drugs such as penicillin and NSAIDs, radiopaque dyes, and latex are the leading causes of anaphylaxis (Linzer, 2011). The reaction is severe and usually starts within 5 to 10 minutes of exposure, though delayed reactions are possible. Histamines and secondary mediators are released from the mast cells and eosinophils in response to contact with an allergen. Cutaneous, cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, and neurologic symptoms occur. Vasodilation results in a rapid decrease in plasma volume, leading to the risk of circulatory collapse. Prolonged resuscitation may be needed, and death may occur. BOX 26.5 FOOD SUBSTITUTIONS Replace milk with water, fruit juice, rice milk, or soymilk. Replace each egg with 1.5 tablespoons each of water and oil and 1 teaspoon baking powder; OR 1 packet plain gelatin with 2 tablespoons warm water added at time of use; OR 1 teaspoon yeast and a quarter-cup warm water. Replace peanuts or tree nuts with raisins, dates, or crispy cereal. Adapted from Winkels, K. (2010). How to eat with food allergies: Finding allergy-free substitutes. Retrieved July 3, 2011, from http://www.eatingwithfoodallergies.com/allergyfreesubstitutes.html Therapeutic management focuses on assessment and support of the airway, breathing, and circulation. Epinephrine is usually required, and intramuscular or intravenous diphenhydramine is used secondarily. Late-onset reactions can be prevented with corticosteroids. Nursing Assessment Assess patency of the airway and adequacy of breathing. Determine if circulation is sufficient. Note level of consciousness. Obtain a brief history, inquiring specifically about allergen exposure. Determine whether the child has received any medication (e.g., epinephrine or diphenhydramine) since the onset of the reaction and what effect the medication had on the symptoms. Table 26.3 gives additional signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis. Nursing Management Nursing management initially focuses on supporting the airway, breathing, and circulation. Provide supplemental oxygen by mask or bag-valve-mask ventilation. Ensure that bronchodilator inhalation treatment (albuterol) is given if bronchospasm is present. Administer intravenous fluids to provide volume expansion. Administer epinephrine, diphenhydramine, and/or corticosteroids as ordered to reverse the allergic process. Preventing and Managing Future EpisodesIt is critical to educate the family about preventing and managing future episodes. Teach the family how to use injectable epinephrine in case of subsequent allergen exposure. Intramuscular epinephrine may be given via the EpiPen\u00ae or EpiPen Jr\u00ae. Dosage is based on the child's weight. The child should carry the pen with him or her at all times. Explain to the child and family that the gray safety release on the EpiPen\u00ae should never be removed until just before use. In addition, teach the child and family that the thumb, fingers, or hand should not be placed over the black tip. Nursing Procedure 26.1 gives further instructions related to EpiPen\u00ae use. Instruct the child and family to call 911 and seek immediate medical attention after using the EpiPen\u00ae. Warn the child that the epinephrine may make him or her feel as if the heart is racing. Day care providers, school nurses, teachers, and staff who interact with the child must know how to recognize an anaphylactic event. In 2004, Public Law No. 108-377, Asthmatic Schoolchildren's Treatment and Health Management Act, was passed by the U.S. Congress. This law is intended to ensure that students with severe allergies can carry prescribed medications (i.e., EpiPen\u00ae) with them. All children with allergies should have an action plan in place at the school or day care center. Advise the child to wear a medical ID alert bracelet or necklace at all times. Teach children and families to avoid known food allergens. Avoid stings from bees and wasps (Hymenoptera) by being alert when eating outdoors, wearing long sleeves and pants when in fields, and having bee and wasp hives or nests removed from areas near the family's home. Avoid use of cephalosporins in children with severe penicillin allergy. Desensitization is available for children with severe penicillin allergy. Desensitization involves administration of increasingly larger doses of penicillin over a period of hours to days in an intensive care setting. Latex Allergy Latex allergy is an IgE-mediated response to exposure to latex, a natural rubber product used in many common items (especially gloves in the health care setting). The pathophysiology of latex allergy is similar to that of food allergy. Avoidance of latex products is recommended for those who are allergic to it. An immediate allergic reaction may occur if a latex-allergic child comes into contact with latex. Latex allergy can also result in anaphylaxis (refer to section above on anaphylaxis). Nursing Assessment Screen all children who visit a health care facility of any kind for latex allergy. Ask if the child is allergic to rubber gloves or has ever developed hives after exposure to them. Ask the parent if the child has symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath after glove exposure. Has the child ever had swelling in the mouth or complained that the mouth itched after a dental examination? Determine whether the child has ever had allergic symptoms after eating foods with a known cross-reactivity to latex, such as pear, peach, passion fruit, plum, pineapple, kiwi, fig, grape, cherry, melon, nectarine, papaya, apple, apricot, banana, chestnut, carrot, celery, avocado, tomato, or potato. For the child who has come into contact with latex, assess for symptoms of a reaction such as hives; wheeze; cough; shortness of breath; palate, or eye pruritus; or hypotension. NURSING PROCEDURE 26.1 Using the Epipen\u00ae or Epipen Jr.\u00ae 1. Grasp the EpiPen\u00ae or EpiPen Jr.\u00ae with the black tip pointing downward, forming a first (Fig. 1). 2. With the other hand, pull off the gray safety release. 3. Swing and jab the EpiPen\u00ae firmly into the outer thigh at a 90-degree angle and hold firmly there for 10 seconds (Figs. 2 and 3).4. Remove the EpiPen\u00ae and massage the thigh for 10 seconds. Adapted from Dey Pharma. (2010). How to use EpiPen autoinjector. Retrieved July 3, 2011, from http://www.epipen.com/how-to-use-epipen Nursing Management Nursing management of latex allergy focuses on preventing exposure to latex products. Instruct children and their families to avoid foods with a known cross-reactivity to latex such as those listed above. If the child is exposed to latex, remove the irritating substance and cleanse the area with soap and water. Assess for the need for resuscitation and perform it if needed. Become familiar with your institution's latex allergy policy. Know which products contain latex and which do not. Document latex allergy on the chart, the child's identification band, the medication administration record, and the physician's order sheet. Refer families to resources for persons with latex allergy. Some helpful links are provided on. KEY CONCEPTS Waning of maternal antibodies in early infancy while humoral immunity is developing leads to physiologic hypogammaglobulinemia, placing the young infant at risk for overwhelming infection. Infants and young children have large lymph nodes, tonsils, and thymus compared with adults. Infants have decreased phagocytic activity, placing them at higher risk for serious infection. Children with immune disorders often show a decreased or absent response to delayed hypersensitivity skin testing (e.g., the tuberculosis test). The ELISA test for HIV detects only antibodies to HIV (which in the infant may be maternal in origin), whereas the PCR test for HIV tests for HIV genetic material, making it the more accurate test for HIV infection in infants and young children. Primary immune deficiencies such as SCID and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome are congenital and serious; they can be cured only by bone marrow or stem cell transplantation. Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disorder that can affect any organ system, primarily causing vasculitis. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis results in chronic pain and affects growth and development as well as school performance. Nasal, palatal, or throat pruritus and difficulty breathing may indicate an anaphylactic reaction. Various forms of hypogammaglobulinemia may be treated with exogenous immunoglobulin administered intravenously every several weeks, allowing children to lead a healthier life with fewer infections. Children with severe allergy or previous anaphylactic episodes must avoid contact with allergens. Nursing management of lupus focuses on preventing flare-ups and complications. Managing pain, maintaining mobility, and administering disease-modifying medications are key nursing interventions in the management of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. HIV infection may be prevented in infants by prenatal screening and maternal treatment, as well as postnatal treatment with zidovudine. HIV infection in children often results in encephalopathy and developmental delay. Spread of HIV infection can be prevented in adolescence by avoiding high-risk behaviors. For children with immune deficiency or autoimmune disease, prevention of infection is a primary nursing concern. A chronic illness such as immune deficiency, SLE, or juvenile arthritis has a significant impact on the family as well as the child. When planning care for the child with an immune deficiency or autoimmune disorder, the nurse should include the child and the family. To promote proper growth, encourage the child with an immune or autoimmune disorder to eat a balanced diet. Teach families of children with immune deficiencies about infection prevention. Teach the family of the child with juvenile arthritis about ways to decrease pain while increasing or maintaining the child's mobility. Teach families of children with severe allergy how to avoid allergens and how to use the EpiPen. Make sure that staff at the child's school or day care center are aware of the allergy. Explain to the child with severe allergy the importance of wearing a medical ID alert bracelet or necklace. REFERENCES American Academy of Pediatrics. (2009).

KEY TERMS adrenarche constitutional delay diabetic ketoacidosis Learning Objectives Upon completion of the chapter, the learner will be able to: 1. Describe the major components and functions of a child's endocrine system. 2. Differentiate between the anatomic and physiologic differences of the endocrine system in children versus adults. 3. Identify the essential assessment elements, common diagnostic procedures, and laboratory tests associated with the diagnosis of endocrine disorders in children. 4. Identify the common medications and treatment modalities used for palliation of endocrine disorders in children. 5. Distinguish specific disorders of the endocrine system affecting children.6. Link the clinical manifestations of specific disorders in the endocrine system of a child with the appropriate nursing diagnoses. 7. Establish the nursing outcomes, evaluative criteria, and interventions for a child with specific disorders in the endocrine system. 8. Develop child/family teaching plans for the child with an endocrine disorder. Carlos Rodriguez, 12 years old, is seen in the clinic today with complaints of weakness, fatigue, blurred vision, and headaches. His mother states, \"Carlos' teacher has noticed mood changes and is concerned about his behavior at school. He's always been a good boy. I'm not sure what's going on.\" The endocrine system consists of various glands, tissues, or clusters of cells that produce and release hormones. Hormones are chemical messengers that stimulate and/or regulate the actions of other tissues, organs, or other endocrine glands that have specific receptors to a hormone. Along with the nervous system, the endocrine milieu influences all physiologic effects such as growth and development, metabolic processes related to fluid and electrolyte balance and energy production, sexual maturation and reproduction, and the body's response to stress. The release patterns of the hormones vary, but the level in the body is maintained within specified limits to preserve health. Problems develop in the endocrine system when there is a deficiency ( hypofunction ) or excess ( hyperfunction ) of a specific hormone. In children, endocrine conditions often develop insidiously and result from an insufficient production of hormones. If the problem is not diagnosed and treated early, delayed growth and development, cognitive impairments, or death may result. Generally, the treatment plan involves correction of the underlying reason for the dysfunction, such as surgical removal of a tumor, and supplementation of missing hormones or adjustment of specific hormone levels. This allows most children to live normal lives.VARIATIONS IN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY The organs or tissues of the endocrine system include the hypothalamus, pituitary islets of Langerhans located in the pancreas. Figure 27.1 shows the location of the organs or tissues involved in the endocrine system. Typically, most endocrine glands begin to develop during the first trimester of gestation, but their development is incomplete at birth. Thus, complete hormonal control is lacking during the early years of life, and the infant cannot appropriately balance fluid concentration, electrolytes, amino acids, glucose, and trace substances. Hormone Production and Secretion The hypothalamic-pituitary axis produces a number of releasing and inhibiting hormones that regulate the function of many of the other endocrine glands, including the thyroid gland, the adrenal glands, and the male and female gonads. Some glands regulate their function in connection with the nervous system, such as the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas and the parathyroid glands. Many other cells in the body secrete hormones such as the pineal gland, the scattered epithelial cells in the gastrointestinal tract, and the thymus. Disorders related to these other cells are discussed in other chapters in this textbook. Figure 27.1 shows the major glands, the hormones produced by the glands, and the effect each hormone has on the target cell, tissue, or organ. The process of hormone production and secretion involves the principle of feedback control. One gland produces a hormone that affects another endocrine gland. Once the physiologic effect is achieved, this gland, known as the target organ, inhibits the further release of the original hormone. The reverse occurs when the first gland detects low levels of the target gland hormone. If the original gland does not release enough of the hormone, the inhibition process stops so that the gland increases the production of the hormone. The endocrine system and the nervous system work closely together to maintain an optimal internal environment for the body, known as homeostasis.COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS Primarily, the treatment of endocrine disorders involves decreasing hormone production (in cases of hypersecretion) or replacing the hormones (in cases of hypofunction). The first step in treating many of these disorders is to screen for potential problems, especially when familial patterns are present. Since the proper functioning of the endocrine system is critical to growth and development, the child's growth is affected by endocrine dysfunction and lack of treatment may lead to serious problems, such as intellectual disability or even death. Early treatment is often associated with better prognosis and prevention of long-term problems. The next step in treatment involves identifying underlying causes for the dysfunction (e.g., a tumor or growth that requires surgical removal or irradiation). The use of supplemental hormone in cases of hypofunction is generally successful in children, as is the use of inhibiting substances in cases of hyperfunction. Common Medical Treatments 27.1 describes the common treatments used in children with endocrine disorders. The table explains and gives indications for each treatment as well as relevant nursing implications. Advances in technology and our understanding of molecular biology continue to increase our knowledge of these disorders and the modalities needed to prevent them or improve quality of life for affected children. These advances are vital, since the whole body is influenced by the endocrine milieu. Drug Guide 27.1 lists the medications most commonly used to treat endocrine disorders. The table gives the actions and indications of each drug, as well as pertinent nursing implications. Many of the medications are synthetic preparations of the actual hormones. It is important to maintain specific blood levels of the drugs to mimic the actual hormone in the body. Nurses must monitor for side effects of too little or too much of the hormone in the child's system. Most endocrine disorders in children require treatment and follow-up with a pediatric endocrinologist as well as a multidisciplinary team that includes a registered nurse who specializes in this area. FIGURE 27.1 Location of the endocrine glands in the body, with the major effects of the glands listed. NURSING PROCESS OVERVIEW FOR THE CHILD WITH AN ENDOCRINE DISORDERThe nursing care of the child with an endocrine disorder requires astute assessment skills, accurate nursing diagnoses and expected outcomes, skilled interventions, and evaluation of the entire process. Children, especially very young ones, easily develop imbalances such as fluid and electrolyte disturbances that can cause further problems. Most of the endocrine disorders are chronic conditions that require ongoing care related to health maintenance, education, developmental issues, and psychosocial needs. These conditions are sometimes complex and range from mild to profound. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve the long-term outcomes for these children. Remember Carlos, the 12-year-old with weakness, fatigue, blurred vision, headaches, and mood changes? What additional health history and physical examination assessment information should the nurse obtain? Assessment Nursing assessment of a child with endocrine dysfunction includes obtaining a thorough health history, performing a physical assessment, and assisting with or obtaining laboratory and diagnostic tests. The clinical manifestations of endocrine disorders occur as a result of the altered control of the bodily processes normally regulated by the gland or hormone. These manifestations present in many areas of the body because of the diverse functions associated with the endocrine system. Health History The health history should include questions regarding any family history of an endocrine disorder or growth and development difficulties. Use a genogram or family tree to detail the information about the family history in a clear and concise manner. Discuss prenatal history, including any maternal factors that may affect growth and development such as substance abuse, use of tobacco or alcohol, and Graves disease; birth history, such as trauma during delivery, birth size, feeding difficulties, and neonatal screening and results; past medical history, such as any chronic childhood disease, treatment for any endocrine problems, recent gastroenteritis or viral syndrome, or exposures to exogenous steroids or gonadotropins; and growth and development patterns, including presence of any delays, learning disabilities, and early or late development of secondary sexual characteristics. Discuss present complaints or illness. Note onset of symptoms, whether gradual or sudden. Endocrine disorders often cause problems in normal growth and development as well as behavioral changes. Question the parent or caregiver about prior growth patterns, achievement of developmental milestones, and the child's behavior. Inquire about recent increases or decreases in weight and height, changes in physical appearance, sleep patterns, muscle weakness, cramps, twitching, or headaches. Have the child and family describe the child's activities on a typical day, including school performance, to identify subtle variations in the child's behavior or moods. For example, a child who is typically quiet might ordinarily be less active than average children of that age, and the child with decreased endocrine function also often displays inactivity and fatigue. By having the family and child describe a typical day, the nurse can distinguish between what is appropriate for that child and what may be a change related to endocrine dysfunction. In addition, obtain a history of dietary and elimination habits. Note extreme thirst, excessive appetite, vomiting, or frequent voiding. Children with endocrine disorders may have some of these symptoms. Physical Examination Physical examination of the child with an endocrine disorder includes inspection and observation, auscultation, percussion, and palpation. Table 27.1 lists key physical examination findings that may be present in the child with endocrine dysfunction. INSPECTION AND OBSERVATION Note a fatigued appearance, poor muscle tone, sweatiness, faintness, nervousness, or confusion. Inspect the head and face, and note hair texture and growth, a protuberant tongue, drooping eyelids, or exophthalmos (protrusion of the eyeballs). Plot the child's height and weight on growth charts to determine abnormal growth velocity, which occurs in many of these disorders. AUSCULTATION Auscultate the heart and lungs. Note heart rate and rhythm. During auscultation of the lungs, note labored respiratory effort, such as Kussmaul breathing, which occurs in diabetic ketoacidosis. Document blood pressure. PERCUSSION AND PALPATION Percuss and then palpate the abdomen. Dull (nontympanic) sounds or the presence of masses may indicate constipation or a tumor of the ovaries. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 27.1 describes the diagnostic tests and procedures frequently used in identifying and monitoring endocrine disorders in children. Serum and urine hormone and other levels are used to determine whether amounts are adequate, deficient, or excessive. Radiographic studies are used to evaluate bone maturation and growth potential as well as density or tissue calcification. Genetic studies may be used to determine enzyme deficiencies or chromosome defects. Stimulation studies provide a more accurate or definitive test for identifying the disorder after preliminary serum levels are abnormal. Serial blood sampling identifies peak or trough levels of hormones. Computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nuclear medicine studies, and ultrasonography are used to look for tumors, cysts, or structural defects. Nursing Diagnoses, Goals, Interventions, and Evaluation After completing the assessment, the nurse identifies nursing diagnoses with related goals/outcomes, interventions, and evaluations. The nursing diagnoses for a child with endocrine dysfunction may include: Delayed growth and development Disturbed body image Deficient knowledge (specify) Interrupted family processes Imbalanced nutrition: less than or more than body requirements Deficient or excess fluid volume NoncomplianceAfter completing an assessment of Carlos, the nurse noted the following: history reveals Carlos has had episodes of bedwetting over the past month and has had polydipsia and polyphagia. His weight continues to be greater than the 95th percentile on the growth chart. Based on these assessment findings, what would your top three nursing diagnoses be for Carlos? Because of the gradual, insidious onset of many of these disorders, the child may first be seen in an acute situation. It may be easier for the child and family to work with short-term goals until they accept the chronic situation. A major goal will be to achieve compliance with medical management. The goals for the child with a disorder of the endocrine system generally include reestablishing homeostasis, promoting adequate growth and development, establishing appropriate body image, promoting health-seeking behaviors, and providing education so the family can manage the condition. Nursing Care Plan 27.1 can be used as a guide in planning care for the child with a disorder of the endocrine system. Of course, this plan will need to be individualized based on the child's symptoms, needs, and disorder as well as the family's requirements. A key element to include in any care plan for the child with an endocrine disorder involves preparing the child, based on his or her developmental needs, for invasive procedures and tests. Provide an opportunity for the family and child to express their concerns and fears during diagnosis and treatment. Reinforce realistic expectations for treatment and prospects for improvement with the family and child. The care plan also needs to address developmental, acute, chronic, and home care issues as well as child and family education. Families will need assistance with managing the condition from a multidisciplinary team. Based on your top three nursing diagnoses for Carlos, describe appropriate nursing interventions. COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS 27.1 DRUG GUIDE 27.1 COMMON DRUGS FOR ENDOCRINE DISORDERS COMMON LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS 27.1PITUITARY DISORDERS Because of the close anatomic and functional relationships between the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, we will discuss them together. The hypothalamus affects the pituitary by releasing and inhibiting hormones and may be the cause of pituitary disorders. In general, disorders of the pituitary fall into two major groups: the anterior pituitary hormones and the posterior pituitary hormones. Anterior pituitary primary disorders in children include growth hormone deficiency, hyperpituitarism, and precocious puberty. Posterior pituitary disorders include diabetes insipidus and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Take Note! Infants with congenital defects of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus may present as a neonatal emergency. The symptoms include apnea, cyanosis, severe hypoglycemia with possible seizures, and prolonged jaundice (Parks & Felner, 2007). Growth Hormone Deficiency Growth hormone (GH) deficiency, also known as hypopituitarism or dwarfism, is characterized by poor growth and short stature. GH is vital for postnatal growth. It is released throughout the day, with most secreted during sleep. GH stimulates linear growth, bone mineral density, and growth in all body tissues. GH deficiency occurs in approximately 1 in 3,500 children (Hatcher, 2010). Often this condition is first identified when the physician or nurse practitioner assesses growth patterns. Children may start with a normal birth weight and length, but within a few years the child is less than the third percentile on the growth chart. Possible complications related to GH deficiency and its treatment include altered carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism; hypoglycemia; glucose intolerance/diabetes; slipped capital femoral of tumors; infection at the injection site; edema; and sodium retention. Pathophysiology GH deficiency is generally a result of the failure of the anterior pituitary or hypothalamic stimulation on the pituitary to produce sufficient GH. This lack of GH impairs the body's ability to metabolize protein, fat, and carbohydrates. Primary causes of GH deficiency include injury to, or destruction of, the anterior pituitary gland or hypothalamus. Causes include a tumor (e.g., craniopharyngioma), infection, infarction, irradiation, abnormal formation of these organs in utero, or damage or trauma during birth or after. It may also be part of a genetic syndrome, such as Prader-Willi syndrome or Turner syndrome, or the result of a genetic mutation or deletion. In some cases the cause may be idiopathic, such as nutritional deprivation or psychosocial issues, and reversible. Psychosocial dwarfism results from emotional deprivation that causes suppression of production of the pituitary hormones, resulting in decreased growth hormone. The child is withdrawn, has bizarre eating and drinking habits such as drinking from toilets, and has primitive speech. The treatment involves removing the child from the dysfunctional environment and providing normal dietary intake. With normalized eating and behavioral habits, pituitary secretion is restored and the child dramatically catches up in growth parameters. Therapeutic Management Treatment of primary GH deficiency involves the use of supplemental GH. Secondary GH deficiency requires removal of any tumors that might be the underlying problem, followed by GH therapy. Biosynthetic GH, derived from recombinant DNA, is given by subcutaneous injection. The weekly dosage is 0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg, divided into equal doses given daily for best growth (Hatcher, 2010). Treatment continues until near final height is achieved. This can be determined by the child deciding he or she is tall enough, a growth rate of less than 1 inch/year, or bone age greater than 16 years in boys and greater than 14 years in girls (Parks & Felner, 2007). NURSING CARE PLAN 27.1 Overview for the Child With an Endocrine Disorder NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Delayed growth and development related to hypo- or hyperfunction of gland/hormone as evidenced by weight and/or height less than expected for age, failure to meet expected age-appropriate developmental milestonesOutcome Identification and Evaluation Nutritional status will be maximized and development will be enhanced: child will maintain or gain weight appropriately and will make continued progress toward expected developmental milestones. Interventions: Enhancing Growth and Development Monitor growth parameters using standard growth charts. Encourage favorite foods (within prescribed diet restrictions if present) to maximize oral intake. Consult dietitian for appropriate diet supplementation recommendations. Encourage compliance with hormone supplementation to enhance ability to achieve appropriate growth. Provide care related to any complications of dysfunction such as correcting fluid and electrolyte imbalances or diarrhea. Screen for developmental capabilities to determine child's current level of functioning. Offer age-appropriate toys, play, and activities (including gross motor) to encourage further development. Provide support to families of children with developmental delay: progress in achieving developmental milestones can be slow and ongoing motivation is needed. Reinforce positive attributes in the child to maintain motivation. For the child with diabetes mellitus: Provide a calorie-appropriate, nonrestricted, well-balanced diet to maintain appropriate growth. Encourage three meals with two or three snacks with consistent carbohydrates to maintain appropriate blood glucose levels and promote growth. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Disturbed body image related to abnormal growth and development/changes in physical appearance due to hormone dysfunction as evidenced by verbalization of dissatisfaction with the child's or adolescent's looks Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child demonstrates appropriate self-esteem in relation to body image: expresses positive feelings about self and participates in social activities. Interventions: Promoting Healthy Body Image Provide opportunities for child to explore feelings related to appearance: venting feelings is associated with less body image disturbance. Relate to child on age level, not appearance level: \"babying\" a child who looks younger due to his or her small size reduces self-image. Involve the child and especially the teen in the decision-making process: a sense of control will improve body image. Encourage the child to spend time with peers who have similar endocrine disorders: peers' opinions are often better accepted than those of persons in authority, such as parents or health care professionals. Refer to counseling or support groups to further support the child. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Deficient knowledge related to therapeutic regimen as evidenced by questions about endocrine disorder and self-management Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child and family will demonstrate sufficient understanding and skills for self-management: verbalize information about disorder, complications/adverse effects, home care regimen, and long-term needs, and provide return demonstrations of medication administration or other procedures. Interventions: Promoting Knowledge Required for Self-Management Assess child's developmental level and family's ability to absorb instruction to determine how to approach teaching sessions. Establish teaching plan with child and family to gain cooperation and involvement. Teach and give printed instructions on disorder, complications, home care, and follow-up requirements so family has a source to refer to at home. Evaluate teaching with return demonstrations to determine whether child/family is skilled enough for home management of the disorder. For the child with diabetes mellitus: First teach \"survival skills\" (e.g., glucose and urine testing, administering insulin, record keeping, food guidelines, when to call physician) to provide initial base of knowledge for self-management. Implement second-phase home management program with more extensive instruction: providing additional teaching over time is necessary for management of a significant chronic illness. Monitor outcomes of teaching with every contact to ensure progress with child/family education. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Interrupted family processes or adjustment issues related to lifestyle changes required to manage chronic illness and possible lifestyle changes as evidenced by family's presence in the hospital, missed work, demonstration of inadequate coping Outcome Identification and Evaluation Family will maintain functional system of support; demonstrate adequate coping, adaptation of roles and functions, and decreased anxiety: parents are involved in child's care, ask appropriate questions, express fears and concerns, identify needs, seek appropriate resources and support, can discuss child's care and condition calmly. Interventions: Encouraging Healthy Family Processes Encourage parents and family members to verbalize concerns related to child's illness, diagnosis, and prognosis: allows the nurse to identify concerns and areas where further education may be needed. Explain treatments, medications, procedures, child's behaviors, and plan of care to parents: understanding of the child's current status and plan of care helps decrease anxiety. Identify support system for family and child: helps nurse identify needs and resources available for coping. Provide family with information about support groups, financial resources, and special clinics in the area for the particular type of disorder to provide family with a wide base of support. Encourage parents to become involved in care: allows parents to feel needed and valued and gives them a sense of control over their child's health. Evaluate coping processes on follow-up visits to determine restoration of family processes. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Imbalanced nutrition: less than or more than body requirements related to pathophysiology of dysfunction as evidenced by growth parameters significantly less or more than expected for age Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child's nutritional status is balanced: child adheres to nutritional guidelines, demonstrates adequate growth (weight and height) pattern within normal range for age and gender or, in the child who has difficulty growing, a progressive increase over time. Interventions: Maintaining Adequate Nutrition Determine body weight and length/height norm for age or what the child's pretreatment measurements were to determine goal to work toward. Weigh daily or weekly (according to physician order or institutional standard) and measure length/height weekly to monitor for appropriate growth. Determine child's food preferences and provide favorite foods as able to increase the likelihood that the child will consume appropriate amounts of foods. Instruct child and family about nutritional requirements so that they are involved and are prepared for home care. Refer to dietitian for more detailed information and assistance. For the child who needs to gain weight: Offer highest-calorie meals at the time of day when the child's appetite is the greatest to increase likelihood of increased caloric intake. Provide increased-calorie shakes or puddings within dietary restrictions: high-calorie foods increase weight gain. Administer vitamin and mineral supplements as prescribed to attain/maintain vitamin and mineral balance in the body. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Deficient or excess fluid volume related to pathophysiology of endocrine dysfunction as evidenced by signs and symptoms of dehydration (deficient fluid volume) or edema and excessive urine output (excess fluid volume) Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will maintain adequate fluid volume as evidenced by elastic skin turgor; absence of edema; moist, pink oral mucosa; presence of tears; urine output 1 mL/kg/hour or more; vital signs within normal range for age; and normal electrolyte/hormone serum levels. Interventions: Maintaining Adequate Fluid Volume Assess hydration status (skin turgor, oral mucosa, presence of tears) every 4 to 8 hours to evaluate maintenance of adequate fluid volume. Assess adequacy of urine output to evaluate end-organ perfusion. Maintain strict intake and output record to evaluate effectiveness of rehydration. Weigh child daily: accurate weight is one of the best indicators of fluid volume status in children. Administer specific hormone, fluid, and electrolyte requirements as ordered to aid in fluid balance. Fluid volume deficit: Maintain IV line and administer IV fluid as ordered to maintain fluid volume. Fluid volume excess: Maintain fluid restriction as ordered to restore homeostasis. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Noncompliance related to long-term/complex management of some disorders as evidenced by failure to keep appointments, development of complications or exacerbation of symptoms, or child/family verbalization of inability to maintain treatment plan Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child and family will comply with treatment regimen: child and family will list treatment expectations and agree to follow through. Interventions: Encouraging Compliance Listen nonjudgmentally while the child and family describe reasons for noncompliance: assessment of problem should begin with nonthreatening discussion. Help the child and family develop a schedule for medication administration and other home regimens that works best for them: involving child and family in planning care will increase compliance by making them feel respected and valued. Work with the child and family to develop a written treatment plan or schedule that best suits their needs to provide support for maintenance of treatment plan. Establish follow-up visits to fit family's situation to promote compliance. Encourage monitoring with pediatric endocrinologist and specialists: multidisciplinary involvement has been shown to increase compliance. Recognize that behavioral change comes slowly: allows time for child and family to adjust to chronic nature of illness. Take Note! Reports have found no evidence linking GH therapy to higher risk of leukemias (Bell et al., 2010; Parks & Felner, 2007). Nursing Assessment The focus of the evaluation for GH deficiency is to rule out chronic illnesses such as renal failure, liver disorders, and thyroid dysfunction. For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 976 . Assessment findings pertinent to GH deficiency are discussed below. Health HistoryThe health history may reveal a familial pattern of short stature or a prenatal history of maternal disorders such as malnutrition. The past history may be significant for birth history of intrauterine growth retardation or past history of severe head trauma or a brain tumor such as craniopharyngioma. Evaluate previous and current growth patterns. Note history of chronic illness such as cardiac, kidney, or intestinal disorders that may contribute to a decreased growth pattern. Assess the child's feelings about being short. Physical Examination In addition to the linear height being at or below the third percentile on standard growth charts, the physical assessment findings may show that the child has a higher weight-to-height ratio ( Fig. 27.2 ). Other physical findings may include prominent subcutaneous deposits of abdominal fat; a child-like face with a large, prominent forehead; a high-pitched voice; delayed sexual maturation (e.g., micropenis testes in boys); delayed dentition; delayed skeletal maturation; and decreased muscle mass. FIGURE 27.2 The child with growth hormone deficiency displays short stature. Take Note! Growth measurements are often inaccurate and unreliable in children. Improved accuracy, especially in performing linear measurements, could yield earlier detection and diagnosis of growth disorders (Mohr et al., 2010). Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on linear growth measurement of children have been developed. A link to these and other helpful resources are provided on . Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing The child will undergo laboratory tests to rule out chronic illnesses such as renal failure or liver and thyroid dysfunction. Laboratory and diagnostic tests used in children with suspected GH deficiency include: Bone age (as shown by radiographs) will be two or more deviations below normal. CT or MRI scans rule out tumors or structural abnormalities. Pituitary function testing confirms the diagnosis. This test consists of providing a GH stimulant such as glucagon, clonidine, insulin, arginine, or L -dopa to stimulate the pituitary to release a burst of GH. Peak GH levels below 7 to 10 ng/mL in at least two tests confirm the diagnosis.Nursing Management Nursing management for the child with GH deficiency focuses on promoting growth, enhancing the child's self-esteem related to short stature, and providing appropriate education about the disorder. Promoting Growth The goal of growth promotion is for the child to demonstrate an improved growth rate, as evidenced by at least 3 to 5 inches in linear growth in the first year of treatment without complications. With early diagnosis and treatment, the child has a better prognosis for reaching a normal adult height. Growth is usually excellent in the first year of therapy compared to later years (Parks & Felner, 2007). Treatment stops when the epiphyseal growth plates fuse. At the beginning of treatment, monitor for height increase and possible side effects related to the medications. Measure the child's height at least every 3 to 6 months and plot growth over time on standardized growth charts. Provide information to the child and family about normal development and growth rates, bone age, and growth potential. Explore with the family and child the expectations and their understanding of what is normal so they will have realistic expectations of treatment. Consult a dietitian if the child and family need assistance in providing adequate nutrition for growth and development. Enhancing the Child's Self-Esteem The child with GH deficiency often has younger-looking features and is shorter than his or her peers. Encourage the child to express positive feelings about his or her self-image, as shown by comments during health care visits as well as involvement with peers. Encourage the child to voice concerns. Emphasize the child's strengths and assets. Provide information about community support groups or websites related to GH deficiency. Evaluate for long-term learning problems that may develop if the child had a tumor and surgery or irradiation to remove it. Unidentified learning problems can have a negative impact on the child's self-esteem. Treat and communicate with the child in an age-appropriate manner even though he or she may appear younger. Educating the Family GH is a powder that is mixed with packaged diluents. Explain how to prepare it and give the correct dosage. Encourage rotation of sites in the subcutaneous tissue to prevent skin irritation. Have the family provide a return demonstration to make sure they understand correct dilution and administration of GH. Continue to provide periodic evaluation and ongoing support. Instruct the family to report headaches, rapid weight gain, increased thirst or urination, or painful hip or knee joints as possible adverse reactions. Explain to the family that the child will need to visit the pediatric endocrinologist every 3 to 6 months to monitor for growth, for potential adverse effects, and for compliance with therapy. Stress the importance of complying with the GH replacement therapy and frequent supervision by a pediatric endocrinologist. Educate the family about the financial costs of therapy, which may be high; the family may need help in obtaining assistance and require referral to social services. Guide the family and child in setting realistic goals and expectations based on age, personal abilities and strengths, and the effectiveness of the GH replacement therapy. For example, the family may want to encourage the child to choose sports that are not dependent on height. Encourage the family to dress the child according to age, not size. Refer the child and family to counseling if indicated. Inform families about support groups such as the Short Stature Foundation, the Human Growth Foundation, and the Magic Foundation. Links and additional information about these groups are provided on . Hyperpituitarism (Pituitary Gigantism) Hyperpituitarism, an extremely rare disorder in children, results from an excessive secretion of GH that leads to an increased growth rate greater than the 97th percentile (Lifshitz, 2007). The cause of this overproduction of GH is most often a tumor of the anterior pituitary, a pituitary adenoma, or, if combined with precocious puberty, a tumor of the hypothalamus. If this overproduction occurs before the epiphyseal plates close, the child may grow to 7 to 8 feet in height. If the overproduction occurs after they close, acromegaly occurs. Acromegaly is an enlargement of the bones of the head and soft parts of the feet and hands. Being tall is valued in today's society, so assessment for accelerated growth is often delayed, especially in boys (Cohen & Shim, 2007). Therapeutic management includes removing the tumor, restoring the GH patterns to normal, and preventing recurrence. Treatment depends on the cause and may involve surgery, radiation therapy, radioactive implants, or pituitary hormone replacement after surgery. Alternatively, treatment may involve administration of somatostatin analogs to suppress GH production. Complications of hyperpituitarism include hypogonadism, visual loss, and heart failure.Nursing Assessment In addition to excessive height, physical findings include coarse facial features and enlarged hands and feet. Some children display behavioral and visual problems. Typically, the condition presents at puberty, but it has been found as early as the newborn period. Increased levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) establish the diagnosis of hyperpituitarism. The gold standard for making the diagnosis of GH excess is failure to suppress serum GH levels after an oral glucose challenge test. A bone scan determines whether the epiphyseal plates are closed. Radiologic studies, including MRI, are used to detect any tumors. Nursing Management Nursing management depends on which treatment the child undergoes. If surgical removal of a tumor is required, provide routine pre- and postoperative care. Administer somatostatin analog (e.g., octreotide acetate) if ordered. It is usually given as a subcutaneous injection every 12 hours; refer to Drug Guide 27.1 for further information. Treat the child according to chronologic age rather than according to height. Assess the child's self-image, teach the child and family about the disorder and the treatment plan, and provide emotional support. Monitor for and report signs of potential complications such as hypogonadism, visual loss, or heart failure. Precocious Puberty In precocious puberty, the child develops sexual characteristics before the usual age of pubertal onset. Puberty, also known as sexual maturation, occurs when the gonads produce increased amounts of sex hormones. Typically, this occurs around 10 to 12 years of age for girls and 11 to 14 years of age for boys. In precocious puberty, breasts develop before age 7 years in white girls or before age 6 years in African American girls, or secondary sex characteristics develop in boys younger than 9 years (Matfin, 2009). The disorder is more common in females and most of the time the cause is unknown (Garibaldi, 2007). Other causes include benign hypothalamic tumor, brain injury or radiation, a history of infectious encephalitis, meningitis, congenital or testes. Pathophysiology Central precocious puberty, the most common form, develops as a result of premature activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary- gonadal axis that results in the production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the pituitary to produce luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). These hormones in turn stimulate the gonads to secrete the sex hormones (estrogen or testosterone). The child develops sexual characteristics, shows increased growth and skeletal maturation, and has reproductive capability. Peripheral precocious puberty presents with no early secretion of gonadotropin or maturation of gonads but rather early overproduction of sex hormones. The condition results in increased end-organ sensitivity to low levels of circulating sex hormones and leads to premature pubic hair and breast development. If left untreated, the child may become fertile. In addition, the hormones stimulate rapid growth. Therefore, the child may appear taller than peers but will reach skeletal maturity and closure of the epiphyseal plates early, which results in overall short stature. Therapeutic Management The clinical treatment for precocious puberty first involves determining the cause. For example, if the etiology is a tumor of the central nervous system, the child undergoes surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. The treatment for central precocious puberty involves administering a GnRH analog. This is available as a depot injection given every 3 to 4 weeks, a subcutaneous injection given daily, or an intranasal compound given two or three times each day. This analog stimulates gonadotropin release initially but when given on a long-term basis will suppress gonadotropin release. With this treatment, the growth rate slows and secondary sexual development stabilizes or regresses. Medroxyprogesterone injections (Depo-Provera) or tablets (Cycrin) reduce secretion of gonadotropins and prevent menstruation. When treatment is discontinued, puberty resumes according to appropriate developmental stages. The overall aim of treatment is to halt or even reverse sexual development and rapid growth as well as promote psychosocial well-being. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 976 . Pertinent assessment findings related to precocious puberty are discussed below. Health HistoryThe health history may reveal complaints of headaches, nausea, vomiting, and visual difficulties due to the circulating hormones. The psychosocial development is typical for the child's age, but the child may show emotional lability, aggressive behavior, and mood swings. Information from the child and family may also reveal risk factors such as exposure to exogenous hormones, history of central nervous system trauma or infection, or a family history of early puberty. Physical Examination Physical examination may reveal acne and an adult-like body odor. The child will present with an accelerated rate of growth. The Tanner staging of breasts, pubic hair, and genitalia reveals advanced maturation for the child's age, but the child does not typically display sexual behavior. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Radiologic examinations and pelvic ultrasound identify advanced bone age, increased uterus size, and development of ovaries consistent with the diagnosis of precocious puberty. Laboratory studies include screening radioimmunoassays for LH, FSH, estradiol, or testosterone. The child's response to GnRH stimulation confirms the diagnosis of central precocious puberty versus gonadotropin- independent puberty. This test involves administering synthetic GnRH intravenously and drawing serial blood levels, about every 2 hours, of LH, FSH, and estrogen or testosterone. A positive result is defined as pubertal or adult levels of these hormones in response to the GnRH administration. CT, MRI, or skull radiography reveals any lesions in the central nervous system or tumors or cysts present in the abdomen, pelvic area, or testes. Nursing Management In general, nursing management of the child with precocious puberty focuses on educating the child and family about the physical changes the child is experiencing and how to correctly use the prescribed medications and helping the child to deal with self-esteem issues related to the accelerated growth and development of secondary sexual characteristics. Goals of nursing management include appropriate physical development and pubertal progression appropriate for age. Refer to Nursing Care Plan 27.1 , and individualize care based on the child's and family's response to this disorder. Providing Education Nursing care involves assessing and documenting the physical changes the child is experiencing and administering medications. Demonstrate correct administration of medication and observe for potential adverse effects (teach this information to the family as well). Encourage the family to comply with follow-up appointments, which typically occur every 6 months and include scheduled stimulation tests. Inform families that pharmacologic intervention stops when the child reaches the age appropriate for pubertal development. Provide appropriate sex education. Reassure parents that precocious puberty does not always involve precocious sexual behavior, but that it may be seen, especially in boys (Dowshen, 2008a). Dealing With Self-Esteem Issues Often these children develop self-esteem issues and anxiety related to body image disturbances and impaired social interactions (Dowshen, 2008a). The goal is for the child to exhibit normal psychosocial development and understand the physical and emotional changes that occur with early onset of puberty. Communicate with the child on an age-appropriate level, even when physical characteristics make the child appear older. Maintain a calm, supportive atmosphere and provide for privacy during examinations. Refer the child and family for counseling as needed. Since the child may have issues with self-image and may be self-conscious, encourage him or her to express his or her feelings about the changes, and use role-playing to show the child how to handle teasing from other children. Let the child know that everyone develops sexual characteristics in time. Delayed Puberty Delayed puberty is a condition of delayed secondary sexual development. In girls, it exists if the breasts have not developed by age 13, pubic hair has not appeared by age 14, or menarche has not occurred by age 16 (Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, 2008; Hatcher, 2010). In boys, it exists when no testicular enlargement or scrotal changes have occurred by age 14 or pubic hair has not appeared by age 15 followed by testicular enlargement (Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, 2008; Hatcher, 2010). The most common cause for delayed puberty is a hereditary pattern of growth and development known as constitutional delay (or a \"late bloomer\") (Dowshen, 2008b). In these cases there is a family pattern of late-onset puberty. These teens will usuallydevelop normally, just at a later time than their peers. Hypogonadism also may result when there is decreased stimulation of the gonads due to dysfunction or tumors in the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. Other causes include irradiation, infection, trauma, or genetic syndromes such as Turner or Klinefelter syndrome. Another common cause is a chronic condition such as anorexia or cystic fibrosis. Therapeutic management involves administering testosterone (males) or estradiol conjugated estrogen (females) in low dosages if there is no underlying situation to address. This is usually necessary for only a short time to get puberty started. Nursing Assessment Assessment involves obtaining a health history to identify the indications for this condition. Assessment of the growth pattern using correct techniques and standards for comparison is essential. On physical assessment, note absence of secondary sex characteristics as noted above. Laboratory and diagnostic testing rules out other causes for delayed puberty. Blood levels of reproductive hormones may also be evaluated. Nursing Management In addition to the general interventions presented in Nursing Care Plan 27.1 , instruct the child and family about the medication therapy. Educate the child and family about the different stages of puberty. Help the family develop a home management schedule for the administration of medication. Answer the family's questions about the condition or potential complications (e.g., infertility), depending on the cause of the condition. Diabetes Insipidus Diabetes insipidus (DI) can be classified into two types\u2014nephrogenic DI and central DI. Nephrogenic DI can be transmitted genetically (e.g., sex-linked, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive forms) or be acquired due to chronic renal disease, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, or use of certain drugs such as lithium, amphotericin, methicillin, and rifampin (Breault & Majzoub, 2007a). This variant of DI is not associated with the pituitary gland and is related to decreased renal sensitivity to antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Therapeutic management for nephrogenic DI involves diuretics, high fluid intake, restricted sodium intake, and a high-protein diet. Desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) is ineffective in the treatment of nephrogenic DI. Central DI is a disorder of the posterior pituitary gland and is the most common form of DI (Children's Hospital of Boston, 2011; Cooperman, 2011). Therefore, central DI will be the focus of the remainder of this discussion. Central DI is characterized by excessive thirst ( polydipsia ) and excessive urination ( polyuria ) that is not affected by decreasing fluid intake. Typically, this disorder occurs in children as a result of complications from head trauma or after cranial surgery to remove hypothalamic-pituitary tumors such as craniopharyngioma. Other causes include genetic mutations, granulomatous disease, infections such as meningitis or encephalitis, vascular anomalies, congenital malformations, infiltrative disease such as leukemia, or administration of certain drugs that are associated with inhibition of vasopressin release, such as phenytoin (Breault & Majzoub, 2007a). However, 10% of central in children are idiopathic (Breault & Majzoub, 2007a). Some cases can be hereditary. DI is usually permanent and requires treatment throughout life. Pathophysiology Central DI results from a deficiency in the secretion of ADH. This hormone, also known as vasopressin, is produced in the hypothalamus and stored in the pituitary gland. ADH is involved in concentrating the urine from the kidneys by stimulating reabsorption of water in the renal collecting tubules through increased membrane permeability. This conserves water and maintains normal osmolality. With a deficiency in ADH, the kidney loses massive amounts of water and retains sodium in the serum. Therapeutic Management Unless a tumor is present (in which case it is removed by surgery), the usual treatment of central DI involves daily replacement of ADH in older children. The drug of choice for home treatment is DDAVP, a long-acting vasopressin analog (Breault & Majzoub, 2007a; Hatcher, 2010). In children, it is typically given intranasally. However, it can also be administered subcutaneously or orally. The drug is given every 8 to 12 hours. The dose depends on the child's age, urine output, and urine specific gravity. The use of DDAVP in infants is controversial and complicated (Rivkees, Dunbar, & Wilson, 2007). In fact, in neonates and young infants, the treatment is often solely fluid therapy due to their large volume requirements of nutritive fluid (i.e., the drive behind an infant's fluid intake is hunger rather than thirst) (Breault & Majzoub, 2007a). However, research has shown that subcutaneously administeredDDAVP may be more effective than oral or intranasal therapy in infants (Rivkees et al., 2007). In the hospital, the child may a short-acting drug, so the dosage can be adjusted quickly. Both the long-acting and short-acting forms of the medication decrease urinary output and thirst, and the dosages of both forms of these drugs need to be titrated to achieve the desired effect. Take Note! A metered nasal spray form of DDAVP is available, but the prescribed dose must be greater than 10 mcg/0.1 mL in order for the child to use the spray (Breault & Majzoub, 2007a). Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 976 . Assessment findings pertinent to DI are discussed below. Health History Nursing assessment involves obtaining a history of any conditions that led to the development of the disorder. This review includes information about the neonatal period as well as a current history of infections such as meningitis, diseases such as leukemia, or familial patterns. Although most symptoms of endocrine disorders develop slowly, the onset of this disorder is abrupt. The health history usually elicits the cardinal symptoms as well as complaints representing the early signs of dehydration. The most common initial symptoms reported are polyuria and polydipsia (Breault & Majzoub, 2007a). Except for unconscious children, the child typically maintains adequate perfusion by drinking water. The parent or child may report frequent trips to the bathroom, nocturia, or enuresis. When the child cannot compensate for the excessive loss of water by increasing fluid intake, other symptoms will be reported, such as weight loss or signs of dehydration. For example, irritability may be due to the early signs of dehydration or the frustration the child feels at being unable to quench his or her thirst. Other signs may be intermittent fever, vomiting, and constipation. Physical Examination Observation and inspection may reveal weight loss or failure to thrive in the young infant. Inspection may also reveal signs of dehydration, such as dry mucous membranes or decreased tears. The child may excrete greater than 3 L/m 2 of urine per day. On auscultation, tachycardia or increased respiratory rate may be signs of compensation for the decrease in fluid volume. Palpation reveals slightly depressed fontanels or decreased skin turgor. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Diagnostic tests used to evaluate DI include: Radiographic studies such as CT scan, MRI, or ultrasound of the skull and kidneys can determine whether a lesion or tumor is present. Urinalysis: urine is dilute, osmolarity is less than 3,000 mOsm/L, specific gravity is less than 1.005, and sodium is decreased. Serum osmolarity is greater than 300 mOsm/L. Serum sodium is elevated. Fluid deprivation test measures vasopressin release from the pituitary in response to water deprivation. Normal results will show decreased urine output, increased urine specific gravity, and no change in serum sodium. Take Note! During a fluid deprivation test, the child may be irritable and frustrated because fluid is being withheld. Don't drink in front of the child. Nursing Management Refer to Nursing Care Plan 27.1 and individualize the plan of care based on the child's and family's response to the illness. Specific interventions related to nursing care of the child with DI are discussed below.Promoting Hydration The goal of treatment is to achieve hourly urine output of 1 to 2 mL/kg and urine specific gravity of at least 1.010. Take Note! Notify the physician or nurse practitioner if the urine output is greater than 1,000 mL per hour for two consecutive voids. Maintain fluid intake regimens as ordered. Monitor fluid status by measuring vital signs, fluid intake and output, and daily weights (using the same scale at the same time of day). If fluids are stopped too soon, the child may become hypernatremic, which can lead to seizures. Feed infants more frequently, since they excrete more dilute urine, consume larger volumes of free water, and secrete lower amounts of vasopressin than older children. Monitor for signs and symptoms of dehydration during the fluid deprivation test as well as when starting the treatment regimen. Take Note! Monitor blood pressure closely when initiating vasopressin. If the child is unconscious or has brain injury, maintain hydration and nutrition with nasogastric or gastrostomy feedings. Promoting Activity Establish appropriate activity for the child, and allow time for him or her to regain strength and the desire to increase level of activity. Assess the child's abilities daily, schedule frequent bathroom breaks, keep fluids the child likes available at all times, and fit the treatment plan to the child's daily activities. Educating the Family Involve the family in development of the fluid intake regimens. A journal or daily log is essential in maintaining the fluid regimen and identifying problems. Children with intact thirst centers can self-regulate their need for fluids, but if this is not the situation, help the family develop a plan for 24-hour fluid replacement. This may require instruction on nasogastric or gastrostomy feedings. Infants will need fluid intake at night. Educate the family about the symptoms of water intoxication (drowsiness, listlessness, headache, confusion, sudden weight gain, and anuria) and dehydration. Help the family develop a plan to inform the school and other individuals in the child's life about the need for liberal bathroom privileges and extra fluids to prevent accidents or dehydration. Teaching Guidelines 27.1 gives tips on educating the family about the medication regimen. Recommend that the family obtain a medical ID alert bracelet or necklace for the child. Encourage compliance with follow-up appointments, which will probably be every 6 months. Teaching Guidelines 27.1 DDAVP INTRANASAL ADMINISTRATION Keep DDAVP in the refrigerator at all times. Clear the nostrils (the medication may be poorly absorbed if the child has nasal congestion). Insert the measuring tube into the bottle. Fill to proper dosage and hold the top of the tube closed while inserting the medication-filled end into the nostril. Blow the liquid out of the tubing into the nostril. If the child sneezes, repeat the dosage. Measure urine specific gravity to monitor effectiveness of the drug. Monitor for signs and symptoms of overdosage such as confusion, headache, drowsiness, and rapid weight gain due to fluid retention. Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) occurs when ADH (vasopressin) is secreted in the presence of low serum osmolality because the feedback mechanism that regulates ADH does not function properly. ADH continues to be released, and thisleads to water retention, decreased serum sodium due to hemodilution, and extracellular fluid volume expansion. SIADH can be caused by central nervous system infections such as meningitis, head trauma, brain tumors, intracranial surgery, and certain medications such as analgesics, barbiturates, or chemotherapy. SIADH is rare in children (Breault & Majzoub, 2007b). However, when seen, it is often related to excessive administration of vasopressin during the treatment of DI (Breault & Majzoub, 2007b). Therapeutic management of SIADH includes correcting the underlying disorder in addition to fluid restriction and intravenous sodium chloride administration to correct hyponatremia and increase serum osmolality. Nursing Assessment Obtain a health history, noting history of a central nervous system infection or tumor, intracranial surgery, head trauma, use of the above-mentioned medications, or a history of DI. Note symptoms such as decreased urine output and weight gain, or gastrointestinal symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Assess neurologic status, noting lethargy, behavioral changes, headache, altered level of consciousness, seizure, or coma. Neurologic signs develop as the sodium level decreases. Diagnostic tests reveal low serum sodium and osmolality, as well as decreased urea, creatinine, uric acid, and albumin levels. Urine samples demonstrate elevated osmolality, high sodium concentrations, and specific gravity greater than 1.030. Adrenal, thyroid, and renal function studies may be used to rule out other causes of hyponatremia. COMPARISON CHART 27.1 DIABETES INSIPIDUS VERSUS SIADH Nursing Management Nursing goals focus on restoring fluid balance and preventing injury. Institute safety precautions if altered level of consciousness, confusion, or seizures are present. Notify the physician or nurse practitioner if headache or irritability is present. Monitor fluid intake and output and weigh the child daily. An indwelling urinary catheter may be needed to allow for hourly monitoring of urine volume and specific gravity. Help the child cope with fluid restriction by offering sugarless candy, a wet washcloth, or, perhaps, ice chips. Administer electrolyte replacement as necessary to correct imbalances. Comparison Chart 27.1 compares DI with SIADH.DISORDERS OF THYROID FUNCTION Disorders of the thyroid gland are relatively common in infancy and childhood (Hatcher, 2010). These disorders can be serious because thyroid hormones are important for growth and development; they regulate metabolism of nutrients and energy production. Congenital Hypothyroidism Congenital hypothyroidism, also known as cretinism, usually results from failure of the thyroid gland to migrate during fetal development (Lafranchi, 2007). This results in malformation or malfunction of the thyroid gland, which leads to insufficient production of the thyroid hormones that are required to meet the body's metabolic and growth and development needs. Congenital hypothyroidism leads to low concentrations of circulating thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine [T 3 ] and thyroxine [T 4 ]). Congenital hypothyroidism occurs in 1 in 4,000 live births (Hatcher, 2010). It occurs over a wide range of ethnic groups, though less among African Americans, and is more common in girls than boys (Lafranchi, 2007). Complications include intellectual disability if untreated, short stature, growth failure, and delayed physical maturation and development (Hatcher, 2010). Pathophysiology Congenital hypothyroidism is due to a defect in the development of the thyroid gland in the fetus due to a spontaneous gene mutation, an inborn error of thyroid hormone synthesis resulting from an autosomal recessive trait, pituitary dysfunction, or failure of the central nervous system-thyroid feedback mechanism to develop. Transient primary hypothyroidism may also occur; it results from transplacental transfer of maternal medications, maternal thyroid-blocking antibodies, and fetal or neonatal exposure to excessive iodines (such as use of iodine antiseptics during delivery or procedures, or excess ingestion of iodine by the mother) (Lafranchi, 2007). Therapeutic Management To prevent intellectual disability and restore normal growth and motor development, thyroid hormone replacement with sodium L - thyroxine (Synthroid, synthetic thyroxine, or Levothroid) is given. The recommended starting dosage is 10 to 15 mcg/kg per day; infants and younger children typically require a higher dosage per unit of body weight (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2006). There are no adverse effects with physiologic doses, but thyroid function tests are performed initially every 2 weeks to closely monitor for effects and to ensure proper dosing. Since thyroid hormone is vital to the infant's developing central nervous system, the goal is to normalize thyroid function as quickly as possible. This treatment will be needed lifelong to maintain normal metabolism and promote normal physical and mental growth and development. Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment of the child with congenital hypothyroidism includes health history, physical examination, and laboratory testing. Health History Inquire whether the neonatal metabolic screening test was performed and results obtained. Determine if the test was done less than 24 to 48 hours after birth. If so a repeat test may be warranted (see Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing below). Inquire about maternal history that may indicate a connection to hypothyroidism, such as maternal exposure to iodine. Additional history findings may include sensitivity to cold, constipation, feeding problems, or lethargy. Since parents like babies to sleep well, the parents may not complain that the baby is sleeping too much; rather, they may remark that it is difficult to keep the baby awake. Physical Examination Most infants are asymptomatic until the first month, when they begin to develop clinical signs. Inspection and observation reveal a lethargic baby or a child with hypotonia, hypoactivity, and a dull expression. A combination of lethargy and irritability may exist, with an overall delayed mental responsiveness. Measurements of weight and height may reveal delayed growth. Other findings may include a persistent open posterior fontanel, coarse facies with short neck and limbs, periorbital puffiness, enlarged tongue, and poor sucking response ( Fig. 27.3 ). The skin may appear pale with mottling or yellow from prolonged jaundice, or it may be cool, dry, and scaly to the touch, with sparse hair development on the older child. Auscultation of the chest might reveal bradycardia. Signs of respiratory distress and decreased pulse pressure may also be present. On palpation of the abdomen, there may be evidence of an umbilical hernia or a mass due to constipation.FIGURE 27.3 Newborn with congenital hypothyroidism. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing States mandate newborn screening for thyroid hormone levels before discharge from the hospital or 2 to 6 days after birth (March of Dimes, 2011). When the test is performed within the first 24 to 48 hours along with other metabolic screenings, the result may be inaccurate because of the immediate increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) shortly after birth (Hatcher, 2010). Radioimmunoassay is used to measure levels of T 4 , which accurately reflects the child's thyroid status. If the T 4 level is low then a second confirming laboratory test is performed, as well as determining whether the TSH is elevated. A thyroid scan may also be used to check for the absence or ectopic placement of the gland. In addition to serum measurement of T 4 , other diagnostic tests include serum T 3 , radioiodine uptake, thyroid-bound globulin, and ultrasonography. Nursing Management The overall goal of nursing management of the infant or child with congenital hypothyroidism is to establish a normal growth pattern without complications such as intellectual disability or failure to thrive. Individualize the nursing care plan based on the infant's responses to the illness. Promoting Appropriate Growth Measure and record growth at regular intervals. Thyroid levels are measured at recommended intervals, such as every 2 to 4 weeks until the target range is reached on a stabilized dose of medication, then every 2 to 3 months for the first several years of life, and becoming less frequent as the child gets older (Lafranchi, 2007). A trial off the medication may be performed around the age of 3, under physician or nurse practitioner supervision, to confirm the diagnosis (Hatcher, 2010; Lafranchi, 2007). Monitor for signs of hypo- or hyperfunction, including changes in vital signs, thermoregulation, and activity level. Provide adequate rest periods and meet thermoregulation needs. If the infant's tongue is unusually large, observe feeding ability, prevent airway obstruction, and position the infant on the side. Fluid restrictions or a low-salt diet may be ordered. Take Note! Observe for signs of thyroid hormone overdose (irritability, rapid pulse, dyspnea, sweating, and fever) or ineffective treatment (fatigue, constipation, and decreased appetite). Educating the Family Since many infants are asymptomatic, the diagnosis may be unexpected, so reassure and convey realistic expectations to the family. Developmental screening may be required if the child showed any symptoms initially or as the child gets older to ensure that drug therapy is appropriate. Educate the family about the disorder, the medication and method of administration, and adverse effects such as increased pulse rate (which may indicate an overdose of thyroid hormone). L -Thyroxine is an oral medication that is available only as a pill. It must be crushed for infants and young children. It can be mixedwith a small amount of formula and placed in the nipple, but it should not be placed in a full bottle of formula because the infant will not ingest all the medication if he or she does not finish the bottle. The medication can also be mixed with a small amount of liquid and given with a dropper. Medication absorption is affected by soy-based formulas, fiber, and iron preparations (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2006). Therefore, carefully evaluate the formula the infant is on before administering L -thyroxine. Inform the family that this medication will be needed throughout the child's life. Explain that missed doses may lead to developmental delays and poor growth. Tell them that frequent blood tests will be needed to evaluate thyroid function and the child's growth rate; genetic counseling may be needed. Clinical examination, including growth and development assessment, should occur every few months until the child is 3 years old. Serum T 4 and TSH should be evaluated 2 to 4 weeks after initiation of treatment, every 1 to 2 months up to 6 months of age, every 3 to 4 months from 6 months to 36 months of age, and then every 6 to 12 months until growth is complete (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2006). More frequent monitoring may be needed if noncompliance occurs, if abnormal values occur, or with any changes in medication dosage or treatment regimen. The nurse may need to help the family to find a laboratory nearby or to handle financial issues related to the therapy. Educate the family about infant stimulation programs if the child shows cognitive problems, retarded physical growth, or slow intellectual development. Some information may need to be reinforced during school-age or adolescent stages of development. Finally, encourage the family to obtain a medical ID bracelet or necklace for the child. Consider This A sha Virani, 1 week old, is brought to the clinic. Her newborn screening test was positive for hypothyroidism. Her parents are shocked and upset by the news. Her mother states, \"My daughter's been doing so well since she came home from the hospital. She seems to be doing everything she should be. She's a great sleeper. I just can't believe anything's wrong with her.\" 1. How would you address the parents' concerns? 2. What teaching will be appropriate for this family? Acquired Hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism also occurs as an acquired condition. This disorder most commonly results from an autoimmune chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Lafranchi, 2007). As a genetic condition, antibodies develop against the thyroid gland, causing the gland to become inflamed, infiltrated, and progressively destroyed. It occurs more often in girls during childhood and adolescence (Lafranchi, 2007). Less common etiologies include hypothyroidism associated with pituitary or hypothalamic dysfunction or exposure to drugs or substances such as lithium that interfere with thyroid hormone synthesis, radiation, thyroidectomy, and iodine deficiency. Therapeutic management is the same as for congenital hypothyroidism. Management involves oral sodium L -thyroxine, which is given at 2 to 5 mcg/kg per day to maintain T 4 in the upper half of the normal range and to suppress TSH. Nursing Assessment Interview the family and child to determine activity tolerance and behavior changes. The symptoms may develop over a period of time and may be subtle. Note vague complaints of fatigue, weakness, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, and dry skin. The severity of symptoms depends on the length of time that the hormone deficiency has existed and its extent. Reviewing the growth pattern may reveal a slowed or arrested growth rate (height) and increased weight. Physical examination may reveal a goiter (enlargement of the thyroid gland). Deep tendon reflexes may be sluggish and the face, eyes, and hands may be edematous. Note thinning or coarse hair, muscle hypertrophy with muscle weakness, and signs of delayed or precocious puberty. The diagnostic evaluation involves serum thyroid function studies (TSH, T 3 , and T 4 ) as well as serum thyroid antibodies to confirm autoimmune thyroiditis. MRI and a thyroid uptake test and scan may also be necessary. Nursing Management Work with the family to establish a daily schedule for administering L -thyroxine, which should be taken 30 to 60 minutes before a meal for optimal absorption. Explain to the family that growth is related to the child's response to the treatment, and there are no specific strategies to aid in this growth. The family should understand the diagnosis, should be able to recognize signs and symptoms of thyroid hypo- and hyperfunction, and should know when to notify the physician or nurse practitioner. The family and child may need assistance in accepting the therapy as well as the experience of catch-up growth that may occur at the beginning of therapy. The child with chronic or severe hypothyroidism may be at risk for adverse effects such as restlessness, insomnia, or irritability. The child'sthyroid levels should be evaluated at recommended intervals such as every 3 to 6 months by a pediatric endocrinologist. Hyperthyroidism Hyperthyroidism is the result of hyperfunction of the thyroid gland. This leads to excessive levels of circulating thyroid hormones. This condition is uncommon in children. The peak incidence in children occurs in adolescence as a result of Graves disease (Lifshitz, 2007). Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes excessive amounts of thyroid hormone to be released in response to human thyroid stimulator immunoglobulin (TSI). It occurs five times more often in girls than in boys (Lafranchi, 2007). A goiter usually develops in this condition. There is a genetic marker in individuals affected by Graves disease, with 60% of affected people having a family history of autoimmune thyroid problems (Lifshitz, 2007). A congenital form of hyperthyroidism, neonatal thyrotoxicosis, occurs in infants of mothers with Graves disease. This neonatal condition, which can be life-threatening, is a self-limiting disorder lasting 2 to 4 months. Less common causes of hyperthyroidism are thyroiditis, thyroid hormone-producing tumors, and pituitary adenomas. Therapeutic management is aimed at decreasing thyroid hormone levels. Current treatment involves antithyroid medication, radioactive iodine therapy, and subtotal thyroidectomy. First-line treatment involves propylthiouracil (PTU) or methimazole (MTZ, Tapazole), which blocks the production of T 3 and T 4 . Adjunct therapy with -adrenergic blockers (Inderal) may also be used if the child has marked symptoms. Radioactive iodine therapy is becoming acceptable for children as a long-term therapy (Lifshitz, 2007). This therapy is administered orally and results in tissue damage and destruction of the thyroid gland within 6 to 18 weeks, but it can result in hypothyroidism. Subtotal thyroidectomy is used when drug therapy is not possible or other treatments have failed. Risks include hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, or laryngeal nerve damage. Nursing Assessment Initially, symptoms of hyperthyroidism are mild and often overlooked. Many children with hyperthyroidism are first seen in the outpatient setting with a history of a problem with sleep, school performance, and distractibility. They become easily frustrated, overheated, and fatigued during physical education class. The child may complain of diarrhea, excessive perspiration, and muscle weakness. The history may also reveal hyperactivity, heat intolerance, emotional lability, and insomnia. Physical examination of the older child may reveal an increased rate of growth; weight loss despite an excellent appetite; hyperactivity; warm, moist skin; tachycardia; fine tremors; gland or goiter; and ophthalmic changes (exophthalmos, which is less pronounced in proptosis; retraction; diplopia) ( Fig. 27.4 ). Elevated pulse and blood pressure may also be noted. Laboratory and diagnostic tests reveal that serum T 4 and T 3 levels are markedly elevated while TSH levels are suppressed.FIGURE 27.4 Adolescent with Graves disease. COMPARISON CHART 27.2 HYPOTHYROIDISM VERSUS HYPERTHYROIDISM Take Note! The sudden release of high levels of thyroid hormones results in thyroid storm, which progresses to heart failure and shock. Immediately report the signs of thyroid storm, which include sudden onset of severe restlessness and irritability, fever, diaphoresis, and severe tachycardia (Lafranchi, 2007). Nursing Management Once the treatment plan is initiated, educate the family and child about the medication and potential adverse effects, the goals of treatment, and possible complications. Monitor for adverse drug effects such as rash, mild leukopenia, loss of taste, sore throat, gastrointestinal disturbances, and arthralgia. If the medication is given two or three times a day, teach the family to use a pill dispenser and alarm clock. Inform the family of the need for routine blood tests and follow-up visits with the pediatric endocrinologist every 2 to 4 months until normal levels are reached; then visits may be decreased to once or twice a year. Instruct the parents to contact the physician or nurse practitioner if the child has tachycardia or extreme fatigue. Help the child and family to cope with symptoms such as heat intolerance, emotional lability, or eye problems. Explain these symptoms to the school or day care personnel and make sure that they understand that the child should take more frequent rest breaks in a cool environment, and should avoid physical education classes until normal hormone levels are attained. Encourage the family to have the child consume a healthy diet with an appropriate level of calories; the child may need to eat five or six meals a day.Provide community referrals such as to the National Graves' Disease Foundation, a link to which can be found on . Encourage the family to obtain a medical ID bracelet or necklace. If surgical intervention is chosen, provide appropriate preoperative teaching and postoperative care. Provide supportive measures such as fluid maintenance, nutritional support, and electrolyte correction. Monitor red blood cell count and liver function tests. Close monitoring for signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism is important. Comparison Chart 27.2 compares hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.DISORDERS RELATED TO PARATHYROID GLAND FUNCTION The parathyroid glands secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH). This hormone, along with vitamin D and calcitonin, regulates calcium/phosphate homeostasis by increasing osteoclastic activity, absorption of calcium and excretion of phosphate by the kidneys, and absorption of calcium in the gastrointestinal tract. The two disorders associated with parathyroid gland dysfunction are hypoparathyroidism and hyperparathyroidism. Both of these disorders are rare in children. Refer to Table 27.2 .DISORDERS RELATED TO ADRENAL GLAND FUNCTION Disorders of the adrenal gland include acute and chronic adrenal insufficiency (hypofunction) and of hyperfunction, such as Cushing syndrome. The adrenal cortex is the site of production of glucocorticoids (for blood glucose regulation), mineralocorticoids (for sodium retention), and androgenic and estrogenic steroid compounds (for phallic and secondary sex development). The adrenal medulla is the site of production of the catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine) and is under neuroendocrine control. When production of these compounds is altered, disease results. Pediatric adrenocortical insufficiency is similar to adults with the exception of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which will be discussed below. Refer to Table 27.3 for an overview of other disorders Congenital Adrenal of autosomal recessive inherited disorders in which there is an insufficient supply of the enzymes required for the synthesis of cortisol and aldosterone. It is the most common type of adrenocortical insufficiency seen in children with an incidence of about 1 in 15,000 to 20,000 live births (Hatcher, 2010; White, 2007). More than 90% of the cases of CAH are caused by a deficiency of 21-hydroxylase (21-OH) enzyme (Hatcher, 2010; White, 2007). Therefore, our discussion will focus on this type. This condition can be life-threatening and requires prompt diagnosis and treatment after birth (Hatcher, 2010). Complications of CAH include hyponatremia (low blood sodium levels), hyperkalemia (high blood potassium levels), hypotension (abnormally low blood pressure), shock, hypoglycemia (low blood glucose levels), short adult stature, and adult testicular tumor in males. Pathophysiology 21-OH enzyme deficiency results in blocking the production of adrenal mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. A reduction of cortisol occurs, which leads to increased adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production by the anterior pituitary to stimulate adrenal gland production. Prolonged oversecretion of ACTH causes enlargement or hyperplasia of the adrenal glands and excess production of androgens, leading to male characteristics appearing early or inappropriately. In males, the enzyme deficiency of 21-OH with excessive androgen secretion leads to a slightly enlarged penis, which may become adult-sized by school age, and a hyperpigmented scrotum. Males do not have obvious signs at birth but may enter puberty by 2 to 3 years of age. The female fetus develops male secondary sexual characteristics; thus, CAH causes ambiguous genitalia in girls (Hatcher, 2010). The clitoris is enlarged and may resemble the penis, the labia have a rugated appearance, and the labial folds are fused, but the internal reproductive organs, including the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus, are normal.A milder form of 21-OH deficiency becomes evident later (genitals are normal at birth), in the toddler or preschool years, with premature adrenarche (early sexual maturation), pubic hair development, accelerated growth velocity, advanced bone age, early closure of the epiphyseal plates resulting in short stature as an adult, acne, and hirsutism (excessive body hair growth). Males usually have normal fertility while females may have lower fertility. Aldosterone insufficiency also leads to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, such as hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypotension due to depletion of extracellular fluid. Cortisol insufficiency leads to hypoglycemia. Therapeutic Management The goal of treatment is to stop excessive adrenal secretion of androgens while maintaining normal growth and development. Most children with 21-OH deficiency will take a glucocorticoid such as hydrocortisone and the mineralocorticoid fludrocortisone (Florinef) for life. Infants may also require sodium supplementation. When the medications are taken at physiologic doses there are no adverse effects, but if the drug levels become elevated, hypertension, growth impairment, and acne become a problem. Regular follow-up care and appropriate titration maintain the dose at appropriate levels to allow normal growth and development. Usually when girls are born with ambiguous genitalia, standard medical treatment is to correct the external genitalia and establish adequate sexual functioning. Gender can be determined by karyotyping chromosomes. Typically, a reduction of the clitoris and opening of the labial folds is done within 2 to 6 months of life, with further surgeries at puberty (White, 2007). Some argue that surgery should be delayed until the child is old enough to decide what kind of correction (if any) should be performed (White, 2007). The decision to intervene immediately or to delay treatment is a complex one that raises many concerns for the family. Further long- term follow-up research is needed to determine risks and benefits of early versus delayed treatment (White, 2007). Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment of the child with CAH includes health history, physical examination, and laboratory and diagnostic testing. Specific findings related to CAH are presented below. Health History and Physical Examination Obtain the health history, noting history of abnormal genitalia at birth in the infant. In the toddler or preschooler, note history of accelerated growth velocity and signs of premature adrenarche. Upon inspection of the infant's genitalia, note a large penis in the boy and ambiguous genitalia in the girl ( Fig. 27.5 ). When observing the toddler or preschooler, note pubic hair development, acne, and hirsutism. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing The most common type of CAH, 21-OH enzyme deficiency, is detected by newborn metabolic screening. See Healthy People 2020. If this test has not been done or the results are unavailable, obtain random hormone levels or levels associated with ACTH stimulation. Radiographs reveal advanced bone age and premature closure of epiphyseal plates of the long bones. FIGURE 27.5 Newborn with ambiguous genitalia. FIGURE 27.6 Cushing syndrome. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Nursing Management In addition to the common interventions associated with endocrine disorders in childhood (see Nursing Care Plan 27.1 ), nursing management of the infant or child with CAH focuses on preventing and monitoring for acute adrenal crisis, helping the family to understand the disease, providing education to the child and family about the importance of maintaining hormone supplementation, and providing emotional support to the family. Preventing and Monitoring for Acute Adrenal Crisis Providing ongoing assessment of the ill or hospitalized child with a history of CAH is crucial in order to recognize the development of life-threatening acute adrenal crisis. Signs and symptoms of acute adrenal crisis include persistent vomiting, dehydration, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypotension, tachycardia, and shock. Monitor children with CAH closely and notify the physician or nurse practitioner if adrenal crisis is suspected. If signs and symptoms of adrenal crisis develop, the child will receive intravenous steroids, such as hydrocortisone, and aggressive fluid resuscitation, often using 5% dextrose in saline (D5NS), to correct electrolyte imbalances. Take Note! Adrenal crisis in the newborn is often unrecognized. It presents within the first few days to weeks of life with vomiting, lethargy, and feeding difficulties. Educating the Family About the Medication Regimen Medication will be required throughout the child's life because cortisone is necessary to sustain life. Teach the family the appropriate oral dosages of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. It is critical to maintain tight control over the levels of these medications in the bloodstream. Either underdosing or overdosing may lead to short adult stature. Low levels of the hormones may also result in adrenal crisis (as discussed above). These drugs are usually given orally but in some instances will need to be given via intramuscular injections. Teach families how to give hydrocortisone intramuscularly if the child is vomiting and cannot keep down oral medication. If the child becomes ill, is under stress, or needs surgery, additional doses of medications may be required. Encourage the family to obtain a medical ID bracelet or necklace for the child. Take Note! Families must keep extra steroids in an injectable form, such as Solu-Cortef or Decadron, at home to give during an emergency. Providing Family Support Make sure the family of a newborn with ambiguous genitalia feels comfortable asking questions and exploring their feelings. There are many issues to consider, such as whether the family will reassign the child's sex or raise the child with the original assignment at birth. The birth certificate may pose a problem if the state requires identification of sex. Cultural attitudes, the parents' expectations, and the extent of family support influence the family's response to the child and the decision-making process related to sex assignment and surgical correction. If corrective surgery is immediately decided upon, then typical surgical concerns for newborns will need to be addressed. In general, laypeople do not understand adrenal function and what this diagnosis may mean to the family. Provide families with privacy to discuss these issues, and offer emotional support. When referring to the infant, use terms such as \"your baby\" instead of the pronouns \"he,\" organs\" instead of \"penis\" or \"clitoris.\" Refer families to the CARES (Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Research, Education, and Support) Foundation and the Magic Foundation for additional support and resources. Links to these resources are provided on . Local parent-to-parent support groups are also helpful.POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), also referred to as functional ovarian hyperandrogenism or ovarian androgen excess, is an endocrine disorder that produces a variety of symptoms in adolescent girls and women. The exact cause is unknown. Testosterone production by the ovaries and adrenal cells is excessive, causing hirsutism, balding, acne, increased muscle mass, and decreased breast size. Polycystic ovaries may or may not be present. There is a genetic predisposition for PCOS, and many women with PCOS are also obese (Shayya & Chang, 2009). Complications of excess androgen production in women include infertility, insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinemia, leading to diabetes mellitus, increased risk for endometrial carcinoma, and cardiovascular disease. Therapeutic management involves the administration of oral contraceptives for their hormonal effects, as well as insulin-sensitizing medications such as metformin (Glucophage). Nursing Assessment Explore the health history for oligomenorrhea (irregular, infrequent periods) or amenorrhea. Symptoms typically emerge at or soon after puberty but often go undiagnosed. Note weight in relation to standardized growth charts and calculate body mass index (BMI) to determine whether the girl is overweight or obese. Inspect the skin for acne, acanthosis nigricans (darkened, thickened pigmentation, particularly around the neck or in the axillary region), and hirsutism (excess body hair growth). Assist with collection of timed blood specimens for glucose and insulin levels (which will often show unexpectedly elevated insulin levels in relation to the glucose level). Laboratory tests may show elevated levels of free testosterone and other androgenic hormones. Nursing Management One of the most important functions of the nurse in relation to PCOS is to assist with early recognition and treatment. Educate the adolescent girl about the use of oral contraceptives to normalize hormone levels, which will decrease androgenic effects. Support the teen in her efforts to diet and exercise to lose weight. Oral insulin-sensitizing drugs such as metformin (Glucophage) may be prescribed. Encourage the teen to comply with the medication regimen. Routinely measure weight to determine progress with weight loss. Measure blood pressure to screen for hypertension, which may develop as a complication of PCOS. Online support groups and education are available. Links to several resources are provided on . DIABETES MELLITUS Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common chronic disease seen in children and adolescents. In DM, carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism is impaired. The cardinal feature of DM is hyperglycemia. The major forms of diabetes are classified as: Type 1, which is caused by a deficiency of insulin secretion due to pancreatic -cell damage Type 2, which is a consequence of insulin resistance that occurs at the level of skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue with different degrees of -cell impairment (Alemzadeh & Wyatt, 2007) Other types of diabetes secondary to certain conditions such as cystic fibrosis, glucocorticoid use (as in Cushing syndrome), and certain genetic syndromes such as Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and Turner syndrome (Alemzadeh & Wyatt, 2007; National Diabetes Education Program, 2008) Gestational diabetes (diabetes during pregnancy) The discussion for this chapter will focus on type 1 and type 2 diabetes as these are the most common types seen in children. However, clinical presentation and disease progression of DM can vary considerably. Therefore, in some cases children cannot be clearly defined as having type 1 or type 2 (American Diabetes Association, 2011). In the past childhood DM was assumed to be type 1. Every year approximately 13,000 children and adolescents are diagnosed with type 1 DM (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010). Historically, type 2 DM occurred mostly in adults. However, in recent years, type 2 DM has been reported in U.S. children and adolescents at an increasing and alarming rate (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010). Some studies report that between 8% and 45% of children with newly diagnosed diabetes have type 2 (Dowshen, 2009). In the next 10 years, the prevalence of type 2 DM is expected to exceed type 1 in U.S. children (American Academy of Pediatrics Policy, 2009). This increase in incidence of type 2 DM among children and adolescents may be attributed to the rise in obesity and decreased physical activity in young people along with exposure to diabetes in utero (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010). Many children with type 2 DM have a relative with type 2 DM and/or are overweight. Children of American Indian/Alaska Native descent have a higher rate of type 2 DM, and Mexican American, Asian American, and African American children are at a higher risk for developing the disease (American Academy of Pediatrics Policy, 2009). See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Care of children with diabetes differs from that of adults due to physiologic and developmental differences. In children insulin sensitivity varies as the child grows and goes through sexual maturation. Children are dependent on others for their care, and self- management ability varies among children based on age, developmental level, and individual differences. Care will be needed in a variety of settings such as school, day care, and extracurricular activities. Therefore, teaching and education will need to involve parents and other caregivers throughout childhood and adolescence. Refer to Table 27.4 , which discusses developmental issues related to diabetes mellitus. PathophysiologyType 1 DM is an autoimmune disorder that occurs in genetically susceptible individuals who may also be exposed to one of several environmental or acquired factors, such as chemicals, viruses, or other toxic agents implicated in the development process. As the genetically susceptible individual is exposed to environmental factors, the immune system begins a T-lymphocyte-mediated process that damages and destroys the b cells of the pancreas, resulting in inadequate insulin secretion. This deficiency of insulin leads to an inability of cells to take up glucose. The end result is hyperglycemia, glucose accumulation in the blood, and the body's inability to use its main source of fuel efficiently. The kidneys try to lower blood glucose, resulting in glycosuria and polyuria, and protein and fat are broken down for energy. The metabolism of fat leads to a build-up of ketones and acidosis (see discussion of diabetic ketoacidosis below). In type 2 DM the pancreas usually produces insulin but the body is resistant to the insulin or there is an inadequate insulin secretion response (the body can produce insulin but not enough to meet the body's needs). Eventually, insulin production decreases (resulting from the pancreas working overtime to produce insulin), with a result similar to type 1 DM. If DM goes unrecognized or is inadequately treated (especially type 1 DM), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or fat catabolism develops (a deficiency or ineffectiveness of insulin results in the body using fat instead of glucose for energy), resulting in anorexia, nausea and vomiting, lethargy, stupor, altered level of consciousness, confusion, decreased skin turgor, abdominal pain, Kussmaul respirations and air hunger, fruity (sweet-smelling) or acetone breath odor, presence of ketones in urine and blood, tachycardia, and, if left untreated, coma and death. Take Note! DKA is a medical emergency. It requires early recognition and prompt intervention. Be alert to the increased chance of DKA during times of stress such as illness, infection, and surgery, as hormones produced by the body in times of stress result in decreased insulin sensitivity and increased glucose production. Prolonged exposure to high blood glucose levels results in damage to blood vessels and nerves. Long-term complications of DM include failure to grow, delayed sexual maturation, poor wound healing, recurrent infections (especially of the skin), retinopathy, neuropathy, vascular complications, nephropathy, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, and cardiovascular disease. Consistent, well-controlled blood glucose levels can prevent these complications from developing for many years. On the other hand, poorly controlled DM can lead to complications much earlier.Therapeutic Management Treatment for DM must occur as part of a multidisciplinary health care team, with the family and child as a central part of that team. In the past the child would be admitted to the hospital for 3 to 5 days for stabilization and education, but today the trend is toward treating children on an outpatient basis. Established glucose control is essential in reducing the risk of long-term complications associated with DM. Therefore, general goals for therapeutic management include: Achieving normal growth and development Promoting optimal serum glucose control, including fluid and electrolyte levels and near-normal hemoglobin A1C or glycosylated hemoglobin (which is hemoglobin that glucose is bound to and it monitors long-term control of blood sugars and diabetes) levels Preventing complications Promoting positive adjustment to the disease, with ability to self-manage in the home The key to success is to educate the child and family so they can self-manage this chronic condition. Therapeutic management involves blood glucose monitoring; daily injections of insulin and/or administration of oral hypoglycemic medications; a realistic and well-balanced diet; an exercise program; and self-management and decision-making skills. Research is ongoing to develop alternative medications, including alternative routes for insulin administration (such as inhaled) and therapies to monitor and treat diabetes (such as continuous glucose sensing systems [National Diabetes Education Program, 2008]). Monitoring Glycemic Control Consistent glycemic control leads to fewer long-term diabetes-related complications. Two important methods for monitoring glycemic control include blood glucose monitoring and monitoring hemoglobin A1C levels.BLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING Blood glucose monitoring evaluates short-term glycemic control. It allows for tight glucose control because supplemental insulin can be used to correct or prevent hyperglycemia; it also enables children and their parents and their physicians or nurse practitioners to provide better management of the disease. (Refer to Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 27.1 ). The frequency of blood glucose monitoring is based on the goals for each particular child. Children who are in the hospital for management of their DM or are on insulin therapy require blood glucose monitoring before meals and at bedtime if not more frequently. Additional glucose checks may be necessary if glycemic control has not occurred, during times of illness, during episodes of hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic symptoms, or when there are changes in therapy. Children receiving noninsulin therapy may check their blood glucose less frequently but it can remain a useful guide to their therapy and its effectiveness. The procedure for glucose monitoring will vary based on equipment used but often involves a fingerstick, a reagent strip, and a glucometer. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) at home is essential to improve glycemic control, to provide self-management of this disease, and to help to prevent complications such as severe hypo-/hyperglycemia. The child and caregiver need to be aware of the importance of checking blood glucose regularly and more frequently when needed. Documenting blood glucose values is necessary to provide information on glucose control. This allows their physician or nurse practitioner to evaluate the effectiveness of their treatment regimen. Accuracy of SMBG is dependent on proper user technique; therefore, assessment of technique and education reinforcement are important at each visit (see Teaching Guidelines 27.2 ). MONITORING HEMOGLOBIN A1C LEVELS Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) provides the physician or nurse practitioner with information regarding the long-term control of glucose levels (refer to Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 27.1 ). In adults the goal is to achieve a near-normal HbA1C. However, in children, especially infants and children younger than 3 years, hypoglycemia poses some unique risks and can be hard to recognize (American Diabetes Association, 2011) (refer to Table 27.4 ). Glycemic control goals need to be individualized, but the American Association of Diabetes (2011) has developed standards related to HbA1C goals in children with type 1 diabetes. These include: Infants and young children 0 to 6 years: HbA1C less than 8.5% but greater than 7.5% Children 6 to 12 years: less than 8% Children and adolescents 13 to 19 years: less than 7.5% Insulin Replacement Therapy Insulin replacement therapy is the cornerstone of management of type 1 DM. Insulin is administered daily by subcutaneous injections into adipose tissue over large muscle masses using a traditional insulin syringe or a subcutaneous injector ( Fig. 27.7 ). U-100 insulin may also be administered using a portable insulin pump (see discussion below). The frequency, dose, and type of insulin are based on how much the child needs to achieve a normal, average blood glucose concentration and to prevent hypoglycemia. Typically, two to four daily injections are commonly used, with dosage depending on the needs of the child. The dose may need to be increased during the pubertal growth spurt as well as during times of illness or stress. See Evidence-Based Practice 27.1 . EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 27.1 IDEAL INJECTION TECHNIQUES WHEN USING 5-MM NEEDLES IN CHILDREN STUDY One hundred and twenty-two otherwise healthy children/adolescents (5 to 19 years of age) with type I DM and 137 adults (22 to 85 years of age) with type 1 and type 2 DM were injected with sterile air (corresponding to 20 IU insulin) with 32-gauge 5- mm needles at 90 and 45 degrees with or without pinched skin in the abdomen and thigh. Via ultrasound injection depth was measured (assessed as either intradermal, intramuscular, or subcutaneous placement) and subjects rated pain on a facial or visual analog scale. To assess injection leakage, test medium injections, at 45 or 90 degrees with pinched skin, into the abdomen and thigh were also performed. Findings No adverse effects, such as bleeding and bruising, were associated with the injections. In children few injections were located outside of the subcutaneous tissue, but there was a significant association between age and likelihood of intramuscular (IM) injection, with the incidence of IM injection even lower in adults. The analysis also showed clear sex differences in the number ofIM injections in children and adolescents, with higher frequency of IM injection in boys. In boys angled and pinched skin resulted in less IM incidence. In girls no IM injections were noted when the skin was pinched or injection administered in the thigh. Children experienced more pain with injection than adults but about one third of children reported no pain. Angle or site of injection did not affect experience of pain. Injections in adults more likely lead to leakage than in children. Leakage was not affected by the volume of the medium but was more likely to occur with vertical injections and with thigh injections (but even then leakage was minimal). Nursing Implications The use of 32-gauge 5-mm needles is associated with minimal leakage and pain, and these can be reliably inserted into subcutaneous tissue. In children, nurses should use a 32-gauge 5-mm needle utilizing an angled technique with pinched skin fold to reduce the chance of IM injection and decrease pain and leakage. Adapted from Hofman, P. L., Derraik, J. G. B., Pinto T. E., Tregurtha, S., Faherty, A., Peart, J. M., et al. (2010). Defining the ideal injection techniques when using 5-mm needles in children and adults. Diabetes Care, 33(9), 1940-1944. An insulin pump is a device that administers a continuous infusion of rapid-acting insulin. These devices have been increasing in usage and studies have found them to be a safe and effective way to improve glycemic control in young people (Nelson, Genthe, Gall, & Edwards, 2009). It consists of a computer, a reservoir of rapid-acting insulin, thin tubing through which the insulin is delivered, and a small needle inserted into the abdomen. Insulin pumps attempt to mimic the physiologic insulin release by delivering small continuous infusions of insulin with additional bolus units administered at mealtimes, for planned carbohydrate intake, and if glucose testing results show it is needed. Advantages of this kind of therapy include: FIGURE 27.7 The subcutaneous injector uses pressure jets to deliver insulin safely and accurately. There are fewer injections and less trauma. Children's food intake can be unpredictable, so insulin delivery can occur after a meal and be adjusted based on actual intake. Children can be sensitive to insulin and require only minute doses, which the pump can deliver with precision. The pumps can store different basal rates for different times during the day and days of the week. For example, a higher basal rate may be needed in the morning when the child is sitting at his or her desk and a lower rate may be necessary during the afternoon when the child is more active with recess and physical education classes. In addition, rates can be programmed differently for school days versus weekend days, when the child may sleep later and have differing activity levels. The use of an insulin pump does require a commitment from the child and caregiver in order to achieve success and improved glycemic control. The child and caregiver must be able to count carbohydrates, monitor glucose levels frequently, and work closely with the physician or nurse practitioner. Take Note! Some insulin pumps have a built-in sensor to monitor blood glucose continuously.Types of insulin include rapid acting, short acting, intermediate acting, and long acting ( Table 27.5 ). Each type works at a different pace and most children will use more than one type. In some cases premixed combinations of intermediate and short or rapid acting, such as 70% NPH and 30% regular, may be used. Again, this depends on the needs of the child. Insulin can be kept at room temperature (insulin that is administered cold may increase discomfort with injection) but should be discarded 1 month after opening even if refrigerated. Any extra, unopened vials should be stored in the refrigerator. Take Note! Lantus is usually given in a single dose at bedtime. Do not mix Lantus with other insulins. Oral Diabetic Medications Oral diabetic medications, also referred to as hypoglycemic, antidiabetic, or antihyperglycemic medications, are used in DM type 2 if glycemic control cannot be achieved by diet and exercise. Oral diabetic medications work in a variety of ways. Sulfonylureas [such insulin secretion by increasing the response of b cells to glucose. Another group, the biguanides, reduces glucose production from the liver. Metformin is an example of a biguanide and is an effective initial therapy unless significant liver or kidney impairment is present. Insulin sensitizers are used to help decrease insulin resistance and improve the body's ability to use insulin in the liver and skeletal tissues. - Glucosidase inhibitors are used to slow digestion of starch in the small intestines so that glucose from the starch enters the bloodstream more slowly and can be matched more effectively with the impaired insulin response of the body. Combination agents are also available. Common adverse effects of these oral diabetic medications include headache, dizziness, flatulence and gastrointestinal (GI) distress, edema, and liver enzyme elevation. If the oral hypoglycemics fail to maintain a normal glucose level, then insulin injections will be required to manage type 2 DM. Diet and Exercise Other therapies involve diet and exercise protocols. Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) can be initiated to prevent type 2 diabetes in children showing signs of prediabetes, to help glycemic control in existing diabetes, and to help slow the development of complications associated with diabetes (American Diabetes Association, 2011). MNT can be complex and must be individualized to each child incorporating the child's food preferences, activity level, cultural preferences, and family habits and schedule. Enlisting the help of a registered dietician who has expertise in diabetic management is recommended (American Diabetes Association, 2011). The appropriate diet for a child or adolescent with diabetes is a balanced, healthy diet that meets the child's growth and development needs. The child and family need to understand the effect that food has on the child's glucose levels. Monitoring carbohydrate intake is an important component of diet management and assists with glycemic control. Nutritional recommendations for a child with diabetes or prediabetes include the following: limit sweets, ensure consistent food intake (eat often and try to avoid skipping meals), monitor carbohydrate intake, eat whole grains and plenty of fruits and vegetables, and limit fat. It has been shown that regular exercise can improve glycemic control and can prevent the development of type 2 diabetes(American Diabetes Association, 2011). Also, exercise has an important influence on the hypoglycemic effects of insulin (by causing the release of glucagon, which will result in increased blood glucose). Therefore, it is important for the child to maintain or increase his or her activity levels. If the child is taking insulin, the family must know how to change the medication dosage or add food to maintain blood glucose control. Children with type 2 DM are often overweight, so the exercise plan is very important in helping the child to lose weight as well as assisting with the hypoglycemic effects of the medications. Management of Complications Another important aspect of therapeutic management includes monitoring and managing complications. The American Diabetes Association (2011) has developed recommendations for standards of medical care to help monitor complications and reduce risk (American Diabetes Association, 2011; National Diabetes Education Program, 2008). These include: Retinopathy: Type 1 diabetes: eye examination by ophthalmologist (with expertise in diabetes) once child is 10 and has had diabetes for 3 to 5 years; annual examinations unless different recommendation by professional Type 2 diabetes: eye examination by ophthalmologist (with expertise in diabetes) shortly after diagnosis; annual examinations unless different recommendation by professional Nephropathy: Type 1 diabetes: annual screening for microalbuminuria (which occurs when the kidneys leak small amounts of albumin into the urine) once child is 10 and has had diabetes for 5 years Type 2 diabetes: annual screening for microalbuminuria shortly after diagnosis Dyslipidemia: in children older than 2 years with a family history of high cholesterol or cardiovascular disease or unknown family history, obtain a lipid profile at time of diagnosis (once glucose level has been stabilized); otherwise, obtain lipid panel at puberty. In addition, children with type 1 diabetes should be screened for celiac disease and hypothyroidism every 1 to 2 years (once glucose levels are stabilized) since both are commonly associated with diabetes. Nursing Assessment Assessment involves understanding the ever-changing needs of children as they grow and develop. The first phase of assessment involves identifying the child who may have DM. The second phase involves identifying problems that might develop in the child with DM. It is important to always be aware of this when observing the child for possible complications or management problems. In addition, always be alert for opportunities to provide education that will expand the understanding and skills related to management of DM of the child and family. Health History and Physical Examination During the initial diagnosis of DM, obtain a detailed history of family patterns and problems in school related to some of the mental and behavior changes that may occur in a hyperglycemic state (e.g., weakness, fatigue, and mood changes). The child or parent may report unusual or excessive thirst (polydipsia) coupled with frequent urination (polyuria). The child may also complain of blurred vision, headaches, or bedwetting. The child with type 1 DM may have a history of poor growth. Comparison Chart 27.3 gives information about common history and physical examination findings in children with type 1 DM versus type 2 DM. Type 1 DM typically presents with acute symptoms and hyperglycemia, while type 2 DM can frequently go undiagnosed until complications appear (American Diabetes Association, 2011). In the child who is known to have DM, the health history includes any problems with hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, diet, activity and exercise patterns, types of medications (insulin or oral diabetic medications) and dose and times of administration, ability to monitor blood glucose levels, and ability to administer insulin. Perform a thorough physical examination, noting any abnormal findings. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing The American Diabetes Association (2011) currently recommends the use of hemoglobin A1C to diagnose diabetes (refer to Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 27.1 ). The American Diabetes Association (2011) still recognizes fasting plasma glucose levels and 2-hour postprandial glucose levels as reliable sources to diagnose diabetes (refer to Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 27.1 ). A hemoglobin A1C greater than 6.5%, a random glucose level above 200 mg/dL (accompanied by typical symptoms of diabetes), a fasting glucose level greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL, and a 2-hour plasma glucose level above 200 mg/dL during an oral glucose tolerance test are laboratory criteria for the diagnosis of DM (American Diabetes Association, 2011). With each of these tests, if hyperglycemia is not explicit, the results should be confirmed with a repeat test on a different day (American DiabetesAssociation, 2011). Other laboratory and diagnostic tests include serum measurements of islet cell antibodies. Serum levels of urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and electrolytes such as potassium and sodium may be drawn. Additional tests include a complete blood count, urinalysis, and immunoassay to measure levels of C peptides after a glucose challenge to verify endogenous insulin secretion. COMPARISON CHART 27.3 TYPE 1 VERSUS TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS The American Diabetes Association (2011) recommends screening for type 2 DM if a child presents with being overweight or obese and also has any two of the following risk factors: Family history: a parent or relative with type 2 DM Ethnic background: Native American, African American, Latino, or Asian American/Pacific Islander Conditions associated with insulin resistance such as acanthosis nigricans, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or PCOS History of maternal diabetes or mother with gestational diabetes when child was in utero Age older than 10 years or onset of puberty before age 10 (American Diabetes Association, 2011; Cox & Polvado, 2008) Nursing Management Individualize the general nursing care discussed in Nursing Care Plan 27.1 based on the child's and family's response to illness. Additional nursing care topics related to DM are discussed below, including regulating glucose control, monitoring for complications, providing education to the child and family, and supporting the child and family. Regulating Glucose Control Consistent and established glucose control can reduce the risk of long-term complications associated with diabetes. Therefore, regulating glucose is a very important nursing function. Typically, in children with type 1 DM and sometimes in cases of type 2 DM, glucose is regulated by subcutaneous injections of insulin. Often, the regimen consists of three injections of intermediate-acting insulin, with the addition of rapid-acting insulin before breakfast and dinner. Insulin doses are typically ordered on a sliding scale related to the serum glucose level and how the insulin works. Insulin doses and frequency are based on the needs of the child utilizing information gained from blood glucose testing. Regulating glucose can be challenging in children due to continual growth, onset of puberty, varying activity levels with unpredictable schedules, unpredictable eating habits, and the inability to always verbalize the way they are feeling. Thus, close monitoring of changing glucose levels through SMBG is essential in determining adjustments needed in insulin therapy, food intake, and activity level.FIGURE 27.8 Insulin injection sites. Teach the child and family to use proper subcutaneous injection techniques to avoid injecting into muscle or vascular spaces. Figure 27.8 shows appropriate sites for subcutaneous injection of insulin. Teach the child and family to rotate sites to avoid adipose hypertrophy (fatty lumps that absorb insulin poorly). If the child is using an insulin pump, additional education will be needed. A traumatic Care Children with diabetes experience numerous finger-pricks and injections. Providing atraumatic care remains important. Allow the child to choose the prick or injection site when possible. Use positioning that is comforting to the child. Encourage participation in care as developmentally appropriate. Take Note! When giving a combination of short- and long-acting insulin, draw up the clear (short-acting) insulin first to prevent contamination with the long-acting insulin. In children with type 2 diabetes, glucose levels can be controlled by the use of oral diabetic medications, diet, and exercise or a combination of all three. Monitoring for, and Managing, Complications While the child is in the hospital, monitor for signs of complications such as acidosis, coma, hyperkalemia or hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, cerebral edema, or hyponatremia. Assess for the development of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia every 2 hours ( Comparison Chart 27.4 ). Monitor the child's status closely during peak times of insulin action. Perform blood glucose testing as ordered or as needed if the child develops symptoms. If the child has a severe hypoglycemic reaction, administer glucagon (a hormone produced by the pancreas and stored in the liver) either subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Children under 20 kilograms receive 0.5 mg; children over 20 kilograms receive 1 mg (Alemzadeh & Wyatt, 2007). Dextrose (50%) may be given intravenously if needed. If the child is not having a severe reaction and is coherent, glucose paste or tablets may be used. Offer 10 to 15 g of a simple carbohydrate such as orange juice if the child feels some symptoms of low blood glucose and glucose monitoring indicates a drop in blood glucose level. Follow this with a more complexcarbohydrate such as peanut butter and crackers to maintain the glucose level. The child with severe hyperglycemia resulting in DKA is usually treated in the pediatric intensive care unit. In the case of a child presenting with DKA to the hospital, monitor the glucose level hourly to prevent it from falling more than 100 mg/dL per hour. A too- rapid decline in blood glucose predisposes the child to cerebral edema. Administration of regular insulin, given intravenously, is preferred during DKA (only regular insulin may be given intravenously [IV]). A bolus dose of 0.1 unit/kg is given, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1 unit/kg per hour (Hatcher, 2010). Fluid therapy is given to treat dehydration, correct electrolyte imbalances (sodium and potassium due to osmotic diuresis), and improve peripheral perfusion. COMPARISON CHART 27.4 HYPOGLYCEMIA VERSUS HYPERGLYCEMIA Any child exhibiting signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia requires insulin. The dosage is usually based on a sliding scale or determined after consultation with the physician or nurse practitioner. Take Note! Double-check all insulin doses against the order sheet and with another nurse to ensure accuracy. Child and family education that focuses on managing and monitoring for complications at home or in other settings such as school or day care is essential (see Educating the Family below). Educating the Family Education is the priority intervention for DM because it will enable the child and family to self-manage this chronic condition. Allow the child and family time to adjust to the diagnosis of a chronic illness that will require self-management. DM is a lifelong condition that requires regular follow-up visits (three or four times a year) to a diabetes specialty clinic. Because approximately 186,000 children and adolescents younger than the age of 20 have diabetes, this becomes a health issue for the community, especially for the schools (National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Diabetes Translation, 2010). Daily management of the child with DM is complex and dynamic. It will require frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels, medications (including oral diabetic medications and insulin injections), and individual meal plans, including snacks, while the child is at school. The school nurse will be a principal contact person for both staff and family. With appropriate management, involvement of the community, and confidence and compliance by the family, the child can maintain a happy, productive life. See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov .Challenges related to educating children with DM include: Children lack the maturity to understand the long-term consequences of this serious chronic illness. Children do not want to be different from their peers; having to make lifestyle changes may result in anger or depression. Poor families may not be able to afford appropriate food, medication, transportation, and telephone service. Families may demonstrate unhealthy behaviors, making it difficult for the child to initiate change because of the lack of supervision or role modeling. Family dynamics are affected because management of diabetes must occur all day, every day. Take Note! Children with DM have higher rates of depression and may have other comorbid conditions, such as eating disorders, adjustment disorders, or anxiety disorders (Alemzadeh & Wyatt, 2007). The initial goal of education is for the family to develop basic management and decision-making skills. Assess the family's ability to learn the basic concepts and offer psychological support. Teach about specific topics in sessions lasting 15 to 20 minutes for the children and 45 to 60 minutes for the caregivers. Teaching must be geared toward the child's level of development and understanding (refer to Table 27.4 ). Among the topics to include when teaching children and their families about diabetes management are: Self-measurement of blood glucose ( Fig. 27.9 ) Urine ketone testing Medication use ( Fig. 27.10 ) Oral diabetic agents Subcutaneous insulin injection or insulin pump use Subcutaneous site selection and rotation When to alter insulin dosages Use of glucagon to treat severe hypoglycemia Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia (refer to Comparison Chart 27.4 ) Treatment for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia at home or other setting such as school Monitoring for and managing complications (see above) Sick-day instructions Laboratory testing and follow-up care Diet and exercise as part of DM management (see above) Teaching Guidelines 27.2 presents information to cover when teaching the family about self-monitoring of blood glucose. Teach families how to give insulin, how to use the insulin pump, and how to rotate injection sites (see above). FIGURE 27.9 The school-age child has developed the psychomotor skills needed for blood glucose monitoring and insulin injection.FIGURE 27.10 The school-age child may first practice insulin injections on a doll. Teaching Guidelines 27.2 BLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING Obtain glucose levels before meals and bedtime snacks. Perform monitoring more often during prolonged exercise, if you are ill, if you have eaten more food than usual, or if you suspect nighttime hypoglycemia. Use the manufacturer's recommendations and perform quality control measures as directed. Look for patterns. For example, 3 to 4 days of a consistent pattern of glucose values above 200 mg/dL before dinner indicates a need to adjust the insulin dose. Blood glucose measurements are the best way to determine daily insulin dosages. Normal levels are as follows: nondiabetics: 70 to 110 mg/dL; toddlers and children with type 1 DM younger than 6 years old: before meals 100 to 180 mg/dL, at bedtime 110 to 200 mg/dL; children with type 1 DM ages 6 to 12: before meals 90 to 180 mg/dL, at bedtime 100 to 180 mg/dL; adolescents 13 to 19 years of age, before meals 90 to 130 mg/dL, at bedtime 90 to 150 mg/dL (American Diabetes Association, 2011). Good glucose control is dependent on accurate monitoring and medication administration by the child or caregiver. Assessment of the child's or parent's technique and review of procedure and instructions should occur with each visit. Treatment of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia may have to occur at home or in another setting such as school. In either case, someone that is trained and able to check the child's blood glucose level needs to be available. In the case of hypoglycemia, early recognition is key. Therefore, all caregivers need to be educated on the causes of hypoglycemia (such as increased physical activity, delayed meals or snacks, insulin, oral diabetic medication, illness, stress, and hormonal fluctuations) along with the signs and symptoms. The child also needs access to glucose tablets or a rapidly absorbing carbohydrate such as orange juice as well as a snack with complex carbohydrates and protein within 30 to 60 minutes of the hypoglycemic episode. Injectable glucagon needs to be available in the case that the hypoglycemia is severe and the child is unconscious. In the event of hyperglycemia, the child needs immediate access to rapid-acting insulin injection. Sick-day instructions may include the following: Contact the physician or nurse practitioner. Perform SMBG more often. Check for ketones in the urine, especially if blood glucose is elevated. Use a sliding scale to calculate the insulin dosage. A dietitian can help the family with detailed meal planning and dietary guidelines. Review basic nutritional information with the child and family and provide sample meals. Encourage the child and family to keep a food diary. For the child who needs to lose weight, suggest low-carbohydrate snacks. Encourage all children with DM to incorporate physical activity daily ( Teaching Guidelines 27.3 ). Teaching Guidelines 27.3 DIET AND EXERCISE FOR CHILDREN WITH DIABETES MELLITUS Provide sufficient calories and good nutrition for normal growth and development. The diet should be low in saturated fats and concentrated carbohydrates. Learn to identify carbohydrate, protein, and fat foods. Make adjustments during periods of rapid growth and for issues such as travel, school parties, and holidays. Consult a dietitian with expertise in diabetes education as needed. Provide three meals per day and midafternoon and bedtime snacks. Consistency of intake can help prevent complications and maintain near-normal blood glucose levels. Encourage the child to exercise routinely to help the body use insulin efficiently, thus reducing the insulin requirement. Encourage the child to participate in age-appropriate sports. When exercising, monitor insulin dose and nutritional and fluid intake, and observe for hypoglycemic reactions. Add an extra snack containing 15 to 30 g carbohydrate for each 45 to 60 minutes of exercise. Avoid exercising excessively when insulin is peaking. Supporting the Child and Family Children with DM and their families may have difficulty coping if they lack confidence in their self-management skills. Assess the ability of the child and family to handle situations. Role-play specific situations related to symptoms or complications to help them see different ways to solve problems. Work with the child and family to enhance their conflict resolution skills. Provide opportunities for them to express their feelings. Observe for signs of depression, especially in adolescents. To enhance the child's confidence and promote feelings of mastery and inclusion, refer him or her to a special camp for children with DM. Also refer families to local support groups, parent-to-parent networks, or one of many national support resources and foundations. Links to camps for children as well as support groups, parent-to-parent networks, and national foundations are provided on . KEY CONCEPTS The endocrine system consists of cells, tissues, and glands that produce and/or secrete hormones (chemical messengers) in response to a negative feedback system involving the hypothalamus and nervous system. Hormones (chemical messengers), along with the nervous system, play an intricate role in reproduction, growth and development, energy production and use, and maintenance of the internal homeostasis. The pituitary, along with the hypothalamus connection, is considered the \"control center,\" producing hormones that stimulate many glands to produce other hormones or to inhibit the process. Hormonal control is immature at birth; this is partly why the infant has trouble maintaining an appropriate balance of fluid concentration, electrolytes, amino acids, glucose, and trace substances. Linear growth and cognitive development may be impaired by untreated endocrine dysfunction in the infant or child. A thorough health history of the child with a known or potential endocrine disorder often reveals poor growth, school or learning problems, and inactivity or fatigue. Serial measurement of growth parameters is a key part of the physical assessment for children with endocrine dysfunction. Close monitoring of the child's status is critical during a hormone stimulation test or water deprivation study. Hormone supplementation is required lifelong for many of the endocrine disorders. The key nursing functions related to hormone supplementation are educating the child and family about medication use and monitoring for therapeutic results and adverse effects. Children with adrenocortical dysfunction will require additional hormone supplementation during times of stress such as fever, infection, or surgery. Growth hormone deficiency is characterized by poor growth and short stature as a result of failure of the anterior pituitary to produce sufficient growth hormone. Early treatment enables the child to reach normal growth. Precocious puberty involves early development of secondary sex characteristics as a result of premature activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Diabetes insipidus is characterized by water intoxication as a result of a deficiency in the antidiuretic hormone that leads to the cardinal signs of polyuria and polydipsia, resulting in hypernatremic dehydration. Key findings in congenital hypothyroidism are a thickened protuberant tongue, an enlarged posterior fontanel, feeding difficulties, hypotonia, and lethargy. Early diagnosis and treatment of hypothyroidism can prevent impaired growth and severe cognitive impairment. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia results from a genetic defect that causes a breakdown in steroid synthesis and an overproduction of androgens that can lead to ambiguous genitalia in females. Diabetes mellitus is the most common endocrine disorder now seen in children. Type 1 DM is an autoimmune disorder resulting from damage and destruction of the b cells in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas; the end result is insulin insufficiency. Peak onset occurs in childhood. Type 2 DM results in an insensitivity or resistance to insulin. The incidence of type 2 DM has risen dramatically. It is occurring at an alarming rate in children, especially in those who are obese and from certain ethnic groups. DKA is a medical emergency. The child will usually be admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit. Critical areas in the nursing management of children with endocrine dysfunction include maintaining appropriate nutrition and fluid balance and promoting growth and development. The nurse provides ongoing assessment and education of the child and family, imparting to them the knowledge and skills required for self-management. Encouraging the child to have a healthy body image and working with the family in establishing healthy family processes are also key nursing functions. The focus of DM management is regulation of glucose control, which is accomplished by medications, diet, and exercise. DM education involves instruction in glucose monitoring, administration of insulin or oral hypoglycemics, meal planning, and promotion of a healthy lifestyle.

A young mother brings her new baby, diagnosed with congenital hypothyroidism, to the clinic so she can learn how to administer levothyroxine. The nurse should include which of the following instructions? a. Crush the medication and place it in a full bottle of formula to disguise the taste. b. Administer the medication every other day. c. Use an oral dispenser syringe or nipple to give the crushed medication mixed with a small amount of formula. d. Tell the mother that the medication will not be needed after the age of 7. 2. During a well-child examination which of the following comments made by the parent would indicate the possibility of a growth hormone deficiency? a. \"I have to buy my child new clothes every 2 to 3 months.\" b. \"I have to buy my child larger shirts than pants; otherwise, the sleeves are too short.\" c. \"My child wears out his clothes before he outgrows them.\" d. \"I can hand down my child's clothes to his younger brother.\" 3. The nurse is caring for a 14-year-old boy with type 1 DM. He takes NPH insulin every morning at 7:30 a.m. Which assessment data will the nurse use to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of the medication? a. Presence of signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia during the morning physical assessment b. Blood glucose level at 1630 c. Appetite and food intake at lunch d. Blood glucose level before breakfast 4. When monitoring the blood glucose level of a 12-year-old child with type 2 DM, your reading is 50 mg/dL. Which is the most appropriate action? a. Encourage the child to get out of bed and increase activity. b. Take the child's vital signs. c. Ask the child about frequent urine output. d. Give the child 4 oz of orange juice.CRITICAL THINKING EXERCISES 1. A 12-year-old boy with type 1 DM has the flu. His mother calls the diabetes clinic to report that he stayed home from school and does not have an appetite, so he is not eating. The mother asks the nurse how much insulin the boy should take. He is currently taking three injections daily with regular and NPH in the morning before breakfast, regular and NPH in the evening after dinner, and regular before bedtime. What questions should the nurse ask before answering the mother's question? Based on the answers to these questions, how would you instruct the mother? 2. The mother of Robin, a 5-year-old girl, reports that Robin has a body odor. She is developing breasts and some pubic hair and was teased when she had a sleepover with friends. The review of her growth charts reveals that Robin went from the 50th percentile to the 93rd percentile in the past 6 months. Based on this information, what are the three major nursing diagnoses to begin establishing a plan of care for the child and family? What are the expected outcomes and major interventions associated with the nursing diagnosis of knowledge deficit? 3. A mother brings her baby to the clinic after receiving a phone message from the clinic saying there was a problem with the baby's thyroid test. She says the trip on the bus took a long time, but the infant slept the entire way. She says that the baby is sleeping much of the time and does not want to eat very much. The baby was discharged from the hospital 2 weeks ago. The birth was without difficulty and there were no problems during labor. Why is this visit urgent? What would the test show if the disorder was due to a pituitary gland problem and not the thyroid gland? STUDY ACTIVITIES 1. During your clinical experiences, ask to be on an inpatient unit that provides care for children with alterations in endocrine function. Compare and contrast the health histories, assessments, laboratory tests, diagnostic procedures, and plans of care for these children with those for the care of children on other units. Participate in the teaching plan for these children and their families. 2. Attend an outpatient clinic that provides care to children with endocrine disorders. Identify the role of the registered nurse in providing coordination of care, health teaching, and referrals for these children and their families. 3. Shadow a diabetes nurse educator to observe the teaching methods and strategies he or she uses to provide an education plan for a child with DM. Observe how the nurse educator includes the family in the plan. Are there any differences between the teaching plans for type 1 DM and type 2 DM? 4. Conduct a literature review for one of the common endocrine disorders to research current management practices. Are there evidence-based practice guidelines for nursing interventions? 5. Conduct an Internet search to research the information that is available to children and their families related to DM.28 Nursing Care of the Child With a Neoplastic Disorder Words of Wisdom Be inspired by the courage of a child with cancer and reflect it in the care you provide.

His father states, \"John seems to get fevers and colds more often than our other children. He's also very tired these days. He hardly ever wants to go out and play with his friends. He complains of headaches frequently and just doesn't really seem like himself.\" Cancer accounts for the most deaths from disease in children older than 1 year of age. Cure has been achieved in some children with childhood leukemia and other cancers, but there is no universal long-term cure available for any of the childhood cancers. However,the 5-year survival rate for all cancers in children is 80% (Baggott, 2010). Cancer is a life-threatening illness that involves emotional distress, fear of the unknown, and changes in life priorities for the child and family. Initial and ongoing diagnostic testing and the adverse effects of treatment for cancer, including chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, or other treatments, are often painful as well. Management of cancer also has a significant psychosocial impact on the child or adolescent. Children with cancer are at significant risk for depression because they have a life-threatening illness and must undergo frequent and stressful tests and treatments (National Cancer Institute, 2010a). In addition, the child often feels isolated from his or her peers, and the adolescent may have difficulty achieving independence, which is the core developmental task of the teenage years. Children and teens with cancer often demonstrate poorer school performance compared to healthy peers. Nurses caring for children with cancer need to be knowledgeable about the medical treatment of the disease (including adverse effects) and must also be particularly aware of the psychosocial and emotional impact of cancer on the child and family.CHILDHOOD CANCER VERSUS ADULT CANCER Cancers in children differ greatly from cancers in adults. Pediatric cancers most often arise from primitive embryonal (mesodermal) and neuroectodermal tissues, resulting in leukemias, lymphomas, sarcomas, or central nervous system (CNS) tumors (American Cancer Society, 2011; Larsen, 2011). This is in direct contrast to adult cancers, which mostly arise from epithelial cells, resulting in carcinomas. The most common childhood cancers, in order of frequency, are leukemia, CNS tumors, lymphoma, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilms tumor, bone tumors, and retinoblastoma. Comparison Chart 28.1 explains how cancer is different in children versus adults. In children, warning signs of cancer are most often related to changes in blood cell production or as a result of compression, infiltration, or obstruction caused by the tumor. Changes in blood cell production may result in fatigue, pallor, frequent or severe infection, or easy bruising. Infiltration, obstruction, or compression by a tumor may result in bone or abdominal pain, pain in other parts of the body, swelling, or unusual discharge.COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS Deciding on a course of medical treatment for cancer in a developing child is complicated. Some of the treatments can impair the child's growth and development. Many pediatric oncologists and cancer treatment centers are active members of the Children's Oncology Group (COG), a National Cancer Institute-supported group that approves and administers clinical trials devoted exclusively to childhood and adolescent cancer research. A clinical trial is a carefully designed research study that assesses the effectiveness of a treatment as well as its acute and long-term effects on the child. Current cancer care in children is a result of the knowledge gained through clinical trials. A clinical trial may include existing medications or treatments in combination with new drugs or may involve a different approach to sequencing or dosing of medications and treatment (Dzolganovski, 2010). COMPARISON CHART 28.1 CHILDHOOD CANCER VERSUS ADULT CANCER HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . To provide optimal outcomes, the child with cancer should be treated at an institution with multidisciplinary cancer care specialists that can provide the most advanced care available. Each case of pediatric cancer should be considered individually, with the oncologyhealth care team and the family reaching treatment decisions together, whether the treatment plan is standard or involves enrollment in a clinical trial. In the child with cancer, particularly advanced disease, the decision to provide treatment (\"let's do everything we can\") or to withhold treatment in the event of an extremely poor prognosis is extraordinarily challenging in an ethical sense. A mature older child or adolescent may have a strong desire to continue or discontinue treatment, and sometimes this desire conflicts with the parents' desires or choices. The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Bioethics (2007) recommends that decision making for older children and adolescents should include the assent of the older child or adolescent ( Box 28.1 ). BOX 28.1 AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS COMMITTEE ON BIOETHICS RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING PEDIATRIC ASSENT Give consideration to each child's developmental capacity, rationality, and autonomy. Help each child to achieve a developmentally appropriate understanding of the illness. Tell the child what he or she can expect regarding testing procedures and treatments. Assess the child's understanding of the situation and how he or she is responding. Note if there is inappropriate pressure to assent to testing or treatment. Seriously solicit the child's expression of willingness to accept the proposed plan of care. Adapted from American Academy of Pediatrics, Committee on Bioethics. (2007). Informed consent, parental permission, and assent in pediatric practice. Retrieved July 3, 2011, from http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/short/pediatrics;95/2/314 . Hospice or palliative care may be needed for the child with cancer. Children facing the end of life experience the same symptoms that adults do, including pain, fatigue, nausea, and dyspnea. Standards for end-of-life care are still in development, but all dying children have the right to die comfortably and with palliation of symptoms, as has been well established in adult hospice programs. Children's Hospice International (CHI) has demonstration models in several U.S. states that focus on enhancing the quality of life of children with life-threatening conditions. Formerly, only children with a life expectancy of less than 6 months had access to hospice care, and they were required to forego curative care to enroll in hospice. CHI's goal is to provide a comprehensive, interdisciplinary continuum of care to the child and family from the time of diagnosis with a life-threatening condition through the time of death, if cure is not achieved (CHI, 2011). For further information related to nursing care of the dying child, refer to Chapter 12 . A variety of medications and treatments are used to treat neoplastic (referring to cells that abnormally proliferate) disorders in children. Most of these treatments will require a physician's or nurse practitioner's order when the child is in the hospital. The most common treatments and medications are listed in Common Medical Treatments 28.1 and Drug Guide 28.1 . Commonly, chemotherapy and radiation therapy are used to treat childhood cancers. In some instances, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is used. The nurse caring for the child with cancer should be familiar with the procedures, how the treatments and medications work, and common nursing implications related to use of these modalities. Chemotherapy To understand how chemotherapy works to destroy cancer cells, it is necessary to review the normal cell cycle, through which all cells progress ( Fig. 28.1 ). The cell cycle consists of five phases: G0 phase: the resting phase; lasts from a few hours to a few years; cells have not started to divide G1 phase: cell makes more protein in preparation for dividing; lasts 18 to 30 hours S phase: chromosomes are copied so that newly formed cells have the appropriate DNA; lasts 18 to 20 hours G2 phase: just before the cell splits into two cells; lasts 2 to 10 hours M phase: mitosis, the actual splitting of the cell into two new cells; lasts 30 minutes to 1 hour Chemotherapy drugs work in two different ways in relation to the cell cycle. Cell cycle-specific agents exert their actions during a specific phase of the cell cycle. Cell cycle-nonspecific drugs exert their effect on the cells regardless of which phase the cell is in. Chemotherapy protocols often call for a combination of drugs that act on different phases of the cell cycle, thus maximizing the destruction of cancer cells. COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS 28.1DRUG GUIDE 28.1 COMMON DRUGS FOR NEOPLASTIC DISORDERS Chemotherapy drugs are divided into classes that exert slightly different actions and have an effect on different portions of the cell cycle. Drug Guide 28.1 gives further explanation about the different classes of chemotherapy drugs. Unfortunately, chemotherapeutic medications disrupt the cell cycle of not only cancer cells but also normal rapidly dividing cells. This results in a significant number of adverse effects. The cells most likely to be affected by chemotherapy are those in the bone marrow, the digestive tract (especially the mouth), the reproductive system, and hair follicles.FIGURE 28.1 Phases of the cell cycle. Adverse effects common to chemotherapeutic drugs include immunosuppression, infection, myelosuppression, nausea, vomiting, constipation, oral mucositis, alopecia, and pain. Long-term complications include microdontia and missing teeth as a result of damage to developing permanent teeth; hearing and vision changes; hematopoietic, immunologic, or gonadal dysfunction; endocrine dysfunction, including altered growth and precocious or delayed puberty; various alterations of the cardiorespiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary systems; and development of a second cancer as an adolescent or adult (Chordas & Graham, 2010). Take Note! Acupuncture as an adjuvant therapy has been demonstrated to significantly decrease nausea, vomiting, and aversion to chemotherapy (Rheingans, 2007). Radiation Therapy Radiation therapy uses high-energy radiation to damage or kill cancer cells. Radiant energy in either a gamma or particle form is emitted during the treatment. Radiation affects not only cancer cells but also any rapidly growing cells with which they are in contact. It may be used as a curative, adjuvant, or palliative treatment, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Radiation therapy is also used to shrink a tumor prior to surgical resection. The area to be treated is marked carefully to minimize damage to normal cells. Adverse effects of radiation therapy include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, oral mucositis, myelosuppression, and alterations in skin integrity at the site of irradiation. Long-term complications are related to the area of the body that was irradiated and include alterations in growth; hormone dysfunction; hearing and vision alterations; learning problems; pulmonary fibrosis; hepatic, sexual, or renal dysfunction; osteoporosis; and development of secondary cancer (particularly at the site of irradiation) (Loch & Khorrami, 2010). Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), also called bone marrow transplantation, is a procedure in which hematopoietic stem cells are infused intravenously into the child. This follows a period of purging of abnormal cells in the child that is accomplished through high-dose chemotherapy or irradiation. The use of high-dose chemotherapy and total body irradiation kills the tumor cells but also destroys the child's bone marrow. The transplanted cells migrate to the empty spaces in the child's bone marrow and reestablish normal hematopoiesis in the child. HSCT is used for a variety of childhood cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, brain tumors, neuroblastoma, and other solid tumors. For most pediatric cancers, it is not the first line of treatment but is used for refractory or advanced disease. Autologous HSCT is achieved through harvest and treatment of the child's own bone marrow, followed by infusion of the treated stem cells. Risk for relapse of the original disease is highest in autologous HSCT. Allogenic HSCT refers to transplantation using stem cells from another individual that are harvested from the bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood. Allogenic HSCT requires human leukocyte antibody (HLA) matching for antigen-specific sites on the leukocytes. Closely matched HLA donors maybe difficult to find from a donor listing, and sibling donors are often the closest match. The degree of match is inversely related to the risk for graft rejection and the development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In other words, the lesser the degree of HLA matching in the donor, the higher the risk for graft rejection and GVHD. GVHD occurs to at least some extent in 11% to 85% of all allogenic HSCT recipients (Kristovich & Callard, 2010). In addition to graft rejection and GVHD, additional initial complications of HSCT are infection, electrolyte imbalance, bleeding, and organ, skin, and mucous membrane toxicities. Long-term complications include impaired growth and fertility related to endocrine dysfunction, developmental delay, cataracts, pulmonary and cardiac disease, avascular necrosis of the bone, and development of secondary cancers. NURSING PROCESS OVERVIEW FOR THE CHILD WITH A NEOPLASTIC DISORDER Care of the child with a neoplastic disorder includes assessment, nursing diagnosis, planning, interventions, and evaluation. There are a number of general concepts related to the nursing process that may be applied to cancers in children. From a general understanding of the care involved for a child with cancer, the nurse can then individualize the care based on specifics for the particular child. Children with cancer often suffer many physical effects as a result of the disease and its treatment. The nurse must be diligent when assessing for these effects and should involve the parents as a reliable source for reporting the child's physical symptoms. Assessment Assessment of children with neoplastic disorders includes health history, physical examination, and laboratory and diagnostic testing. Remember John, the 4-year-old with fever, fatigue, and headaches? What additional health history and physical examination assessment information should you obtain? Health History Determine current medical history. Note history of recurrent fever or frequent infections. Inquire about bleeding tendencies, such as unusual bruising or petechiae. Note early-morning headache with nausea or vomiting, gait or behavior changes, or visual disturbances. Inquire about changes in bowel or bladder habits or decrease in appetite. Note history of bone fractures unrelated to trauma. Explore the health history for the presence of risk factors such as previous malignancy and treatment; synthetic chemical exposures; parental exposure to radiation, chemicals, or chemotherapeutic agents; and a family history of malignancy (especially childhood), immune disorders, or genetic disorders such as neurofibromatosis or Down syndrome. Physical Examination A complete physical examination should be performed on any child with, or suspected of having, cancer. Note particular findings as discussed below. INSPECTION AND OBSERVATION Observe the child's overall appearance and energy level. Note a thin or frail appearance, fatigue, or altered level of consciousness. Document visible masses or asymmetry of the face, thorax, abdomen, or extremities. Note difficulty breathing. Inspect the skin for pallor, bruising, or petechiae. Examine the oral cavity for bleeding gums or pale mucous membranes. Observe the child's gait, noting ataxia or limp. Note rectal bleeding or vaginal discharge. AUSCULTATION, PERCUSSION, AND PALPATION Auscultate the heart, lungs, and abdomen, noting any abnormalities. Percuss the abdomen, noting dullness over a mass if present. Palpate for lymphadenopathy; in particular, note nontender or firm lymph nodes. Palpate any unusual area of swelling anywhere on the body, noting size and absence of tenderness. Palpate the abdomen, noting organomegaly or presence of a mass. Note limited range of motion or pain upon palpation of extremities. Psychosocial Assessment Assess the child's and family's psychosocial status, using open-ended questions. It is particularly important to determine the child's self-esteem, level of anxiety or stress, and coping mechanisms. Determine the spiritual status of the child and family. Ongoing medical procedures and the fear of dying take a toll on the child and family. Ask the child how things are going at home; how does he or she get along with brothers, sisters, and parents? If the child is school age, ask how school is going. Does the child have friends with whom he or she gets to spend time? Ask the child what he or she does in his spare time; are there any hobbies? These types of queries will provide the nurse with information about how well the child is coping. Assess the parents' status as well. Ask about the marital relationship and how other children in the family are doing. Determine whether certain stressors may need to be addressed. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 28.1 explains the laboratory and diagnostic tests most commonly used for neoplastic disorders. The tests can assist the physician or nurse practitioner in diagnosing the disorder, or can be used as guidelines in determining treatment. Laboratory or nonnursing personnel obtain some of the tests, while the nurse might obtain others. In either instance the nurse should be familiar with how the tests are obtained, what they are used for, and normal versus abnormal results. This knowledge will also be necessary when providing child and family education about the testing. Nursing Diagnosis, Goals, Interventions, and Evaluation Upon completion of a thorough assessment, the nurse might identify several nursing diagnoses, including: Risk for infection Pain Impaiblue oral mucous membranes Nausea Imbalanced nutrition Constipation Diarrhea Risk for impaiblue skin integrity Activity intolerance Disturbed body image Situational low self-esteem Compromised family coping Anticipatory grieving After completing a nursing assessment of John, you note the following: history of recurrent infections, unusual bruising, and enlarged lymph nodes. Based on the assessment findings, what would your top three prioritized nursing diagnoses be for John? Nursing goals, interventions, and evaluation for the child with cancer are based on the nursing diagnoses. Nursing Care Plan 28.1 may be used as a guide in planning nursing care for the child with a neoplastic disorder. The care plan includes many nursing diagnoses that are applicable to the child or adolescent, but not all children will have the same effects from cancer and its treatment. Nursing care should be individualized based on the child's and family's responses to illness. Additional information about nursing management related to specific types of cancer will be included later in the chapter as it relates to specific disorders. Based on your top three nursing diagnoses for John, describe appropriate nursing interventions. PROVIDING EDUCATION Provide education to families of all children with cancer as outlined in Teaching Guidelines 28.1 . ADMINISTERING CHEMOTHERAPY All chemotherapy medications have the potential to cause toxicities in the child as well as the persons handling or preparing the medication. General guidelines related to the preparation and administration of chemotherapy include: Chemotherapy should be prepared and administered only by specially trained personnel. Personal protective equipment (PPE) in the form of double gloves and nonpermeable gowns should be worn when preparing or administering chemotherapy. If splashing is possible or a spill occurs, then a face shield and/or mask may also be necessary. Dispose of all equipment used in chemotherapy preparation and administration in a puncture-resistant container (Chordas & Graham, 2010). It is critical to calculate the chemotherapy dose correctly. Chemotherapy medication doses in children are based on body surface area (BSA). A nomogram is a commonly used device for determining BSA. To use the nomogram, draw a straight line between the child's height on the left and the child's weight on the right. The point at which the straight line crosses the center is the child's BSA expressed in meters squared ( Fig. 28.2 ). An alternative to using the nomogram is to use the following formula: BSA (m 2 ) = the centimeters] \u00d7 weight [in kilograms] divided by 3,600) (Chordas & Graham, 2010). For example, for a child 140 cm tall and weighing 30 kg: 140 \u00d7 30 = 4,200; 4,200/3,600 = 1.167; and the square root of 1.167 is 1.08. The BSA would be 1.08. MANAGING ADVERSE EFFECTS OF CHEMOTHERAPY Chemotherapy can result in multiple adverse effects. Myelosuppression leads to low blood counts in all cell lines, placing the child at risk for infection, hemorrhage, and anemia. Nausea, vomiting, and anorexia may hinder the child's growth. Alopecia and facial changes may affect the child's self-esteem ( Fig. 28.3 ). Nursing interventions related to the effects of myelosuppression, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia are discussed below. Refer to Nursing Care Plan 28.1 for nursing interventions related to altered body image. Take Note! Cooling the scalp during chemotherapy administration with the use of a cooling cap may decrease hair loss (Tomlinson & Kline, 2010). Preventing Infection. Many chemotherapeutic drugs cause significant bone marrow suppression and decreased amounts of circulating mature neutrophils (\"segs,\" or segmented neutrophils). Administer granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) as ordered to promote maturation (Brundige, 2010). Administer varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) within 72 hours of exposure to active chickenpox. If the child is actively infected with chickenpox, administer intravenous acyclovir as ordered. Children receiving treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia are at risk for opportunistic infection with Pneumocystis jiroveci, as most children are colonized with this fungus. Administer prophylactic antibiotics as ordered and teach the parents to administer them at home (Tomlinson & Kline, 2010). Teaching Guidelines 28.2 gives further information about infection prevention at home. As neutrophils are the primary means of fighting bacterial infection, when the neutrophil count is low, the chance for developing an overwhelming bacterial infection is high. Each drug that causes bone marrow suppression has a point of nadir. Nadir is the time after administration of the drug when bone marrow suppression is expected to be at its greatest and the neutrophil count is expected to be at its lowest (neutropenia). Nadir is individual for each drug and ranges from 7 to 28 days after dosing. An absolute neutrophil count (ANC) below 500 places the child at greatest risk, although an ANC below 1,500 usually warrants evaluation (Brundige, 2010). Refer to Box 28.2 for information related to calculating the absolute neutrophil count. Depending on institutional policy, precautions for neutropenia will be followed if the ANC is depressed. Precautions related to neutropenia generally include: Place the child in a private room. Perform hand hygiene before and after contact with each child. Monitor vital signs every 4 hours. Assess for signs and symptoms of infection at least every 8 hours. Avoid rectal suppositories, enemas, or examinations; urinary catheterization; and invasive procedures. Restrict visitors with fever, cough, or other signs/symptoms of infection. Do not permit raw fruits or vegetables or fresh flowers or live plants in the room. Place a mask on the child when he or she is being transported outside of the room. Perform dental care with a soft toothbrush if the platelet count is adequate. Children with neutropenia and fever must be started on intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics without delay to avoid overwhelming sepsis (Brundige, 2010). Preventing Hemorrhage. Assess for petechiae, purpura, bruising, or bleeding. Determine changes from baseline that warrant intervention. Encourage quiet activities or play to avoid trauma. Avoid rectal temperatures and examinations to avoid rectal mucosal damage that results in bleeding. Post a sign at the head of the bed stating \"no rectal temperatures or medications.\" Avoid intramuscular injections and lumbar puncture if possible to decrease the risk of bleeding from a puncture site. If bone marrow aspiration must be performed, apply a pressure dressing to the site to prevent bleeding. For active or uncontrolled bleeding, transfuse platelets as ordered to control bleeding. Preventing Anemia. To maintain blood volume, limit blood draws to the minimum volume required. Encourage the child to eat an appropriate diet that includes adequate iron. Administer erythropoietin injections as ordered. Teach families to give the injections at home if prescribed. Managing Nausea, Vomiting, and Anorexia. Many chemotherapeutic drugs produce the adverse effect of nausea and vomiting, which often leads to anorexia. The cycle of nausea, vomiting, and anorexia is difficult to break once it begins. In addition, taste alterations are common in children who have received chemotherapy. During or after chemotherapy, children may develop an aversion to a food that was previously their favorite (Tomlinson & Kline, 2010). Provide foods the child desires or asks for in order to increase the likelihood of eating. Prevent nausea by administering antiemetic medications prior to the administration of chemotherapy and on a routine schedule around the clock for the first 1 to 2 days rather than on an as-needed (PRN) basis. Herbal or complementary therapies may provide another option for management of nausea. Take Note! Ginger capsules, ginger tea, and candied ginger have been used as a nausea remedy for centuries (ginger ale is usually artificially flavored, so it would not have the same effect). Though ginger is considered safe, instruct families to check with the oncologist before using this remedy. Bright lights and noise may worsen nausea. Therefore, keep the child's environment dimly lit and calm. Relaxation therapy and guided imagery may also be helpful in preventing or treating nausea and vomiting. Refer to Nursing Care Plan 28.1 for additional interventions. Take Note! Foot massage may decrease the nausea and pain associated with chemotherapy (Post-White & Ladas, 2010). MONITORING THE CHILD RECEIVING RADIATION THERAPY Radiation causes damage to the cells in a localized area, which may include normal cells in addition to the cancerous ones. Assess the child's skin daily, particularly at the treatment site. Provide good hygiene, but perform this care gently. Encourage moisture retention in the skin by applying aqueous creams or moisturizers. Do not apply deodorants or perfumed lotions on the radiation treatment site. Avoid the use of heat or ice packs at the site. Instruct the child and family that clothing should fit loosely so as not to irritate the site (Loch & Khorrami, 2010). During, and for 8 weeks after, the radiation treatment, the skin will be more photosensitive. Explain the importance of protecting the skin with a high-SPF (30 or above) sunscreen. PROVIDING CARE TO THE CHILD UNDERGOING HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION Stem cell transplantation is performed at limited specialty medical centers in the United States. In addition, special training is required for all personnel caring for the child who undergoes a stem cell transplant. The intent of this discussion is to provide only a brief introduction to, and overview of, nursing management related to HSCT. Care for the child undergoing HSCT may be divided into three phases\u2014the pretransplant phase, the posttransplant phase, and the lengthy supportive care phase. Nursing management of each phase is briefly discussed below. Pretransplant Phase. In the pretransplant phase, the child is being prepared to receive the transplant. The child's own bone marrow cells are eradicated through high-dose chemotherapy and total body irradiation. This phase usually occurs over 7 to 10 days. The child will be hospitalized because he or she is at extreme risk for serious infection. Maintain protective isolation in a positive-pressure room and limit visitors. Administer gammaglobulin, acyclovir, or antibiotics as ordered to prevent or treat infection. Lymphohematopoietic rescue occurs with infusion of the donor or autologous cells (Norville & Tomlinson, 2010). Posttransplant Phase. The posttransplant phase is also a time of high risk for the child. Monitor closely for symptoms of GVHD such as severe diarrhea and maculopapular rash progressing to redness or desquamation of the skin (especially palms or soles) ( Fig. 28.4 ). If GVHD occurs, administer immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or mycophenolate (which place the child at further risk for infection) (Norville & Tomlinson, 2010). Supportive Care. During the supportive care phase, which lasts several months after the transplant, continue to monitor for and prevent infection. Administer packed red blood cells or platelets and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor as needed. Families and children who undergo HSCT need prolonged and extensive emotional and psychosocial support. A medical social worker and psychologist or counselor are usually members of the transplant team and are excellent resources for these families' needs (Norville & Tomlinson, 2010). PROMOTING A NORMAL LIFE Children and teens want to be normal and to experience the things that other children their age do. The child should attend school when he or she is well enough and the white blood cell counts are not dangerously low. Children, their families, and their teachers should be aware that cancer and its treatment can affect scholastic abilities. Learning disabilities, difficulty with memory, attention disorders, and cognitive deficits can occur (Tomlinson & Kline, 2010). Maintain other activities if the child is able and if platelet counts are within normal limits. Special camps are available for children with cancer. These camps offer an opportunity for children and adolescents to experience a variety of activities safely and to network with other children who are experiencing similar physical and emotional challenges (Conrad & Altmaier, 2009). The Children's Oncology Camping Association and the American Childhood Cancer Foundation provide lists ofcamps throughout the United States and Canada and internationally for children and teens with cancer. Links to these resources are provided on . PROMOTING GROWTH Promote growth in children with cancer by encouraging an appropriate diet and preventing nausea and vomiting and also by addressing concerns such as diarrhea and constipation. Chronic diarrhea related to radiation therapy may prevent the child from gaining weight and growing properly (see Nursing Care Plan 28.1 ). The use of vinca alkaloids and opioids, as well as the decreased activity level of the child with cancer, may contribute to constipation. Constipation increases the pain experience, contributes to the child's malaise, and decreases quality of life. It directly affects the child's ability to grow by increasing anorexia, nausea, and vomiting (Tomlinson & Kline, 2010). Nursing Care Plan 28.1 details interventions related to preventing and managing constipation. PREVENTING AND TREATING ONCOLOGIC EMERGENCIES Oncologic emergencies may occur as an effect of the disease process itself or from cancer treatment. As progress is made in chemotherapy and radiation treatment, children with cancer have an increased survival rate, but they still face the risk of developing an oncologic emergency. Nurses caring for children with cancer need to be familiar with signs and symptoms of oncologic emergencies as well as with their treatment. All of these problems warrant careful, frequent monitoring of respiratory, cardiovascular, neurologic, and renal status. Table 28.1 provides information about oncologic emergencies. CARING FOR THE DYING CHILD Among children in the United States diagnosed with cancer, over 2,200 will die from the disease each year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007). A \"do not resuscitate\" (DNR) order for the child with progressive cancer is obtained in many situations. This order helps to optimize care in the terminal phase of cancer. Nurses serve as child and family advocates, clarifying terminology and providing support as needed during the discussion of DNR orders and throughout the rest of the terminal phase. Children with terminal cancer often experience a great deal of pain, particularly when death is imminent. Pain is often accompanied by agitation and dyspnea, which further contribute to the child's discomfort. Whether the child has a DNR order or his or her status remains that of \"full code,\" pain management is central to the nursing care of the child who is dying from cancer. The Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses' position paper entitled \"Pain Management for the Child With Cancer in End-of-Life Care\" outlines the following recommendations for managing children's pain at the end of life: Prevention and alleviation of pain is a primary goal of care in the child dying of cancer. Children and parents are equal partners with members of the health care team in managing the child's pain. Children dying of cancer may require aggressive dosing of analgesics. Medications that do not have a dose maximum should be escalated, sometimes rapidly, to achieve adequate pain control or to maintain pain control when tolerance has occurred. The nurse's role in caring for children who are in pain at the end of life includes assessment, identifying expected outcomes, and planning, performing, and evaluating interventions (Hooke, Hellsten, Stutzer, & Forte, 2002). Interventions related to pain management may be found in Nursing Care Plan 28.1 . Further discussion related to care of the dying child is found in Chapter 12 . COMMON LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS 28.1 NURSING CARE PLAN 28.1 Overview for the Child With a Neoplastic Disorder Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will not experience overwhelming infection: will be free from infection or able to recover if he or she becomes infected. Interventions: Preventing Infection Assess for fever, pain, cough, tachypnea, adventitious breath sounds, skin ulceration, stomatitis, and perirectal fissures to identify potential infection. Administer antibiotics for temperature greater than 38.4\u00b0C to decrease likelihood of overwhelming sepsis. Maintain meticulous hand-washing procedures (including family, visitors, staff) to minimize spread of infectious organisms. Maintain isolation as prescribed to minimize exposure to infectious organisms. Avoid rectal temperatures and examinations, intramuscular injections, and urinary catheterization when child is neutropenic to decrease possibility of introducing microorganisms. Educate family and visitors that child should be restricted from contact with known infectious exposures (in hospital and at home) to encourage cooperation with infection control. Strictly observe medical asepsis to avoid unintentional introduction of microorganisms. Promote nutrition and appropriate rest to maximize body's potential to heal. Inform family to contact the physician or nurse practitioner if child has known exposure to chickenpox or measles so that preventive measures (e.g., varicella zoster immunoglobulin [VZIG],) can be taken. Administer vaccines (not live) as prescribed (after clearance with oncologist) to prevent common childhood communicable diseases. Teach family to monitor for fever at home and report temperature elevations to oncologist immediately so that antibiotic therapy may be instituted as soon as possible. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Pain related to invasive diagnostic testing, surgical procedure, neuropathy, disease progression, or adverse effects of treatment as evidenced by verbalization of pain, elevated pain scale ratings, guarding, withdrawal from play or refusal to participate in activities of daily living, or physiologic indicators such as elevated heart rate, diaphoresis, muscle tension or rigidity Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will demonstrate pain relief in amount sufficient to allow participation in play, activities of daily living, or therapeutic interventions. Use the age-appropriate pain scale to set the goal and set a time frame for achievement of the goal. Interventions: Promoting Comfort Determine level of pain using child interview, pain scale, and assessment of physiologic variables to determine baseline. Document location, intensity, and description of pain to determine baseline. Discuss with the child and parent techniques that have helped alleviate pain in the past to incorporate successful interventions into the plan of care. Administer acetaminophen for mild pain: avoid salicylate and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs due to increased risk for bleeding. Administer medications as ordered using the least invasive method possible to avoid pain (intramuscular, subcutaneous, and rectal route should be avoided in the child with thrombocytopenia). Monitor frequently for adverse effects (particularly respiratory effects) of opioid analgesics, as opioids reduce responsiveness of carbon dioxide receptors in the brain's respiratory center. Use nonpharmacologic measures such as play therapy, games, TV, guided breathing, imagery, hypnosis, or meditation as appropriate: distracts child's attention from the pain. Use massage, positioning, or heat to relieve pain in a particular area. Use EMLA before needlesticks and conscious sedation with lumbar puncture and bone marrow aspiration to reduce recurrent acute painful episodes associated with frequent blood draws and diagnostic/treatment procedures. Have the child lie flat for 30 minutes after a lumbar puncture and increase fluid intake for 24 hours after the procedure to decrease incidence of headache. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Impaired oral mucous membranes related to chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunocompromise, decreased platelet count,malnutrition, or dehydration as evidenced by oral lesions, ulcers, plaques, hyperemia or bleeding, difficulty eating or swallowing, or complaint of oral discomfort Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will maintain intact, moist mucosa free from redness, ulceration, or debris. Interventions: Restoring Healthy Oral Mucosa Frequently assess oral cavity for redness, lesions, ulcers, plaques, or bleeding to provide baseline for comparison and identify alterations early. Offer ice chips frequently while child is NPO to maintain hydration of mucosa. Use only a soft toothbrush or toothette for dental care, avoiding excessive pressure with brushing, to decrease incidence of bleeding with mouth care. Keep lips lubricated with petroleum jelly or fragrance-free lip balm to maintain moist, hydrated lips. Rinse with salt solution or mouthwash every 1 to 2 hours to keep oral cavity clean and moist. Administer glutamine and/or P-carotene supplements, which have been shown to decrease the incidence and severity of mucositis. Have child swish and spit 1:1 Benadryl/Maalox solution to decrease pain. Administer antifungal solution to prevent or treat oral candidiasis. Avoid spicy, acidic, or very hot or very cold foods to decrease pain. Administer pain medication (usually acetaminophen or codeine) as ordered to decrease pain. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Nausea related to adverse effects of chemotherapy or radiation therapy as evidenced by verbalization of nausea, increased salivation, swallowing movements, or vomiting Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will experience decreased nausea: will verbalize symptom relief and will be free from vomiting. Interventions: Alleviating Nausea and Vomiting Administer antiemetics prior to chemotherapy and as needed thereafter to decrease frequency of nausea. Assess frequency of vomiting and level of hydration to provide baseline data and recognize alterations early. Offer frequent, smaller meals or snacks: smaller amounts are less likely to be vomited. Avoid spicy foods to avoid stomach upset. Allow bubbles to dissipate from carbonated beverages before they are ingested: carbonation may contribute to nausea. Remove cover from meal tray before entering child's room: this will allow the food odor to dissipate outside of the room; food odors may trigger nausea and vomiting. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements related to anorexia, nausea, vomiting, or mucosal irritation associated with chemotherapy or radiation as evidenced by decreased oral intake and weight, length/height, and/or body mass index (BMI) below average for age or individual child's usual measures Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will improve nutritional intake, resulting in steady increase in weight and length/height. Interventions: Promoting Adequate Nutrition Determine body weight and length/height norm for age or find out what the child's pretreatment measurements were to determine goal to work toward. Determine child's food preferences and provide favorite foods as able to increase the likelihood that the child will consume adequate amounts of foods. Administer antiemetics as ordered to increase the likelihood that the child will retain the food he or she ingests. Weigh child daily or weekly (according to physician order or institutional standard) and measure length/height weekly to monitor for growth. Offer highest-calorie meals at the time of day when the child's appetite is the greatest to increase likelihood of increased caloric intake. Provide increased-calorie shakes or puddings within diet restriction: high-calorie foods increase weight gain. Administer vitamin and mineral supplements as prescribed to attain/maintain vitamin and mineral balance in the body. Administer total parenteral nutrition and intravenous lipids as ordered to provide adequate nutrition for healing. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Constipation related to effects of vinca alkaloids, opioid use, decreased activity, and dietary changes as evidenced by hard stool or stool that is difficult to pass Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child's bowel function will return to usual pattern: child will pass a formed, soft stool every day (or modify this criterion according to child's usual pattern). Interventions: Preventing or Managing Constipation Ensure that child increases fluid intake to provide enough water in the intestines for soft stool formation. Increase fiber in the diet to provide bulk for stool formation. Administer stool softeners such as mineral oil or docusate sodium: these help soften the stool, aiding in passage. Provide motivator laxatives such as magnesium hydroxide, lactulose, or sorbitol to stimulate stool passage. Use stimulant laxatives such as senna or bisacodyl only intermittently rather than on a daily basis to avoid dependency and diarrhea. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Diarrhea related to effects of radiation therapy as evidenced by loose or watery stools, possibly frequent Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child's bowel function will return to usual pattern: child will pass a formed, soft stool daily (or modify this criterion according to child's usual pattern). Interventions: Managing Diarrhea Assess frequency of diarrhea and level of hydration to provide data about severity. Obtain weight daily on same scale to determine extent of fluid loss. Maintain accurate intake and output records to determine extent of fluid loss. Administer oral rehydration solutions or intravenous fluids as ordered to maintain or restore adequate hydration. Restrict roughage and residue in diet to decrease likelihood of diarrhea. Avoid milk products during acute diarrheal phase: lactose often worsens diarrhea. Provide an elemental diet to relieve symptoms: absorbed in the upper small bowel. Provide meticulous perineal care to avoid skin breakdown related to frequent or loose stools. Administer antidiarrheal medications if ordered to decrease frequency of stools. If severe and related to radiation therapy, a 3- to 4-day rest period from radiation may be required to begin recovery of normal absorptive capabilities of bowel. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for impaired skin integrity related to radiation therapy Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child's skin will remain intact: areas of redness in radiation field will not progress to desquamation. Interventions: Promoting Skin Integrity Assess skin frequently for erythema, erosions, ulcers, or blisters to provide baseline data and intervene early if skin is impaired. Use a mild soap for cleansing and pat dry rather than rubbing to avoid skin irritation. Use aloe vera lotion to moisturize the skin. Avoid perfumed lotions, soaps, heat, cold, or sun, as these will further irritate the skin in the irradiated area. Do not scrub ink from marked radiation field, and avoid adhesive tape in that area, to avoid further skin irritation. Administer diphenhydramine or apply hydrocortisone 1% cream to reduce itching and urge to scratch. For areas of desquamation related to radiation, apply Silvadene cream once or twice a day to hasten skin repair. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Activity intolerance related to treatment adverse effects, anemia, or generalized weakness as evidenced by verbalization of weakness or fatigue; elevation of heart rate, respiratory rate, or blood pressure with activity; complaint of shortness of breath with play or activity Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will display increased activity tolerance: desire to play without developing symptoms of exertion. Interventions: Promoting Activity Encourage activity or ambulation per physician's orders: early mobilization results in better outcomes. Observe child for symptoms of activity intolerance such as pallor, nausea, lightheadedness or dizziness, or changes in vital signs to determine level of tolerance. If child is on bed rest, perform range-of-motion exercises and frequent position changes: negative changes to the musculoskeletal system occur quickly with inactivity and immobility. Cluster nursing care activities and plan for periods of rest before and after exertion to decrease oxygen need and consumption. Refer the child to physical therapy for exercise prescription to increase skeletal muscle strength. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Disturbed body image related to hair loss as evidenced by verbalization of dissatisfaction with appearance Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child or adolescent will display appropriate body image: will look at self in mirror and participate in social activities. Interventions: Promoting Body Image Acknowledge the child's feelings of anger over body changes and illness: venting feelings is associated with less body image disturbance. Encourage the child or teen to choose a wig or hats and scarves to involve the child in making decisions about appearance. Support the child's or teen's choices of comfortable, fashionable clothing to disguise weight loss or scarring while promoting self-esteem. Involve the child in the decision-making process, as a sense of control will improve body image. Encourage the child to spend time with peers who have experienced hair, limb, or weight loss, as peers' opinions are often better accepted than those of persons in authority, such as parents or health care professionals. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for situational low self-esteem related to loss of control and inability to progress with quest for independence (adolescents) Outcome Identification and Evaluation Adolescent will maintain or increase self-esteem: will display increased coping responses and verbalize control as appropriate as well as discuss plans for future. Interventions: Promoting Self-Esteem Identify the adolescent's positive abilities to promote self-esteem. Give genuine and honest positive feedback, as the child or adolescent desires honesty. Explore strengths and weaknesses with the adolescent: helps the teen to see similarities and differences with healthy peers of the same age. Encourage the teen to perform self-care as possible to promote independence. Offer emotional support: reduces psychological distress and increases coping abilities. Encourage participation in a support group to allow teens to discuss body changes and the reactions they perceive in others. When the adolescent is physically able, encourage attendance at camp or an adventure/wilderness event: these programs have been shown to improve mental health and coping skills. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Compromised family coping related to potentially life-threatening illness and stressors involved with cancer treatment Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child and/or family will demonstrate adequate coping skills: will verbalize feeling supported and demonstrate healthy family interactions. Interventions: Promoting Child and Family Coping Provide emotional support to the child and family: improves coping abilities. Actively listen to the child's and family's concerns: validates their feelings and establishes trust. Provide open communication with the child and siblings: children appreciate honesty about their illness, and coping is improved. Refer families to community resources such as parent support groups and grief counseling: such support improves coping abilities. Give terminally ill children permission to discuss their feelings about their illness, allowing them to conquer fears and express love for their family and friends. Encourage families to be honest with siblings about the treatment and prognosis of the child with cancer: children often sense what is going on and cope better when they are prepared and are given an honest explanation of events. Prepare siblings for the death of the child with cancer, using the child life specialist and chaplain as necessary: the bereavement period is eased when siblings are prepared. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Anticipatory grieving (family) related to diagnosis of cancer in a child and impending loss of child as evidenced by crying, disbelief of diagnosis, and expressions of grief Outcome Identification and Evaluation Family will express feelings of grief: seek help in dealing with feelings, plan for future one day at the time. Intervention: Supporting the Grieving Family Use therapeutic communication with open-ended questions to encourage an open and trusting relationship for better communication. Actively listen to the family's expression of grief: just being present and listening conveys support. Encourage the family to cry and express feelings away from the child to work through feelings while not upsetting the child. Assess for spiritual distress and refer the family to the hospital chaplain or clergy of choice for support. Educate the family about the child's condition honestly: knowing what is going on, what is to be expected, and what the treatment plan is gives the family a sense of control. Support the family through discussions with the child about anticipated death when the illness is deemed terminal. Teaching Guidelines 28.1 EDUCATION FOR FAMILIES OF CHILDREN WITH CANCER Obtain a printed or written copy of the child's treatment plan. Keep a calendar of all appointment times, blood count lab draw days, and phone numbers of all physicians and nurse practitioners, home care companies, the laboratory, and the hospital. Seek medical care IMMEDIATELY if the child's temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (101\u00b0F) or higher. Call the oncologist or seek medical care if any of the following occur: Cough or rapid breathing Increased bruising, bleeding or petechiae, pallor, or increased levels of fatigue Earache, sore throat, nuchal rigidity Blisters, rashes, ulcers Red, irritated skin on the child's buttocks Abdominal pain, difficulty or pain with eating, drinking, or swallowing Constipation or diarrhea For children with central venous catheters: Pus, redness, or swelling at the site Breakage of the catheter Do not give the child aspirin.

EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 28.1 NONPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPIES FOR SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT IN CHILDHOOD CANCER STUDY Even with significant advances in childhood cancer surgery and treatment, troublesome symptoms remain a large problem. Children report that the most upsetting aspect of cancer treatment is the numerous side effects they suffer. The author performed a systematic review of research studies that evaluated the use of complementary and alternative therapies for cancer treatment side effect management. Forty-one studies were reviewed that addressed such topics as procedural pain, distress, fear and anxiety, nausea/vomiting, anxiety, distress, and depression. Nonpharmacologic adjunctive therapies evaluated in the studies included hypnosis, distraction, cognitive behavioral therapies, relaxation, imagery, breathing, music therapy, play, self-hypnosis, acupuncture, art therapy, coping skills training, hand holding, humor, and nonessential touch. Findings Many of the nonpharmacologic adjuvant therapies studies were found to be effective for symptom relief. Cognitive behavioral therapy, distraction, and hypnosis were particularly helpful. Although safety concerns for various therapies were not reported, the author proposed that further rigorous research on these modalities is necessary. Nursing Implications Many families will be seeking nonpharmacologic or complementary/alternative therapies for relieving the distressing symptoms associated with cancer treatment. Nurses must keep an open mind about these therapies. When families have questions about using these treatments, they should be directed to authorities in the area. Nurses are in a perfect position to initiate additional rigorous research to determine the effectiveness and long-term safety of these therapies. Adapted from Rheingans, J. I. (2007).

Brandt, MD) LEUKEMIA Leukemia accounts for about one third of all childhood cancers (Zupanec & Tomlinson, 2010). It is a primary disorder of the bone marrow in which the normal elements are replaced with abnormal white blood cells. Normally, lymphoid cells grow and develop into lymphocytes, and myeloid cells grow and develop into red blood cells, granulocytes, monocytes, and platelets. Leukemia may develop at any time during the usual stages of normal lymphoid or myeloid development. Leukemia may be classified as acute or chronic, lymphocytic or myelogenous. Acute leukemias are rapidly progressive diseases affecting the undifferentiated or immature cells; the result is cells without normal function. Chronic leukemias progress more slowly, permitting maturation and differentiation of cells so that they retain some of their normal function. Acute leukemias, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), make up a significant majority of all cases of leukemia in children and adolescents (Zupanec & Tomlinson, 2010). Therefore, they will be the focus of the discussion below. Complications of leukemia include metastasis (spread of cancer to other sites) to the blood, bone, CNS, spleen, liver, or other organs and alterations in growth. Late effects include problems with neurocognitive function and ocular, cardiovascular, or thyroid dysfunction. With advances in treatment over the past 50 years, most cases of childhood leukemia are curable. However, children who experience relapse or present with advanced disease have a poorer prognosis (Zupanec & Tomlinson, 2010). Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ALL is the most common form of cancer in children. Eighty-five percent of cases of ALL occur in children between 2 and 10 years of age (Maloney et al., 2011). It is more common in white children than in other races. ALL is classified according to the type of cells involved\u2014T cell, B cell, early pre-B cell, or pre-B cell. Most children will achieve initial remission if appropriate treatment is given. The overall cure rate of ALL is over 70% (Maloney et al., 2011). Prognosis is based on the white blood cell (WBC) count at diagnosis, the type of cytogenetic factors and immunophenotype, the age at diagnosis, and the extent of extramedullary involvement. Generally, the higher the WBC count at diagnosis, the worse the prognosis. Children between 1 and 9 years of age and with a white blood cell count less than 50,000 at diagnosis have the best prognosis. When a child experiences a relapse, the prognosis becomes poorer. Complications include infection, hemorrhage, poor growth, and CNS, bone, or testicular involvement. Take Note! Growth hormone replacement therapy using recombinant human growth hormone may improve the long-term growth of children with leukemia (Zupanec & Tomlinson, 2010). Pathophysiology The exact cause of ALL remains unknown. Genetic factors and chromosome abnormalities may play a role in its development. In ALL, abnormal lymphoblasts abound in the blood-forming tissues. The lymphoblasts are fragile and immature, lacking the infection- fighting capabilities of the normal WBC. The growth of lymphoblasts is excessive and the abnormal cells replace the normal cells in the bone marrow. The proliferating leukemic cells demonstrate massive metabolic needs, depriving normal body cells of needed nutrients and resulting in fatigue, weight loss or growth arrest, and muscle wasting. The bone marrow becomes unable to maintain normal levels of red blood cells, WBCs, and platelets, so anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia result. As the bone marrow expands or the leukemic cells infiltrate the bone, joint and bone pain may occur. The leukemic cells may permeate the lymph nodes, causing diffuse lymphadenopathy, or the liver and spleen, resulting in hepatosplenomegaly. With spread to the CNS, vomiting, headache, seizures, coma, vision alterations, or cranial nerve palsies may occur (Zupanec & Tomlinson, 2010). Take Note! Changes in behavior or personality, headache, irritability, dizziness, persistent nausea or vomiting, seizures, gait changes, lethargy, or altered level of consciousness may indicate CNS infiltration with leukemic cells. Immediately report these findings to the pediatric oncologist. Therapeutic Management Therapeutic management of the child with ALL focuses on giving chemotherapy to eradicate the leukemic cells and restore normal bone marrow function. Treatment is divided into three stages. CNS prophylaxis is provided at each stage; without CNS prophylaxis, leukemia would spread to the CNS in up to 50% of children with ALL (Zupanec & Tomlinson, 2010). The length of treatment andchoice of medications are based on the child's age, risk category, and subtype determined by bone marrow analysis. Table 28.2 discusses the stages of leukemia treatment. For relapsed or less responsive leukemia, HSCT may be necessary. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 1029 . Assessment findings pertinent to ALL are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Fever (may be persistent or recurrent, with unknown cause) Recurrent infection Fatigue, malaise, or listlessness Pallor Unusual bleeding or bruising Abdominal pain Nausea or vomiting Bone pain Headache (Zupanec & Tomlinson, 2010) Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as: Male gender Age 2 to 5 years Caucasian race Down syndrome, Shwachman syndrome, or ataxia-telangiectasia X-ray exposure in utero Previous radiation-treated cancer (Zupanec & Tomlinson, 2010) Determine the child's history of varicella zoster immunization or disease. Chickenpox infection in the leukemic child may lead to disseminated, overwhelming infection. Physical Examination Take the child's temperature (fever may be present), and look for petechiae, purpura, or unusual bruising (due to decreased platelet levels). Inspect the skin for signs of infection. Auscultate the lungs, noting adventitious breath sounds, which may indicate pneumonia (present at diagnosis or due to immunosuppression during treatment). Note location and size of enlarged lymph nodes. Palpate theliver and spleen for enlargement. Document tenderness on abdominal palpation. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of ALL include: Complete blood counts: abnormal findings include low hemoglobin and hematocrit, decreased red blood cell count, decreased platelet count, and elevated, normal, or decreased WBC count Peripheral blood smear may reveal blasts. Bone marrow aspiration: stained smear from bone marrow aspiration will show greater than 25% lymphoblasts. Bone marrow aspirate is also examined for immunophenotyping (lymphoid vs. myeloid, and level of cancer cell maturity) and cytogenetic analysis (determines abnormalities in chromosome number and structure). Immunopheotyping and cytogenetic analysis are used in the classification of the leukemia, which helps guide treatment. Lumbar puncture will reveal whether leukemic cells have infiltrated the CNS. Liver function tests and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels determine liver and renal function, which, if abnormal, may preclude treatment with certain chemotherapeutic agents. Chest radiography may reveal pneumonia or a mediastinal mass. A traumatic Care The child with leukemia undergoes frequent implantable port accesses for blood draws and chemotherapy, bone marrow aspirations for assessment of blood cell status, and lumbar punctures for laboratory studies and intrathecal medication administration. To decrease trauma produced by these repetitive painful procedures, utilize EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) cream appropriately. Teach the child's primary caregiver to apply the cream to the implantable port site 30 minutes to 1 hour prior to the child's clinic appointment time. Apply EMLA cream to the posterior hip or lumbar spine, 1 to 3 hours prior to bone marrow aspiration or lumbar puncture. Nursing Management Nursing care of children with ALL focuses on managing disease complications such as infection, pain, anemia, bleeding, and hyperuricemia and the many adverse effects related to treatment. Many children require blood product transfusion for the treatment of severe anemia or low platelet levels with active bleeding. Individualize nursing care based on the diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes presented in Nursing Care Plan 28.1 , depending on the child's response to the disease and chemotherapy. Refer to the nursing process overview section for further information related to managing the adverse effects of chemotherapy. Take Note! Blood products administered to children with any type of leukemia should be irradiated, cytomegalovirus (CMV) negative, and leukodepleted. This treatment of blood products before transfusion will decrease the amount of antibodies in the blood, an important factor in preventing GVHD should HSCT become necessary at a later date (Nixon, 2010). Reducing Pain Children and teens with leukemia suffer pain related to the disease as well as the treatment. Chemotherapy drugs commonly used in leukemia may cause peripheral neuropathy and headache. Lumbar puncture and bone marrow aspiration, which are periodically performed throughout the course of treatment, also cause pain. The most common areas of pain are the head and neck, legs, and abdomen (probably from protracted vomiting with chemotherapy). Use distraction techniques, such as listening to music, watching TV, or playing games, to help take the child's mind off the pain. Administer mild analgesics such as acetaminophen for acute episodes of pain. Using EMLA cream prior to venipuncture, port access, lumbar puncture, and bone marrow aspiration may decrease procedure-related pain events. In addition, applying heat or cold to the painful area is usually acceptable. Administer narcotic analgesics, as prescribed, for episodes of acute severe pain or for palliation of chronic pain (Simon, 2010). Acute Myelogenous Leukemia AML is the second most common type of leukemia in children (Zupanec & Tomlinson, 2010). Its incidence peaks during theadolescent years (Zupanec & Tomlinson, 2010). AML affects the myeloid cell progenitors or precursors in the bone marrow, resulting in malignant (invasive and fast-growing) cells. The French-American-British (FAB) classification system identifies eight subtypes of AML (MO to M7), depending on myeloid lineage involved and the degree of cell differentiation. These subtypes are useful for determining treatment. The overall survival rate for childhood AML is 50% to 70% (Maloney et al., 2011). Complications include treatment resistance, infection, hemorrhage, and metastasis. The induction phase of AML requires intense bone marrow suppression and prolonged hospitalization because AML is less responsive to treatment than ALL. Toxicity from treatment is more common in AML and is likely to be more serious than with ALL. Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics and prophylactic platelet transfusions may be prescribed. After remission is achieved, children require intensive chemotherapy to prolong the duration of remission. HSCT is often required in children with AML, depending on the subtype (Zupanec & Tomlinson, 2010). Take Note! At the time of diagnosis, some children with AML present with a WBC count above 100,000 (hyperleukocytosis); this results in venous stasis and backup of blast cells in small vessels, causing hypoxia, hemorrhage, and lung or brain infarction. Hyperleukocytosis is a medical emergency. These children require leukapheresis to decrease hyperviscosity by quickly decreasing the number of circulating blasts (Maloney et al., 2011). Nursing Assessment Explore the health history for common signs and symptoms, including recurrent infections, fever, or fatigue. Explore the medical history for risk factors, such as Hispanic race, previous chemotherapy, and genetic abnormalities such as Down syndrome, Fanconi anemia, neurofibromatosis type I, Shwachman syndrome, Bloom syndrome, and familial monosomy 7. Perform a thorough physical examination. Note skin pallor and salmon-colored or blue-gray papular lesions. Palpate the skin for subcutaneous rubbery nodules. Palpate for lymphadenopathy. Note headache, visual disturbance, or signs of increased intracranial pressure, such as vomiting, which may indicate CNS involvement. Upon diagnosis of AML, the child's WBC count is typically extremely elevated. Bone marrow aspiration will reveal greater than 20% blast cells (Zupanec & Tomlinson, 2010). Nursing Management Nursing management of the child with AML is similar to that of the child with ALL. Nursing interventions focus on managing the adverse effects of treatment and preventing infection. Refer to the nursing process overview section and to Nursing Care Plan 28.1 for appropriate interventions.LYMPHOMAS Lymphomas, or tumors of the lymph tissue (lymph nodes, thymus, spleen), account for about 10% to 15% of cases of childhood cancer (Maloney et al., 2011). Lymphomas may be divided into two categories\u2014Hodgkin disease (or Hodgkin lymphoma) and non- Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), which includes more than a dozen types. Hodgkin disease tends to affect lymph nodes located closer to the body's surface, such as those in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas, whereas NHL tends to affect lymph nodes located more deeply inside the body. Hodgkin Disease In Hodgkin disease, malignant B lymphocytes grow in the lymph tissue, usually starting in one general area of lymph nodes. The presence of Reed-Sternberg cells (giant transformed B lymphocytes with one or two nuclei) differentiates Hodgkin disease from other lymphomas. As the cells multiply, the lymph nodes enlarge, compressing nearby structures, destroying normal cells, and invading other tissues. The cause of Hodgkin disease is still being researched, but there appears to be a link to Epstein-Barr virus infection (Zupanec, 2010). Hodgkin disease is rare in children younger than 5 years of age and is most common in adolescents and young adults; in children 14 years and younger, it is more common in boys than girls (Zupanec, 2010). In addition to the traditional staging (I through IV, depending on the amount of spread; Table 28.3 ), Hodgkin is also classified as A (asymptomatic) or B (presence of symptoms of fever, night sweats, or weight loss of 10% or more). Prognosis depends on the stage of the disease, tumor bulk, and A or B classification (disease classified as A generally carries a better prognosis). Overall, children with Hodgkin disease have a 75% 20-year survival rate (Maloney et al., 2011). Complications of Hodgkin disease include liver failure and secondary cancer such as acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and NHL. Chemotherapy, usually with a combination of drugs, is the treatment of choice for children with Hodgkin disease. Radiation therapy may also be necessary. In the child with disease that does not go into remission or in the child who experiences relapse, HSCT may be an option. Nursing Assessment Explore the health history for common signs and symptoms, which may include recent weight loss, fever, drenching night sweats, anorexia, malaise, fatigue, or pruritus. Elicit the health history, determining risk factors such as prior Epstein-Barr virus infection, family history of Hodgkin disease, genetic immune disorder, or HIV infection. Evaluate respiratory status, as the presence of a mediastinal mass may compromise respiration. Palpate for enlarged lymph nodes; they may feel rubbery and tend to occur in clusters (most common sites are cervical and supraclavicular) ( Fig. 28.5 ). Palpate the abdomen for hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, which may be present with advanced disease. The chest radiograph may reveal a mediastinal mass. The complete blood count may be normal or reflect anemia. Tissue sampling will reveal Reed-Sternberg cells. Take Note! Significant pain in the affected lymph nodes has sometimes been noted after alcohol ingestion (Zupanec, 2010). FIGURE 28.5 Hodgkin lymphoma. Large, fixed cervical masses in a 14-year-old with weight loss. (Used with permission from Chung, E. K., Atkinson-McEvoy, L. R., Boom, J. A. & Matz, P. S. (2010). Visual diagnosis and treatment in pediatrics (2nd ed.). Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.) Nursing Management Nursing management of the child with Hodgkin lymphoma focuses on addressing the adverse effects of chemotherapy or radiation. Refer to the nursing process overview section and Nursing Care Plan 28.1 to develop an individualized nursing care plan based on the child's response to treatment. Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma NHL results from mutations in the B and T lymphocytes that lead to uncontrolled growth. NHL tends to affect lymph nodes located more deeply within the body. NHL spreads by the bloodstream and in children is a rapidly proliferating, aggressive malignancy that is very responsive to treatment. Prognosis depends on the cell type involved and the extent of the disease at diagnosis. Ninety percent of children with localized NHL have disease-free long-term survival after treatment (Maloney et al., 2011). Complications include metastasis and the development of a secondary malignancy later in life. Remission is induced with chemotherapy and followed with a maintenance phase of chemotherapy lasting about 2 years. NHL tends to spread easily to the CNS, so CNS prophylaxis similar to that used in leukemia is warranted (Zupanec, 2010). Autologous bone marrow transplantation may be used in some children. Nursing Assessment Children with NHL are usually symptomatic for only a few days or a few weeks before diagnosis because the disease progresses so quickly. Note onset and location of pain or lymph node swelling. Document history of abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation. Explore the health history for risk factors such as congenital or acquired immune deficiency. Observe for increased work of breathing, facial edema, or venous engorgement (mediastinal mass). Palpate for the presence of lymphadenopathy and palpate the abdomen for the presence of a mass. Lymph node biopsy and bone marrow aspiration determine the diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT) scan, chest radiography, and bone marrow results may be used to determine the extent of metastasis. Take Note! Cough, dyspnea, orthopnea, facial edema, or venous engorgement may indicate mediastinal disease in the child with NHL. This is an emergency requiring rapid treatment (Maloney et al., 2011).Nursing Management As with Hodgkin lymphoma, nursing management of NHL is directed toward managing the adverse effects of chemotherapy. Refer to the nursing process overview section and Nursing Care Plan 28.1 to plan nursing care for the child and family based on the responses they exhibit.BRAIN TUMORS Brain tumors are the most common form of solid tumor and the second most common type of cancer in children (Maloney et al., 2011). Slightly more than half of brain tumors arise in the posterior fossa (infratentorial); the rest are supratentorial in origin. The cause of brain tumors in children is unknown. Some tumors are localized (low grade), while others are of higher grade and more invasive. The prognosis depends on the location of the tumor and extent of tumor. Low-grade tumors and those that are fully resectable have a better prognosis than tumors that are located deeper within the brain or are more invasive, making them difficult to resect (Kline & O'Hanlon-Curry, 2010). There are many different types of childhood brain tumors; Table 28.4 explains the most common ones. Complications of brain tumors include hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure, brain stem herniation, and negative effects of radiation such as neuropsychological, intellectual, and endocrinologic sequelae (Kline & O'Hanlon-Curry, 2010; Maloney et al., 2011). Pathophysiology Though the cause of brain tumors is generally not known, the effects of brain tumors are predictable. As the tumor grows within the cranium, it exerts pressure on the brain tissues surrounding it. The tumor mass may compress vital structures in the brain, block cerebrospinal fluid flow, or cause edema in the brain. The result is an increase in intracranial pressure. Presenting symptoms vary according to location and type of tumor. Therapeutic Management The type of tumor may be identified at the time of surgery. The location of the tumor within the brain will determine the extent to which it can safely be resected. Children with hydrocephalus may require a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (see Chapter 16 for further information on hydrocephalus). Radiation is reserved for children older than age 2 years because it can have long-term neurocognitive effects (Maloney et al., 2011). Chemotherapy is being used increasingly in the treatment of pediatric brain tumors in an attempt to avoid the use of radiation therapy. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 1029 . Assessment findings pertinent to CNS tumors are discussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. Common signs and symptoms reported during the health history might include: Nausea or vomiting Headache Unsteady gait Blurred or double vision Seizures Motor abnormality or hemiparesis Weakness, atrophy Swallowing difficulties Behavior or personality changes Irritability, failure to thrive, or developmental delay (in very young children) Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as history of neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, or prior treatment for CNS leukemia. Physical Examination INSPECTION AND OBSERVATION Observe for strabismus or nystagmus, \"sunsetting\" eyes, head tilt, alterations in coordination, gait disturbance, or alterations in sensation. Note alteration in gag reflex, cranial nerve palsy, lethargy, or irritability. Note the child's posture. Check pupillary reaction, noting size, equality, reaction to light, and accommodation. PALPATION Measure blood pressure, which may decrease with increasing intracranial pressure. In the infant, palpate the anterior fontanel for bulging. Assess deep tendon reflexes, noting hyperreflexia. Take Note! A fixed and dilated pupil is a neurosurgical emergency. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of CNS tumors include: CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography (PET) will demonstrate evidence of the tumor and its location within the intracranial cavity. Lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid cell evaluation may show tumor markers or the presence of -fetoprotein or human chorionic gonadotropin, which may assist in the diagnosis. Nursing Management Nursing management of the child with a brain tumor includes preoperative and postoperative care, as well as interventions to manage adverse effects related to chemotherapy and radiation. Refer to the nursing process overview section for a discussion of nursing interventions related to chemotherapy adverse effects. Nursing Care Plan 28.1 provides additional interventions that may be individualized depending on the child's response to the brain tumor and its treatment. Providing Preoperative Care Preoperatively, care focuses on monitoring for additional increases in intracranial pressure and avoiding activities that cause transient increases in intracranial pressure. Administer dexamethasone as prescribed to decrease intracranial inflammation. Prevent straining with bowel movements by use of a stool softener. Assess the child's pain level as well as level of consciousness, vital signs, and pupillary reaction to determine subtle changes as soon as possible. Provide a tour of the intensive care unit, which is where the child will wake up after the surgery. Instruct the child and family about the possibility of intubation and ventilation in the postoperative period. If a ventriculoperitoneal shunt will be placed for the treatment of hydrocephalus caused by the tumor, provide education about shunts to the child and family (see Chapter 16 ). Shave the portion of the head as determined by the neurosurgeon. Some children may choose to have the entire head shaved. Sometimes children with long hair may feel better about losing it if they donate it to Locks of Love, an organization that provides hairpieces for financially disadvantaged children who have long-term medical hair loss. A link to this resource is provided on .Providing Postoperative Care Regulate fluid administration, as excess fluid intake may cause or worsen cerebral edema. Administer mannitol or hypertonic dextrose to decrease cerebral edema. Assess vital signs frequently, along with checking pupillary reactions and determining level of consciousness. Extreme lethargy or coma may be present for several days postoperatively. Increases in temperature may indicate infection or may be caused by cerebral edema or disturbance of the hypothalamus. Treat hyperthermia with antipyretics such as acetaminophen and with sponge baths, as increases in temperature increase metabolic need. Reduce the temperature slowly. Monitor for signs of increased intracranial pressure. Headache is common in the postoperative period. Assess pain level and provide analgesics as prescribed. Minimize environmental stimuli, providing a calm and quiet atmosphere. Check the head dressing for cerebrospinal fluid drainage or bleeding. Assess for and document the extent of head, face, or neck edema. Administer eye lubricant if edema prevents complete closure of the eyelids. Apply cool compresses to the eyes to decrease swelling. As the child begins to regain consciousness, he or she may be confused or combative. Restrain the child if needed to keep him or her in bed and prevent dislodging of tubes and lines. Positioning the Child in the Postoperative Period Position the child on the unaffected side with the head of the bed flat or at the level prescribed by the neurosurgeon. Side positioning is usually preferred, as the child may have difficulty handling oral secretions if the level of consciousness is decreased. Do not elevate the foot of the bed, as this may increase intracranial pressure and contribute to bleeding. When changing the child's position, maintain the head in alignment with the remainder of the body. Children with paralyzed or spastic extremities will need additional positioning support. Take Note! Observe preoperatively and postoperatively for signs of brain stem herniation such as opisthotonos (see Fig. 16.13 in Chapter 16 ), nuchal rigidity, head tilt, sluggish pupils, increased blood pressure with widening pulse pressure, change in respirations, bradycardia, irregular pulse, and changes in body temperature. Consider This A lice Tice, 6 years old, is scheduled to receive chemotherapy for a brain tumor. As the nurse caring for her, how can you prepare Alice for this? What nursing interventions are important when caring for a child receiving chemotherapy? (Discuss reducing pain, reducing risk of infection, promoting adequate nutrition, and managing nausea and vomiting.)NEUROBLASTOMA Neuroblastoma, a tumor that arises from embryonic neural crest cells, is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children (Hendershot, 2010). It most frequently occurs in the abdomen, mainly in the adrenal gland, but it may occur anywhere along the paravertebral sympathetic chain in the chest or retroperitoneum (Hendershot, 2010). By the time of diagnosis, the neuroblastoma has usually already metastasized. Neuroblastoma is the second most frequently occurring solid tumor in children; 90% of cases are diagnosed before the age of 5 years (Maloney et al., 2011). Staging of the tumor at diagnosis determines the course of treatment and prognosis. Table 28.5 discusses the staging of neuroblastomas. Survival rates range from about 40% to 90%, depending on the staging of the tumor (Hendershot, 2010). Prognosis depends on the tumor stage, age at diagnosis, location of tumor, and location of metastasis. Infants younger than 12 months of age and children with stage I disease have the best survival rates (Maloney et al., 2011). Children with tumors above the diaphragm tend to have a better prognosis than those with abdominal tumors. Metastasis to the bone is a worse prognostic factor than metastasis to the skin, liver, or bone marrow. Children who relapse after initial treatment also tend to have a dismal prognosis. In addition to metastasis, complications may include nerve compression, resulting in neurologic deficits. The neuroblastoma must be removed surgically. Radiation and chemotherapy are administered to all children with neuroblastoma except those with stage I disease, in whom the tumor is completely resected. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 1029 . Assessment findings pertinent to neuroblastoma are discussed below. Health History Presenting signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma depend on the location of the primary tumor and the extent of metastasis. Often parents are the first to notice a swollen or asymmetric abdomen. Elicit the health history, documenting bowel or bladder dysfunction, especially watery diarrhea, neurologic symptoms (brain metastasis), bone pain (bone metastasis), anorexia, vomiting, or weight loss. Physical Examination Note neck or facial swelling, bruising above the eyes, or edema around the eyes (metastasis to skull bones). Inspect the skin for palloror bruising (bone marrow metastasis) and document cough or difficulty breathing. Auscultate the lungs for wheezing. Palpate for lymphadenopathy, especially cervical. Palpate the abdomen, noting a firm, nontender mass. Palpate for and note hepatomegaly or splenomegaly if present. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Laboratory and diagnostic testing may reveal the following: CT scan or MRI to determine site of tumor and evidence of metastasis Chest radiograph, bone scan, and skeletal survey to identify metastasis Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to determine metastasis to the bone marrow 24-hour urine collection for homovanillic acid (HVA) and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA); levels will be elevated. Nursing Management Postoperative nursing care depends on the site of tumor removal, which is most often the abdomen. Provide routine care after abdominal surgery. Refer to the nursing process overview section and Nursing Care Plan 28.1 for nursing care related to the effects of chemotherapy and radiation. Provide emotional support and possible referrals to help children and families cope with a potentially poor prognosis (due to the fact that the disease has often metastasized significantly by the time of diagnosis). A traumatic Care The child with cancer often undergoes a large number of painful procedures related to laboratory specimens and treatment protocols. To assist the child to cope with these procedures, provide distraction in the form of reading a favorite book or playing a favorite movie or musical selection.BONE AND SOFT TISSUE TUMORS Bone and soft tissue tumors are common solid tumors in children. Bone tumors are most often diagnosed in adolescence, whereas soft tissue tumors tend to occur in younger children (Hendershot, 2010). This discussion will focus on the most common bone and soft tissue tumors occurring in childhood. The most common bone tumors in children are osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma (Hendershot, 2010). These bone tumors often initially go undiagnosed, as adolescents frequently seek care for traumatic events and the pain suffered with a bone tumor may initially be attributed to trauma. Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue tumor in childhood (Hendershot, 2010). Osteosarcoma Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone cancer in children, occurring most frequently in adolescents at the peak of the growth spurt (Maloney et al., 2011). Osteosarcoma occurs slightly more often in males and Caucasians (Hendershot, 2010). It presumably arises from the embryonic mesenchymal tissue that forms the bones. The most common sites are in the long bones, particularly the proximal humerus, proximal tibia, and distal femur. Complications include metastasis, particularly to the lungs and other bones, and recurrence of disease within 3 years, primarily affecting the lungs. Surgical removal of the tumor is necessary. Chemotherapy is often administered before surgery to decrease the size of the tumor; it is usually administered after surgery to treat or prevent metastasis. The type of surgery performed depends on the tumor size, extent of disease outside of the bone, distant metastasis, and skeletal maturity. Radical amputation may be performed, but often teens undergo a limb salvage procedure. Radical amputation may include the entire extremity or the entire affected bone. Limb-sparing surgery entails removing only the affected portion of the bone, replacing it with either an endoprosthesis or cadaver bone (Abed & Grimer, 2010). Nursing Assessment Obtain the health history, ascertaining when pain, limp, or limitation of motion was first noticed. Dull bone pain may be present for several months, eventually progressing to limp or gait changes. Inspect the affected limb for erythema and swelling. Palpate the affected area for warmth and tenderness and to determine the size of the soft tissue mass, if also present. As with other pediatric cancers, a thorough physical examination is warranted to detect other abnormalities that may indicate metastasis. Laboratory and diagnostic testing may include: CT scan or MRI to determine the extent of the lesion and to identify metastasis Bone scan to determine the extent of malignancy Nursing Management The adolescent will generally be quite anxious about the possibility of amputation and even about the limb salvage procedure. Present preoperative teaching at the adolescent's developmental level and ensure that he or she is included in planning treatment. Regardless of the type of surgery performed, provide routine orthopedic postoperative care. Educate the adolescent and parents on the care of the stump, if amputation is necessary, and ensure that the teen becomes competent in crutch walking. A prosthesis may be ordered. The adolescent will need time to adjust to these significant body image changes and may benefit from talking with another teen who has undergone a similar procedure. Support the teen in choosing clothing that may camouflage the prosthesis while still allowing the teen to appear fashionable. Provide emotional support, as the teen's maturity level allows him or her to understand the severity of the disease. Peer support groups are often helpful, as teens value their peers' opinions and enjoy being part of a group. Examples of comprehensive online support groups are Melissa's Living Legacy Foundation/Helping Teens Live with Cancer and The Wellness Community. Links to these resources are provided on . Ewing Sarcoma Ewing sarcoma is a highly malignant bone tumor. It is rarer than osteosarcoma, accounting for only about 10% of childhood bone tumors (Maloney et al., 2011). It occurs most frequently in the pelvis, chest wall, vertebrae, and long bone diaphyses (midshaft). About 25% of children demonstrate metastasis; the lungs, bone, and bone marrow are the most common sites (Maloney et al., 2011). The prognosis for Ewing sarcoma depends on the extent of metastasis. Radiation, chemotherapy, and surgical excision are usually used in combination. Treatment varies depending on the site of theprimary tumor and the extent of metastasis at diagnosis. Myeloablative chemotherapy (which destroys the child's marrow) may be used for metastatic disease, followed by a stem cell rescue transplant. Nursing Assessment Explore the history for intermittent pain that progressively worsens. Note a possible history of fever. Eventually the pain becomes constant and severe, sometimes interrupting sleep. Note the presence of swelling or erythema at the tumor site. CT scan or MRI of the affected area will reveal the extent of the tumor. Biopsy is necessary to establish the diagnosis. CT scan of the chest, bone scan, and bilateral bone marrow aspiration with biopsy determine the extent of metastasis. Nursing Management Before treatment begins, discourage active play or weight bearing on the affected extremity to avoid pathologic fracture at the tumor site. Nursing management focuses on addressing the adverse effects of treatment (refer to the nursing process overview section). Give honest and direct answers to teens with Ewing sarcoma who ask questions about their disease. These children will undergo intensive therapy and spend a great deal of time in the hospital. Depending on the age of the child, fantasy play, art or pet therapy, drama, writing, humor, and/or music may help the child to work through the psychological impact of this disease. Refer to Nursing Care Plan 28.1 for additional interventions, which should be individualized depending on the child's and family's response to the disease process and treatment. Thinking About Development S erena Jameson is a 14-year-old cheerleader with newly diagnosed Ewing sarcoma. Her prescribed treatment protocol involves several medications known to cause severe alopecia. Considering Serena's developmental stage, how will this impact her ability and/or willingness to participate in future cheerleading exhibitions? Develop a list of ideas for assisting Serena to cope with the anticipated changes to her body image. Rhabdomyosarcoma Rhabdomyosarcoma is a soft tissue tumor that usually arises from the embryonic mesenchymal cells that would ordinarily form striated muscle. The most common locations for the tumor are the head and neck, genitourinary tract, and extremities ( Fig. 28.6 ). The tumor is highly malignant and spreads via local extension or through the venous or lymphatic system, with the lung being the most common site for metastasis. Diagnosis is usually made between 2 and 5 years of age, with 70% of all rhabdomyosarcomas diagnosed by age 10 years (Maloney et al., 2011). The prognosis is based on the stage of the disease at diagnosis. Box 28.3 explains the staging of rhabdomyosarcoma. Prognosis is generally favorable for stage I disease, but 3-year survival occurs in only 39% of children with metastatic disease (Maloney et al., 2011). Complications of rhabdomyosarcoma include metastasis to lung, bone, or bone marrow and direct extension into the CNS, resulting in brain stem compromise or cranial nerve palsy.FIGURE 28.6 The most common sites of rhabdomyosarcoma. Surgical removal of the primary tumor is generally performed. At the time of the surgery, the lesion is biopsied and the stage of disease determined. Depending on the site (especially head, neck, and pelvis) and size of the tumor, radiation and chemotherapy may be used to shrink the tumor to avoid disability. Nursing Assessment The child or parent will often discover an asymptomatic mass and seek medical attention at that time. Obtain a health history, noting recent illness, when the mass was discovered, and whether it has changed since first noted. Examine the history for risk factors such as parental smoking, exposure to environmental chemicals, family history of cancer, or neurofibromatosis. Note respiratory effort and cough, and auscultate the lungs for adventitious sounds. Palpate for lymphadenopathy. Palpate the abdomen for a mass or hepatosplenomegaly. Abnormalities found on physical examination depend on the location of the rhabdomyosarcoma ( Table 28.6 ). BOX 28.3 STAGING OF RHABDOMYOSARCOMA Stage I: completely resectable localized tumor Stage II: after local tumor resection, microscopic residual disease remains Stage III: after local tumor resection, gross residual disease remains Stage IV: metastasis present at diagnosis Adapted from Hendershot, E. (2010). Solid tumors. In D. Tomlinson & N. E. Kline (Eds.), Pediatric oncology nursing. New York, NY: Springer. Laboratory and diagnostic testing may include: CT scan or MRI of primary lesion and the chest for metastasis Open biopsy of the primary tumor for definitive diagnosis Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, bone scan, and skeletal survey to determine metastasis Take Note! Primary tumors arising in the neck region may compress the child's airway. Assess work of breathing and lung sounds. Nursing Management Provide routine postoperative care, depending on the site of surgery. Assess for adverse effects of high-dose radiation, which is generally used to treat the primary tumor as well as metastatic sites. Administer chemotherapy as ordered and assess for adverse effects. Refer to the nursing process overview section and Nursing Care Plan 28.1 to determine an individualized plan of care based on the child's response to the treatment.WILMS TUMOR Wilms tumor is the most common renal tumor and the fourth most common solid tumor in children (Hendershot, 2010). Peak incidence occurs between the ages of 2 and 3 years (Hendershot, 2010). It usually affects only one kidney ( Fig. 28.7 ). The etiology is unknown, but some cases occur via genetic inheritance. Associated anomalies may occur with Wilms tumor. Wilms tumor demonstrates rapid growth and is usually large at diagnosis. Metastasis occurs via direct extension or through the bloodstream. Wilms tumor most commonly metastasizes to the perirenal tissues, liver, diaphragm, lungs, abdominal muscles, and lymph nodes. The prognosis depends on staging at diagnosis and the extent of metastasis ( Box 28.4 ). The overall survival rate is about 90% (Hendershot, 2010). Complications include metastasis or complications from radiation therapy such as liver or renal damage, female sterility, bowel obstruction, pneumonia, or scoliosis. FIGURE 28.7 Wilms tumor is usually unilateral. Therapeutic Management Surgical removal of the tumor and affected kidney (nephrectomy) is the treatment of choice and also allows for accurate staging and assessment of tumor spread. Radiation or chemotherapy may be administered either before or after surgery. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 1029 . Assessment findings pertinent to Wilms tumor are discussed below. Health History Parents typically initially observe the abdominal mass associated with Wilms tumor and then seek medical attention. Elicit the health history, noting when the mass was discovered. Note abdominal pain, which may be related to rapid tumor growth. Document history of constipation, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, or difficulty breathing. Determine risk factors such as hemihypertrophy of the spine, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, genitourinary anomalies, absence of the iris, or family history of cancer. BOX 28.4 STAGING OF WILMS TUMOR Stage I: unilateral, limited to kidney, completely resectable Stage II: unilateral, tumor extends beyond kidney but is completely resectable Stage III: unilateral, tumor has spread outside of kidney, located in abdominal cavity only, not fully removed Stage IV: unilateral with metastasis in liver, lung, bone, or brain Stage V: bilateral kidney involvement Adapted from Hendershot, E. (2010). Solid tumors. In D. Tomlinson & N. E. Kline (Eds.), Pediatric oncology nursing. New York, NY: Springer.Physical Examination Measure blood pressure; hypertension occurs in 25% of children with Wilms tumor (Maloney et al., 2011). Inspect the abdomen for asymmetry or a visible mass. Observe for associated anomalies as noted above. Auscultate the lungs for adventitious breath sounds associated with tumor metastasis. Palpate for lymphadenopathy. Take Note! Avoid palpating the abdomen after the initial assessment preoperatively. Wilms tumor is highly vascular and soft, so excessive handling of the tumor may result in tumor seeding and metastasis. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Laboratory and diagnostic testing may include: Renal or abdominal ultrasound to assess the tumor and the contralateral kidney CT scan or MRI of the abdomen and chest to determine local spread to lymph nodes or adjacent organs, as well as any distant metastasis Complete blood count, BUN, and creatinine: usually within normal limits Urinalysis: may reveal hematuria or leukocytes 24-hour urine collection for HVA and VMA to distinguish the tumor from neuroblastoma (levels will not be elevated with Wilms tumor) Nursing Management Postoperative care of the child with Wilms tumor resection is similar to that of children undergoing other abdominal surgery. Assessment of remaining kidney function is critical. The child may have adverse effects related to chemotherapy or radiation. Refer to the nursing process overview section and Nursing Care Plan 28.1 to individualize care for the child based on the child's response to therapy. Take Note! To avoid injuring the remaining kidney, children with a single kidney should not play contact sports.RETINOBLASTOMA Retinoblastoma is a congenital, highly malignant tumor that arises from embryonic retinal cells. It accounts for 5% of cases of blindness in children (Maloney et al., 2011). Most children are diagnosed by age 3, and the overall survival rate is 90% (Maloney et al., 2011). Retinoblastoma may be hereditary or nonhereditary. Nonhereditary retinoblastoma may be associated with advanced paternal age and always presents with unilateral involvement. Hereditary retinoblastoma is inherited via the autosomal dominant mode. These cases may be unilateral or bilateral. The tumor may grow forward into the vitreous cavity of the eye or extend into the subretinal space, causing retinal detachment. The tumor may extend into the choroid, the sclera, and the optic nerve. Complications include spread to the brain and the opposite eye, as well as metastasis to lymph nodes, bone, bone marrow, and liver. Secondary tumors, most often sarcomas, may also occur in children who have been treated for retinoblastoma. Table 28.7 explains the staging of retinoblastoma. The goals of treatment are to eradicate the tumor, preserve vision, and provide a good cosmetic outcome. Retinoblastoma may be treated with radiation, chemotherapy, laser surgery, cryotherapy, or a combination of these treatments. Moderate vision may be preserved for most children without advanced disease. In advanced disease or in the case of a massive tumor with retinal detachment, enucleation (removal of the eye) is necessary. Nursing Assessment Parents are often the first to notice the \"cat's eye reflex\" or \"whitewash glow\" to the child's affected pupil. Obtain the health history, determining when other associated symptoms such as strabismus, orbital inflammation, vomiting, or headache began. Inquire about risk factors such as a family history of retinoblastoma or other cancer, or the presence of chromosomal anomalies. Assess pupils for size and reactivity to light. Note presence of leukocoria (\"cat's eye reflex,\" a whitish appearance of the pupil) in the affected eye ( Fig. 28.8 ). Assess the eyes for associated signs, which may include erythema, orbital inflammation, or hyphema. Diagnostic evaluation includes an ophthalmologic examination under anesthesia. CT, MRI, or ultrasound of the head and eyes will help to visualize the tumor. The infant or toddler may also undergo lumbar puncture and bone marrow aspiration to determine the presence and extent of metastasis.FIGURE 28.8 Note the whitish appearance of this child's pupil (leukocoria). (Used with permission from Rubin, E. & Farber, J. L. (1999) Pathology (3rd ed.). Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.) Nursing Management Provide routine postoperative care to the infant or toddler. If the eye is enucleated, observe the large pressure dressing on the eye socket for bleeding. Dressing changes to the socket may include sterile saline rinses and/or antibiotic ointment application. If disease occurs outside of the eye or if metastasis is present, inform the parents that chemotherapy will be necessary. Monitor for side effects of chemotherapy (see the nursing process overview section). Follow-up will include eye examinations every 3 to 6 months until age 6 and then annually to check for further tumor development. If the eye is enucleated, a prosthetic eye will be fitted several weeks after removal. Teach families use of the prosthetic eye; it does not require daily removal. Provide parents with support and encouragement. Refer the family for genetic counseling. Any subsequent children will require ophthalmologic examination every 1 to 3 weeks until 1 year of age, with close follow-up until age 3 years (Canty, 2009). Children treated for retinoblastoma will also need genetic counseling as they reach puberty because of the risk of bilateral disease in their offspring (Canty, 2009). Take Note! Educate parents about protecting vision in the remaining eye: routine eye check-ups, protection from accidental injury, use of safety goggles during sports, and prompt treatment of eye infections. Generally, children with one eye should not participate in contact sports.SCREENING FOR REPRODUCTIVE CANCERS IN ADOLESCENTS Increasingly, reproductive cancers are being diagnosed in adolescents. Cervical cancer and testicular cancer may be discovered early with appropriate screening, and earlier discovery leads to better outcomes. Starting screening in the teenage years may also instill a lifelong healthy habit in the adolescent. Cervical Cancer Risk factors for cervical cancer include young age at first intercourse, infection with a sexually transmitted disease, and a history of multiple sex partners. More and more teenagers are presenting with these risk factors. Cervical cancer is most commonly attributed to human papillomavirus (HPV) (American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP], 2011). HPV vaccine (Gardasil) is recommended to be given as a three-vaccine series to all girls beginning at age 11 to 12 years (AAP, 2011). Despite the availability of the vaccine, not all girls will receive it. Counsel all sexually active adolescents to seek reproductive care, which is available without parental consent in most states. The screening Papanicolaou (Pap) smear is efficient and reliable at determining abnormal cervical cells and is a key part of screening for cervical cancer (if cancer is present, the parent will have to be notified). Cervical cancer has a very high response to therapy and rate of cure if treated in its early stages. Therefore, encourage teenage girls to be responsible for their sexual health by seeking appropriate examination and screening. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Testicular Cancer Although uncommon in teens, testicular cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in males between 15 and 34 years of age (National Cancer Institute, 2011b). It is one of the most curable cancers if diagnosed early. To get into the habit of screening for testicular lumps, encourage adolescent boys to begin performing testicular self-examinations monthly ( Teaching Guidelines 28.3 ). HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Teaching Guidelines 28.3 TESTICULAR SELF-EXAMINATION Perform the examination once a month, after a shower. Be familiar with the size and weight of your testicles. Roll the testicle between your fingers. The small rope-like structure is the epididymis; this is normal. Report any lump, swelling, or heaviness of one testicle to your physician or nurse practitioner. Adapted from Figueroa, T. E. (2009). How to perform a testicular self-examination. Retrieved March 20, 2011, from http://kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_health/guys/tse.html KEY CONCEPTS Childhood cancer tends to develop from embryonal tissue; in general, it is more responsive to therapy than adult cancers, which tend to be derived from epithelial tissue. In adults, cancer is influenced to a large extent by environmental factors. Cancer in children is most often not attributed to environmental factors, so generally there are no routine screening measures or prevention strategies for childhood cancer. The pain associated with lumbar puncture or bone marrow aspiration may be minimized with the use of topical anesthetics or conscious sedation. CT scans and MRI are used extensively in the diagnosis and follow-up of childhood cancer. The young child may have difficulty holding still for these scans and may need short-term sedation. Leukemia often presents in children with a history of fever, infection, and fatigue. Bone pain or CNS symptoms may be present if metastasis to the bone or brain has occurred. Lymphomas in children present similarly to those in adults, often with an enlarged, nontender lymph node. Symptoms of brain tumors depend on the location of the tumor; commonly they present with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting. Neuroblastoma has often significantly metastasized at diagnosis. It most commonly presents as a mass in the abdomen. Shortness of breath or chest pain in the child with cancer is a medical emergency; it may indicate superior vena cava syndrome or a tumor in the mediastinal region. Retinoblastoma may be identified by the presence of leukocoria in one or both eyes. Retinoblastoma occurs in early infancy up until early childhood. Bone cancer does not necessarily require amputation; it may be treated with a combination of limb salvage procedure, radiation, and chemotherapy. The symptoms of rhabdomyosarcoma depend on the location of the tumor. Avoid abdominal palpation preoperatively in the child with Wilms tumor; palpation may cause seeding of the tumor and metastasis. Radiation therapy may result in fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and long-term cognitive sequelae (if directed to the cranium). Nursing care of the child receiving treatment for cancer focuses on preventing or treating adverse effects such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, alopecia, mucositis, and infection. The neutropenic child with fever should receive medical attention as soon as possible so that intravenous antibiotics may be started immediately. Cancer is a significant stressor for children and families. Families need support and education throughout the diagnostic process, treatment and cure, or palliative care. The child with cancer should lead as near normal a life as possible. When physically able and cleared by the oncologist, the child should resume usual activities such as school. Camps for children with cancer provide an excellent opportunity for children to enjoy everyday activities and meet children experiencing similar alterations in their lives. Nutrition may be optimized for children with cancer by managing nausea and vomiting with antiemetics, providing favorite foods, and possibly using total parenteral nutrition. Teach adolescents appropriate screening techniques for reproductive cancers. Educate the child and family about the adverse effects of cancer treatments. Teach parents how to avoid infection in the child receiving chemotherapy, the signs and symptoms of infection, and when to seek medical treatment. REFERENCES Abed, R., & Grimer, R. (2010).

Start antiemetic drugs prior to the chemotherapy infusion. d. Maintain IV fluid infusion to avoid dehydration. CRITICAL THINKING EXERCISES 1. Develop a discharge teaching plan for a child who has just completed the induction phase of chemotherapy for acute lymphocytic leukemia. 2. A 17-year-old girl has recently been diagnosed with osteosarcoma. She is worried about how treatment will affect her plans for college, marriage, and children. How will you respond to her concerns? 3. A 3-year-old is going to be starting chemotherapy for rhabdomyosarcoma. Develop an age-appropriate teaching plan for this child. 4. Develop a nursing care plan for an adolescent with cancer who is undergoing radiation and chemotherapy and experiencing a significant number of adverse effects from his treatment. STUDY ACTIVITIES 1. While in the clinical area, care for a young child who has undergone therapy for a brain tumor. Compare this child's growth and development to those of a healthy similar-age child who you know or have cared for. 2. During your clinical rotation, care for a child who has received several chemotherapy treatments. After establishing a therapeutic relationship, talk with the child about his or her understanding of the disease and the experience the child has had with diagnosis and treatment thus far. If time allows, ask the child to draw a picture describing this experience. Record your observations in your clinical journal and reflect on the emotions you feel about this experience. 3. Attend the pediatric oncology clinic. Determine the role of the advanced practice nurse (nurse practitioner or clinical nurse specialist) compared to the role of the registered nurse in the outpatient care of children with cancer. Determine which activities the nurse appropriately delegates to unlicensed assistive personnel in that setting. 4. Talk to the hospital chaplain about his or her experiences with dying children. Reflect on this conversation in your clinical journal.29 Nursing Care of the Child With a Genetic Disorder Words of Wisdom Nursing includes care for the helpless and brave child victim of heredity. KEY TERMS allele chromosome translocation Learning Objectives Upon completion of the chapter, the learner will be able to: 1. Discuss various inheritance patterns, including nontraditional patterns of inheritance. 2. Discuss ethical and legal issues associated with genetic testing. 3. Discuss genetic counseling and the role of the nurse. 4. Discuss the nurse's role and responsibilities when caring for a child diagnosed with a genetic disorder and his or her family. 5. Identify nursing interventions related to common laboratory and diagnostic tests used in the diagnosis and management of genetic conditions. 6. Distinguish various genetic disorders occurring in childhood. 7. Devise an individualized nursing care plan for the child with a genetic disorder. 8. Develop child/family teaching plans for the child with a genetic disorder. Julie Woods, a 5-year-old, is brought to the clinic for her annual examination. Her mother states, \"She's so muchsmaller than all of the other kindergartners.\" Genetics is the study of heredity\u2014its transmission and its variation. A genetic disorder is a disease caused by an abnormality in an individual's genetic material or genome. Some genetic disorders occur in multiple family members (via inheritance of abnormal genes). Other disorders may occur in only a single family member (via spontaneous mutation). A genetic disorder is caused by completely or partially altered genetic material. In contrast, a familial disorder is more common in relatives of the affected individual but may be caused by environmental influences, not genetic alterations. Many chronic disorders of childhood have a genetic or inherited cause. Common disorders suspected to be caused or influenced by genetic factors include birth defects, chromosomal abnormalities, neurocutaneous disorders, intellectual disability, many types of short stature disorders, connective tissue disorders, and inborn errors of metabolism. Genetic disorders can present at any age but the most obvious and severe disorders are present in childhood (Korf, 2007a). Our ability to diagnose genetic conditions is far superior to our ability to cure or treat them. However, accurate diagnosis does lead to improved treatment and outcomes. Nurses should have a basic knowledge of genetics, common genetic disorders in children, genetic testing, and genetic counseling so that they can provide support and information to families and can promote an improved quality of life. Take Note! Genetic science has the potential to revolutionize health care with regard to national screening programs, predisposition testing, detection of genetic disorders, and pharmacogenetics.ADVANCES IN GENETICS Recent advances in genetic knowledge and technology have affected all areas of health. Genetic testing can identify presymptomatic conditions in children and adults and can provide carrier screening, prenatal diagnostic testing, newborn screening, confirmation of a diagnosis, forensic and identity testing, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (U.S. Department of Energy Genome Programs, 2010). Over 1,000 genetic tests are available for diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy/Becker muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, and sickle cell disease (U.S. Department of Energy Genome Programs, 2010). Gene therapy can be used to replace or repair defective or missing genes with normal ones. Although it is a promising treatment option for many inherited and incurable diseases, it currently remains an experimental treatment option (U.S. Department of Energy Genome Programs, 2009). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the sale of any gene therapy and current clinical trails have yielded minimal success (U.S. Department of Energy Genome Programs, 2009). The Human Genome Project (HGP) and continued research by the National Human Genome Research Institute has helped foster much of this progress. The genome of an organism is its entire hereditary information encoded in the DNA. The HGP, an international effort to produce a comprehensive sequence of the human genome, was coordinated by the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health. It began in October 1990 and was completed in May 2003. Its goals included: Identify all of the approximately 20,000 to 25,000 genes in human DNA. Determine the sequences of the 3 billion chemical base pairs that make up human DNA. Store this information in databases to make it accessible for further study. Improve tools for data analysis. Transfer related technologies to the private sector. Address the ethical, legal, and social implications of this discovery (U.S. Department of Energy Genome Programs, 2011). The HGP has led to the discovery of the genetic basis for hundreds of disorders and has advanced our understanding of basic genetic processes at the molecular level. A link to additional information about the HGP is available on . One goal of the HGP was to translate the findings into new and more effective strategies for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of genetic disorders. Current and potential applications for the HGP to health care include rapid and more specific diagnosis of disease, with hundreds of genetic tests available in research or clinical practice; earlier detection of genetic predisposition to disease; less emphasis on treating the symptoms of a disease and more emphasis on seeking the fundamental causes of the disease; new classes of drugs; avoiding environmental conditions that may trigger disease; and repair or replacement of defective genes using gene therapy. This knowledge, along with the commercialization of the technology, can change both professional and parental understanding of genetic disorders. The potential benefits of these discoveries are vast, but so is the potential for misuse. These advances challenge all health care professionals to consider the many ethical, legal, and social ramifications of genetics in human lives. In the near future, risk profiling based on an individual's unique genetic makeup will be used to tailor prevention, treatment, and ongoing management of health conditions. This profiling will raise issues associated with privacy and confidentiality related to workplace discrimination and access to health insurance. Issues of autonomy are equally problematic as society considers how to address the injustices that will inevitably surface when disease risk can be determined years in advance of its occurrence. Nurses will play an important role in developing policies and providing direction and support in this arena. In order to fulfill this important role, nurses need a basic understanding of genetics, including inheritance and inheritance patterns. (Visit for links to resources on the ethical, social, and legal issues surrounding human genetic research and advances.)INHERITANCE A gene is the basic unit of heredity of all traits. Genes occupy a specific location on a chromosome (a long, continuous strand of DNA that carries genetic information) and determine the organism's physical and mental characteristics. In humans each somatic cell (a cell forming the body of an organism) has 46 chromosomes: 22 pairs of nonsex chromosomes (autosomes) and 1 pair of sex chromosomes. The genotype is the specific genetic makeup of an individual; it is the internally coded inheritable information and refers to the particular allele (one of two or more alternative versions of a gene at a given position on a chromosome that imparts the same characteristic of that gene). For example, each human has a gene that controls height, but there are variations of these genes (alleles) that can produce a height of 5 feet or one of 6 feet, 2 inches. A gene that controls eye color may have an allele that can produce blue eyes or an allele that produces brown eyes. The genotype, together with environmental variation that influences the individual, determines the phenotype (the outward characteristics of the individual). A human inherits two genes, one from each parent; therefore, one allele comes from the mother and one from the father. These alleles may be the same for the characteristic ( homozygous ) or different ( heterozygous ). If the two alleles differ, the dominant one will usually be expressed in the individual's phenotype. Patterns of Inheritance Patterns of inheritance demonstrate how genetic abnormalities can be passed onto offspring. Although diagnosis of a genetic disorder is usually based on clinical signs and symptoms or on laboratory confirmation of an altered gene associated with the disorder, accurate diagnosis can be aided by identifying the pattern of inheritance within a family. In addition, nurses must understand the patterns of inheritance so they can teach and counsel families about the risks of genetic disorders occurring in future pregnancies. Mendelian or Monogenic Laws of Inheritance Principles of inheritance of single-gene disorders are the same that govern the inheritance of other traits, such as eye and hair color. These are known as Mendel's laws of inheritance, named for Gregor Mendel, an Austrian naturalist who conducted genetic research. These patterns occur because a single gene is defective and the disorders that result are referred to as monogenic or, sometimes, mendelian disorders. If the defect occurs on the autosome, the genetic disorder is termed autosomal; if the defect is on the X chromosome, the genetic disorder is termed X linked. The defect also can be classified as dominant or recessive. Monogenic disorders include recessive. AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT INHERITANCE Autosomal dominant inheritance occurs when a single gene in the heterozygous state is capable of producing the phenotype. In these cases, the abnormal or mutant gene overshadows the normal gene and the individual will demonstrate signs and symptoms of the disorder. The affected person usually has one affected parent. However, there are varying degrees of presentation among individuals in a family. For example, a parent with a mild form of the disorder could have a child with a more severe form (termed variable expression). In some autosomal dominant disorders there may be no history of an affected family member. This can be due to the child representing a new mutation or the result of incomplete or reduced penetrance, which means that a person with the genetic mutation does not develop phenotypic features of the disorder. Incomplete or reduced penetrance may result from a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors; age; and gender. Offspring of an affected parent will have a 50% chance of inheriting two normal genes (disorder free) and a 50% chance of inheriting one normal and one abnormal gene (and, thus, the disorder) ( Fig. 29.1 ) (Conley, 2010; Robin, 2007). Females and males are equally affected by autosomal dominant disorders and an affected male can pass the disorder on to his son (Robin, 2007). This male-to-male transmission is important in distinguishing autosomal dominant inheritance from X-linked inheritance. Common types of genetic disorders that follow the autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance include neurofibromatosis, Huntington disease, achondroplasia, and polycystic kidney disease. AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE INHERITANCE Autosomal recessive inheritance occurs when two copies of the mutant or abnormal gene in the homozygous state are necessary to produce the phenotype. In other words, two abnormal genes are needed for the individual to demonstrate signs and symptoms of the disorder. Both parents of the affected person must be heterozygous carriers of the gene (clinically normal, but carriers of the gene). Offspring of two carriers of the abnormal gene have a 25% chance of inheriting two normal genes; a 50% chance of inheriting one normal gene and one abnormal gene (carrier); and a 25% chance of inheriting two abnormal genes (and, thus, the disorder) (Conley, 2010; Robin, 2007) ( Fig. 29.2 inheritance pattern. Figure 29.2 Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Affected individuals are usually present in only one generation of the family. Females and males are equally affected, and a male can pass the disorder on to his son (Robin, 2007). The chance that any two parents will both be carriers of the mutant gene is increased if the couple has consanguinity (relationship by blood or common ancestry) (Robin, 2007). Common types of genetic disorders that follow the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern include cystic fibrosis, phenylketonuria, Tay-Sachs disease, and sickle cell disease. X-LINKED INHERITANCE X-linked inheritance disorders are those associated with altered genes on the X chromosome. They differ from autosomal disorders. If a male inherits an X-linked altered gene, he will express the condition. This is because a male has only one X chromosome and, therefore, all the genes on his X chromosome will be expressed (the Y chromosome carries no normal allele to compensate for the altered gene). Because females inherit two X chromosomes, they can be either heterozygous or homozygous for any allele. Therefore, X-linked disorders express recessive inheritance demonstrate a recessive pattern of inheritance (Conley, 2010; Marino & Claybon, 2008). There are more affected males than females because all the genes on a man's X chromosome will be expressed since a male has only one X chromosome (Robin, 2007). On the other hand, a female will usually need two abnormal X chromosomes to exhibit the disease and one normal and one abnormal X chromosome to be a carrier of the disease. There is no male-to-male transmission (since no X chromosome from the male is transmitted to male offspring), but any man who is affected with an X-linked recessive disorder will have carrier daughters. If a woman is a carrier, there is a 25% chance she will have an affected son, a 25% chance that her daughter will be a carrier, a 25% chance that she will have an unaffected son, and a 25% chance her daughter will be a noncarrier ( Fig. 29.3 ) (Conley, 2010). Common types of genetic disorders that follow X-linked recessive inheritance patterns include hemophilia, color blindness, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Conley, 2010). X-Linked Dominant Inheritance. X-linked dominant inheritance occurs when a male has an abnormal X chromosome or a female has one abnormal X chromosome. All of the daughters and none of the sons of an affected male will inherit the condition, while both male and female offspring of an affected woman have a 50% chance of inheriting the condition (Robin, 2007) ( Fig. 29.4 ). Males are more severely affected than females. Many X-linked dominant disorders have lethal results in males (Robin, 2007). In females, even though the gene is dominant, having a second normal X gene offsets the effects of the dominant gene to some extent, resulting in decreasing severity of the disorder. X-linked dominant disorders are rare; examples include hypophosphatemic (vitamin D-resistant) rickets and fragile X syndrome.FIGURE 29.3 X-linked recessive inheritance pattern. FIGURE 29.4 X-linked dominant inheritance pattern. Multifactorial InheritanceMany of the common congenital malformations, such stenosis, clubfoot, congenital hip dysplasia, cardiac defects, are attributed to multifactorial inheritance (Conley, 2010; Robin, 2007). These conditions are thought to be caused by multiple gene and environmental factors. That is, a combination of genes from both parents, along with unknown environmental factors, produces the trait or condition. An individual may inherit a predisposition to a particular anomaly or disease. The anomalies or diseases vary in severity and often a sex bias is present. For example, pyloric stenosis is seen more often in males, while congenital hip dysplasia is much more likely to occur in females. Multifactorial conditions tend to run in families, but the pattern of inheritance is not as predictable as with single-gene disorders. The chance of recurrence is also less than in single-gene disorders, but the degree of risk is related to the number of genes in common with the affected individual. The closer the degree of relationship, the more genes an individual has in common with the affected family member, and thus the higher risk that the individual's offspring will have a similar defect. In multifactorial inheritance the likelihood that both identical twins will be affected is not 100%, indicating that there are nongenetic factors involved. Nontraditional Inheritance Patterns Molecular studies have revealed that some genetic disorders are inherited in ways that do not follow the typical patterns of dominant, recessive, X-linked, or multifactorial inheritance. Examples of nontraditional inheritance patterns include mitochondrial inheritance and genomic imprinting. As the science of molecular genetics advances and we learn more about inheritance patterns, other nontraditional patterns of inheritance may be discovered or may be found to be relatively common. MITOCHONDRIAL INHERITANCE Certain diseases result from mutations in the mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria (the part of the cell responsible for energy production) are inherited almost exclusively from the mother. Therefore, mitochondrial inheritance is usually passed from the mother to the offspring, regardless of the offspring's sex (differentiating mitochondrial inheritance from X-linked recessive inheritance). These mutations are often deletions and abnormalities and are often seen in one or more organs, such as the brain, eye, and skeletal muscle. They are often associated with energy deficits in cells with high energy requirements, such as nerve and muscle cells. These disorders tend to be progressive and the age of onset can vary from infancy to adulthood. There is an extreme amount of variability in symptoms within a family. Examples of disorders that follow mitochondrial inheritance include Kearns-Sayre syndrome (a neuromuscular disorder) and Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (which causes progressive visual impairment). GENOMIC IMPRINTING Another nontraditional inheritance pattern results from a process called genomic imprinting. Genomic imprinting plays a critical role in fetal growth and development and placental functioning. It is a phenomenon by which the expression of a gene is determined by its parental origin. In genomic imprinting both the maternal and paternal alleles are present, but only one is expressed; the other is inactive. Genomic imprinting does not alter the genetic sequence itself, but affects the phenotype observed. In these cases, the altered genes in a certain region of the genome have very different expressions depending on whether they were inherited from the mother or the father. Several human syndromes are known to be associated with defects in gene imprinting. Disorders that result from a disruption of imprinting usually involve a growth phenotype and include varying degrees of developmental problems. Common examples include Prader-Willi syndrome (a condition resulting in severe hypotonia and hyperphagia, leading to obesity and intellectual disability), Angelman syndrome (a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with intellectual disability, jerky movements, and seizures), and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (characterized by somatic to embryonic neoplasia). Abnormalities In some cases of genetic disorders, the abnormality occurs due to problems with the chromosomes. Chromosomal abnormalities do not follow straightforward patterns of inheritance. Although some chromosomal disorders can be inherited, most others occur due to random events during the formation of reproductive cells or in early fetal development. Sperm and egg cells each have 23 unpaired chromosomes. When they unite during conception they form a fertilized egg with 46 chromosomes. Sometimes before pregnancy begins, an error has occurred during the process of cell division, leaving an egg or sperm with too many or too few chromosomes. If this egg or sperm cell joins with a normal egg or sperm cell, the resulting embryo has a chromosomal abnormality. Chromosomal abnormalities can also occur due to an error in the structure of the chromosome. Small pieces of the chromosome may be deleted, duplicated, inverted, misplaced, or exchanged with part of another chromosome. Most chromosomal abnormalities occur due to an error in the egg or sperm. Therefore, the abnormality is present in every cell of the body. Some abnormalities can happen after fertilization, during mitotic cell division, and result in mosaicism. Mosaicism or themosaic form is when the chromosomal abnormalities do not show up in every cell; only some cells or tissues carry the abnormality. In mosaic forms of the disorder the symptoms are usually less severe than if all the cells were abnormal. Chromosomal abnormalities occur in 1% of live births (Descartes & Carroll, 2007). There is a much higher frequency of chromosomal abnormalities in spontaneous abortions and stillbirths (Descartes & Carroll, 2007). Congenital anomalies and intellectual disability are often associated with chromosomal abnormalities (Descartes & Carroll, 2007). These abnormalities occur on autosomal or nonsex chromosomes as well as sex chromosomes and can result from abnormalities of either chromosome number or chromosome structure. A karyotype is a pictorial analysis of chromosomes. It depicts a systematic arrangement of chromosomes of a single cell by pairs ( Fig. 29.5 ). Karyotyping is often used in prenatal testing to diagnose or predict genetic diseases. ABNORMALITIES OF CHROMOSOME NUMBER Chromosomal abnormalities of number often result due to nondisjunction (failure of separation of the chromosome pair) during cell division, meiosis, or mitosis. Few chromosomal numerical abnormalities are compatible with full-term development and most result in spontaneous abortion (Descartes & Carroll, 2007). Some numerical abnormalities, however, can support development to term because the chromosome on which the abnormality is present carries relatively few genes (e.g., chromosome 13, 18, 21, or X). Two common abnormalities of chromosome number are monosomies or trisomies. In monosomies there is only one copy of a particular chromosome instead of the usual pair; in these cases all fetuses spontaneously abort in early pregnancy. Survival occurs only in mosaic forms of these disorders. In trisomies, there are three of a particular chromosome instead of the usual two. The most common trisomies include trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), trisomy 18, and trisomy 13 (see below for further discussion). Trisomies may be present in every cell or may present in the mosaic form. ABNORMALITIES OF CHROMOSOME STRUCTURE Abnormalities of chromosome structure usually occur when there is a breakage and loss of a portion of one or more chromosomes, and during the repair process the broken ends are rejoined incorrectly. Structural abnormalities usually lead to having too much or too little genetic material. Altered chromosome structure can take on several forms. Deletions occur when a portion of the chromosome is missing, resulting in a loss of that portion of the chromosome. Duplications are seen when a portion of the chromosome is duplicated and an extra chromosomal segment is present. Clinical findings vary depending on how much chromosomal material is involved. Inversions occur when a portion of the chromosome breaks off at two points and is turned upside down and reattached; therefore, the genetic material is inverted. With inversion, there is no loss or gain of chromosomal material and carriers are phenotypically normal, but they do have an increased risk for miscarriage and having chromosomally abnormal offspring (Descartes & Carroll, 2007). Ring chromosomes are seen when a portion of a chromosome has broken off in two places and has formed a circle or ring. The most clinically significant structural abnormality is a translocation . This occurs when a portion of one chromosome is transferred to another chromosome and an abnormal rearrangement is present.FIGURE 29.5 Chromosomes in a karyotype are arranged and numbered by size, from largest to smallest. The normal human karyotype has 46 chromosomes: 22 pairs of autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes. (A) A normal male. (B) A normal female. Structural abnormalities can be balanced or unbalanced. Balanced abnormalities involve the rearrangement of genetic material with neither an overall gain nor loss. Individuals who inherit a balanced structural abnormality are usually phenotypically normal but are at a higher risk for miscarriages and having chromosomally abnormal offspring. Examples of structural rearrangements that can be balanced include inversions, translocations, and ring chromosomes. Unbalanced structural abnormalities are similar to numerical abnormalities because genetic material is either gained or lost. Unbalanced structural abnormalities can encompass several genes and result in severe clinical consequences. SEX CHROMOSOME ABNORMALITIES Chromosomal abnormalities can also involve sex chromosomes. These cases usually have milder clinical effects than autosomal chromosomal abnormalities (Descartes & Carroll, 2007). Sex chromosome abnormalities are gender specific and involve a missing or extra sex chromosome. They affect sexual development and may cause infertility, growth abnormalities, and, possibly, behavioral and learning problems. However, many affected individuals lead essentially normal lives. Examples are Turner syndrome in females and Klinefelter syndrome in males (see discussion later in this chapter).GENETIC EVALUATION AND COUNSELING Genetic counseling is a communication and educational process where the genetic influence of health is explained along with information regarding a specific genetic disorder, its transmission, its inheritance, and options available in management and family planning (Korf, 2007c). There are a variety of reasons an individual should be referred for genetic counseling ( Box 29.1 ). In many cases, geneticists and genetic counselors provide information to families regarding genetic diseases. However, an experienced physician, nurse practitioner, or nurse who has received special training in genetics may also provide the information. A genetic consultation involves evaluation of an individual or a family. Its purpose is to confirm, diagnose, or rule out genetic conditions; identify medical management issues; calculate and communicate genetic risks to a family; discuss ethical and legal issues; and assist in providing and arranging psychosocial support. Genetic counselors serve as educators and resource people for other health care providers and the general public. BOX 29.1 THOSE WHO MAY BENEFIT FROM GENETIC COUNSELING Maternal age 35 years or older when the baby is born Paternal age 50 years or older Previous child, parents, or close relatives with an inherited disease, congenital anomalies, metabolic disorders, developmental disorders, or chromosomal abnormalities Consanguinity or incest Pregnancy screening abnormality, including -feto-protein, triple/quadruple screen, amniocentesis, or ultrasound Stillborn with congenital anomalies Two or more pregnancy losses Teratogen exposure or risk Concerns about genetic defects that occur frequently in their ethnic or racial group (e.g., those of African descent are most at risk for having a child with sickle cell anemia) Abnormal newborn screening Child born with one or more major malformations in a major organ system Child with abnormalities of growth Child with developmental delay, intellectual disability, blindness, or deafness Adapated from Conley, Y. P. (2010) Genetics and health applications. In S. M. Nettina (Ed.), Lippincott manual of nursing practice (9th ed., pp. 35-46. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; and Korf, B. (2007). Integration of genetics into pediatric practice. In R. M. Kliegman, R. E. Behrman, H. B. Jenson, & B. F. Stanton (Eds.), Nelson's textbook of pediatrics (18th ed., pp. 572-575). Philadelphia: Saunders. The ideal time for genetic counseling is before conception. Preconception counseling allows couples to identify and reduce potential pregnancy risks, plan for known risks, and establish early prenatal care. Genetic counseling is particularly important if a congenital anomaly or genetic disease has been diagnosed prenatally or when a child is born with a life-threatening congenital anomaly or genetic disease. In these cases families need urgent information because they need to make immediate decisions. If a diagnosis with genetic implications is made later in life, if a couple with a family history or a previous child with a genetic disorder is planning a family, or if there is suspected teratogen exposure, urgency of information is not such an issue. In these situations the family needs to take in all the information and explore all their options. This may occur during several meetings over a longer period of time.FIGURE 29.6 A pedigree is a diagram that shows the links between family members and includes medical information for each relative. Genetic counseling involves extensive information gathering about birth history, past medical history, and current health status. A detailed family history is imperative and in most cases will include the development of a pedigree, which is like a family tree ( Fig. 29.6 ). Information is ideally gathered on three generations, but if the family history is complicated, information from more distant relatives may be needed. Families receiving genetic counseling should be told that this information will be necessary so that they can discuss these sensitive issues with family members in advance. When necessary, medical records may be requested for family members, especially those who have a genetic disorder. Sometimes the process of preparing a pedigree may reveal information that is not known by all family members, such as an adopted child, a child conceived through in vitro fertilization, or a husband not being the father of a baby. Therefore, it is extremely important to take steps to maintain confidentiality. Medical genetic knowledge has increased dramatically over the past few decades. This has greatly expanded the role of the genetic counselor. It is possible not only to detect specific diseases with genetic mutations but also to test for a genetic predisposition to various diseases or conditions and certain physical characteristics. This leads to complex ethical, moral, and social issues. Health care providers need to maintain privacy and confidentiality and administer care in a nondiscriminatory manner while maintaining sensitivity to cultural differences. It is essential to respect the child's autonomy and present information in a nondirective manner.NURSE'S ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES Pediatric nurses will encounter children with genetic disorders in every clinical specialty area. This includes clinics, hospitals, schools, and community-based centers. Talking with families who have recently been diagnosed with a genetic disorder or who have had a child born with congenital anomalies is very difficult. Many times the nurse is the one who has first contact with these parents and will be the one to provide follow-up care. Genetic disorders are significant, life-changing, and possibly life-threatening situations. The information is highly technical and the field is still evolving. Therefore, it is important to refer the family to a physician or nurse practitioner who specializes in genetics. The nurse should understand who will benefit from genetic counseling and should be able to discuss the role of the genetic counselor with families. Inform families at risk that genetic counseling is available before they attempt to have another baby. The nurse is in an ideal position to help families review what has been discussed during the genetic counseling sessions and to answer any additional questions they might have. Nurses play an essential role in providing emotional support to the family throughout this challenging time. Nurses should also refer the family to appropriate agencies, support groups, and resources, such as a social worker, a chaplain, or an ethicist.COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS A variety of medications and other medical treatments are used to treat the symptoms of genetic disorders in children. Genetic disorders do not have specific treatments and there is no cure, so treatment focuses on the specific symptoms of each disorder. Genetic disorders often involve multiple organ systems and children with these disorders have complex medical needs. Thus, a multidisciplinary approach and good communication are imperative. See below for a discussion on common genetic disorders and their management. NURSING PROCESS OVERVIEW FOR THE CHILD WITH A GENETIC DISORDER Care of the child with a genetic disorder includes assessment, nursing diagnosis, planning, interventions, and evaluation. There are a number of general concepts related to the nursing process that may be applied to the care of children with genetic disorders. From a general understanding of the care involved for a child with a genetic disorder, the nurse can then individualize the care based on specifics for the particular child. Assessment Assessment of the child with a genetic disorder includes health history, physical examination, and laboratory and diagnostic testing. Remember Julie, the 5-year-old brought in for her annual examination? What additional health history and physical examination information should you obtain? Health History The health history consists of past medical history, including the mother's pregnancy history; family history; neonatal history; and history of present illness (when the symptoms started and how they have progressed), as well as treatments used at home. Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as: Family history of genetic disorders Any complications during the prenatal, perinatal, or postnatal periods Changes in developmental status or delays in developmental milestones The pregnancy history can be extremely relevant when identifying a genetic disorder. The pregnancy history may be significant for maternal age older than 35 years or paternal age older than 50 years, repeated premature births, breech delivery, congenital hip dysplasia, abnormalities found on ultrasound, abnormalities in prenatal blood screening tests (e.g., triple/quadruple screen, -fetoprotein), amniotic fluid abnormalities (polyhydramnios, oligohydramnios), multiple births, exposure to medications and known teratogens, and decreased fetal movement. A focused neonatal history can also help identify a genetic problem. The neonatal history may be significant for symmetric intrauterine growth restriction, large for gestational age without a reason, hearing impaired, persistent hyperbilirubinemia, poor adaptation to the extrauterine environment (demonstrated by temperature and heart rate instability and poor feeding), hypotonia or hypertonia, seizures, and abnormal newborn screening results. The family history plays a critical role in identifying genetic disorders. Gather data for three generations. If there is a positive family history, the likelihood of a genetic disorder in the child is increased. It is helpful to create a family pedigree (refer to the genetic counseling section above). The family history may be significant for major congenital anomalies, intellectual disability, genetic diseases, metabolic disorders, multiple miscarriages or stillbirths, developmental delays, significant learning disabilities, psychiatric problems, consanguinity, and chronic serious illness (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, renal disease, hearing impairment, blindness, asthma, seizures, and unexplained death). When eliciting the history of the present illness, inquire about: Developmental delay Seizures Hypotonia or hypertonia Feeding problems Lethargy Failure to thrive Septic appearance Vomiting Children known to have a genetic disorder are often admitted to the hospital for other health-related issues or complications and management of the genetic disorder. The health history should include questions related to: Age when the disorder was diagnosed Developmental delay Complications of the disorder (e.g., thyroid problems, cardiac problems, respiratory problems, leukemia, seizures, cognitive impairment) Medications the child takes for complications associated with the disorder Dietary restrictions Compliance with management regimen Once complications have been identified, further investigation into their severity, frequency, and management is essential to the care of this child while in the hospital. Physical Examination Physical examination of the child with a genetic disorder includes inspection and observation, palpation, and auscultation.INSPECTION AND OBSERVATION Inspect and observe for congenital anomalies, either major or minor. A major anomaly is an anomaly or malformation that creates significant medical problems and requires surgical or medical management (Stevenson, 2006; Wynshaw-Boris & Biesecker, 2007) ( Box 29.2 ). Minor anomalies are features that vary from those seen in the general population but do not cause an increase in morbidity in and of themselves (Stevenson, 2006; Wynshaw-Boris & Biesecker, 2007) ( Box 29.3 ). Take Note! Low-set ears are a minor anomaly that is associated with numerous genetic dysmorphisms. If noted, assess thoroughly for other abnormalities. As the number of minor anomalies present increases, the probability of the presence of a major anomaly increases. In fact, when three or more minor anomalies are present, the risk for a major anomaly or intellectual disability is approximately 20% (Marino & Claybon, 2008). Assess for a recognized pattern of anomalies that may be associated with certain syndromes. Take Note! Cleft lip and cleft palate are associated with many syndromes. If noted, assess for other anomalies. Inspect and observe for an abnormal or foul odor of the child's excretions. Certain metabolic disorders or inborn errors of metabolism are associated with specific odors ( Table 29.1 ). AUSCULTATION Physical examination includes auscultation of the heart. Murmurs or dysrhythmias may have a genetic cause. In a child with a congenital heart problem (e.g., ventricular septal defect) and a strong family history of cardiac structural problems, a genetic cause needs to be considered. PALPATION Palpation can be used to detect hepatosplenomegaly (an enlarged spleen and liver). However, physicians or nurse practitioners usually perform this assessment because it requires skill and experience. Hepatosplenomegaly may indicate a metabolic disorder. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 29.1 explains the laboratory and diagnostic tests used most commonly to detect genetic disorders. The tests can assist the physician or nurse practitioner in diagnosing the disorder or can be used as guidelines in determining treatment. Laboratory or nonnursing personnel obtain some of the tests, while the nurse might obtain others. In either instance the nurse should be familiar with how the tests are obtained, what they are used for, and normal versus abnormal results. This knowledge will also be necessary when providing child and family education related to the testing. Due to the nature of the information, a referral to genetic counseling before testing may be appropriate. Advances in genetic technology, including information obtained from the Human Genome Project, have led to dramatic increases in the number of diagnostic and screening tests (GeneTests, 2010). Nursing Diagnoses, Goals, Interventions, and Evaluation Upon completion of an assessment, the nurse might identify several nursing diagnoses, including: Deficient knowledge (specify) Decisional conflict Risk for delayed growth and development Fear Interrupted family processes After completing an assessment of Julie, the nurse noted the following: short stature for age and a low posterior hairline. Based on these assessment findings, what would your top three nursing diagnoses be for Julie? Nursing goals, interventions, and evaluation for the child with a genetic disorder are based on the nursing diagnoses. Nursing Care Plan 29.1 provides a general guide for planning care for a child with a genetic disorder. Additional information about nursing management will be included later in the chapter as it relates to specific disorders. No matter what the genetic abnormality is, the news may be shattering to the family. It is difficult for nurses to even begin to understand what the family is going through. When providing support and education to families of children with serious genetic abnormalities, use these guiding principles: Build a trusting relationship. Stress the authenticity of the parents' feelings. Reject your own personal biases. Recognize that individuals cope in various ways; the family's behavior may not be what you would expect. Help the family to identify their own strengths and supports, building on those as able. Know that the family's emotions may exhaust and disorganize them. Assist the family members to maintain open communication among themselves. Provide referrals to local parent groups or other families with a child with a similar disorder. Allow the family to verbalize their emotions and ask questions. Always ask the parents how they are doing (Lashley, 2005). Based on your top three nursing diagnoses for Julie, describe appropriate nursing interventions.BOX 29.2 EXAMPLES OF MAJOR CONGENITAL ANOMALIES Cleft lip Cleft palate Congenital heart disease, structural and conduction disorders Neural tube defects, such as myelomeningocele Chromosomal abnormalities Omphalocele Renal agenesis/hypoplasia Limb reduction defects Generalized Specific skin such as cafe-au-lait macules, hypopigmented macules, or cutaneous hemangiomas Adapted from Stevenson, R.

New York: Oxford University Press, Inc.COMMON LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS 29.1 COMMON CHROMOSOMAL ABNORMALITIES Chromosomal abnormalities are seen in about 1 in 150 babies (March of Dimes, 2009a). Many children with chromosomal abnormalities have associated intellectual disabilities, learning disabilities, behavioral problems, and distinct features, including physical birth defects. The risk for autosomal trisomies increases with advanced maternal age (March of Dimes, 2009a). The most common chromosomal abnormalities will be discussed below. New techniques in chromosome analysis allow for the identification of tiny abnormalities that could not be seen before (March of Dimes, 2009a). Therefore, more chromosomal abnormalities are being identified in children ( Table 29.2 ). NURSING CARE PLAN 29.1 Overview for the Child With a Genetic Disorder NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Deficient knowledge related to lack of information regarding complex, technical medical condition; prognosis; and medical needs as evidenced by verbalization, questions, or actions demonstrating lack of understanding about child's condition or care Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child and family will verbalize accurate information and understanding about condition, prognosis, and medical needs: child and family demonstrate knowledge of condition, prognosis, and medical needs, including possible causes, contributing factors, and treatment measures. Intervention: Providing Child and Family Teaching Assess child's and family's willingness to learn: child and family must be willing to learn for teaching to be effective. Provide family with time to adjust to diagnosis: will facilitate adjustment and ability to learn and participate in child's care. Repeat information: allows family and child time to learn and understand. Teach in short sessions: many short sessions are more helpful than one long session. Gear teaching to the child and family's level of understanding (depends on age of child, physical condition, memory) to ensure understanding. Provide reinforcement and rewards: facilitates the teaching/learning process. Use multiple modes of learning involving many senses (written, verbal, demonstration, and videos) when possible: child and family are more likely to retain information when it is presented in different ways using many senses. Refer child and family to a genetics specialist: genetic information is highly technical; the field is advancing at a rapid pace, and information needs to be the most current and accurate. A genetic specialist can provide this along with expertise, support, and resources. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Decisional conflict related to treatment options, conflicting values, and ethical, legal, and social issues surrounding genetic testing as evidenced by verbalization of uncertainty about choices, verbalization of undesired consequences of alternative actions being considered, delayed decision making, physical signs of stress Outcome Identification and Evaluation Family will state they are able to make an informed decision: family will state advantages and disadvantages of choices and share fears and concerns regarding choices. Intervention: Providing Decision-Making Support Give family time and encourage them to express their feelings associated with decision making: the decision-making process becomes more difficult if feelings are not expressed. Encourage family to list advantages and disadvantages of each alternative: aids in problem solving and helps family recognize all alternatives. Initiate health teaching and referral to genetic specialist when needed: genetic testing information is often technical and complex. Families need accurate and up-to- date information to aid in decision making. Maintain a nondirective manner: this is a difficult decision that the family must make for themselves; the nurse should provide all the necessary information while maintaining an unobtrusive role. Validate the family's feelings regarding the decisional conflict: validation is a therapeutic communication technique that promotes the nurse-family relationship. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Risk for delayed growth and development related to physical disability, cognitive deficits, activity restrictions secondary to genetic disorder Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child's growth and development will be enhanced: child will demonstrate adequate growth patterns within parameters of disease. Child will make continued progress toward attainment of developmental milestones and will not suffer regression in abilities. Child will demonstrate developmental milestones within age parameters and limits of disease. Child will make steady gains in growth patterns (e.g., height and weight) within disease parameters. Child expresses interest in the environment and people around him or her and interacts with environment appropriately for developmental level. Intervention: Promoting Growth and Development Screen for developmental capabilities to determine child's current level of functioning. Offer age-appropriate toys, play, and activities (including gross motor) to encourage further development. Perform exercises or interventions as prescribed by physical or occupational therapist: these activities promote function and developmental skills. Provide support to families: due to immobility and extremity deficits, the child's progress toward developmental milestones may be slow. Use therapeutic play and adaptive toys to facilitate developmental functioning. Provide stimulating environment when possible to maximize potential for growth and development. Praise accomplishments and emphasize child's abilities to improve self-esteem and encourage feeling of confidence and competence. Monitor height and weight and plot on growth chart to identify growth patterns and deviations in these patterns. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Fear related to outcome of genetic testing as evidenced by reports of apprehension and increased tension Outcome Identification and Evaluation Family will state they can cope with the results of the genetic testing or demonstrate reduced fear: family accurately discusses chances of offspring having genetic disease, demonstrates positive coping, and asks questions about genetic testing and meaning of results. Intervention: Managing Fear Empathize with the family and avoid false reassurances; be truthful: allows family to recognize that fear is a reasonable response. Giving false information or reassurance will actually increase fear. Explore coping skills used previously by the family to cope with fear. Reinforce these skills and explore other outlets, such as relaxation, breathing, and physical activity: encourages use of coping mechanisms that help control fear. Encourage verbalization of feelings and concerns about genetic testing. Allow time for questions: provides a safe outlet to express feelings and encourages open communication between the family members. Explain all procedures and review results as available: knowledge deficit contributes to fear. Refer to appropriate support groups and genetic counseling: talking with families who have gone through similar situations can help decrease fear and provide methods of coping. Genetic counseling provides information along with support and additional resources. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Family processes, interrupted, related to child's illness, hospitalization, diagnosis of genetic illness in child, and potential long-term effects of illness as evidenced by family's presence in hospital and clinic, missed work, demonstration of inadequate coping Outcome Identification and Evaluation Family will maintain functional system of support and demonstrate adequate coping, adaptation of roles and functions, and decreased anxiety: parents are involved in child's care, ask appropriate questions, express fears and concerns, and can discuss child's care and condition calmly. Intervention: Promoting Family Coping Encourage family to verbalize concerns about child's illness, diagnosis, and prognosis: allows the nurse to identify concerns and areas where further education may be needed and demonstrates family-centered care. Explain therapies, procedures, child's behaviors, and plan of care to parents: understanding the child's current status and plan of care helps decrease anxiety. Encourage parental involvement in care: allows parents to feel needed and valued and gives them a sense of control over their child's health. Identify support system for family and child: helps nurse identify needs and resources available for coping. Educate family about resources available to help them develop a wide base of support. Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of an extra 21st chromosome. It is the most common chromosomal abnormality associated with intellectual disability (March of Dimes, 2009a). One in 800 live births results in trisomy 21 (March of Dimes, 2009a). Approximately 75% of trisomy 21 conceptions result in spontaneous abortion (Chen, 2010). Trisomy 21 is seen in all ages, races, and socioeconomic levels, but a higher incidence is found with a maternal age older than 35 years (March of Dimes, 2009a). The likelihood of having a baby with Down syndrome is 1 in 1,000 in women younger than age 30, 1 in 400 at age 35, 1 in 100 at age 40, 1 in 35 at age 45, and 1 in 12 by age 49 (March of Dimes, 2009a; National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, 2010). Trisomy 21 is associated with some degree of intellectual disability, characteristic facial features (e.g., slanted eyes and depressed nasal bridge), and other health problems (e.g., cardiac defects, visual and hearing impairment, intestinal malformations, and an increased susceptibility to infections). The severity of these problems varies. The prognosis has been improving over the past few decades. Fundamental changes in the care of these children have resulted in longer life expectancy (around 60 years of age) and an improved quality of life (Buckley & Buckley, 2008). Pathophysiology Trisomy 21 is a disorder caused by nondisjunction or translocation before, at, or after conception. Each egg and sperm cell normally contain 23 chromosomes. When they join, this results in 23 pairs or 46 chromosomes. Sometimes an extra chromosome originates in the development of either the egg or the sperm, resulting in an embryo with three chromosome 21's in all cells ( Fig. 29.7 ). This results in the characteristic features and birth defects of Down syndrome. This type and timing of nondisjunction, resulting in the presence of three chromosome 21's in all cells, is responsible for 95% of cases of Down syndrome (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007; Descartes & Caroll, 2007).In approximately 1% of cases of Down syndrome, the nondisjunction occurs after fertilization and a mixture of two cell types is seen (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007; Descartes & Caroll, 2007). In these cases some cells have 47 chromosomes (due to three chromosome 21s), while others have the normal 46 chromosomes (with the normal two chromosome 21s present). This is referred to as the mosaic form of Down syndrome. Children with mosaic Down syndrome may have a milder form of the disorder, but this is not a general finding. FIGURE 29.7 Down syndrome karyotype. Note the third chromosome located at chromosome 21. About 4% of Down syndrome cases involve a translocation, in which part of the number 21 chromosome breaks off during celldivision before or at conception and attaches (or translocates) to another chromosome (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007; Descartes & Caroll, 2007). The cells will remain with 46 chromosomes, but this extra portion of the number 21 chromosome results in the clinical findings of Down syndrome. Cases of translocation are not associated with advanced maternal age, as is the situation with nondisjunction errors. In fact, 25% of cases are the result of a hereditary translocation (Chen, 2010). Therapeutic Management Management of Down syndrome will involve multiple disciplines, including a primary physician; specialty physicians such as a cardiologist, ophthalmologist, and teachers; and, of course, the parents. There is no standard treatment for all children, and there is no prevention or cure. Treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive. The overall focus of therapeutic management will be to promote the child's optimal growth and development and function within the limits of the disease. Managing Complications Children with Down syndrome need the usual immunizations, well-child care, and screening recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. In addition, medical management will focus on complications associated with Down syndrome. Congenital heart disease occurs in 40% to 50% of children with Down syndrome (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007; Chen, 2010). Cardiac problems vary from minor defects that respond to medication therapy to major defects that require surgical intervention. Children with Down syndrome also have an increased incidence of gastrointestinal disorders (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007; Chen, 2010). These disorders vary from those that can be managed by dietary manipulation, such as celiac disease and constipation, to intestinal malformations such as Hirschsprung disease and imperforate anus, which require surgical intervention. Hearing and vision impairments also are common. More than 60% of children with Down syndrome have a hearing loss (Chen, 2010). Therefore, regular evaluation of vision and hearing is essential. Obstructive sleep apnea is present in 50% to 75% of children with Down syndrome (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007). Often parents are unaware their child is having sleep disturbances, so baseline testing in young children may be warranted. Children with Down syndrome have a higher incidence of thyroid disease, which can affect growth and cognitive function (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007; Chen, 2010). Most of these children have hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid), but sometimes hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid) occurs. Periodic thyroid testing may be warranted. Children with Down syndrome are also at a higher risk for obesity and malocclusions (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2007; Chen, 2010). Atlantoaxial instability (increased mobility of the cervical spine at the first and second vertebrae) is seen in about 14% of children with Down syndrome (Chen, 2010). In most cases these children are asymptomatic, but symptoms may appear if spinal cord compression occurs. Screening for atlantoaxial instability may be appropriate, especially if the child is involved in sports. Take Note! If neck pain, unusual posturing of the head and neck (torticollis), change in gait, loss of upper body strength, abnormal reflexes, or change in bowel or bladder functioning is noted in the child with Down syndrome, immediate attention is required. The risk of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is 56 times that of children without Down syndrome, with 1 in 150 children with Down syndrome developing leukemia (Chen, 2010). Children with Down syndrome also have a higher susceptibility to infection and a higher mortality rate from infectious diseases (Chen, 2010; Schoenstadt, 2008). Precautions to prevent and monitor for infection are needed. Other potential complications include alopecia, communication disorders, and seizures. Due to their increased risk for certain congenital anomalies and diseases, children with Down syndrome will need to be monitored closely, and regular medical care is essential. Early Intervention Therapy Early intervention refers to a variety of specialized programs and resources available to young children with developmental delay or other impairment. These programs may involve an array of health care professionals such as physical, occupational, and speech therapists; special educators; and social workers. The programs focus on providing stimulation and encouragement to children with Down syndrome. They help encourage and accelerate development and may help to prevent some developmental delays. The earlier the intervention can begin, the more beneficial it will be. The programs are individualized to meet the specific needs of each child. Children with Down syndrome progress through the same developmental stages as typical children, but they do so on their owntimetable (refer to Table 29.3 for the average age of skill acquisition in children with Down syndrome). For example, children with Down syndrome will learn to walk, but the average child with Down syndrome walks at 24 months (versus 12 months for a child without Down syndrome). Conditions such as hypotonia, ligament laxity, decreased strength, enlarged tongue, and short arms and legs are common in children with Down syndrome, and early intervention can help in the development of gross and fine motor skills, language, and social and self-care skills. Parents also benefit from early intervention programs in terms of support, encouragement, and information. Early intervention programs teach parents how to interact with their child while meeting the child's specific needs and encouraging development. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 1070 . Assessment findings pertinent to Down syndrome are discussed below. Health History Down syndrome is often diagnosed prenatally using perinatal screening and diagnostic tests. If not diagnosed prenatally, most cases are diagnosed in the first few days of life based on the physical characteristics associated with Down syndrome. Identify high-risk deliveries. Explore the pregnancy history and past medical history for risk factors such as: Lack of prenatal care or screening Abnormal prenatal screening or diagnostic tests for Down syndrome (e.g., triple/quadruple screen, ultrasound, amniocentesis) Maternal age older than 35 years The older infant or child known to have Down syndrome is often admitted to the hospital for corrective surgeries or other complications of the disease, such as infections. Elicit a description of the present illness and chief complaint. In an infant or child returning for a clinic visit or hospitalization, the health history should include questions related to: Cardiac defects or disease (treatment regimen, surgical repair) Hearing or vision impairment (last hearing and vision evaluation, any corrective measures) Developmental delays (speech, gross and fine motor skills) Sucking or feeding problems Cognitive abilities (degree of intellectual disability) Gastrointestinal disorders such as vomiting or absence of stools (special dietary management, surgical interventions) Thyroid disease Leukemia Atlantoaxial instability Seizures Infections such as recurrent or chronic respiratory infections, otitis media Growth (height and weight changes, feeding problems, unexplained weight gain) Signs and symptoms of sleep apnea, such as snoring, restlessness during sleep, daytime sleepiness Any other changes in physical state or medication regimen Physical Examination The initial assessment after birth may reveal certain physical features characteristic of Down syndrome ( Box 29.4 and Fig. 29.8 ). Observe the child's general appearance. Note lack of muscle tone and loose joints; this is usually more pronounced in infancy, and the infant has a floppy appearance. Observe growth and development. Plot growth on appropriate growth charts. Because children with Down syndrome grow at a slower rate, special growth charts have been developed (see for an example). When assessing achievement of developmental milestones in children with Down syndrome, it may be more useful to look at the sequence of milestones rather than the age at which they were achieved. Each milestone represents a skill that is needed for the next stage of development. BOX 29.4 COMMON CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF DOWN SYNDROME Hypotonia Short stature Flattened occiput Small (brachycephalic) head Flat facial profile Depressed nasal bridge and small nose Oblique palpebral fissures (an upward slant to the eyes) Brushfield spots (white spots on the iris of the eye) Low-set ears Abnormally shaped ears Small mouth Protrusion of tongue; tongue is large compared to mouth size Arched palate Hands with broad, short fingers A single deep transverse crease on the palm of the hand (simian crease) Congenital heart defect Short neck, with excessive skin at the nape Hyperflexibility and looseness of joints (excessive ability to extend the joints) Dysplastic middle phalanx of fifth finger (one flexion furrow instead of two) Epicanthal folds (small skin folds on the inner corner of the eyes) Excessive space between large and second toe Adapted from Descartes, M., & Carroll, A.

Assess vision, especially for cataracts. Assess respiratory status and cardiac status. Auscultate for murmurs and pulmonary changes, which can indicate congenital heart disease. Chronic or recurrent respiratory infections, such as pneumonia and otitis media, may be found. Laboratory and Diagnostic TestsDown syndrome risk screening can be calculated prenatally between 11 and 14 weeks using ultrasound and blood tests (nuchal translucency and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A [PAPP-A] and human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG]), and around 16 and 18 weeks using triple/quadruple blood tests to detect -fetoprotein (AFP), hCG, estriol, and/or inhibin A levels (Anderson & Brown, 2009). Ultrasound and amniocentesis or chorionic villi sampling (CVS) to detect chromosomal abnormalities can also occur prenatally. Down syndrome can be confirmed after birth using chromosome analysis (see Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 29.1 ). FIGURE 29.8 Child with Down syndrome. Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the diagnosis and assessment of complications associated with Down syndrome include: Echocardiogram: to detect cardiac defects Vision and hearing screening: to detect vision and hearing impairments Thyroid hormone level: to detect thyroid disease Cervical radiographs: to assess for atlantoaxial instability Ultrasound: to assess for gastrointestinal malformations These tests will be important in evaluating the severity of the child's physical disabilities. Nursing Management Due to the high incidence of Down syndrome and the complex medical needs of these children, most pediatric nurses are likely to care for these children in their practice. Nursing management focuses on providing supportive measures such as promoting growth and development, preventing complications, promoting nutrition, and providing support and education to the child and family. In addition to the nursing diagnoses and related interventions discussed in Nursing Care Plan 29.1 , additional considerations are reviewed below. Promoting Growth and Development Children with Down syndrome tend to grow more slowly, learn more slowly, have shorter attention spans, and have trouble with reasoning and judgment. Their personality tends to be one of genuine warmth and cheerfulness along with patience, gentleness, and a natural spontaneity. Growth and developmental milestones for children with Down syndrome have been developed as a guide for physicians and nurse practitioners. Table 29.3 gives examples of the average age at which these children reach selected milestones versus typical children. Thinking About Development A s a nurse in a physician's office, how will your education on safety differ when caring for an infant with Down syndrome compared to a toddler or adolescent? Nurses play a key role in connecting families with appropriate resources that can facilitate the child's growth and development. The sooner early intervention programs can begin, the better for the child (see the above discussion on early intervention). Speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy will be important in promoting the child's growth and development. Special education should fit the child's individual needs, and the child should be integrated into mainstream education whenever possible. Preventing Complications Children with Down syndrome are at risk for certain health problems (see above). Even though most nurses will encounter a child with Down syndrome in their practice, only a few nurses will become experts in their care. The needs of these children are complex, and guidelines have been established that can help the nurse care for these children and their families (these guidelines are available on the National Down Syndrome Society webpage, a link to which is provided on). See also Appendix D at the back of this book. Nurses play a key role in educating parents and caregivers about how to prevent the complications of Down syndrome (see Teaching Guidelines 29.1 and Fig. 29.9 ). Teaching Guidelines 29.1 HEALTH GUIDELINES FOR CHILDREN WITH DOWN SYNDROME Have your child evaluated by a pediatric cardiologist before 3 months of age, including an echocardiogram. Take your child for routine vision and hearing tests. By 6 months have your child seen by a pediatric ophthalmologist. Make sure your child gets regular medical care, including recommended immunizations and a thyroid test at 6 and 12 months and then yearly. Have your child follow a regular diet and exercise routine. Make sure all family members perform proper hand hygiene to prevent infection. Monitor for signs and symptoms of respiratory infections, such as pneumonia and otitis media. Discuss with your physician the use of pneumococcal, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza vaccines. Begin early interventions, therapy, and education as soon as possible. Make sure your child brushes his or her teeth regularly. He or she should visit the dentist every 6 months. Make sure the child gets a cervical radiograph between 3 and 5 years of age to screen for atlantoaxial instability. Adapted from American Academy of Pediatrics, Committee on Genetics. (2007). Health supervision for children with Down syndrome. Pediatrics, 107 (2), 442- 449. Retrieved November 28, 2010, from http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;107/2/442 Promoting Nutrition Children with Down syndrome may have difficulty sucking and feeding due to lack of muscle tone. They tend to have small mouths; a smooth, flat, large tongue; and due to the underdeveloped nasal bone, chronically stuffy noses. This may lead to poor nutritional intake and problems with growth. These problems usually improve as the child gains tongue control. Use of a bulb syringe, humidification, and changing the infant's position can lessen the problem. Breastfeeding a baby with Down syndrome is usually possible, and the antibodies in breast milk can help the infant fight infections. The caregiver's hand can be used to provide additional support of the chin and throat. Speech or occupational therapists can work on strengthening muscles and assisting in feeding accommodations. Other feeding problems and failure to thrive can be related to cardiac defects and usually improve after medical management is initiated or corrective surgery performed. Children with Down syndrome do not need a special diet unless underlying gastrointestinal disease is present, such as celiac disease. A balanced, high-fiber diet and regular exercise are important. Research has suggested that children with Down syndrome have lower basal metabolic rates, which can lead to problems with obesity, so it is important in the early years to develop appropriate eating habits and a regular exercise routine. High fiber intake is important for children with Down syndrome because their lack of muscle tone may decrease gastric motility, leading to constipation.Providing Support and Education for the Child and Family Down syndrome is a lifelong disorder that can result in health problems and cognitive disability. The diagnosis is usually made prenatally or shortly after birth. Parents and caregivers will need support and education during this difficult time. The range of mental impairment varies from mild to moderate; severe deficits occur occasionally. Some families may see having a child with Down syndrome as a lifelong tragedy; others may view it as a positive growing experience. Evaluate how the family defines and manages this experience. Base the plan of care on each individual family's values, beliefs, strengths, and resources. Family members may have trouble meeting the demands of caring for a child with Down syndrome. These children have complex medical needs, which place strain on the family and its finances. From the time of diagnosis, the family should be involved in the child's care. Include parents in planning interventions and care for the child. In most cases they are the primary caregivers and will provide daily care as well as assisting the child in the development of functioning and skills. They can provide essential information to the health care team and will be advocates for their child throughout his or her life. As the child grows, the needs of the family and child will change. Recognize and respect these needs and provide ongoing education and support for the child and family. Children with Down syndrome will need meaningful education programs. Many children with Down syndrome begin formal education in infancy and continue through high school. Full integration has become more common (Schoenstadt, 2008). The outlook is brighter than it once was for children with Down syndrome. Many go on in adulthood to obtain jobs, to receive secondary education, and to live on their own or in semi-independent housing. Be familiar with local and national resources for families of children with Down syndrome so that you can help these children fulfill their potential. An extensive list of helpful resources is provided on . Consider This C harles Faust, a 10-month-old with Down syndrome, is seen in the clinic for a well-child examination. The parents have questions about his growth and development. They are concerned because Charles can't pick up finger foods such as Cheerios and put them in his mouth. How would you address their concerns? Discuss ways the family can encourage Charles's growth and development. In addition to usual well-child care, what other medical management will you want to discuss with the family to prevent complications associated with Down syndrome?FIGURE 29.9 Down syndrome health care guidelines. Trisomy 18 and Trisomy 13 Trisomy 18 (also known as Edwards syndrome) and trisomy 13 (also known as Patau syndrome) are two other common trisomies. These trisomies are much more severe and debilitating than trisomy 21. The incidence of trisomy 18 (the presence of three number 18 chromosomes) is 1 in 6,000 births; the incidence of trisomy 13 (the presence of three number 13 chromosomes) is 1 in 10,000 births (Descartes & Caroll, 2007). Like Down syndrome, trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 usually result from nondisjunction during cell division. Trisomy 18 and trisomy 13 can be present in all cells or may occur in mosaic forms. Both are associated with a characteristic set of anomalies and severe intellectual disability (Descartes & Caroll, 2007). The prognosis for trisomy 18 and trisomy 13 is usually poor; these children usually do not survive beyond the first year of life.There is no cure for trisomy 18 or trisomy 13. Therapeutic management will focus on managing the various congenital anomalies and health issues associated with the disorders. Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment will include a general observation for characteristic anomalies ( Table 29.4 and Figs. 29.10 and 29.11 ). Prenatal screening and diagnostic tests for trisomy 18 and trisomy 13 exist. If not diagnosed during the prenatal period, most cases are diagnosed in the first few days of life based on the physical characteristics associated with the disorders. Nursing Management Nursing management will be mainly supportive. This will be a difficult time for the family, so providing support and resources for the family will be an important nursing function. SOFT is a support organization for families who have had a child with a chromosome abnormality (visit for a link to this resource). Turner Syndrome Turner syndrome is a common abnormality of the sex chromosome. The phenotype is female. It occurs in about 1 in 2,500 to 5,000 live female births (Conley, 2010; Descartes & Caroll, 2007). The abnormality is due to a loss of all or part of one of the sex chromosomes. About half of the affected individuals have only one X chromosome; the other half have a variety of abnormalities of one of their sex chromosomes and may present with the mosaic form. There is no cure for Turner syndrome. Therapeutic management will focus on managing the health issues associated with the syndrome. Children with Turner syndrome are more prone to cardiovascular problems, kidney and thyroid problems, skeletal disorders such as scoliosis and osteoporosis, hearing and eye disturbances, learning disabilities, and obesity (Rapaport, 2007; Watson, 2010). Infertility is usually present, but a few spontaneous pregnancies have been reported (Rapaport, 2007). Growth hormone administration is a standard of care and usually begins when the child's height falls below the fifth percentile for healthy girls. Hormone replacement therapy may also be given to initiate puberty and complete growth. FIGURE 29.10 Trisomy 18.FIGURE 29.11 Trisomy 13. Nursing Assessment On assessment, note patterns of growth; short stature and slow growth will be a characteristic finding and often the first indication. Other physical characteristics include a webbed neck, low posterior hairline, wide-spaced nipples, edema of the hands and feet, amenorrhea, no development of secondary sex characteristics, sterility, and perceptual and social skill difficulties ( Fig. 29.12 ). Turner syndrome can be suspected prenatally by ultrasound findings such as fetal edema or redundant nuchal skin or by abnormal results of the triple or quadruple screen (Bondy, 2007). It can be diagnosed by chromosomal analysis, either prenatally or after birth. Most children are diagnosed at birth or in early childhood when slow growth or growth failure is noted. Some cases will not be diagnosed until the pubertal growth spurt does not occur. Nursing Management Nursing management is mainly supportive. Provide education and support to the family; they need to understand that short stature and infertility are likely. Explain that intellectual disability is unlikely, but some learning disabilities may be present. Emphasize that with medical supervision and support, girls with Turner syndrome may lead healthy, satisfying lives. Counseling about infertility is important. Parents may be upset that their daughter will not be able to reproduce, so explain that many alternatives for reproduction, such as in vitro fertilization and adoption, are available.FIGURE 29.12 Note the webbed neck of the child with Turner syndrome. Providing support and resources for the family is an important nursing function. The Turner Syndrome Society of the United States provides assistance, support, and education to individuals with Turner syndrome and their families. A link to resources is provided on . Klinefelter Syndrome Klinefelter syndrome is the most common sex abnormality (Descartes & Caroll, 2007). The karyotype and phenotype are male, but one or more extra X chromosomes is present. The abnormality is usually caused by nondisjunction during meiosis, but mosaic forms do present. The incidence of Klinefelter syndrome is 1 in 500 to 700 males (Conley, 2010; Descartes & Caroll, 2007). Males present with some female-like physical features that are caused by testosterone deficiency. The risk of recurrence in future pregnancies is not increased. There is no cure for Klinefelter syndrome. Therapeutic management will focus on interventions to enhance masculine characteristics, such as testosterone replacement. Early recognition and hormonal treatment are important to improve quality of life and prevent serious consequences. Cosmetic surgery may be performed to minimize female characteristics such as gynecomastia (increased breast size). Nursing Assessment Due to nonspecific findings during childhood, the diagnosis is not usually made until adolescence or adulthood. Prenatal diagnosis is rare unless amniocentesis was performed for genetic testing. Many males with Klinefelter syndrome go through life without being diagnosed (Descartes & Caroll, 2007). The diagnosis is confirmed by chromosomal analysis. On assessment, lack of development of secondary sex characteristics may be found. The individual may have decreased facial hair, gynecomastia, decreased pubic hair, and hypogonadism or underdeveloped testes, which leads to infertility. The individual may be taller than average by 5 years of age, with long legs and a short torso ( Fig. 29.13 ). Intellectual disability is not present, but cognitive impairments of varying degree, such as motor delay, speech or language difficulties, attention deficits, and learning disabilities, may be found. Nursing Management Nursing management will be mainly supportive. Provide education and support to the family. Links to The American Association for Klinefelter Syndrome, The Klinefelter Syndrome Support Group, and Klinefelter Syndrome and Associates are provided on .FIGURE 29.13 Klinefelter syndrome. Counseling about infertility is important. Educate children and families that marriage and sexual relations are possible. Parents may be upset that their son will not be able to reproduce, so explain that many alternatives for reproduction are available and technology is advancing in the field of infertility. Fragile X Syndrome Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, 2010). It is the outcome of a mutation of a gene (FMR1 [fragile X mental retardation]) on the X chromosome. This mutation essentially \"turns off\" the gene, triggering fragile X syndrome. Males and females are both affected, but it is more commonly seen in males, and affected females usually have milder symptoms (Watson, 2010). The incidence is approximately 1 in 8,000 females and 1 in 4,000 males (Genetics Home Reference, 2007). The inheritance of fragile X is complex and is less straightforward than single-gene or mendelian inheritance. Some carrier females are affected, and not all males with the gene abnormality show symptoms. Males and females are both fertile and can transmit the disorder to their offspring, so genetic counseling is appropriate. The prognosis for individuals with fragile X is good, and they tend to live a normal life span.FIGURE 29.14 Fragile X syndrome. There is no cure for fragile X syndrome. Therapeutic management will be multidisciplinary and aimed at interventions to improve cognitive, emotional, and behavioral impairments. Nursing Assessment During childhood, clinical manifestations are subtle, with minor dysmorphic features and developmental delay. Problems with sensation, emotion, and behavior often are the first signs. A delay in attaining developmental milestones will most likely be the first clue found on assessment. Intellectual impairment can range from subtle learning disabilities to severe intellectual disability and autistic-like behaviors. In adolescence, boys tend to present with characteristic features such as an elongated face; prominent jaw; large, protruding ears; large size; macroorchidism (large testes); and a range of behavioral abnormalities and cognitive deficits ( Fig. 29.14 ). There is a characteristic pattern to the cognitive deficits, with problems in abstract reasoning, sequential processing, and mathematics. Typical behavior problems include attention deficits, hand flapping and biting, hyperactivity, shyness, social isolation, low self-esteem, and gaze aversion. In females the clinical manifestations are similar but are more varied and often present in a milder form. Diagnosis is confirmed by molecular genetic testing. Fragile X can be diagnosed prenatally if inheritance is suspected. Nursing Management Nursing management will be mainly supportive. Early diagnosis and intervention with developmental therapies and an individualized education plan are ideal. Care of these children will be the same as care of other children with intellectual disability (see Chapter 30 for further information on intellectual disability). Provide education and support to the family. The National Fragile X Foundation provides education and emotional support and works to increase awareness and advance research for fragile X.

Many neurologic conditions are associated with cutaneous manifestations, since the skin and the nervous system share a common embryologic origin. They are complex conditions and most also affect other organ systems such as eyes, bones, heart, and kidneys. Most are hereditary and follow an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern or sporadic occurrence. Neurofibromatosis is a common neurocutaneous syndrome and will be discussed in detail below. Table 29.5 provides information on other neurocutaneous syndromes. Neurofibromatosis Neurofibromatoses are neurocutaneous genetic disorders of the nervous system that primarily affect the development and growth of neural cell tissues. There are distinct types: neurofibromatosis 1, neurofibromatosis 2, and schwannomatosis (which used to be considered a variation of neurofibromatosis 2) (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2010). Neurofibromatosis 1 (von Recklinghausen disease) is the more common type and is discussed here (Haslam, 2007; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2010). This disorder causes tumors to grow on nerves and produce other abnormalities such as skin changes and bone deformities. Although many affected persons inherit the disorder, nearly half of the cases are due to a new mutation (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2010). The inheritance pattern is autosomal dominant; therefore, offspring of affected individuals have a 50% chance of inheriting the altered gene and presenting with symptoms. Neurofibromatoses are due to a mutation of the neurofibromin gene on chromosome 17. The estimated prevalence is 1 in 2,500 to 3,000 live births (Tuli, Tuli, Kelly, & Ryan, 2010). Complications associated headaches; hydrocephalus; hearing loss; neurocognitive deficits, including learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, fine and gross motor delays, autism spectrum disorder, and behavior and psychosocial issues; abnormalities of speech; and a higher risk for neoplasms. There is no cure for neurofibromatosis. Therapeutic management is aimed at controlling symptoms and managing complications.Surgical intervention can help reduce some of the bone malformations and remove painful or disfiguring tumors. These children should have a yearly physical, including blood pressure and cardiovascular examination, scoliosis screening, ophthalmology examination, developmental screening, and a neurologic examination. The disease is progressive and symptoms usually worsen over time, but it is difficult to predict the course. Most affected individuals develop mild to moderate symptoms, with non-life-threatening complications, and live a normal, productive life. Nursing Assessment On assessment the nurse may find caf\u00e9-au-lait spots (light-brown macules), which are the hallmark of neurofibromatosis (Haslam, 2007) ( Fig. 29.15 ). These are usually present at birth but can appear during the first year of life and usually increase in size, number, and pigmentation. They are present all over the body, particularly the trunk and extremities, while usually sparing the face. Pigmented are benign tumors, are other signs of neurofibromatosis. Many children with neurofibromatosis have larger than normal head circumference and are shorter than average. Enough features are usually present by 10 years of age to make a diagnosis (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2010). The severity of symptoms varies greatly, but the diagnosis is made if two or more of the clinical signs in Box 29.5 are present. Take Note! If more than six caf\u00e9-au-lait spots are present, neurofibromatosis should be suspected. FIGURE 29.15 Cafe-au-lait spots associated with neurofibromatosis. BOX 29.5 CLINICAL SIGNS OF NEUROFIBROMATOSIS Diagnosis is made if two or more of the following are present: Six or more cafe-au-lait macules (light brown spots) >5 mm in diameter in children and >15 mm in diameter in adolescents and adults Two or more neurofibromas (benign tumors) or one plexiform neurofibroma (tumor that involves many nerves) Freckling in the armpit or groin Presence of an optic glioma (a tumor on the optic nerve) Two or more growths on the iris of the eye (Lisch nodules or iris hamartomas) Abnormal development of the spine (scoliosis), the temple bone of the skull, or the tibia A first-degree relative (parent, sibling, or child) with neurofibromatosis Adapted from National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

Nursing Management Nursing management will be mainly supportive. Early detection of treatable conditions and complications is a priority. Provide support and education to the child and family. Discuss genetic counseling with the family. Referral to appropriate resources is essential. Linksto resources for The Children's Tumor Foundation are provided on .OTHER GENETIC DISORDERS Thousands of genetic disorders are known, and new ones are being discovered, but most of them are rare. Table 29.6 lists other genetic disorders that the pediatric nurse may encounter. Nursing management of these disorders will be mainly supportive and will focus on providing support and education to the family and child, with an emphasis on developmental and educational needs. Referral to genetic counseling and appropriate resources is an important nursing function.INBORN ERRORS OF METABOLISM Inborn errors of metabolism are a group of hereditary disorders. They are collectively common, but individually rare (Weiner, 2009). Most follow an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. They are caused by gene mutations that result in abnormalities in the synthesis or catabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, or fats. The body cannot convert food into energy as it normally would. Most inborn errors are due to a defect in an enzyme or transport protein that results in a block in the metabolic pathway. The blocked metabolic pathway allows for accumulation of the damaging byproduct of the impaired metabolic process or may be responsible for a deficiency or absence of a necessary product. Presentation can occur at any time, even in adulthood, but many affected individuals exhibit signs in the newborn period or shortly after. Most inborn errors of metabolism presenting in the neonatal period are lethal if specific treatment is not initiated immediately. Newborn screening is used to detect these disorders before symptoms develop. Recent developments in screening techniques (tandem mass spectrometry) allow dozens of metabolic disorders to be detected from a single drop of blood (Newborn Screening Authoring Committee, 2008). A child who tests positive will require additional testing to confirm the diagnosis (see Chapter 9 for more information on newborn screening for inborn errors of metabolism). Therapeutic management of these disorders varies depending on the cause of the error of metabolism, but dietary management is often a key component. Nursing Assessment Clinical signs and symptoms vary with each disorder. Table 29.7 gives information on some common inborn errors of metabolism seen in children. See Evidence-Based Practice 29.1 . Take Note! If the blood sample for the newborn screening was obtained within the first 24 hours after birth, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that a repeat sample be obtained within 1 to 2 weeks (Bartoshesky, 2009). EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 29.1 EFFECTS OF GESTATIONAL AGE AND BIRTHWEIGHT ON FALSE-POSITIVE NEWBORN SCREENING RATES Newborn screening tests have improved outcomes and the health of infants and children. However, the rates of false-positive results are a concern. False-positive newborn screening results have been found to be higher among premature infants. What are the effects of gestational age and birthweight on false-positive newborn screening rates? STUDY A retrospective cohort study was conducted utilizing the Ohio State Newborn Screening Program Database; 455,125 newborn screens were reviewed. Gestational age, birthweight, and age in hours at time of collection were extracted.Findings False-positive rates were found to increase as gestational age and birthweight decreased with the exceptions of increased false- positive rates for infants older than 42 weeks' gestational age. Very low-birthweight (VLBW) infants had a 13-fold higher false- positive rate compared with average-weight infants. One in 10 VLBW infants had a false-positive result. The study also found an increase in false-positive results among VLBW infants where specimen collection occurred before 48 hours. Nursing Implications Waiting to collect newborn screen specimens, in infants born at less than 32 weeks' gestation and nontransfused, until 24 to 48 hours postnatal age will potentially reduce false-positive results. Reducing false-positive rates in neonates would lead to decreased parental anxiety, improved cost effectiveness, and enhanced screening efficiency. Further studies are needed to investigate results of newborn screens collected at 48 hours postnatal age in infants born at less than 32 weeks' gestation. Adapted from Slaughter, J. L., Meinzen-Derr, J., Rose, S. R., Leslie, N. D., Chandrasekar, R., Linard, S. M., et al. (2010). The effects of gestational age and birth weight on false-positive newborn-screening rates. Pediatrics, 126(5), 910-916. Because of newborn screening and early identification and management, it is rare to see an untreated newborn with clinical signsand symptoms of disease caused by one of the inborn error of metabolism disorders. If seen, a newborn who was healthy at birth will often present with lethargy, poor feeding, apnea or tachypnea, recurrent vomiting, altered consciousness, failure to thrive, seizures, septic appearance, or developmental delay. Physical changes that may be seen include dysmorphology, cardiomegaly, rashes, cataracts, or cirrhosis. Take Note! When a previously healthy newborn presents with a history of deterioration, suspect an inborn error of metabolism. The diagnostic workup usually requires a variety of specific laboratory studies and may include: Glucose: may be elevated Ammonia: may be elevated Blood gases: may have low bicarbonate and low pH, metabolic acidosis (respiratory alkalosis may also be seen, especially when high ammonia levels are present) Early diagnosis is the key to saving and improving the lives of these children. Take Note! If an inborn error of metabolism is suspected, feedings will usually be stopped until the test results are received. When a child who has previously been diagnosed with an inborn error of metabolism is hospitalized, the nurse must determine the prescribed diet and medications so these may be continued while in the hospital setting. Nursing Management Ensure that the diet prescribed for the infant or child is followed. For amino acid disorders (e.g., phenylketonuria [PKU]), urea cycle defects (e.g., tyrosinemia type I), and organic acidemia (e.g., maple syrup urine disease), nutritional therapy is the major intervention. Dietary intake of specific amino acids is restricted according to the disorder. Ensure that overall protein and calorie needs are still met, as children need sufficient calories for proper growth. In children with urea cycle defects and organic acidemia, anorexia is common and severe, and the child may need gastrostomy tube feeding supplementation. In fatty acid oxidation disorders (e.g., medium-chain acylcoenzyme A [CoA] dehydrogenase deficiency), the goal is to avoid prolonged periods of fasting and to provide frequent feeds when the child is sick. Supplementation with specific vitamins may also be important in the treatment of these disorders. Strict adherence to the diet is necessary and will require close supervision by registered dietitians, physicians, and nurses and the cooperation of both the parent and child. Nursing management will focus on education and support for the family, who will need thorough knowledge about the child's disease and management. Refer the child and family to a dietitian and appropriate resources, including support groups. In addition, monitor the child's developmental progress and begin therapies as soon as a concern arises. KEY CONCEPTS Nurses must understand the pattern of inheritance (which demonstrates how a genetic disorder can be passed onto offspring) so they can teach and counsel families about the risks of future pregnancies. If the defect occurs on the autosome, the genetic disorder is termed autosomal; if the defect is on the X chromosome, the genetic disorder is termed X linked. The defect also can be classified as dominant or recessive. Monogenic disorders include autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked recessive common congenital malformations, such lip, stenosis, clubfoot, congenital hip dysplasia, and cardiac defects, are attributed to multifactorial inheritance. These conditions are thought to be caused by multiple gene and environmental factors. Molecular studies have revealed that some genetic disorders are inherited in ways that do not follow the typical patterns of dominant, recessive, X-linked, or multifactorial inheritance. Examples of nontraditional inheritance patterns include mitochondrial inheritance and genomic imprinting. In some cases of genetic disorders, the abnormality occurs due to problems with the chromosomes. Chromosomal abnormalities do not follow straightforward patterns of inheritance. Medical genetic knowledge has increased dramatically over the past few decades. It is possible not only to detect specificdiseases with genetic mutations but also to test for a genetic predisposition to various diseases or conditions and certain physical characteristics. This leads to complex ethical, moral, and social issues. Physicians and nurse practitioners need to maintain privacy and confidentiality and administer care in a nondiscriminatory manner while maintaining sensitivity to cultural differences. It is essential to respect the child's autonomy and present information in a nondirective manner. The purpose of a genetic consultation is to confirm or rule out genetic conditions, identify medical management issues, calculate and communicate genetic risks to a family, discuss ethical and legal issues, and provide psychosocial support. Nurses play an important role in the counseling process. Many times the nurse is the one who has first contact with these parents and is the one to provide follow-up care. The nurse must be able to identify those who could benefit from genetic counseling and must be able to discuss the role of the genetic counselor with families. Families at risk must be aware that genetic counseling is available before they attempt to have another baby. Nurses play an essential role in providing emotional support and referrals to appropriate agencies, support groups, and resources when caring for families with suspected or diagnosed genetic disorders. Referral for genetic counseling prior to genetic testing may be appropriate. Many children with chromosomal abnormalities have intellectual disability, learning disabilities, behavioral problems, and distinct features, including birth defects. Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) is associated with some degree of intellectual disability, characteristic facial features (e.g., slanted eyes and depressed nasal bridge), and other health problems, such as cardiac defects, visual and hearing impairments, intestinal malformations, and an increased susceptibility to infections. In Turner syndrome, short stature and slow growth are characteristic findings. Klinefelter syndrome is usually diagnosed in adolescence or adulthood due to a lack of development of secondary sex characteristics. Fragile X syndrome's clinical manifestations are subtle during childhood, with minor dysmorphic features and developmental delay. Problems with sensation, emotion, and behavior often are the first signs. Caf\u00e9-au-lait spots (light-brown macules) are the hallmark of neurofibromatosis (Haslam, 2007). Inborn errors of metabolism are caused by gene mutations that result in abnormalities in the synthesis or catabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, or fats. Most inborn errors of metabolism presenting in the neonatal period are lethal if specific treatment is not initiated immediately. Nurses should have a basic knowledge of genetics, common genetic disorders in children, genetic testing, and genetic counseling so they can provide support and information to families and can help improve their quality of life. Genetic disorders usually result in a lifelong complex medical condition. Nurses must provide ongoing education and support for the child and family about the disorder, treatment, and management as well as available resources.

KEY TERMS abuse affect bingeing comorbidity neglect purging suicide violence Learning Objectives Upon completion of the chapter, the learner will be able to: 1. Discuss the impact of alterations in mental health on the growth and development of infants, children, and adolescents. 2. Describe techniques used to evaluate the status of mental health in children. 3. Identify appropriate nursing assessments and interventions related to therapy and medications for the treatment of childhood and adolescent mental health disorders. 4. Distinguish mental health disorders common in infants, children, and adolescents. 5. Develop an individualized nursing care plan for the child with a mental health disorder. 6. Develop child/family teaching plans for the child with a mental health disorder. John Howard, age 6 years, is brought to the clinic for his annual examination. His father states, \"John has frequent emotional outbursts and his mood seems to switch from happy to sad rather quickly. His teachers have said his performance at school has been poor.\" Mental health issues make up the bulk of the \"new morbidity\" of children. Such issues include developmental and behavioral disorders, eating disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and abuse and violence (acts of aggression) directed toward children.As many as one in five children may be suffering from mental health-related problems, yet up to 80% of those children fail to receive the services they need, leading to further academic and social difficulties (American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP], 2011). Mental illness manifested in the early years increases the risk of adolescent emotional issues, use of firearms, reckless driving, substance abuse, and promiscuous sexual activity. Some cognitive or neurobehavioral disorders may have a genetic or physiologic cause, whereas others result from family or environmental stressors. Usually children with cognitive or mental health disorders are treated in the community or on an outpatient basis, but sometimes the disorder has such a significant impact on the child and family that hospitalization is required. Many hospitalized children also suffer from cognitive or mental health disorders. When a child is diagnosed with a cognitive or mental health disorder, the family may become overwhelmed by the multifaceted services that he or she requires. The scope of mental health issues among children, adolescents, and their families has become so extensive that the U.S. Surgeon General has published a \"National Agenda for Action.\" The Surgeon General's Conference on Children's Mental Health has set the following goals: 1. Promote public awareness of children's mental health issues and reduce the stigma associated with mental illness. 2. Continue to develop, disseminate, and implement scientifically proven prevention and treatment services in the field of children's mental health. 3. Improve the assessment of and recognition of mental health needs in children. 4. Eliminate racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in access to mental health care services. 5. Improve the infrastructure for children's mental health services, including support for scientifically proven interventions across professions. 6. Increase access to, and coordination of, quality mental health care services. 7. Train front-line providers to recognize and manage mental health issues, and educate mental health care providers about scientifically proven prevention and treatment services. 8. Monitor the access to and coordination of quality mental health care services (U.S. Public Health Service, 2000). Mental health problems in children are real and painful and can be severe. For affected children to have a chance at a healthy future, nurses must participate in the early identification and referral of children with potential cognitive deficits or other mental health issues.EFFECTS OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ON HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT Children's behavior is influenced by biologic or genetic characteristics, nutrition, physical health, developmental ability, environmental and family interactions, the child's individual temperament, and the parents' or caregivers' responses to the child's behavior. The changes that occur with normal growth and development are often a source of stress for children, and in some children they may lead to dysfunction. Children progress at very different rates, so it is often difficult to identify subtle abnormalities. When stress, fatigue, or pain occurs in children, they may quickly regress to earlier patterns of behavior. These regressive behaviors may continue if a mental health concern is present. It is possible that stress placed on developing neurons leads to decreased coping abilities later in life. Children learn through their experiences. Therefore, they may develop maladaptive behaviors through life interactions (Stafford, 2011).COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS A variety of medications and other medical and psychological treatments are used to treat mental health disorders in children. Most of these treatments will require a physician's or nurse practitioner's order when the child is in the hospital. The most common medications are listed in Drug Guide 30.1 . The nurse caring for the child with a mental health disorder should become familiar with how the treatments and medications work, as well as medication adverse effects to monitor for. Many mental health disorders are treated with some type of therapy, including behavioral, play, family, and cognitive therapy. Table 30.1 reviews the types of therapies commonly used. These therapies are generally carried out only by specially trained personnel. Behavior management techniques are also used to help children alter negative behavior patterns (Nurcombe, 2008). The methods may be used outside of therapy sessions, in the hospital, clinic, classroom, or home. Behavior management techniques include the following: Set limits with the child, holding him or her responsible for his or her behavior. Do not argue, bargain, or negotiate about the limits once established. Provide consistent caregivers (unlicensed assistive personnel and nurses for the hospitalized child) and establish the child's daily routine. Use a low-pitched voice and remain calm. Redirect the child's attention when needed. Ignore inappropriate behaviors. Praise the child's self-control efforts and other accomplishments. Use restraints only when necessary. DRUG GUIDE 30.1 COMMON DRUGS FOR NEOPLASTIC DISORDERS NURSING PROCESS OVERVIEW FOR THE CHILD WITH A MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER Care of the child with a mental health disorder includes assessment, nursing diagnosis, planning, interventions, and evaluation. There are a number of general concepts related to the nursing process that may be applied to mental health concerns in children. From a general understanding of the care involved for a child with a mental health disorder, the nurse can then individualize the care based on specifics for each child. Assessment A careful and thorough health history forms the basis of the nursing assessment of a child with a mental health or cognitive disorder. The physical examination may yield clues to the type of disorder, but the physical examination is often completely normal (except in cases of physical or sexual abuse). Take Note! Observe a child's play or drawings; if the manner or theme of play or nature of the drawings leads you to suspect cognitive or psychological issues, refer the child for further mental health evaluation. Health History Elicit the health history, noting the child's prenatal and birth history, past medical history (including previously diagnosed cognitive or mental health disorders), history of neurologic injury or disease, and family history of mental health disorder. Perform a developmental history, noting age of attainment (or loss) of milestones. Question the child and/or parent about behavior changes such as: Altered sleep Difference in eating patterns, weight loss or gain, change in appetite Problems at school Participation in risk-taking behaviors Alterations in friendships Changes in extracurricular activity participation Note results of any developmental testing performed. Ask the family about progression of the child's skills. Note any unusual deficits or capabilities. Question the family about recent stress, trauma, or change in family structure. Ask if any family members are chronically ill. Note medications the child takes routinely, and ask about any allergies to food, drugs, medications, or environmental agents. Interview the child at an age-appropriate level to determine his or her self-perception, future plans, and stressors and how he or she copes with them. Determine the child's perception of his or her relationship with parents, siblings, friends, peers, pets, inanimate objects, and transitional or security objects. What is the child's predominant mood? Determine whether the child likes himself or herself, asking such questions as \"What do you like most about yourself?\" and \"What would you like to change about yourself?\" Determine whether the child has a sense of pride in his or her accomplishments. Has the child developed an appropriate conscience (with understanding of right and wrong)? Determine the child's gender identity status. Document if the child displays any of the following during the health interview: Hallucinations Aggression Impulsivity Distractibility Intolerance to frustration Lack of sense of humor or fun Inhibition Poor attention span Potential cognitive or learning disabilities Unusual motor activities Note history of physical complaints that may be associated with physical abuse such as burns or other injuries or with sexual abuse situations, such as sore throat, difficulty swallowing, or genital burning or itching. Remember John, the 6-year-old brought in for his annual examination? What additional health history and physical examination assessment information should the nurse obtain? Physical Examination Observe the child's clothing, noting whether it is appropriate for age, developmental level, and setting. Note the child's facial expression and response to the parent or caretaker and the nurse. Does the child make appropriate eye contact? Determine the child's level of consciousness and extent of interest in and interaction with surroundings. Note the child's posture, affect (facial emotional display), and mood. How appropriate to the situation are the child's emotional reactions? Does the child communicate well? Measure the child's weight and height/length, as well as head circumference if he or she is younger than 3 years old. Perform a thorough physical examination, noting any physical abnormalities or signs of other physical health disorders. Note abnormal findings that may be associated with particular mental health disorders, such as bruising, burns, contusions, cuts, abrasions, unusual skin marks, soft/sparse body hair, split fingernails, inflamed oropharynx, eroded tooth enamel, reddened gums, or genitourinary discharge or bleeding. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Mental health disorders are generally diagnosed based on clinical features. However, brain imaging such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging may be used to evaluate for a congenital abnormality or alterations in the brain tissue that may lead to developmental delay. A blood or urine toxicology panel is useful in the diagnosis of drug abuse or overdose, or instances of bizarre behavior. Nursing Diagnoses and Related Interventions The overall goal of nursing management of cognitive and mental health disorders in children is to help the child and family to reach an optimal level of functioning. This may be achieved through interventions designed to decrease the impact of stressors on the child's life. Upon completion of a thorough assessment of the child and family, the nurse might identify several nursing diagnoses, including: Impaired social interaction Delayed growth and development Ineffective individual coping Hopelessness Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements Disturbed thought processes Caregiver role strain After completing an assessment of John, the nurse noted the following: difficulty sitting still for the examination, easily distracted and frustrated, labile mood. Based on the assessment findings, what would your top three nursing diagnoses be for John? Nursing goals, interventions, and evaluation for the child with a mental health disorder are based on the nursing diagnoses. Nursing Care Plan 30.1 provides a general guide for planning care for a child with a mental health disorder. Children's responses to a mental health issue and its treatment will vary, and nursing care should be individualized based on the child's and family's responses to illness. Additional information about nursing management will be included later in the chapter as it relates to specific disorders. See Healthy People 2020. Based on your top three nursing diagnoses for John, describe appropriate nursing interventions.HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov .DEVELOPMENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS Developmental and behavioral disorders make up a large proportion of mental health disorders in children. They include learning disabilities, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Learning Disabilities About 15 million children and adolescents have learning disabilities (Prasher & Kapadia, 2006). About half of the children with a learning disability have at least one other comorbid condition (usually a mental health or behavioral disorder). The National Center for Learning Disabilities (2011) defines a learning disability as \"a neurological disorder that affects the brain's ability to receive, process, store and respond to information.\" Learning disabilities become evident when a child of average intelligence has difficulty mastering basic academic skills. Learning disabilities can affect the child's ability to listen, speak, read, write, and perform mathematics. For example: Children with dyslexia have difficulty with reading, writing, and spelling. Children with dyscalculia have problems with mathematics and computation. Children with dyspraxia have problems with manual dexterity and coordination. Children with dysgraphia have difficulty producing the written word (composition, spelling, and writing). Take Note! Sensory processing disorder may be mistaken for a learning disability, but it is not and should be treated differently (see Box 30.1 ). NURSING CARE PLAN 30.1 Overview for the Child With a Mental Health Disorder NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Impaired social interaction related to altered social skills as evidenced by impulsivity, intrusive behavior, inability to follow through, anxiety, depressed mood, feelings of unattractiveness or unworthiness Outcome Identification and Evaluation The child will demonstrate socially acceptable skills, interacting successfully with peers and in the educational setting, completing tasks as required. Interventions: Promoting Appropriate Social Interaction Identify factors that may aggravate the child's performance to minimize stimuli that exacerbate the child's undesired behaviors. Modify the environment to decrease distracting stimuli as the child's ability to deal with external stimuli may be impaired. Ensure that the child hears his or her name and makes eye contact prior to conversing or instructions so that the child is engaged and has increased ability to follow through. State expectations for tasks or behaviors clearly as understanding is necessary to ensure completion. Provide positive feedback for appropriate behaviors or task completion, encouraging the child to adopt expectations into his behaviors and routine. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Ineffective individual coping related to inability to deal with life stressors as evidenced by few or no meaningful friendships, inability to empathize or give/receive affection, low self-esteem, or maladaptive coping behaviors such as substance abuse Outcome Identification and Evaluation The child will demonstrate improved coping, verbalize feelings, socially engage, demonstrate problem-solving skills. Interventions: Promoting Coping Skills Encourage discussion of thoughts and feelings, as this is an initial step toward learning to deal with them appropriately. Provide positive feedback for appropriate discussion, as this increases the likelihood of continuing performance. Demonstrate unconditional acceptance of the child as a person to increase self-esteem in the child who has been feeling rejection. Set clear limits on behavior as needed so the child has a structure to adhere to. Teach the child problem-solving skills as an alternative to acting-out behaviors. Role model appropriate social and conversation skills so the child can see what is expected in a nonthreatening manner. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements, related to intake insufficient to meet metabolic needs as evidenced by weight loss, failure to gain weight, less-than-expected increases in stature and weight, loss of appetite, or refusal to eat Outcome Identification and Evaluation The child or adolescent will demonstrate appropriate growth, making gains in weight and stature as appropriate. Interventions: Improving Nutritional Intake Provide favorite foods to encourage the child with poor appetite to eat more. Assist families to choose nutrient-rich foods so that the food the child does eat is most beneficial. For the child with an eating disorder: Mutually establish a contract related to treatment to promote the child's sense of control. Provide mealtime structure, as clear limits let the child know what the expectations are. Encourage the child to choose foods and timing of meals to develop independence in eating habits. Ensure the eating environment is pleasant and relaxed, with minimal distractions, to minimize the child's anxiety and guilt about not eating. Withdraw attention if the child refuses to eat: secondary gain is minimized if refusal to eat is ignored. Provide continuous supervision during the meal and for 30 minutes following it so that the child cannot conceal or dispose of food or induce vomiting. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Delayed growth and development related to disability, behavioral disorder, or altered nutrition as evidenced by lack of attainment of age- appropriate skills, regression in skills, or altered intellectual functioning Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will demonstrate progress toward developmental milestones: child expresses interest in the environment and people around him or her, interacts with environment in an age-appropriate way. Interventions: Promoting Development Use therapeutic play and adaptive toys to facilitate developmental functioning. Provide stimulating environment when possible to maximize potential for growth and development. Praise accomplishments and emphasize the child's abilities to improve self-esteem and encourage feelings of confidence and competence. Follow through with physical, occupational, and speech therapists' recommendations to maximize exposure to exercises designed to increase the child's skills. Determine parents' expectations of the child's future achievement to help them work toward these goals. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Disturbed thought processes related to behavioral disorder, depression, anxiety, abusive situation, or substance abuse as evidenced by distractibility, non-reality-based thinking, hypervigilance, or inaccurate interpretation of interactions of others Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child's thought processes will improve: child will demonstrate appropriate orientation, remain free from physical harm, and perform activities of daily living as able. Interventions: Improving Thought Processes Observe for causes of altered thought processes to provide a baseline for assessment and intervention. Perform an age-appropriate mental status examination to determine extent of altered thinking. Adjust communication style based on the child's cues to improve communication. Listen carefully and seek clarification to determine basis for the child's agitation or other behaviors. Provide validation of the child's thoughts and feelings to improve trust in the relationship. Establish a daily routine to provide the child with a sense of security. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Hopelessness related to child's perception of his or her life situation, negative life view, or alteration in mental well-being as evidenced by passivity, verbalization, alterations in sleep, or lack of initiative Outcome Identification and Evaluation Child will display a sense of hope: will verbalize feelings, participate in care, make positive statements. Interventions: Promoting Hope Monitor and document potential for suicide, as hopelessness often leads to suicidal ideation. Assist the child to identify reasons for hope and for living, so the nurse is aware of the child's values. Help the child to set goals that are important to him or her to allow the child to see possibilities. Encourage simple decision making on a daily basis, as hopelessness often occurs as a response to loss of control. Assist the child to identify positive qualities in himself or herself and his or her life to facilitate the development of hope. Involve parents or others the child loves in the child's care as social support is critical to the development of hope. NURSING DIAGNOSIS: Caregiver role strain related to long-term care of the child with a chronic mental health disorder as evidenced by fatigue, inattention to own needs, conflict, or ambivalence Outcome Identification and Evaluation The child's caregiver will participate in the child's care, verbalizing the child's needs and treatment plan and demonstrating skills necessary for care. Interventions: Decreasing Role Strain Teach the parent or caregiver about the child's illness, treatments, and medications to clarify expectations for the child and parent. Role model appropriate interaction behaviors with the child so the parent can learn these techniques by watching. Encourage structure in daily routines to allow the parent to meet his or her own needs and allow for adequate rest. Gradually increase the parent's responsibility related to care of the child to help the parent feel less overwhelmed. Allow the parent to move at his or her own pace in assuming care to enhance the chances for success. Help the parent to identify a back-up caregiver so the parent has times of respite from constant involvement with the child.Therapeutic Management Therapeutic management may involve remedial or compensatory approaches or may use interventions directed toward social- emotional problems. The focus of the remedial approach is to improve specific skills. The compensatory approach helps the child to compensate for the disability, rather than attempting to directly correct it. Social-emotional problems may result from frustration or low self-esteem related to capabilities. These may respond to supportive interventions and improvement in coping. Occasionally they may be as severe as to warrant pharmacotherapy (Tramontana, 2008). BOX 30.1 SENSORY PROCESSING DISORDER (ALSO CALLED SENSORY INTEGRATION DYSFUNCTION) A neurologic disorder in which the child cannot organize sensory input used in daily living Hyposensitivity or hypersensitivity to sensory input Results in overreaction to different textures, decreasing the child's ability to participate in the world Preterm and low-birthweight infants are at increased risk compared with typical infants. Occupational and other therapies may increase the child's ability to function. Adapted from Sensory Processing Disorder Foundation. (2011). About SPD. Retrieved April 13, 2011, from http://www.spdfoundation.net/about-sensory- processing-disorder.html Nursing Assessment Elicit the health history, noting risk factors such as a family history of learning disability, problems during pregnancy or birth, prenatal alcohol or drug use, low birthweight, premature or prolonged labor, head injury, poor nutritional status or failure to thrive, or lead poisoning. Obtain detailed information about the educational difficulties the child is experiencing (e.g., he or she seems to do fine in math but always reverses letters when reading). A thorough physical examination may reveal clues to comorbid conditions. Ensure that the child has undergone a comprehensive education evaluation with assessment testing to diagnose the specific learning disability. Testing may be performed by a school, educational, developmental, or clinical psychologist; occupational therapist; speech and language therapist; or other developmental specialist, depending on the areas of learning with which the child is experiencing difficulty. Take Note! If a child cannot speak in sentences by 30 months of age, does not have understandable speech 50% of the time by age 3 years, cannot sit still for a short story by 3 to 5 years of age, or cannot tie shoes, cut, button, or hop by 5 to 6 years of age, refer the child to be evaluated for a learning disability. Nursing Management Ensure that families are aware of their child's rights under the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA), which was reapproved in 2004 (108th Congress, 2004). IDEA offers protection from discrimination and the right to assistance in the school or workplace. Each child will need an individualized education plan (IEP) that reflects his or her particular needs, which then must be provided for through the school system. Offer encouragement and support to families as they advocate for their child. Follow up at subsequent health care visits to determine that the child is receiving the services he or she needs to optimize his or her potential for success. Refer families for additional resources through the National Center for Learning Disabilities, Learning Disabilities Online, or the Center for Learning Differences (links to these resources are provided on ). Intellectual Disability Intellectual disability refers to a functional state in which significant limitations in intellectual status and adaptive behavior (functioning in daily life) develop before the age of 18 years. Up to 3% of the population may be designated as intellectually disabled (NICHCY National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities, 2011). As defined by the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disability (AAIDD) (2011), intellectual disability includes: Deviations in IQ of two or more standard deviations (IQ of less than 70 to 75) Coexisting deficits in at least two adaptive skills: communication, community use, functional academics, health and safety, homeliving, leisure, self-care, self-direction, social skills, and work Disability occurring before the age of 18 years Long ago persons with intellectual disability (formerly termed mentally retarded) were confined to institutions and were thought to be harmful to society. In the early 21st century, most children with intellectual disability are receiving their education in public schools with their peers and living at home with their families or elsewhere in the community. Only the most severely affected individuals require separate classrooms or schools. Pathophysiology In many instances of intellectual disability the exact cause remains unknown. Prenatal errors in central nervous system development may be responsible. Other potential causes include an insult or damage to the brain during the prenatal, perinatal, or postnatal period. Prenatal exposure to alcohol or other drugs may impact cognitive development as well. Motor problems such as hyper- or hypotonia, tremor, ataxia, or clumsiness, or visual motor problems may occur concomitantly with intellectual disability. In addition, functioning at a higher level may be prevented when a learning disability or sensory processing impairment is also present. Intellectual disability is generally categorized according to severity: Mild: IQ 50 to 70 Moderate: IQ 35 to 50 Severe: IQ 20 to 35 Profound: IQ less than 20 (Council for Exceptional Children, 2011) Therapeutic Management The primary goal of therapeutic management of children with intellectual disability is to provide appropriate educational experiences that allow the child to achieve a level of functioning and self-sufficiency needed for existence in the home, community, work, and leisure settings. A multidisciplinary approach may be used and the child's conceptual, social, practical, and intellectual abilities will drive school placement and the focus of the educational experience. The majority of individuals with intellectual disability require only minimal support in the school or home setting, and these individuals are able to achieve some level of self-sufficiency. Only a few children and adults with intellectual disability require extensive support and require long-term caretaking. Nursing Assessment Perform developmental screening at each health care visit to identify developmental delays early. Elicit the health history, determining the mental and adaptive capacities of the child's parents and other family members. Obtain a detailed pregnancy and birth history. Document sequence and age of attainment of developmental milestones. Note history of motor, visual, or language difficulties. Assess the child's health history for risk factors such as preterm or postterm birth, low birthweight, birth injury, prenatal or neonatal infection, prenatal alcohol or drug exposure, genetic syndrome, chromosomal alteration, metabolic disease, exposure to toxins (e.g., lead), head injury or other trauma, nutritional deficiency, cerebral malformation, and other brain disease or mental health disorder. Note history of or concomitant seizure disorder, orthopedic problems, speech problems, or vision or hearing deficit. For the child with known intellectual disability, assess language, sensory, and psychomotor functioning. Determine the child's ability to toilet, dress, and feed himself or herself. Ask the parents about involvement with school and community services and support. On physical examination note dysmorphic features (possibly very mild) consistent with certain syndromes (e.g., fetal alcohol syndrome; see Box 30.2 ). Evaluate the newborn or metabolic screening results. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the head may be performed to evaluate the brain structure. Thyroid function tests may be ordered to rule out thyroid problems leading to developmental delay. BOX 30.2 FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME Results from in utero alcohol exposure Typical facial features include low nasal bridge with short upturned nose, flattened midface, long philtrum with narrow upper lip Poor coordination, skeletal abnormalities Microcephaly Failure to thrive Hearing loss Adapted from Goldson, E., & Reynolds, A. (2011). Child development and behavior. In W. W. Hay, M. J. Levin, J. M. Sondheimer, & R. R. Deterding (Eds.), Current pediatric diagnosis and treatment (20th ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill. Take Note! Due to the extent of cognition required to understand and produce speech, the most sensitive early indicator of intellectual disability is delayed language development. Nursing Management When children with intellectual disability are admitted to the hospital (usually for some other physical or medical condition), it is important for the nurse to continue the child's usual home routine. Follow through with feeding and motor supports that the child uses. Ensure that the child is closely supervised and remains free from harm. Allow parents time to verbalize frustrations or fears. For some families the caretaking burden is extensive and lifelong; arrange for respite care as available. Support the child's strengths, and assist the child and family to follow through with therapy or treatment designed to enhance the child's functioning. Assist with the development of the child's IEP as appropriate. Autism Spectrum Disorder Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), also termed pervasive developmental disorder, has its onset in infancy or early childhood. One child in 150 is affected by autism spectrum disorder (Inglese, 2009). The spectrum of autism disorder ranges from mild (e.g., Asperger syndrome) to severe. Autistic behaviors may be first noticed in infancy as developmental delays or between the age of 12 and 36 months when the child regresses or loses previously acquired skills. Parental concerns about development may be sensitive indicators of the development of autism. Pathophysiology The exact etiology of autism continues to elude scientists, but it may be due to genetic makeup, brain abnormalities, altered chemistry, a virus, or toxic chemicals. Children with ASD display impaired social interactions and communication as well as perseverative or stereotypic behaviors. They may fail to develop interpersonal relationships and experience social isolation. Many children with autism are intellectually disabled, requiring lifelong supervision, though some are gifted (Rizzolo & Cerciello, 2009). Therapeutic Management There are no medications or treatments available to cure autism. The goal of therapeutic management is for the child to reach optimal functioning within the limitations of the disorder. Each child's treatment is individualized; behavioral and communication therapies are very important. Children with ASD respond very well to highly structured educational environments. Stimulants may be used to control hyperactivity, and antipsychotic medications are sometimes helpful in children with repetitive and aggressive behaviors. Many families are drawn to the use of complementary and alternative medical therapies in attempts to treat their autistic child. They may use vitamins and nutritional supplements, herbs or restrictive diets, music therapy, art therapy, and sensory integration techniques. To date, these therapies have not been scientifically proven to improve autism (Inglese, 2009). Nursing Assessment Elicit the health history, noting delay or regression in developmental skills, particularly speech and language abilities. The child may be mute, utter only sounds (not words), or repeat words or phrases over and over. The parent may report that the infant or toddler spends hours in repetitive activity and demonstrates bizarre motor and stereotypic behaviors. The infant may resist cuddling, lack eye contact, be indifferent to touch or affection, and have little change in facial expression. Toddlers may display hyperactivity, aggression, temper tantrums, or self-injury behaviors, such as head banging or hand biting. The history may also reveal hypersensitivity to touch or hyposensitivity to pain. Assess the child's functional status, including behavior, nutrition, sleep, speech and language, education needs, and developmental or neurologic limitations (Inglese, 2009). Assist with screening, using an approved autism screening tool such as: Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT) Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) Pervasive Developmental Disorders Screening Test-II (PDDST-II) Perform a thorough physical examination. Observe the infant or toddler for lack of eye contact, failure to look at objects pointed to by the examiner, failure to point to himself or herself, failure to let his or her needs be known, perseverative play activities, and unusual behavior such as hand flapping or spinning. Measure growth parameters, in particular noting head circumference (macrocephaly or microcephaly may be associated with ASD). Note the presence of large, prominent, or posteriorly rotated ears. Examine the skin for hypo- or hyperpigmented lesions. Note asymmetry of nerve function or palsy, hypertonia, hypotonia, alterations in deep tendon reflexes, toe-walking, loose gait, or poor coordination. Obtain hearing screening results and ascertain that lead screening has been performed. Take Note! Screen all infants and toddlers for warning signs of autism: Not babbling by 12 months Not pointing or using gestures by 12 months No single words by 16 months No two-word utterances by 24 months Losing language or social skills at any age (Smith, Segal, & Hutman, 2010) Nursing Management When children are initially diagnosed with autism, provide parents with an extensive amount of emotional support, professional guidance, and education about the disorder while they are attempting to adjust to the diagnosis. Assess the fit between the child's developmental needs and the treatment plan. Help parents overcome barriers to obtain appropriate education, developmental, and behavioral treatment programs. Ensure that the child younger than 36 months of age receives services via the local early intervention program and children 3 years and older have an IEP in place if enrolled in the public school system. Stress the importance of rigid, unchanging routines, as children with ASD often act out when their routine changes (which is likely to occur if the child must be hospitalized for another condition). Many special schools exist for children with significant developmental disorders, though some are extremely expensive. Assess the parents' need for respite care and make referrals accordingly. Provide positive feedback to parents for their perseverance in working with their child. Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common mental health disorders diagnosed in childhood: it affects 7% to 10% of all children, and up to 5% of adults (Vessey & Wilkinson, 2008). ADHD is characterized and combined. The child with ADHD has a disruption in learning ability, socialization, and compliance, placing significant demands on the child, parents, teachers, and community. About 50% to 60% of children with ADHD also have a comorbidity (disorder accompanying the primary illness) such as oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, an anxiety disorder, depression, a less severe developmental disorder, an auditory processing disorder, or learning or reading disabilities (Ryan-Krause, 2010a). Comparison Chart 30.1 gives information about oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder to distinguish them from ADHD. Pathophysiology Though the exact cause of ADHD remains unidentified, current thought includes as its etiology an alteration in the dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmitter system. The symptoms of impulsivity, hyperactivity, and inattention begin before 7 years of age and persist longer than 6 months. Symptoms exist in the school and home settings, impairing family and social interactions. Children and teens with ADHD experience frustration, labile moods, emotional outbursts, peer rejection, poor school performance, and low self- esteem. They may also have poor metacognitive abilities such as organization, time management, and the ability to break a project down into a series of smaller tasks. They are not lazy or unmotivated, but simply have poor skills in these areas. Box 30.3 provides criteria for the diagnosis of ADHD (Ryan-Krause, 2010a). Therapeutic ManagementMedication management nonstimulant norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and/or - agonist antihypertensive agents. These medications are not a cure for ADHD, but help to increase the child's ability to pay attention and decrease the level of impulsive behavior. The child's activity level is not usually affected. Behavior therapy and classroom restructuring may be useful as part of the therapeutic management plan. Since ADHD manifests into young adulthood, management should continue throughout adolescence (Vessey & Wilkinson, 2008). Concomitant disorders, such as anxiety, should also be treated (see discussion of anxiety disorders below). COMPARISON CHART 30.1 OPPOSITIONAL DEFIANT DISORDER VERSUS CONDUCT DISORDER BOX 30.3 DIAGNOSIS OF ATTENTION DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER Presence of six or more of the following: Failure to pay close attention Careless mistakes on schoolwork Difficulty paying attention to tasks or play Doesn't listen Doesn't follow through Doesn't complete tasks Doesn't understand instructions Poorly organized Avoids, dislikes, or fails to engage in activities requiring mental effort Loses things needed for task completion Easily distracted Forgetful Presence of six or more of the symptoms of hyperactivity or impulsivity: Fidgety or squirmy Often out of seat Activity inappropriate to the situation Cannot engage in quiet play Always on the go Talks excessively Blurts out answers Has difficulty waiting his or her turn Often interrupts or intrudes on others a Adapted from Ryan-Krause, P. (2010). Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: Part I. Journal of Pediatric Health Care, 24, 194-198. Nursing Assessment For a full description of the assessment phase of the nursing process, refer to page 1107 . Assessment findings pertinent to ADHD arediscussed below. Health History Elicit a description of the behavioral issue or school performance problem. Explore the child's history for risk factors such as head trauma, lead exposure, cigarette smoke exposure, prematurity, or low birthweight. The past history may also reveal a larger than usual number of accidents. Determine if there is a family history of ADHD. Question the parent about school behavior. The school-age child may be unable to stay on task, talks out of turn, leaves his or her desk frequently, and either neglects to complete in-class and homework assignments or forgets to turn them in. The adolescent may be inattentive in school, poorly organized, and forgetful. Several behavioral checklists are available that may assist in the diagnosis of ADHD. They may be completed by the child's teacher and/or parent and focus on behavior patterns related to conduct or learning problems, social competence, anxiety, activity level, and attention. Obtain the completed behavioral checklists (usually one from the parent and one from the teacher) as well as any school records or testing performed. Physical Examination Perform vision and hearing screening to rule out vision or hearing impairment as the cause of poor school performance. Observe the preschool child's behavior, noting quickness, agility, fearlessness, and the desire to touch or explore everything in the room. The older child or adolescent may have difficulty staying on task during the exam or change the subject frequently while conversing. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests No definitive laboratory or diagnostic test is available for the identification of ADHD. A complete blood count may be performed to rule out anemia, and thyroid hormone levels may be drawn to determine whether they are normal. Nursing Management Having a child with ADHD can be frustrating as the child's inattention, high activity level, impulsivity, and distractibility are often very difficult to deal with. Parents may doubt their ability to be effective parents or may view their child as somehow defective. Children with ADHD may also feel they are bad, faulty, stupid, or intellectually challenged. Provide emotional support, allowing enough time for the family to air their concerns. Work with the child and family to develop goals such as completion of homework, improved communication, or increasing independence in self-care. Assist the family to advocate for their child's needs through the public school system. The child is entitled to a developmentally appropriate education via an IEP as necessary (refer to Chapter 12 for additional information about special education). The IEP should be updated as needed. Ensure coordination of health and school services. Flag the child's chart and set up a schedule for systematic communication with the family and school. Teach families and school personnel to use behavioral techniques such as time- out, positive reinforcement, reward or privilege withdrawal, or a token system. The token system rewards appropriate behavior with a token and results in a token being taken away if inappropriate behavior occurs. At the end of a specified period of time, the tokens may be exchanged for a prize or privilege. Refer families to local support groups and the national ADHD support group, links to which are provided on . Explain that stimulant medications should be taken in the morning to decrease the adverse effect of insomnia. Some children may experience decreased appetite, so giving the medication with or after the meal may be beneficial. The child may feel \"different\" from his or her peers if he or she has to visit the school nurse for a lunchtime dose of ADHD medication; this may lead to noncompliance and a subsequent increase in ADHD symptoms, with deterioration in schoolwork. In this situation, encourage the family to explore with their physician or nurse practitioner the option of one of the newer extended-release or once-daily ADHD medications.TOURETTE SYNDROME Tourette syndrome consists of multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics occurring either simultaneously or at different times. Children are not tic-free for longer than 3 months. Tics are defined as sudden rapid recurrent stereotypical movements and/or sounds over which the child appears to have no control. Tourette syndrome is estimated to affect up to 1% of children (Bloch & Leckman, 2008). Its onset is before 18 years of age. Comorbid conditions such as ADHD and obsessive-compulsive disorder occur in 50% of children with Tourette syndrome (Bloch & Leckman, 2008). The exact pathophysiologic mechanism of Tourette syndrome has yet to be identified, though genetics does seem to play a part. Therapeutic management is highly individualized and involves psychopharmacology and behavioral therapies. Habit reversal training may help in some children. Nursing Assessment Evaluate the health history for the occurrence of tics. The child may be embarrassed or ashamed about the tics and the parents may feel fearful, angry, or guilty. Determine the presence of symptoms of comorbid conditions. Elicit the child's past health history, noting a family history of tics. Assess the child's psychosocial history to determine the extent to which the tics interfere with friendship, school performance, and self-esteem. Observe the child for simple or complex motor tics. Vocal tics such as sniffling, grunting, clicking, or word utterance may occur. Perform a thorough physical examination, which is usually normal. Nursing Management Inform families that the tics become more noticeable or severe during times of stress and less pronounced when the child is focused on an activity such as watching TV, reading, or playing a video game. Help the family to build on the child's functional behaviors and adaptive skills to improve the child's self-esteem. Encourage the family to pursue classroom accommodations such as allowing for \"tic breaks,\" taking untimed tests or tests in another room, or using note takers or tape recording. Support the family's decisions related to medication use and therapy and provide appropriate education about the particular drugs and therapies. \"Teaching the Tiger\" by M. P. Dornbush and S. K. Pruitt (Hope Press) is useful for teachers of the child with Tourette syndrome. For additional support, refer families to Tourette Syndrome Association, Tourette Syndrome Foundation of Canada, or Tourette Syndrome Plus (links to these resources are provided on ).EATING DISORDERS Eating disorders include pica, rumination, anorexia nervosa, and bulimia. They affect a significant number of children, especially adolescents. Pica, which occurs most frequently in 2- to 3-year-olds, is an eating disorder in which the child ingests (over at least a 1- month period) a nonnutritive material such as paint, clay, or sand. Rumination is an eating disorder occurring in infants in which the baby regurgitates partially digested food or formula and expels or swallows it. The numbers of children affected by pica and rumination is not known. This discussion will focus on anorexia nervosa and bulimia, as they are more commonly encountered. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia are common eating disorders affecting primarily adolescents, though younger children may also be affected. In American society being thin is highly valued, which compounds the problem. Anorexia nervosa occurs in about 1% to 2% of adolescents; bulimia affects about 2% to 4% (Sigel, 2011). Anorexia nervosa is characterized by dramatic weight loss as a result of decreased food intake and sharply increased physical exercise. Bulimia refers to a cycle of normal food intake, followed by binge- eating and then purging. Typically, the adolescent with bulimia remains at a near-normal weight. Complications of anorexia and bulimia include fluid and electrolyte imbalance, decreased blood volume, cardiac arrhythmias, esophagitis, rupture of the esophagus or stomach, tooth loss, and menstrual problems. The mortality rate for anorexia may be as high as 18% (Sigel, 2011). Therapeutic management may occur in either the inpatient or outpatient setting. In either case, a multidisciplinary approach including individual and family therapy as well as nutritional therapy is needed for the best chance at successful treatment. Atypical antipsychotics may be helpful with body image delusions, and later in therapy antidepressants may be useful (Sigel, 2011). Nursing Assessment Determine the health history, noting risk factors such as family history, female gender, Caucasian race, preoccupation with appearance, obsessive traits, or low self-esteem. Adolescents with anorexia may have a history of constipation, syncope, secondary amenorrhea, abdominal pain, and periodic episodes of cold hands and feet. Parents usually note the chief complaint as weight loss. Note history of depression in the child with bulimia. Evaluate the child's self-concept, noting multiple fears, high need for acceptance, disordered body image, and perfectionism. Perform a thorough physical examination. The anorexic is usually severely underweight, with a body mass index (BMI) of less than 17. Note cachetic appearance, dry sallow skin, thinning scalp hair, soft sparse body hair, and nail pitting. Measure vital signs, noting low temperature, bradycardia, or hypotension. Auscultate the heart, noting murmur as a result of mitral valve prolapse (occurs in about one third of adolescents with anorexia). The adolescent with bulimia will be of normal weight or slightly overweight. Inspect the hands for calluses on the backs of the knuckles and split fingernails. Inspect the mouth and oropharynx for eroded dental enamel, red gums, and inflamed throat from self- induced vomiting. Careful laboratory and diagnostic evaluation of serum electrolytes and an electrocardiogram are needed in adolescents with anorexia because severe electrolyte disturbances and cardiac arrhythmias often occur. Nursing Management Most children with eating disorders can be treated successfully on an outpatient basis, though this treatment may require many months. Those with anorexia who display severe weight loss, unstable vital signs, food refusal, or arrested pubertal development or who require enteral nutrition will need to be hospitalized. Refeeding syndrome (cardiovascular, hematologic, and neurologic complications) may occur in the severely malnourished adolescent with anorexia if rapid nutritional replacement is given. Therefore, slow refeeding is essential to avoid complications. Give phosphorus supplements as ordered. Assess vital signs frequently for orthostatic hypotension, irregular and decreased pulse, or hypothermia. Consult the nutritionist for assistance with calculating caloric needs and determining an appropriate diet. Aim for a weight gain goal of 0.5 to 2 lbs per week. Instruct the child and family to keep a daily journal of intake, bingeing (excessive consumption) and purging (forced vomiting) behaviors, mood, and exercise. The journal may be used as an assessment tool as well as to document progress toward recovery. Assist the child and family to plan a suitably structured routine for the child that includes meals, snacks, and appropriate physical activity. Use the physical findings associated with anorexia to educate the child about the consequences of malnutrition and how they can be remedied with adequate nutrient intake. Refer the adolescent, as appropriate, to behavior or group therapy. Assess the child's need for medical intervention for concomitant depression or anxiety (some anorexics also require psychotropic medications). Provide emotional support and positive reinforcement to the child and family. Refer the family to local support groups or online resources such as the Academy for Eating Disorders or the National Eating Disorders Association (links to these resources are provided on ). See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Consider This N icole Ashton, 16 years old, is seen in your clinic due to weight loss. Her mother states that she has lost noticeable weight over the past few months and has stopped menstruating. What additional assessment information would be necessary? After further examination it is determined that Nicole has anorexia nervosa. Her treatment is to take place on an outpatient basis beginning immediately. Discuss ways the family can encourage and assist in Nicole's recovery.MOOD DISORDERS Mood disorders in children include depressive disorders and bipolar disorder. Up to 3% of children and 6% of adolescents may suffer from depression at any one time (Lack & Green, 2009). Children may experience major depressive disorder or dysthymic disorder. Girls are twice as likely to be affected as boys, particularly during the teenage years. Bipolar disorder refers to a condition of alternating manic and depressive episodes and affects about 1% of children (Lack & Green, 2009). During the manic episode, mood is significantly elevated and the child displays excess energy. Depression may cause significant alterations in school performance and social relationships. Anxiety disorders and disruptive behavior may occur together with depression. Substance abuse may also occur concurrently with depression. Divorce and serious family issues may contribute to the development of depression because of the ongoing stress they place on the child and their strong psychological impact. Children and adolescents experiencing depressive episodes may harm themselves purposefully (without intent to kill themselves). They may hit, cut, or burn themselves (Swannell, Martin, Scott, Gibbons, & Gifford 2008). Additionally, depressed children are at risk for suicide. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance 2008 Report revealed that 15% of teens had seriously considered suicide, 11% had a plan, and 7% had attempted suicide (CDC, 2009). Pathophysiology Both norepinephrine and dopamine play a role in mood. Norepinephrine is considered to be important in the areas of energy and alertness, while dopamine is important in the areas of pleasure and motivation. When alterations in the neurotransmission of norepinephrine and dopamine occur, the symptoms of depression (apathy, loss of interest, and pleasure) result. Decreased levels of serotonin have also been implicated in depressive symptoms. Development of a depressive disorder may also be related to genetics, behavior, or cognitive function. Children of parents with a depressive disorder are at an increased risk for developing one themselves. Maladaptive cognitive functions or lack of social skills resulting in negative feelings may also play a role (Lack & Green, 2009). Therapeutic Management Children with mood disorders usually benefit from psychotherapy. This helps the child to deal with the psychosocial consequences of his or her behavior on his or her interpersonal relationships with others. Crisis management, parental counseling, and individual, group, or family therapy may be useful. Major depressive disorder warrants the use of pharmacologic antidepressants. Bipolar disorder may be treated with neuroleptic agents or mood stabilizers (Nurcombe, 2008). Nursing Assessment Children with untreated depression are at high risk for suicide as well as the development of comorbid disorders such as anxiety disorders, substance abuse, eating disorders, self-harm, and disruptive behavioral disorders (such as conduct disorder or ADHD) (Stafford, 2011). The nurse must screen all children for the development of depression. Health History Obtain a health history from the child and separately from the parent. Evaluate the child for history of recent changes in behavior, changes in peer relationships, alterations in school performance, withdrawal from previously enjoyed activities, sleep disturbances, changes in eating behaviors, increase in accidents, or sexual promiscuity. If possible, use a standardized depression screening questionnaire; there are many available. Ask about potential stressors such as school concerns, conflicts with parents, dating issues, and abuse (physical or sexual). When bipolar disorder is suspected, the history may reveal rapid, pressured speech; increased energy; decreased sleep; flamboyant behavior; or irritability during manic episodes. Note history of weight loss, failure to thrive, or increased incidence of infections in the infant. For the toddler, note delay or regression in developmental skills, increase in nightmares, or parental reports of clinginess. The preschooler may have a history of loss of interest in newly acquired skills; manifest encopresis, enuresis, anorexia, or binge-eating; or make frequent negative self-statements. The parents of a school-age child may report that he or she has a depressed, irritable, or aggressive mood. Assess for risk factors for suicide, which include: Previous suicide attempt Change in school performance, sleep, or appetite Loss of interest in formerly favorite school or other activities Feelings of hopelessness or depression Statements about thoughts of suicide Physical Examination Observe the infant for weepiness, withdrawn behaviors, or a frozen facial expression. Note a sad or expressionless face in the toddler or preschooler. In any age child, observe for apathy. Inspect the entire body surface for self-inflicted injuries (such as cuts or burns), which may or may not be present. The remainder of the physical examination is generally normal unless the depressed child also has a chronic medical condition. Nursing Management Nursing management of children and adolescents with mood disorders focuses on education and support, and prevention of depression and suicide. Educating and Supporting the Child and Family Teach families that mood disorders are biologic conditions, not personality flaws. Teach families how to administer antidepressant medication and to monitor for adverse effects. Encourage and praise the child's and family's efforts at following through with cognitive and behavioral therapies. Support the family throughout the process, as sometimes treatment may be lengthy. Refer parents to local support resources or to the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance or the Child and Adolescent Bipolar Foundation. Links to these resources are provided on . Preventing Depression and Suicide Establish a trusting relationship with the children and adolescents with whom you interact, particularly in the primary care setting, school, or chronic illness clinic. This trusting relationship may encourage children or adolescents to confide feelings or problems earlier than they may do with their parents. Screen all healthy and chronically ill preteens and teens for the development of depression (Stafford, 2011). Use standardized screening tools such as those listed in Box 30.4 . When a potential problem is identified, immediately refer the child for mental health assessment and intervention. It is important to identify depression early so that treatment can start. When a grief-inducing event is impending (such as the death of a family member), begin preventive intervention to help the child to deal with it. Provide appropriate observation for any child exhibiting suicidal ideation. See Healthy People 2020. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Take Note! Closely observe children taking antidepressants for the development of presuicidal behavior. BOX 30.4 SCREENING TOOLS FOR DEPRESSION The following tools are used to screen for depression. Links to each of these screening tools are provided on Pointy . Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale Modified for Children (CES-DC) Weinberg Depression Scale for Children and Adolescents (WDSCA) Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) Beck Depression Inventory for Youth (BDI-Y)ANXIETY DISORDERS Anxiety disorders are the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric conditions among children and adolescents. In fact, as many as 4% to 20% of children experience at least one anxiety disorder (Connolly & Nanayakkara, 2010). Anxiety often occurs together with other mental health disorders, especially depression. Normal children experience fear, worry, and shyness. Infants fear loud noises, being startled, and strangers. Toddlers are afraid of the dark and of separation. Preschoolers fear imaginary creatures and body mutilation. School-age children worry about injury and natural events, whereas adolescents are anxious about school and social performance. These normal fears produce a certain level of anxiety that is tolerated by most children, but it is important to distinguish normal developmentally appropriate anxiety from an anxiety disorder. Anxiety is considered to be a reaction to a perceived or actual threat. The threat may or may not be distorted by the child, and the emotional distress leads to behavioral responses. The \"fight-or-flight\" response results in tachycardia, increased blood pressure, sweating, enhanced arousal and reactivity, tremors, and increased blood flow to the muscles (Keeley & Storch, 2009). Types of Anxiety Disorders Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by unrealistic concerns over past behavior, future events, and personal competence. Social phobia is a disorder characterized by the child or teen demonstrating a persistent fear of speaking or eating in front of others, using public restrooms, or speaking to authorities. Selective mutism refers to a persistent failure to speak. Separation anxiety is more common in children than adolescents. In this disorder, the child may need to remain close to the parents, and the child's worries focus on separation themes. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by compulsions (repetitive behaviors such as cleaning, washing, or checking something), which the child performs to reduce anxiety about obsessions (unwanted and intrusive thoughts). Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that occurs after a child experiences a traumatic event, later experiencing physiologic arousal when a stimulus triggers memories of the event (Keeley & Storch, 2009). Pathophysiology Anxiety disorders are thought to occur as a result of disrupted modulation within the central nervous system. Underactivation of the serotonergic system and overactivation of the noradrenergic system are thought to be responsible for dysregulation of physiologic arousal and the resulting emotional experience. Disruption of the -aminobutyric acid (GABA) system may also play a role. Genetic factors may also play a role in the development of anxiety disorders, as may family and environmental influences. Additionally, abnormal thoughts or behaviors may have been learned through observation or conditioning (Keeley & Storch, 2009). Therapeutic Management Therapeutic management of anxiety disorders generally involves the use of pharmacologic agents and psychological therapies. Anxiolytics or antidepressants are the most common pharmacologic approaches. Cognitive-behavioral therapy; individual, family, or group psychotherapy; and other behavioral interventions such as relaxation techniques may also be useful (Keeley & Storch, 2009). See Evidence-Based Practice 30.1 . EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 30.1 BEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER STUDY Behavioral or cognitive-behavioral therapy (BT/CBT) is often recommended for children and adolescents with obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD). The authors reviewed studies comparing BT/CBT with no treatment or in combination with pharmacotherapeutics for OCD. Four studies with 222 total participants were included in the review. Findings Participants who underwent BT/CBT demonstrated better posttreatment functioning and reduced risk of continuing with OCD as compared with those receiving no BT/CBT. Evidence surfaced that BT/CBT combined with medication was superior totreatment with medication alone. The dropout rate during therapy was low, indicating acceptance by participants and their families. Nursing Implications Encourage families to explore the possibility of adding BT/CBT to the treatment plan. Assist families with finding an appropriate provider of BT/CBT in their local area. Praise children and families for ongoing dedication to BT/CBT. Continue to offer emotional support to all members of the family throughout the treatment process. Adapted from O'Kearne, R. T., Ansley, K. J., & von Sanden, C. (2006). Behavioural and cognitive behavioural therapy for obsessive compulsive disorder in children and adolescents. The Cochrane Library 2006, 4. Indianapolis, NY: John Wiley & Sons. Nursing Assessment Children and adolescents do not usually express anxiety directly. Therefore, it is very important for the nurse to evaluate somatic complaints and perform a careful health history. Health History Explore the child's current and past medical history for risk factors such as depression, anxious temperament, family history of anxiety disorders, certain environmental or life experiences (such as parental dysfunction or significant stressful event or trauma), or unstable parental attachment. Elicit the health history, noting history of social inhibition, panic, or \"heart racing.\" Young children may display overactivity, acting out, sleep difficulties, or separation issues. Older children may describe feelings of nervousness, anger, fear, or tension and may display disruptive behavior. Ask the child to choose a number on a scale from 0 to 10 to describe how much he or she worries about things. Have the parent rank the child's worry in the same fashion, and ask the parent what the child worries about most. Determine frequency of headaches and stomachaches. Use a standardized screening tool such as the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC), Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SACS), Preschool Anxiety Scale, and Beck Anxiety Inventory for Youth. Links to each of these screening tools are available on . Physical Examination Perform a complete physical examination to rule out physiologic causes of the child's symptoms. Note patches of hair loss that occur with repetitive hair twisting or pulling associated with anxiety. Evaluate for evidence of nail biting, sucking blisters, or skin erosion from finger rubbing. Inspect the entire body for signs of self-injury, which may or may not be present. Nursing Management Screen children at well-child or other health care visits, as well as upon admission to the hospital, for anxiety symptoms. If an anxiety disorder is suspected, refer the child to the appropriate mental health provider for further evaluation. When the child is diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and medication is prescribed, teach families about medication administration and adverse effects. Encourage and praise them for follow-through related to cognitive and behavioral therapy or psychotherapy. Provide emotional support to the child and family. Assess the family for the presence of parental anxiety or insecure attachment. Note parenting style and parent-child interactions. Not only the child but also the family will benefit from interventions that improve parent-child relationships, decrease parental anxiety, and foster parenting skills that promote autonomy in the child. Thus, refer the child and family to concurrent family therapy if needed.ABUSE AND VIOLENCE Abuse and violence contribute significantly to mental illness in children. Children may suffer from child maltreatment, M\u00fcnchausen syndrome, or substance abuse. Child Maltreatment Child maltreatment includes physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect. Physical abuse refers to injuries that are intentionally inflicted on a child and result in morbidity or mortality. Sexual abuse refers to involvement of the child in any activity meant to provide sexual gratification to an adult. Emotional abuse may be verbal denigration of the child or occur as a result of the child witnessing domestic violence. Neglect is defined as failure to provide a child with appropriate food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and schooling (Antonia & Sirotnak, 2011). Statistics related to family violence as well as child physical and sexual abuse are difficult to determine, as the perpetrator usually forces the victim into silence. Children usually do not want to admit that their parent or relative has hurt them, partly from feelings of guilt and partly because they do not want to lose that parent. In 2008, 44.1 referrals to child protective services were made per 100 children, yet this may be an underestimate of the prevalence of child abuse (Antonia & Sirotnak, 2011). Abuse and violence occur across all socioeconomic levels but are more prevalent among the poor (Antonia & Sirotnak, 2011). Despite the lack of adequate statistics, it is well known that the problem of abuse and violence is widespread. Parents or caregivers are the most frequent perpetrators of abuse against children (Antonia & Sirotnak, 2011). A history of childhood abuse is associated with the development of depressive disorders, suicidal ideation and attempts, anxiety disorders, and alcohol and drug use. Abuse may result in significant physical injury, poor physical health, and, in some cases, impaired brain development. Being a victim of abuse places children at risk for low self-esteem, poor academic achievement, poor emotional health, and social difficulties. Additional long-term consequences include juvenile delinquency and perpetuation of the violence cycle (Child Welfare Information Gateway, 2008). Therapeutic management of victims of abuse and violence involves physical treatment of the injury, palliative care in some cases, and intervention to preserve or restore the child's mental well-being as well as family functioning. To protect children, all states require by law that health care professionals report suspected cases of child abuse or neglect (Child Welfare Information Gateway, 2010). Nursing Assessment Elicit the health history, noting the chief complaint and timing of onset. Assess for appropriateness of the parent-child attachment (often altered in the case of neglect). Pay particular attention to statements made by the child's parent or caretaker. Is the history given consistent with the child's injury? Identify abuse and violence by screening all children and families using these questions: Questions for children: Are you afraid of anyone at home? Who could you tell if someone hurt you or touched you in a way that made you uncomfortable? Has anyone hurt you or touched you in that way? Questions for parents: Are you afraid of anyone at home? Do you ever feel like you may hit or hurt your child when frustrated? Assess for risk factors in children and parents or caretakers. Risk factors for abuse in children include poverty, prematurity, cerebral palsy, chronic illness, or intellectual disability. Risk factors for being abusers in parents or caretakers include a history of being abused themselves, alcohol or substance abuse, or extreme stress. Determine if the child has a history of hurting self or others (e.g., cutting), running away, attempting suicide (taking one's own life), or being involved in high-risk behaviors. Note inappropriate sexual behavior for developmental age, such as seductiveness, as this may indicate sexual abuse. Note history of chronic sore throat or difficulty swallowing, which may occur with forced oral sex or sexually transmitted infections. Document history of genital burning or itching (associated with sexual abuse). Note nonspecific symptoms of emotional abuse such as low self-confidence, sleep disturbance, hypervigilance, headaches, or stomachaches. Take Note! A delay in seeking medical treatment, a history that changes over time, or a history of trauma that is inconsistent with the observed injury all suggest child abuse.Physical Examination Perform a gentle but thorough physical examination, using a soft touch and calm voice. Observe the parent-child interaction, noting fear or an excessive desire to please. Note the infant's level of consciousness. Vigorous shaking in the infant leads to intracranial hemorrhage and shaken baby syndrome. Inspect the skin for bruises, burns, cuts, abrasions, contusions, scars, and any other unusual or suspicious marks. Current or healed scratches or cuts may be found on parts of the body ordinarily covered by clothing in the child who self-mutilates. Burns that occur in a stocking or glove pattern, or only to the soles or palms, are highly suspicious for inflicted burns. Injuries in various stages of healing are also indicative of abuse. Bruises on the chest, head, neck, or abdomen are suspicious for abuse. Nonambulatory children infrequently experience bruises or fractures. Figure 30.1 shows injury sites usually indicative of abuse; Figure 30.2 is a photograph of a child who was beaten with an electric cord. Observe for inflammation of the oropharynx (may occur with forced oral sex). Inspect the anus and penis or vaginal area for bleeding or discharge (which may indicate sexual abuse). FIGURE 30.1 Injury sites that are suspicious for abuse.FIGURE 30.2 Note the mark left from a looped electric cord. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests Common laboratory and diagnostic studies ordered for the assessment of abuse include: Radiographic skeletal survey or bone scan may reveal current or past fractures. Computed tomography scan of the head may reveal intracranial hemorrhage. Rectal, oral, vaginal, or urethral specimens may reveal sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea or chlamydia. Nursing Management Refer suspected cases of neglect or abuse to the local child protection agency. When abusive activity is identified in the hospital, notify the social services and risk management departments. In addition to physical or palliative care needed for the injuries, abused children need to redevelop a sense of trust in adults. Provide consistent care to the abused child by assigning a core group of nurses. Child abuse requires a multidisciplinary approach that may include psychological therapy for the child and family. Role model appropriate caretaking activities to the parent or caregiver. Call attention to normal growth and development activities noted in the infant or child, as sometimes parents have expectations of child behavior that may be unrealistic based on the child's age, leading to the abuse. Praise parents and caretakers for taking appropriate steps toward getting help and for providing appropriate care to the child. Refer parents to Parents Anonymous, an organization dedicated to the prevention of child abuse through strengthening of the family (see for a link to this website). When it is determined by the child protective team that the child would be in danger to continue living in the current situation, the child may be removed from the home. If the child is removed from the family temporarily or permanently, provide the foster or adoptive family with education necessary to assume the child's care. M\u00fcnchausen Syndrome by Proxy M\u00fcnchausen syndrome by proxy (MSBP) is a type of child abuse in which the parent creates physical and/or psychological symptoms of illness or impairment in the child. The adult meets his or her own psychological needs by having an ill child. MSBP is difficult to detect and may remain hidden for years. In most cases, the biologic mother is the perpetrator (Mason & Poirier, 2010). Therapeutic management focuses on ensuring the safety and well-being of the child, as well providing psychotherapy for the perpetrator. Nursing Assessment Take a thorough and detailed health history of the child's illness or illnesses. Use quotations to document the parent's responses. Warning signs of MSBP include: Child with one or more illnesses that do not respond to treatment or that follow a puzzling course; a similar history in siblings Symptoms that do not make sense or that disappear when the perpetrator is removed or not present; the symptoms are witnessed only by the caregiver (e.g., cyanosis, apnea, seizure) Physical and laboratory findings that do not fit with the reported history Repeated hospitalizations failing to produce a medical diagnosis, transfers to other hospitals, discharges against medical advice Parent who refuses to accept that the diagnosis is not medical (Antonia & Sirotnak, 2011; Mason & Poirier, 2010) Observe the mother's behavior with the child, spouse or partner, and staff. Use of covert video surveillance may reveal maternal actions causing illness in the child when the nurse, physician, or nurse practitioner is not in the room. Perform a thorough physical examination, noting where the physical examination findings differ from the reported health history. Nursing Management Management of MSBP is complex. When abusive activity is identified, notify the social services and risk management departments of the hospital. Ensure that the local child protection team and the caregiver's family or support system is present when the caregiver is confronted. Inform the caregiver of the plan of care for the child and of the availability of psychiatric assistance for the caregiver. Substance Abuse Substance use most often begins before age 20. Among eighth graders, 18% report having been drunk at least once prior to high school, and over 75% of teenagers report alcohol use before high school graduation (Kaul, 2011). In addition to alcohol, youths also use marijuana, cocaine, injectable illegal drugs such as heroin, hallucinogenic drugs, methamphetamines, inhalants, and Ecstasy (Kaul, 2011). Nursing Assessment Note risk factors for substance abuse, such as family history of substance abuse, current parental substance use, dysfunctional family relationships, concurrent mental health disorder, aggressive behaviors, low self-esteem or poor academic performance, negative life events, poor social skills, or peers who use substances. Determine the child's history, noting altered school performance or attendance, changes in peer group participation, frequent mood swings, changes in physical appearance, or an altered relationship with or perception of parents. Document history of insomnia, appetite loss, excessive itching, sleepiness or extreme fatigue, dry mouth, or shakiness. Note violent behavior, drunkenness, stupor, blank expression, drowsiness, lack of coordination, confusion, incoherent speech, extremes in emotions, aggressive behavior, silly behavior, or rapid speech. Perform a complete physical examination. Observe for an odor of alcohol or marijuana smoke. Assess the eyes, noting wateriness or dilated pupils. Inspect the nares, noting rhinorrhea or absence of nasal hair. Inspect the fingers for glue smears or discoloration and the skin for needle marks or tracks. Palpate the hands and feet for coolness. Laboratory and diagnostic tests include toxicology studies, such as urine screening, to determine the presence of stimulants, sedative-hypnotics, barbiturates, Quaaludes, opiates, cocaine, and marijuana. Nursing Management Help the adolescent to acknowledge that he or she has a problem. Explain the negative consequences of substance use and raise the teen's awareness of risks. Remain empathetic, yet leave responsibility with the adolescent. Key nursing interventions include promoting participation in treatment programs and preventing substance abuse. Promoting Participation in Treatment Programs Refer the adolescent to a substance abuse program. Outpatient or day treatment programs are useful in most situations. Family-based programs produce the highest level of recovery. Self-help or 12-step groups are an important element in the recovery process. Serious addiction, the presence of one or more comorbid psychiatric conditions, or suicidal ideation requires residential treatment or hospitalization. See Healthy People 2020. Preventing Substance Abuse Establish a trusting relationship with children and adolescents in order to improve acceptance of education about substance use and to provide a safe environment for confiding about their problems. Screen all children and adolescents for risk factors. During routine psychosocial screening, be alert to alterations as noted earlier. Teach all children, beginning at the elementary school level (or earlier in some high-risk communities), that all chemicals have the potential to be harmful to the body, including tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs. Educate children and adolescents that no matter which administration route is used, the drug still enters the body and affects it(negatively). Help children to learn problem-solving skills that they can call upon in the future rather than relying on drugs or other substances to avoid their problems. Teach children to \"just say no.\" Reinforce that they are the ones who have control over their body and what they expose it to. Encourage children to participate in the local community DARE program (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) and praise them for completing it. Teach parents that being involved in their child's social life and knowing where they are and with whom when they are outside of the home is an important step toward limiting substance exposure. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . KEY CONCEPTS Mental health and behavioral disorders account for the bulk of the \"new morbidity\" among children and adolescents. The child with behavioral problems or mental health issues often has difficulty in the areas of school, peer relationships, and the family, all of which may worsen the child's self-concept, further hindering his or her emotional health. Developmental screening is a key component in the evaluation of a child's mental health. Various screening tools are available for depression, ADHD, and anxiety. Children with autism spectrum disorder often have impaired social interactions as well as altered communication. Learning disabilities and ADHD have a significant negative impact on the child's potential for appropriate education. Individualized education plans help children with learning disabilities, intellectual disability, and ADHD receive the educational support they require to optimize their educational capacity. Provide support and education to children with mood or anxiety disorders and their families. Educating parents about medication administration and its adverse effects is a critical aspect of nursing management of the child with a mental health disorder. Provide nutritional replacement at the appropriate pace in the child with anorexia nervosa. Monitor the child closely for the development of refeeding syndrome. A key nursing function is screening all children and their families for abuse and violence. Report suspected cases of child abuse to the appropriate authorities. Educate children about the dangers associated with substance abuse. Reward and praise children and adolescents who do not experiment with or use alcohol or illicit drugs. REFERENCES 108th Congress.

KEY (endotracheal) tube Learning Objectives Upon completion of the chapter, the learner will be able to: 1. Identify various factors contributing to emergency situations among infants and children. 2. Discuss common treatments and medications used during pediatric emergencies. 3. Conduct a health history of a child in an emergency situation, specific to the emergency. 4. Perform a rapid cardiopulmonary assessment. 5. Discuss common laboratory and other diagnostic tests used during pediatric emergencies. 6. Integrate the principles of the American Heart Association and Pediatric Advanced Life Support in the comprehensive management of pediatric emergencies, such as respiratory arrest, shock, cardiac arrest, near drowning, poisoning, and trauma.Alma Anderson, age 8 years, has been admitted to the pediatric unit. Her mother calls the nurse into the room, stating, \"Alma's having trouble breathing!\" Children are uniquely vulnerable to a range of emergency situations. These situations are often life-threatening if not treated quickly and effectively. Because of their developmental level, children are at a greater risk for near drowning, poisoning, and traumatic injury compared to adults. Most pediatric cardiopulmonary arrests result from respiratory failure or shock. Data suggest that children who have a cardiopulmonary arrest requiring resuscitative measures rarely fare well. For these reasons, the American Heart Association (AHA) has delineated two distinct chains of survival, one for adults and one for children, which should be followed during a life- threatening situation. The adult chain of survival is: 1. Early emergency medical system (EMS) activation 2. Early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) 3. Early defibrillation 4. Early access to advanced care 5. Integrated post-cardiac arrest care In contrast, the pediatric chain of survival is: 1. Prevention of cardiac arrest and injuries 2. Early CPR 3. Early access to emergency response system 4. Early advanced care (Pediatric Advanced Life Support) 5. Integrated post-cardiac arrest care (Berg et al., 2010) Considering the special risks that threaten children, the AHA has also developed specific guidelines for Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS). Courses in PALS are offered for health care professionals so that they can provide expert care for children in emergencies. This chapter emphasizes the principles of PALS in its discussion of the nurse's role in the management of pediatric emergencies. Take Note! The current pediatric basic life support guidelines define an infant as between 0 and 12 months of age, and a child as age 1 year up until puberty. Children in this range should be managed using the PALS guidelines rather than those for adults (Berg et al., 2010).COMMON MEDICAL TREATMENTS A variety of medications and other medical treatments are used in pediatric emergencies. Most of these treatments will require a physician's order when the child is in the hospital, though some emergency departments and pediatric units may have standing orders for pediatric emergencies. The most common medical treatments and medications used in pediatric emergencies are listed in Common Medical Treatments 31.1 and Drug Guide 31.1 . The nurse should be familiar with these procedures and medications, how they work, and nursing implications. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 Healthy People Objectives based on data from http://www.healthypeople.gov . Take Note! Certain emergency drugs for children may be given via a tracheal tube (a tube inserted into the trachea that serves to maintain the airway and facilitate artificial respiration). Use the mnemonic LEAN (lidocaine, epinephrine, atropine, and naloxone) to remember which drugs may be given via the tracheal route. In certain cases, when an emergency drug is given via a tracheal tube, the dosage must be increased. In addition, drugs given via this route should be followed by 5 mL of sterile saline and five consecutive multiple positive-pressure ventilations to ensure that the drugs are delivered (Kleinman et al., 2010a). NURSING PROCESS OVERVIEW FOR THE CHILD IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION The nurse may encounter a pediatric emergency in a variety of settings. As a member of a trauma team at a pediatric hospital, the nurse may participate in the stabilization of a child who has suffered a near drowning or trauma. The emergency department nurse may encounter a child who has just been injured, such as from a fall, an accident, or sports. On the hospital unit, a child with asthma may suffer respiratory distress or stop breathing. Regardless of the setting or how the emergency developed, the principles for managing pediatric emergencies are the same. Care of the child in an emergency includes all components of the nursing process: assessment, nursing diagnosis, planning, interventions, and evaluation. In an emergency, the nurse must act quickly. It is important to intervene immediately when an abnormality is determined upon assessment. When evaluating a child who presents emergently, always follow the AHA's guidelines for basic life support (Berg et al., 2010), which includes evaluating the child's: Airway B reathing C irculation After you have evaluated the child's airway, breathing, and circulation, provide care as necessary, including rescue breathing or CPR. Once the child's cardiopulmonary status is stabilized or the child is resuscitated, assessment and management will vary depending on the cause of the emergency. Assessment Nursing assessment of the child who presents emergently includes health history, physical examination, and laboratory and diagnostic testing. However, the initial history may be focused and very brief if the child is critically ill; the nurse may need to proceed immediately to rapid cardiopulmonary assessment. Once a child is stabilized, a more comprehensive history is obtained. Laboratory tests, while often important, should never take priority over cardiopulmonary and hemodynamic stabilization. Remember Alma, the 8-year-old with breathing trouble? What additional health history and physical examination assessment information should the nurse obtain? Health History Obtain the health history rapidly while simultaneously evaluating the child and providing life-saving interventions. A brief history is needed initially, followed by a more thorough history after the child is stabilized. The parents or caregiver will provide information about the child's chief complaint. Record the information using the caregiver's own words. For example, the caregiver might say, \"He's been having trouble breathing\" if the child is presenting in respiratory distress. If the child was injured in a bicycle accident, the caregiver might say, \"She was riding her bike down the hill and lost control.\" This brief statement provides guidance for obtaining more in-depth information about the emergency. Ask about any significant past history that may affect the care of the child. For example, children who are medically fragile, who were born prematurely, or who have a significant genetically linked disease (e.g., sickle cell anemia) may require special consideration when planning and implementing care.Physical Examination In an emergency, the nurse must perform a rapid cardiopulmonary assessment and intervene immediately if alterations are noted. The remainder of the physical examination then follows. RAPID CARDIOPULMONARY ASSESSMENT As the brief history is being obtained, begin the rapid cardiopulmonary assessment. Most pediatric arrests are related primarily to airway and breathing, and usually only secondarily to the heart. Supported breathing may be all that is needed if the child has a strong, adequate pulse. Always perform the assessment and interventions in that order. In most circumstances, if a child's airway is properly managed and breathing is assisted, the child may not experience a full arrest requiring chest compressions. Take Note! Assessment and management of the airway of a prearresting or arresting child is ALWAYS the first intervention in a pediatric emergency. Intervene if there is an airway problem before moving on to assessment of breathing. If an intervention for breathing is required, start it before proceeding to assessment of circulation. Airway Evaluation and Management. First evaluate the airway. Assess its patency. Position the airway in a manner that promotes good air flow. If secretions are obstructing the airway, suction the airway to remove them. If the child is unconscious or has just been injured, open the airway using the head tilt-chin lift maneuver. Place the fingertips on the bony prominence of the child's chin and lift the chin to open the airway. Simultaneously, place one hand on the forehead and tilt the child's head back ( Fig. 31.1 ). If the airway is not maintainable, reposition the airway for appropriate airflow. Place the child immediately on oxygen at 100% and apply a pulse oximeter to monitor oxygen saturation levels. Take Note! If cervical spine injury is a possibility, do not use the head tilt-chin lift maneuver; use only the jaw-thrust technique for opening the airway (see trauma section for explanation and illustration). Breathing Evaluation and Management. After establishing an open airway, look for signs of respiration. Turn your head and place your ear over the child's mouth to \"look, listen, and feel\" for spontaneous respirations. Look to see if the child's chest is rising, listen for air escaping, and note if you feel any air coming out of the child's nose or mouth. If the child is breathing, evaluate the quality of the respirations: Is ventilation effective, or is the child simply gasping ineffectively for air? Count the respiratory rate. Observe the child's color. Note depth of respiration, chest rise, adequacy of air flow in all lung fields, and presence of adventitious sounds. Evaluate for increased work of breathing and the use of accessory muscles. When signs of respiratory distress are noted, immediately place the child on oxygen at 100% and apply a pulse oximeter to monitor oxygen saturation levels. If the child is breathing shallowly and has poor respiratory effort, attempt to reposition the airway to promote better airflow. For the child receiving 100% oxygen who does not improve with repositioning, begin assisted ventilation with a bag-valve-mask (BVM) device. A need for ongoing BVM ventilation may require airway intubation (process by which a breathing tube, such as a tracheal tube, is inserted into a child's airway to assist with breathing). See the section on respiratory arrest for information on assisting with ventilation using the BVM device and airway intubation. Circulation Evaluation and Management. Next, evaluate circulation. During this phase, evaluate the heart rate, pulses, perfusion, skin color and temperature, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, and level of consciousness. Determine the heart rate via direct auscultation or palpation of central pulses. Radial and brachial pulses are more difficult to palpate, especially in infants and young children. If perfusion is poor, such as with shock or cardiac arrest, the child may have a weak pulse or no pulse. In the young infant, check the brachial artery for a pulse. In the child and adolescent, evaluate the carotid pulse. Take Note! ALWAYS evaluate the presence of a heart rate by auscultation of the heart or by palpation of central pulses. NEVER use the cardiac monitor to determine if the child has a heart rate. The presence of a cardiac rhythm is not a reliable method for evaluation of the ability to perfuse the body. In certain circumstances a rhythm continues but there is no pulse (pulseless electrical activity). If the child has no heart rate (pulse), begin cardiac compressions. See below for information on performing CPR. High-quality chest compressions of adequate rate and depth are essential (Kleinman et al., 2010a). If there is a pulse, note its quality: Is it barely palpable or weak? Is it strong or bounding? Compare the strength and quality of central and peripheral pulses. Assess capillary refill time. Evaluate the child's perfusion by noting skin temperature and color. Is the skin pink? Is it warm to the touch? The child's skin may be cool to the touch and may appear pale, mottled, or cyanotic. As the child's condition worsens with developing shock and cardiovascular compromise, note a line of demarcation of skin temperature. In this situation, the distal extremities will feel cooler than the proximal regions of the body. Measure the blood pressure (BP) and place the child on a cardiac monitor to evaluate the cardiac rhythm. Note the child's sensorium or level of consciousness; if circulation is poor, the child will demonstrate an altered level of consciousness as perfusion to the brain becomes diminished. Take Note! According to PALS, the minimum acceptable systolic BP is 60 for the neonate, 70 for the infant aged 1 to 12 months, and 70 + twice the age in years for children aged 1 to 10 years [e.g., a 4-year-old should have a minimal systolic BP of 78: 70 5 (2 \u00d7 4) 5 79]. For children older than age 10, the minimum acceptable systolic BP is 90 (Kleinman et al., 2010a).If the circulation or perfusion is compromised, then fluid resuscitation is necessary. Establish large-bore intravenous (IV) access immediately and administer isotonic fluid rapidly. Provide 20 mL/kg of normal saline (NS) or lactated Ringer's (LR) as an IV bolus (if the infant is younger than 1 month old, administer 10 mL/kg). If peripheral IV access cannot be obtained in the child with altered perfusion within three attempts or 90 seconds, assist with insertion of an intraosseous needle for fluid administration (refer to shock section for further information about intraosseous access). Central venous lines or cutdown access may also be used, but these measures take longer to accomplish. ADDITIONAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION COMPONENTS In addition to assessing and stabilizing the child's airway, breathing, and circulation, perform a thorough physical examination and assess pain. Neurologic Evaluation. Quickly evaluate the sensorium in an older child. Ask the child to state his or her name. Ask what happened to the child. Does the child know what day it is? Is the child aware of where he or she is? If the child is an infant, evaluate his or her interest in the environment and response to parents. An infant who is not interested in the environment or seems unable to recognize his or her parents is a cause for concern. In contrast, an infant who enjoys sucking on a finger and making eye contact with the nurse during the assessment is reassuring. Evaluate the child's head. In the infant or young toddler, palpate the anterior fontanel to determine if it is normal (soft and flat), depressed, or full. A sunken fontanel is associated with volume depletion from dehydration or blood loss. If the fontanel is full, note if it is bulging or tense, which may indicate increased intracranial pressure. Next assess the eyes. Are they open or closed? If closed, do they open spontaneously, to voice, to pain? Does the child focus on and follow the nurse's movements? Evaluate the pupils for equality and reactivity. Sluggish pupillary reaction may occur with increased intracranial pressure. Take Note! A nonreactive pupil is an ominous sign indicating a need for immediate relief of increased intracranial pressure. Evaluate the child's face. Does the child smile or cry? Does the child react to playfulness with a laugh? Does the young infant cry vigorously? Are facial movements equal? In a child, a normal or near-normal neurologic examination can be a reassuring sign. Conversely, obtunded or muted responses to environmental stimuli are a cause for concern. Next evaluate for spontaneous movement of the extremities. Young infants cannot walk, so assess their ability to move their arms and legs and grossly evaluate the tone of their extremities. Does the infant vigorously and equally move the arms and legs? Is the muscle tone normal, or does the infant appear floppy or flaccid? When evaluating the older child, note whether he or she is ambulatory alone, ambulatory with assistance, or unable to walk. Note whether the child has use of the upper extremities. In the case of trauma, the child may arrive immobilized on a backboard. In this scenario, evaluate the child's motor responsiveness and sensation in each extremity, comparing findings bilaterally while the child is in the supine position. Ask the child if he or she feels you touching each extremity. Ask the child to squeeze your fingers and to wiggle the toes. This will provide information about cerebral integrity and perfusion, cerebellar health, and spinal cord integrity. The Pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale may also be used to evaluate the neurologic status in children (American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP], 2010). Chapter 16 provides a more in-depth discussion of this scale. Skin and Extremity Evaluation. Remove the child's clothing and thoroughly examine the skin for bruising, lesions, or rashes. If the child has a rash, note the size, shape, color, configuration, and location. Apply pressure to the rash with the fingertips to see whether it blanches. Inspect the trunk, abdomen, and extremities for abrasions or deformities. Take Note! Rashes that do not blanch may be classified as petechiae or purpura. This type of rash may be associated with certain serious conditions, such as meningococcemia. Report this finding to the physician or nurse practitioner immediately. Pain Assessment. In emergencies, children may experience pain as a direct result of the injury or disease, and life-saving interventions such as resuscitation, insertion of IV lines, and administration of medications may cause further pain. The child's pain may also be exaggerated by light, noise, movement of the stretcher or bed, and the sensations of cold or heat. Nurses play a key role in minimizing the child's pain, and this may decrease the child's future distress (Rzucidio & Campbell, 2009). If the child is awake and verbal, use an age-appropriate pain assessment scale to determine the child's pain level. If the child is sedated or unconscious, assess pain with a standardized scale that relies on physiologic measurements as well as behavioral parameters. Refer to Chapter 14 for additional information on pain assessment in children. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing A number of laboratory and diagnostic tests may be ordered in a pediatric emergency. Laboratory tests can help to distinguish the cause of the emergency or additional problems that need to be treated. Standard laboratory tests obtained in most emergency departments include: Arterial blood gases (ABGs), obtained initially and then serially to assess for changes Electrolytes and glucose levels Complete blood count (CBC) Blood cultures Urinalysis If ingestion is suspected, then a toxicology panel will be obtained. In suspected sepsis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and urine and spinal fluid cultures may also be obtained. The pediatric trauma victim may have additional laboratory tests performed, including amylase, liver enzymes, and blood type and cross-match. Diagnostic tests may include radiologic tests, computed tomography (CT) scanning, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). One advantage of radiologic diagnostic testing is that the tests are relatively noninvasive. A disadvantage of CT and MRI scans is that before they can be performed, the child must be stabilized. Common Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests 31.1 discusses the tests most commonly used in pediatric emergencies.After completing an assessment of Alma, the nurse noted the following: a patent airway, anxious but able to speak in short sentences, and skin temperature cool on the extremities. Based on these assessment findings, what would your top three nursing diagnoses be for Alma? Describe appropriate nursing interventions. Nursing Diagnoses and Related Interventions After completing a thorough assessment and initial stabilization of the child, the nurse might identify several nursing diagnoses, including: Ineffective airway clearance Ineffective breathing pattern Impaired gas exchange Deficient fluid volume Decreased cardiac output Ineffective tissue perfusion (cardiopulmonary, peripheral cerebral, or renal) Deficient knowledge Fear Interrupted family processes Specific nursing goals, interventions, and evaluation for the child in an emergency are based on the nursing diagnoses. Additional information about nursing management will be included later in the chapter as it relates to specific disorders. Providing Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Always evaluate and manage the airway first. Call for help and assign someone to obtain the automatic external defibrillator (AED). Open the airway and assess for adequate breathing. If the child is not breathing, begin rescue breathing. Check for a pulse. In the child, the carotid or femoral pulses are easiest to assess. In the past, it was recommended that the brachial pulse be checked in the infant, but this is often difficult, so an alternative is to check the femoral pulse. Carefully assess for signs of a pulse, but do not spend more than 10 seconds checking the pulse. If there is not a pulse or if the heart rate is less than 60 beats per minute (bpm), begin chest compressions. Take Note! When a cardiac arrest occurs in a child out of the hospital and is a witnessed, sudden collapse, initial management is slightly different than that for other arrests. In these sudden, witnessed events, call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number for help first, get the AED, and return to start CPR (Berg et al., 2010). Table 31.1 presents the AHA's most recent recommendations for ratios of breaths and compressions. These recommendations stress the importance of properly performed chest compressions. Therefore, several changes have been made to the guidelines: Rescuers must provide compressions of adequate rate and depth. Chest recoil should be allowed. Minimal interruption of chest compressions should be the goal. For infant CPR, two-person infant CPR can be performed by encircling the chest with two thumbs and simultaneously using the hands to provide a thoracic squeeze. For two-person CPR, no pauses should occur for ventilation, with the compressing health care provider giving continuous compressions (Berg et al., 2010). Providing Defibrillation or Synchronized Cardioversion In some cases, the child has an abnormal life-threatening cardiac rhythm or an arrhythmia that does not respond to pharmacologic therapy or leads to hemodynamic instability. In these cases, electrical therapy, in the form of defibrillation or synchronized cardioversion, may be needed. Defibrillation is the use of electrical energy to depolarize the cells of the myocardium to terminate an abnormal life-threatening cardiac rhythm, such as ventricular fibrillation. Defibrillation is used in conjunction with oxygen, CPR, and medications. The effects of defibrillation are enhanced in an oxygen-rich environment coupled with good artificial circulation (CPR). Cardioversion , another means of applying electrical current to the heart, is used when the child has supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or ventricular tachycardia with a pulse. Cardioversion may also be enhanced with medications. Cardioversion is delivered synchronized\u2014that is, the electrical current is applied on the R wave of the electrocardiogram (ECG). The basic defibrillator is equipped with adult- and pediatric-sized paddles. A switch turns the machine on and controls are used to select the amount of energy (joules). Typically, the initial energy amount is 2 joules/kg; it can be increased up to 4 joules/kg for defibrillation. Energy for cardioversion is delivered at 0.5 to 1 joule/kg. When the defibrillator is being used in an acute care setting, the leader of the code team will take charge of defibrillator use. He or she is responsible for ensuring that only the child receives the energy from the defibrillator. The code team leader will count to 4 before delivering a shock to the child to ensure that all personnel and other equipment are clear of the bed to avoid accidental shock. Using Automated External Defibrillation In cases of sudden, witnessed, out-of-hospital collapse, an arrhythmia is often the cause. Therefore, the AHA has revised its recommendations about the use of an AED in children (Berg et al., 2010). An AED is an alternative to manually defibrillating an individual. The AED device consists of electrodes that are applied to the chest. These electrodes are used to monitor the heart rhythm and deliver the electrical current. AED devices are readily available in a variety of locations, such as airports, sports facilities, and businesses. Traditionally, the AED was designed for use in adults, but newer AEDs with smaller pads and the ability to alter energy delivery are now more readily available. Therefore, the AHA has recommended that an AED be used for children who are older than age 1 year who have no pulse and have suffered a sudden, witnessed collapse (Berg et al., 2010).The AED is designed for persons to use it in the prehospital setting. Once the AED is turned on, the machine uses auditory commands to guide laypersons and health care professionals alike through the correct placement of the electrodes and the administration of energy. The AED periodically evaluates the victim's cardiac rhythm and instructs the user about checking the pulse, continuing CPR, and delivering shocks. Nurses who care for children should be able to operate an AED and be prepared to use it in nontraditional settings. See Evidence-Based Practice 31.1 . Determining Medication Doses and Equipment Sizes Many pediatric acute care facilities prepare code reference sheets when a child is admitted. This sheet uses the child's actual weight to determine medication doses and equipment sizes. The reference sheet is kept on a clipboard at the child's bedside or taped on the wall at the head of the bed. An additional copy is placed in the child's chart. Ambulatory care providers often use the Broselow tape to estimate the child's weight based on the child's length ( Fig. 31.2 ). The tape is color coded and emergency equipment for a child of that size is stored in corresponding color-coded packages or in color-coded drawers on the pediatric emergency cart. Medication doses and equipment sizes are also located on the tape. The most accurate calculation for code medications is based on the child's weight, but use of the Broselow tape for estimating the weight has been shown to be successful in children weighing less than 25 kg (So, Farrington, & Absher, 2009). Managing Pain Depending on the child's status and pain level, individualize pain management interventions. For the alert child, nonpharmacologic measures may be used in addition to medications. Provide atraumatic care for procedures and use aggressive pharmacologic treatments to manage pain as the child's condition allows. Refer to Chapter 14 for additional information on pain management strategies. Ensuring Stabilization After a child has been resuscitated, the nurse plays a key role in stabilization and transport. Thoroughly document the interventions that were performed as well as the ongoing assessment of the child's response to the interventions. Provide continued monitoring of the child while awaiting transport. Copy and assemble any pertinent documentation, such as the resuscitation record, nurse's notes, and laboratory test results, which will be given to the receiving institution. Ensure that all lines are taped securely and that vascular access sites are dressed and labeled with the date and time of insertion. As soon as possible, bring the child's family in to visit with the child. Provide explanations about the IV lines, monitoring equipment, and other medical equipment and devices. Encourage the family to talk to and touch the child. Providing Support and Education to the Child and Family The experience of respiratory distress, oxygen deprivation, and an emergency situation is a frightening one for persons of all ages. The life-saving interventions that take place during an emergency can be especially intimidating and upsetting to children. Infants and young children cannot understand explanations about these interventions, and older children and adolescents may feel frightened and angry about the loss of control. The caregivers may feel fear, anger, guilt, and sadness. They may be concerned about the very real possibility that their child might die. Resuscitation of a child is often a perplexing and frightening event for laypersons to observe. Therefore, traditionally family members have been excluded during the resuscitation of children. Recently, however, there has been a trend to allow family members to be present during pediatric resuscitation. Current evidence-based practice guidelines recommend individual evaluation of each family to determine whether allowing their presence during the resuscitation will be beneficial (Meeks, Ahmann, & Dokken, 2009). Considering the highly technical nature of resuscitation, the rapidity with which interventions occur, and the fear associated with a life-threatening event, nurses can play a crucial role in providing understandable explanations to families, coupled with empathic support. During the acute phase, the nurse should give brief explanations as life-saving interventions are being provided. Examples of these types of explanations include: When applying the pulse oximeter sensor: \"I need to put this light on your child to check his oxygen level; it won't hurt.\" When connecting the child to the cardiac monitor: \"We're going to put these sticky patches on your child and connect them so we can monitor his heart rate on this screen.\" When preparing for intubation and ventilation: \"Your child can't breathe on his own right now, so we're going to give him some extra help with this tube. This tube will go through his breathing passage and this machine will help him to breathe.\" The nurse plays a key role in providing empathy and support. Do not provide false reassurance and say, for example, \"He's going to be all right.\" The outcome is never certain. Rather, communicate empathically. For example, say, \"This must be very difficult for you. We're doing everything we can to help your child.\" Provide honest answers in a reassuring manner. Respect each family's diversity and observe their strengths and weaknesses. Be nonjudgmental in all interactions with families, even when the child's emergency situation may have resulted from family neglect. Parents often feel helpless when their child is in a high-tech environment. Suddenly overwhelmed with the equipment and monitoring devices, they no longer are the persons who are the most skilled in caring for their child. Integrate the child's parents into the health care team. Suggest ways the parents can make the hospital experience more normal for their child. For example, simply allowing a father to read a story to his daughter or encouraging a mother to hold her child's hand is therapeutic both for the child and the parents. Be aware of this dramatic change and how it affects the parents. Always ensure that they feel like they are a welcome part of their child's care. Providing the child with familiar comfort objects helps to decrease stress. Once the intubated child is alert and stabilized, assist him or her with communication. Some children can lift one finger for yes and two fingers for no. If the child is old enough to write, provide paper and pencil. Play is essential to the work of the child, and even if he or she is immobile, play is still possible. Puppets at the bedside and books help give the child a more normal experience in a scary situation that is far from the norm. Teenagers may enjoy listening to music through headphones. Even children who are comatose should be talked to and allowed to listen to familiar music. Even if the outcomes are serious, the nurse can provide critical support to children and families. Whether hugging a crying mother or playing \"peek-a-boo\" with an intubated child, the nurse will be the one who can make a difference during a frightening experience.

COMMON LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS 31.1 PEDIATRIC EMERGENCIES EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 31.1 THE ROLE OF AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs) IN CARDIAC RESUSCITATION OF CHILDREN Primary cardiac arrest resulting from arrhythmia or commotio cordis is rare in children and adolescents but often has a very poor outcome. Also, sudden death during sporting events has occurred in children and adolescents. Traditionally, manual defibrillation has been the only form of defibrillation used in children. With the newer technology available in AEDs, the question arose as to whether they could be used effectively to treat arrhythmia in children. STUDY Cecchin et al. (2001) performed a study of over 600 children to determine the specificity and sensitivity of automated external defibrillation in children. Findings The researchers found that AEDs can be sensitive and specific for detecting and treating arrhythmia by defibrillation in children older than 1 year of age. Salib et al. (2005) report a positive and healthy outcome after an AED was used at the scene on a 13- year-old who suffered a baseball blow to the chest resulting in commotio cordis. As a result of these and many other studies, in 2005 the American Heart Association recommended changes in the pediatric basic life support guidelines to include the use of AEDs in sudden witnessed collapse in children.Nursing Implications For nurses working in hospitals, ensure that witnessed collapse in children includes assessing for the need for defibrillation. Outside the hospital, nurses should advocate for AEDs to be placed in all high school gymnasiums and at all parks and ball fields. Adapted from Cecchin, F., Jorgenson, D. B., Berul, C. I., et al.

Assessment and management of the most common types of emergencies in children are discussed below. The topics covered include respiratory arrest, shock, cardiac arrhythmias and arrest, near drowning, poisoning, and traumatic injury. Respiratory Arrest Respiratory emergencies may lead to respiratory failure and eventual cardiopulmonary arrest in children. Infants and young children are at greater risk for respiratory emergencies than adolescents and adults because they have smaller airways and underdeveloped immune systems, resulting in a diminished ability to combat serious respiratory illnesses. Young children often lack coordination, making them susceptible to choking on foods and small objects, which may also lead to cardiopulmonary arrest. In addition, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a leading cause of cardiopulmonary arrest in young infants and thus is one of the leading causes of postneonatal mortality in the United States (Marino & Fine, 2009). For these reasons, nurses must be skilled at recognizing the signs of pediatric respiratory distress so they can prevent progression to cardiopulmonary arrest. Table 31.2 lists some of the more common causes of pediatric respiratory arrest. Nursing Assessment If the child has severe respiratory compromise, obtain a brief history while simultaneously providing respiratory interventions. To obtain the history, use the following questions as a guide: When did the symptoms begin and when do they occur? Did the symptoms have a sudden onset (as with a foreign body aspiration)? How have the symptoms progressed? Is the cough continual, intermittent, or worse at night or with exercise? Has there been any stridor? (Stridor is heard upon inhalation and may be associated with swelling of the trachea [as with croup] or with a foreign body in the upper airway.) Is there wheezing? If so, is the wheezing on inspiration or on expiration, or both? What makes the symptoms better and what makes them worse? Does drinking from a bottle induce the symptoms (as with gastroesophageal reflux-induced aspiration)? Is the child taking any medication for the symptoms? Does the child or do any members of the immediate family have a history of chronic respiratory disease, such as asthma? Are the child's immunizations up to date? Was the child born prematurely? If so, did the child require mechanical ventilation? For how long? Were there any respiratory problems during the first few days of life? When did the child last eat? (This question is important because a recent meal will increase the child's risk of aspiration in the event of a respiratory arrest. In addition, the presence of food in the stomach will increase the risk of aspiration during tracheal intubation.) If the child can communicate, ask how he or she is feeling. Is he or she short of breath? Does his or her chest hurt? Observe the child while speaking. Children who are in respiratory distress may speak in short sentences with gasping between words. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION In an emergency, physical examination is often limited to inspection, observation, and auscultation. First, quickly survey the respiratory status. Determine if the child is breathing. Inspection and Observation. Establish if the airway is patent, maintainable, or unable to be maintained. The child with a patent airway is breathing without signs of obstruction. The maintainable airway remains patent independently by the child or with interventions such as a towel roll under an infant's neck or the insertion of a nasal trumpet. The airway that cannot be maintained does not remain patent unless a more aggressive intervention, such as the insertion of a tracheal tube, is performed. Look at the child's posture. Is the child sitting up, leaning forward, and drooling, as with epiglottitis? Observe the child's face: does he or she appear anxious or relaxed? Children in respiratory distress often appear anxious. Look at the nose and mouth. Are the nares patent? Is there noticeable nasal congestion or mucus coming from the nose? Note nasal flaring or mouth breathing. Observe for head bobbing. Listen for audible expiratory grunting or inspiratory stridor. Note the child's color. Does the child appear pale, mottled,dusky, or cyanotic? Children may appear mottled in response to poor oxygenation, hypothermia, or stress. Children with severe respiratory compromise may appear dusky. Look for cyanosis around the mouth or on the trunk. Cyanosis is a late and often ominous sign of respiratory distress. Central cyanosis is more likely to be associated with respiratory or cardiac compromise. In contrast, peripheral cyanosis is more likely to be associated with circulatory alteration. Take Note! Closely inspect the color of the area around the mouth. Circumoral pallor is a sign of poor oxygenation. Evaluate the pattern and quality of respiration, noting the respiratory rate. Tachypnea (increased respiratory rate) is often noted in children in respiratory distress. However, seriously ill children grunt and may have normal or subnormal respiratory rates. Hypoventilation , a decrease in the depth and rate of respirations, is noted in very ill children or children who have central respiratory depression secondary to narcotics. If the child is a young infant (younger than 2 months) or premature, periodic breathing may occur. Periodic breathing is regular breathing with occasional short pauses (brief periods of apnea). After the apneic pause, the infant will breathe rapidly (up to 60 breaths per minute) for a short period and then will resume a normal respiratory rate. In general, the infant who has periodic breathing looks pink and has a normal heart rate. Observe for the use of accessory muscles in the neck or retractions in the chest, determining the extent and severity of the retractions. Auscultation. Auscultate the lungs with the diaphragm of the stethoscope. Breath sounds over the tracheal region are higher pitched and are described as vesicular, while breath sounds over the peripheral lung fields tend to be lower pitched, known as bronchial. Instruct the child to take deep breaths with the mouth open. To encourage the young child to exhale strongly, instruct him or her to \"blow out\" the penlight (as with a candle) or to blow on a tissue. Encourage the child not to breathe more rapidly than normal (toprevent hyperventilation [increased depth and rate of respirations]) and to avoid making any noises with the mouth. Take Note! Significant upper respiratory congestion often interferes with assessment of the lower airways because the sound is easily transmitted throughout the chest. Differentiate between the upper and lower airway noises by listening with the stethoscope over the nose. The nurse may be able to determine whether the noise is nasal or bronchial by using this technique. Auscultate the child's chest systematically. Listen in all anterior, axillary, and posterior regions, comparing the left to the right sides. Note any decreased or absent breath sounds, which may be the result of bronchial obstruction (as with mucous infection) or air trapping (as in children with asthma). Unilateral absent breath sounds are associated with foreign body aspiration and pneumothorax. Take Note! Sometimes a child's respiratory status is so severely compromised that little or no air movement is noted. This commonly occurs during a severe asthma exacerbation. Minimal or no air movement requires immediate intervention. Note the presence and location of adventitious breath sounds such as crackles, wheezes, or rhonchi. Document the presence of a pleural friction rub (a low-pitched, grating sound), a sound resulting from inflammation of the pleura. Palpation . Palpate the chest for any abnormalities. In the older, less severely ill, and cooperative child, assess for tactile fremitus. Using the palm of the hand, palpate over the lung regions in the same manner as for auscultation and percussion while the child says \"ninety-nine.\" Increased vibrations elicited during this maneuver are associated with consolidating conditions, such as pneumonia. Percussion. Percuss the interspaces of the chest between the ribs in the same systematic fashion as with auscultation. Normally, percussion over an air-filled lung reveals resonant sounds. Note the presence of hyperresonance, which may indicate an acute problem such as a pneumothorax or a chronic disease such as asthma. In contrast, percussion sounds will be dull over a lobe of the lung that is consolidated with fluid, infectious organisms, and blood cells, as in the case of pneumonia. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing Use continuous pulse oximetry if respiratory status is a concern. Note and report oxygen saturation levels below 95%. (See Chapter 18 for additional information about use of the pulse oximeter.) Additional tests may reveal: Arterial or capillary blood gases: hypoxemia, hypercarbia, altered pH Chest radiograph: alterations in normal anatomy or lung expansion, or evidence of pneumonia, tumor, or foreign body Metal detector: evidence of metallic foreign body. Novel as it may sound, metal detectors have been found to be highly accurate (99%) in detecting the presence of ingested coins in children (Ramlakhan, Burke, & Gilchrist, 2006). Take Note! Children with cardiac conditions resulting in cyanosis often have baseline oxygen saturations that are relatively low because of the mixing of oxygenated with deoxygenated blood. Nursing Management The basic principle of pediatric emergency care and PALS is prevention of cardiopulmonary arrest (Kleinman et al., 2010a). Therefore, the nurse must rapidly assess and appropriately manage children who have signs of respiratory distress. Nursing management of the child in respiratory distress involves maintaining a patent airway, providing supplemental oxygen, monitoring for changes in status, and in some cases assisting ventilation. In addition to providing these life-saving measures and monitoring the child's progress, offer support and education to the child and family. MAINTAINING A PATENT AIRWAY When a child exhibits signs of respiratory distress, make a quick decision about whether it will be safe to allow the child to stay with the parent or whether the child must be placed on the examination table or bed. For example, in the case of croup, the child will often breathe more comfortably and experience less stridor while in the comfort of the parent's lap. Many children in respiratory distress often are most comfortable sitting upright, as this position helps to decrease the work of breathing by allowing appropriatediaphragmatic movement. In contrast, a child with a decreasing level of consciousness may need to be placed in the supine position to facilitate positioning of the airway. The infant may benefit from a small towel folded under the shoulders or neck ( Fig. 31.3 ). Avoid neck flexion or hyperextension, which may completely occlude the infant's airway. In children older than age 1 year, the optimal method for opening the airway is to hyperextend the neck, as recommended by the AHA (Berg et al., 2010). If a cervical spine injury is not suspected, use the head tilt- chin lift technique to open the airway. If the child has suffered head or neck trauma and cervical spine instability is a concern, use the jaw-thrust maneuver by placing three fingers under the child's lower jaw and lifting the jaw upward and outward ( Fig. 31.4 ). In either case, never place the hand under the neck to open the airway. FIGURE 31.3 (A) The infant and young child's prominent occiput encourages flexion of the neck and may result in airway occlusion. (B) Putting a towel roll under the shoulders or neck helps to open the infant's or young child's airway by placing it in the neutral or \"sniff\" position. FIGURE 31.4 Jaw-thrust technique for opening the airway. Often the nurse encounters an acutely ill child who cannot maintain an airway independently but may be able to do so with some assistance. For example, sometimes simply opening the airway and moving the tongue away from the tracheal opening is all that is required to regain airway patency. In certain conditions, a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal airway may be necessary for airwaymaintenance. Comparison Chart 31.1 provides additional information about these types of airways. COMPARISON CHART 31.1 OROPHARYNGEAL VERSUS NASOPHARYNGEAL AIRWAYS ASSISTING VENTILATION USING A BAG-VALVE-MASK The child in respiratory distress may ventilate poorly, hypoventilate, or tire and become apneic. In this case, the child may require assistance with ventilation through BVM ventilation (see Table 31.3 ). ( Table 31.3 also lists and discusses assisting with ventilation using tracheal intubation [discussed in detail below], an anesthesia ventilation system, and a laryngeal maskairway.) BVM ventilation is used in the management of children who cannot ventilate or oxygenate effectively on their own. This technique is a more efficient way of ensuring ventilation than using only supplemental oxygen. In addition, resuscitating a child in this manner is superior to mouth-to-mouth resuscitation as it provides higher oxygen concentrations and protects the nurse from exposure to oral secretions (Berg et al., 2010). However, this technique requires proper training and practice. The proper procedure involves appropriate opening of the airway followed by providing breaths with the BVM. Ventilation with the BVM may be performed with either one or two rescuers. First, choose an appropriate-sized bag and a corresponding face mask that fits the infant or child. Self-inflating bags are usually available in neonatal, infant, child, and adult sizes. Corresponding masks are available. Choose a face mask that properly fits the child's face and that provides a seal over the nose and mouth and excludes the eyes, thus preventing any pressure on the eyes ( Fig. 31.5 ). FIGURE 31.5 The mask should form a seal over the nose and mouth, across the chin and nose bridge. Take Note! Face masks should be clear so that the nurse can see the child's lip color and identify any emesis during resuscitation. Connect the BVM via the tubing to the oxygen source and turn on the oxygen. When resuscitating infants and children, set the flow rate at approximately 10 L/minute. For an adolescent who is adult sized, set the flow rate at 15 L/minute or higher to compensate for the larger-volume bag. Check to make sure that the oxygen is flowing through the tubing to the bag. Self-inflating bags do not provide free-flow oxygen out of the face mask; manual pumping of the bag is necessary. However, the bags have a corrugated plastic tail that allows oxygen to freely flow. Therefore, check over the tail for oxygen flow through the bag. After opening the airway appropriately (see above), place the mask over the child's face. When one rescuer is providing ventilation (commonly referred to as \"bagging\"), the person must provide a seal with the mask over the child's face with one hand and use the other hand to manipulate the resuscitator bag. The hand used to provide the mask seal will simultaneously maintain the airway in an open position. Generally, use the left thumb and index finger to hold the mask on the child's face. While maintaining a good seal with the mask, use upward pressure on the jaw angle while pressing downward on the mask below the child's mouth to keep the mouth open ( Fig. 31.6 ). Take care not to put pressure on the neck with the fourth and fifth fingers.FIGURE 31.6 Proper hand placement for maintaining airway and adequate mask seal using one-rescuer technique. If adequate personnel are available, a more desirable situation involves one person standing behind the child's head to maintain an open airway and to provide a seal of the mask over the face with a hand on each side (usually the thumbs and second fingers). A second rescuer stands on one side of the child and compresses the bag to ventilate the child using both hands. If the child is more difficult to ventilate, the two-rescuer method allows the ventilating nurse to provide better ventilation than with the one-rescuer method. In addition, the two-rescuer method ensures the best possible mask seal, as the rescuer holding the mask can use both hands to maintain the seal. Regardless of the number of persons present, proper placement of the face mask is critical, and a good seal must be maintained throughout the resuscitation. In addition, during ventilation, use only the force and tidal volume necessary to cause a chest rise, no more. If a good chest rise is not observed, attempt to open the airway again. It may be necessary to adjust the position of the airway a few times to achieve a patency conducive to ventilation. Compress the bag to deliver breaths at the amount recommended in infants and children. Initially, provide two rescue breaths and observe for a chest rise. Rescue breaths should not overinflate the lungs. Breaths should be delivered over 1 second. After the first two rescue ventilations, perform rescue breathing at a rate of one breath every 3 to 5 seconds, or about 12 to 20 breaths per minute. Delivering each breath should be a steady, one-inhalation-to-one-exhalation ratio. This means that the amount of time delivering the inspiratory ventilation is equal to the amount of time that expiration is allowed. While ventilating the infant or child, work with, not against, any spontaneous respiratory effort; in other words, if the child is breathing out, do not attempt to force air in at the same time. Monitoring Effectiveness of Ventilation. During the resuscitation, continually reassess the child's response to the resuscitative efforts, noting: Adequacy of chest rise Absence or minimal presence of abdominal distention Improved heart rate and pulse oximetry readings Improved color Capillary refill less than 3 seconds with strengthening pulses If the child's status deteriorates and he or she becomes pulseless, then CPR must be started. In addition, periodically and briefly stop ventilating to evaluate for spontaneous respirations. Preventing Complications Related to Bag-Valve-Mask Ventilation. During resuscitation, health care personnel usually exhibit high energy levels, a normal physiologic response that facilitates resuscitative efforts as the rescuers act quickly. However, this heightened state can lead to overzealousness while ventilating an infant or child. Health care providers may inadvertently ventilate thechild too rapidly using too much tidal volume, leading to excessive ventilation volume and increased airway pressure. This poor technique can be detrimental to the child, causing: Reduced cardiac output (due to increased intrathoracic pressure and increased cardiac afterload) Air trapping Barotrauma (trauma caused by changes in pressure) Air leak (thus reducing the oxygen delivered to the child) In addition, children with head injury who receive excessive ventilation volumes and high rates may develop: Decreased cerebral blood flow Cerebral edema Neurologic damage (AHA, 2007) Thus, nurses must be mindful of their technique during bagging, not exceeding the recommended respiratory rate or providing too much tidal volume to the child. Ventilate the child in a controlled and uniform manner, providing just enough volume to result in a chest rise. ASSISTING WITH VENTILATION USING TRACHEAL INTUBATION Tracheal intubation is needed if the infant or child does not have a maintainable airway or will require artificial ventilation for a prolonged time (see Table 31.3 ). Intubation of infants and children is a procedure that requires great skill and therefore should be performed by only the most qualified and experienced personnel. Children are most commonly intubated orally, rather than nasally, in acute situations. NURSING PROCEDURE 31.1 Assisting With Tracheal Intubation 1. Prepare equipment and supplies. 2. Draw up medications (for rapid sequence intubation). 3. Turn up the volume on the cardiac monitor so that members of the team can easily hear the audible QRS indication of the child's heart rate and note any bradycardia with the procedure. 4. Turn on the suction. Make sure that suction is working by placing your hand over the tubing before you attach the suction catheter. 5. Continue to ventilate the child with the bag-valve-mask (BVM) and 100% oxygen as the team prepares to intubate the child. 6. When there is no suspected cervical spine injury, in the child older than age 2 years, place a small pillow under the child's head to facilitate opening of the airway; this step is unnecessary in children younger than age 2 due to the prominence of their occiput. 7. When assisting with the intubation, stand beside the child's head and prepare to assist with suctioning of oral secretions, providing BVM ventilation as needed, and assisting with securing the tube with tape. 8. Before the initial intubation attempt and after each subsequent attempt to intubate, provide several inhalations of 100% oxygen via the BVM ventilation method (optimally for a few minutes). 9. Administer premedication and medications for sedation. 10. Administer paralyzing medication. 11. Observe as the health care professional who is intubating the child follows the recommended procedure for intubation using the laryngoscope to visualize the vocal cords. Nurses are an essential part of the intubation team, usually assisting a physician, nurse practitioner, respiratory therapist, or physician's assistant during the intubation procedure ( Nursing Procedure 31.1 ). The nurse may set up the equipment, prepare and administer intubation medications, or assist with suctioning the oral secretions and preparing the tape to secure the tracheal tube. In a child in full arrest, the nurse might be responsible for performing ongoing chest compressions while other team members manage the child's airway.Setting Up Equipment. Appropriate setup and preparation of equipment is essential ( Table 31.4 ). The tracheal tube size used depends on the child's size. To calculate tracheal tube size, divide the child's age by 4 and add 4. The resulting number will indicate the size of the tracheal tube in millimeters. For example, if the child is 2 years old, the proper-sized tube would be 4.5 [(2/4) + 4 = 4.5]. Always have one size smaller ready also, so have a 4.0 and a 4.5 tracheal tube for this child. Administering Medications. Several medications are often given to facilitate intubation of children. Premedicating a child before passing a tracheal tube aids in the following: Reducing pain and anxiety (consistent with the concept of atraumatic care) Minimizing the effects of passing the tracheal tube down the airway (vagal stimulation leading to bradycardia [decrease in heart rate]) Preventing hypoxia Reducing intracranial pressure Preventing airway trauma and aspiration of stomach contents The use of medications during the intubation process is known as rapid sequence intubation ( Table 31.5 ). Typically, these medications are used in controlled settings such as the emergency department or the intensive care unit (ICU). Rapid sequence intubation is done only in children who are not experiencing cardiac arrest. If the intubation is expected to be particularly difficult, paralyzing medication should not be used. The nurse must be aware of the differences in the various medication classes, their advantages, their disadvantages, and adverse effects. The nurse must also be able to distinguish between medications that produce sedation and ones that produce analgesia. Children who are paralyzed and sedated may be suffering severe pain. The pain control needs of children who are acutely ill are of paramount importance and cannot be overstated. Do not mistake a child who is immobilized as a result of sedative and paralytic medications for a child who is pain-free. Take Note! Attempts to insert a tracheal tube should last no longer than 20 to 30 seconds each. After each attempt, the child should receive multiple ventilations by the BVM method using 100% oxygen (AHA, 2007). Ensuring and Maintaining Correct Tube Placement. To assess for correct placement once the tracheal tube is inserted, observe for symmetric chest rise and auscultate over the lung fields for equal breath sounds. Inspect the tracheal tube for the presence of water vapor on the inside, indicating that the tube is in the trachea. To rule out accidental esophageal intubation, auscultate over the abdomen while the child is being ventilated: there should not be breath sounds in the abdomen. Note improvement in the oxygen saturation level via pulse oximetry. Once tracheal tube placement is verified, mark the tube with an indelible pen at the level of the child's lip and secure it with tape. Document the number on the tracheal tube at the level of the child's mouth. Anticipate a chest radiograph to confirm correct placement of the tracheal tube. After placement is confirmed, the tracheal tube is connected to the ventilator by respiratory personnel. The ventilator will provide continuous artificial ventilation and oxygenation. Exhaled CO 2 monitoring is recommended as it provides an indication of appropriate ventilation ( Box 31.1 ). If an exhaled CO 2 monitor is being used, the exhaled CO 2 should be yellow. The nurse plays a key role in ensuring that the tracheal tube remains taped securely in place by doing the following: Using soft wrist restraints if necessary to prevent the child from removing the tracheal tube Providing sedative and/or paralyzing medications Using caution when moving the child for radiographs, changing linens, and performing other procedures Monitoring the Child Who Is Intubated. Provide ongoing and frequent monitoring of the intubated child to determine adequacy ofoxygenation and ventilation as noted earlier. Once the child is intubated, the ventilatory support being provided should result in improvement in oxygen saturation and vital signs. If the child begins to exhibit signs of poor oxygenation, perform a quick assessment. Auscultate the lungs for equal air entry and determine the heart rate. Are the breath sounds equal? Is the heart rate normal for age? Perform a quick survey of the equipment and look for any disconnected tubes or kinks in the tubing. Determine oxygen saturation levels via pulse oximeter and evaluate the end-tidal CO 2 color (see Box 31.1 ). Use the PALS mnemonic \"DOPE\" for troubleshooting when the status of a child who is intubated deteriorates: BOX 31.1 EXHALED CO 2 MONITORING OR END-TIDAL CO2 MONITORING Device that connects to the child's ventilator circuit to detect CO 2 in the tubing. CO 2 should be noted in the tubing after six ventilations. Devices are usually color coded. In the case of tracheal intubation, observe the color on the device change from purple to tan to yellow. The American Heart Association's Pediatric Advanced Life Support Provider Manual (2007) suggests the following method to remember how the colors on the end-tidal CO 2 device correspond with tracheal tube placement: Purple = Problem (little or no CO 2 detected) Tan = Think about a problem. Yellow = Yes, CO 2 is definitely detected and the tube is in the trachea. Adapted from American Heart Association. (2007). Pediatric advanced life support provider manual. Dallas, TX: Author. D = Displacement. The tracheal tube is displaced from the trachea. O = Obstruction. The tracheal tube is obstructed (e.g., with a mucous plug). P = Pneumothorax. Usually a pneumothorax results in a sudden change in the child's assessment. The signs of a pneumothorax include decreased breath sounds and decreased chest expansion on the side of the pneumothorax. Subcutaneous emphysema may be noted over the chest. In the case of tension pneumothorax, there may be a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure. E = Equipment failure. Relatively simple problems as previously discussed, such as a disconnected oxygen supply, can cause the child to deteriorate. Culprits such as a leak in the ventilator circuit or a loss of power are other types of equipment failure that may be responsible (Kleinman et al., 2010a). Make sure all equipment is appropriately connected and functional. When obstruction with secretions is suspected, suction the tracheal tube. If the tracheal tube is displaced from the trachea, remove the tube if it remains in the child's mouth and begin BVM ventilation. In the case of pneumothorax, prepare to assist with needle thoracotomy. Preparing the Intubated Child for Transport. Once the child is stabilized with a secure tracheal tube in place, prepare to transport the child. The child will be moved by stretcher to an intensive care unit in the acute care facility or by air or land ambulance to another facility that specializes in the care of acutely ill children. Make sure that all tubes are taped securely. During transport, use portable oxygen and ventilate manually with the BVM. As the sending nurse, ensure that all laboratory results are obtained and provided to the receiving nurse. If the child is going to another facility, complete a detailed summary of the resuscitation or provide a copy of the nurse's and/or progress notes. Complete the appropriate transfer forms as determined by the institution. If the child is being transported by ambulance, the parents may not be able to accompany their child. In this case, find out as much as possible about the transport and assist the parents by giving directions to the receiving institution.SHOCK Shock may be defined as an inability for blood flow and oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic demands of tissue (Kleinman et al., 2010b). If shock is left untreated, cardiopulmonary arrest will result. Shock, which may be classified as compensated or decompensated, is due to a variety of clinical problems. Compensated shock occurs when poor perfusion exists without a decrease in BP. In decompensated shock, inadequate perfusion is accompanied by a drop in BP. Unchecked decompensated shock leads to cardiac arrest and death. The principles of PALS stress the early evaluation and management of children in compensated shock with the goal of preventing decompensated shock (Kleinman et al., 2010b). Once the child in shock is hypotensive, organ perfusion is dramatically impaired and a dire clinical scenario ensues. Pathophysiology Shock is the result of dramatic respiratory or hemodynamic compromise. Impaired cardiac output, impaired systemic vascular resistance (SVR), or a combination of both causes shock. Cardiac output (CO) is equal to heart rate (HR) times ventricular stroke volume (SV) (CO = HR \u00d7 SV). Stroke volume is how much blood is ejected from the heart with each beat. Stroke volume is related to left ventricular filling pressure, the impedance to ventricular filling, and myocardial contractility. Left ventricular filling pressure is also known as preload, and the impedance to ventricular filling is commonly called afterload. Young children and infants have relatively small stroke volumes compared to older children and adults. Therefore, infants and young children differ from their adult counterparts in that their cardiac output depends on their heart rate, not their stroke volume. Clinically, in cases of circulatory compromise and compensated shock in infants and children, the heart rate is increased. The exception to this is a paradoxical phenomenon in neonates, who may have bradycardia rather than tachycardia. Systemic vascular resistance or afterload is the impediment to the heart's ventricular ejection. Increased SVR will result in a decrease in blood flow unless the ventricular pressure increases. Increased vascular resistance is a common problem in shock. In children who have shock-related increased SVR, cardiac output will fall unless the ventricle can compensate by increasing pressure. In cardiac insufficiency, the child's heart will have impaired ability to compensate for the increased afterload. Altered microcirculatory status is common in all types of shock. Compensatory mechanisms are activated in response to decreased blood flow. Sympathetic nervous system response results in marked contraction of larger-vessel sphincters and arterioles. This compression results in dramatically impaired capillary blood flow. Blood is redirected away from less important body systems, such as the skin and the kidneys, to the vital organs (the heart and brain). During compensated shock, the body can maintain some level of blood flow to the vital organs. Peripheral vasoconstriction, the body's compensatory response to diminished blood flow, often results in the child's ability to maintain a normal or near-normal BP. As shock continues, capillary beds become obstructed by cellular debris, and platelets and white blood cells aggregate. Endothelial damage occurs as a result of capillary congestion. Poor blood flow to the capillaries results in anaerobic metabolism. Lactic acid accumulates, and this can lead to acidosis. In addition, children with septic shock sustain marked endothelial damage as a result of exposure to bacterial toxins. The cumulative effect of capillary obstruction and dramatically impaired blood flow is tissue ischemia. As tissue ischemia progresses, the child will show signs of altered perfusion to vital organs. For example, as blood flow to the brain is diminished, the child will demonstrate an altered level of consciousness. Altered blood flow to the kidneys will result in decreased urine output or absence of urine output (oliguria). Commonly, the heart rate will increase in the early stages of shock, but as the heart becomes compromised as a result of poor perfusion, the child will become bradycardic. The child will demonstrate an increased respiratory rate in the initial phase of shock. Tachypnea is seen in septic shock as well. In fact, the child may demonstrate marked hyperventilation in an effort to blow off carbon dioxide in response to the acidosis that is associated with septic shock. Types of Shock The most common types of shock are hypovolemic, septic, cardiogenic, and distributive. Hypovolemic shock, the most common type of shock in children, occurs when systemic perfusion decreases as a result of inadequate vascular volume (Kleinman et al., 2010b). Children commonly have hypovolemic shock that occurs in association with fluid losses. For example, hypovolemic shock may occur with gastroenteritis that results in vomiting and diarrhea, medications such as diuretics, and heat stroke. Other causes of hypovolemia in children include blood loss, such as from a major injury, and third spacing of fluid, such as with burns. Septic shock is related to a systemic inflammatory response in which there may be increased cardiac output with a low SVR, known as warm shock. More commonly in children, septic shock results in a decrease in cardiac output with an increase in SVR, known as cold shock.Cardiogenic shock results from an ineffective pump, the heart, with a resultant decrease in stroke volume. Children who have congenital or acquired cardiac abnormalities with a poorly functioning heart are at risk for cardiogenic shock (Fisher, Nelson, Beyersdorf, & Satkowiak, 2010). Distributive shock is the result of a loss in the SVR. A relative hypovolemia occurs, most often with neurogenic injury-related shock and anaphylaxis. In relative hypovolemia, the vascular compartment expands due to systemic vasodilation. This results in a relatively larger vasculature requiring more fluid to maintain cardiac output despite no actual loss of fluid. Lastly, toxic drug ingestions may also lead to shock. Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment of the child in shock includes the health history and physical examination as well as laboratory and diagnostic testing. The nursing assessment must be performed quickly and accurately so that resuscitation can be expedited. Health History In shock, the health history is based on the child's presentation. Children with shock are critically ill and require emergent intervention. Therefore, the history is obtained as life-saving interventions are provided. Determine when the child first became ill and treatments that have been given thus far. Inquire about sources of volume loss, such as: Vomiting Diarrhea Decreased oral intake Blood loss Ask when the child last urinated. Investigate for other related symptoms such as behavioral changes or lethargy. Has the child had a fever or rash, complained of headache, or been exposed to anyone with similar symptoms? Inquire about day care attendance and whether the family has recently traveled outside of the country. Determine if the child has a history of a congenital heart defect or other heart condition or if the child has severe allergies. Ask the parent about accidental ingestion of medications or other substances and, for the older child or adolescent, about the possibility of illicit substance use. Physical Examination The key to successful shock management is early recognition of the signs and symptoms. Obtain vital signs, noting any alterations. Measure BP, although this is not a reliable method of evaluating for shock in children. Children tend to maintain a normal or slightly less than normal BP in compensated shock while sacrificing tissue perfusion until the child suffers a cardiopulmonary arrest. Therefore, other components of the circulatory evaluation will be more valuable when assessing a child. Take Note! Bradycardia is a serious sign in neonates and may occur with respiratory compromise, circulatory compromise, and/or overwhelming sepsis (Kattwinkel et al., 2010). As with any emergency, evaluate the airway first. Is it patent? Then determine if the child is breathing. The child in shock will often demonstrate signs of respiratory distress, such as grunting, gasping, nasal flaring, tachypnea, and increased work of breathing. Auscultate breath sounds to determine the adequacy of air entry and airflow. If the child shows signs of respiratory distress, manage the airway and breathing problem first, as discussed earlier in the chapter. Assess the skin color. Palpate the skin temperature and determine quality of pulses. Except in special cases, such as distributive shock, the child in shock will generally have darker and cooler extremities with delayed capillary refill. Note the line of demarcation if present. This refers to the point on the distal extremity where cool temperature begins (the proximal portion of the extremity may continue to be warm). In distributive shock, the initial assessment will reveal full and bounding pulses and warm, erythemic skin. Evaluate the pulse quality. Distal pulses will likely be weaker than central pulses. Evaluate the child's hydration state and check skin turgor. Decreased elasticity is associated with hypovolemic states, though this is usually a late sign. Observe the child's face; in compensated shock the child may be awake but obtunded and demonstrate signs of distress. The child in decompensated shock may have his or her eyes closed and may be responsive only to voice or other stimulation. Evaluate pupillary responses. Determine urinary output, which will be decreased in the child with shock. After having evaluated and provided initial life-saving management for airway, breathing, and circulation, evaluate the child's entire body for other disabilities. Injuries warrant vigilant evaluation for ongoing blood loss, although they may also produce internal bloodloss (e.g., a femur fracture). Look for signs of malformation, swelling, redness, or pain of the extremities, which may suggest internal blood loss. Also inspect for any open wounds and active sites of bleeding. Children with abdominal injuries also may lose copious amounts of blood internally. Inspect the abdomen for redness, skin discoloration, or distention. Auscultate for bowel sounds in all four quadrants. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing As the child is being resuscitated, laboratory tests and radiographs will be ordered and obtained. However, no diagnostic test should replace the priority of respiratory support, vascular access, and fluid administration. Laboratory results will guide ongoing management. Common laboratory and diagnostic tests used for children with shock include: Blood glucose levels: usually performed at the bedside using a glucose meter (e.g., Chemstrip \u00ae or ACCU-CHEK \u00ae ) to obtain a rapid Electrolytes: to evaluate for electrolyte abnormalities CBC with differential: to assess for viral or bacterial infection (septic shock) and to evaluate for anemia and platelet abnormalities Blood culture: to evaluate for sepsis; preliminary results will not be available for 1 to 2 days C-reactive protein: to evaluate for infection Arterial blood gases: to assess oxygen and carbon dioxide levels and to provide information about acid-base balance Toxicology panel (if ingestion is suspected) Lumbar puncture: to evaluate the cerebrospinal fluid for meningitis Urinalysis: to evaluate for glucose, ketones, and protein; concentration (specific gravity) is increased in dehydration states Urine culture: to evaluate for urinary tract or kidney infection Radiographs: to evaluate heart size, to evaluate the lungs for pneumonia or pulmonary edema (present with cardiogenic shock) Nursing Management Signs of shock in children warrant an emergent response. Managing the Child's ABCs Always evaluate and manage the airway and breathing and check for pulses. Initiate CPR if the child is pulseless. All children who have signs and symptoms of shock should receive 100% oxygen via mask. If the child has poor respiratory effort or is apneic, administer 100% oxygen via BVM or tracheal tube (refer to the section on respiratory emergencies for more specific information about management of airway and breathing). As part of ongoing monitoring, institute cardiac and apnea monitoring and assess oxygen saturation levels via pulse oximetry. Obtaining Vascular Access Once the airway and breathing are addressed, nursing management of shock focuses on obtaining vascular access and restoring fluid volume. Children with signs of shock should receive generous amounts of isotonic IV fluids rapidly. However, obtaining vascular access in critically ill children can be challenging. Vascular access must be obtained using the quickest route possible in children whose condition is markedly deteriorated, such as those in decompensated shock. Various forms of vascular access available for the management of the critically ill child include: Peripheral IV route: a large-bore catheter is used to give large amounts of fluid. This route may not be feasible in children with significant vascular compromise. Central IV route: central lines can be inserted into the jugular vein and threaded into the superior vena cava. The femoral route is best for obtaining central venous access while CPR is in progress because the insertion procedure will not interfere with life-saving interventions involving the airway and cardiac compressions. The subclavian vein, located under the clavicle, is an alternative route for central access. Saphenous vein: the saphenous vein (found in the ankle) is an alternative route for venous access that is obtained using a surgical incision. Intraosseous access: intraosseous access, obtained by cannulating the bone marrow, is recommended in cases of decompensated shock or cardiac arrest if IV access cannot be attained rapidly. The preferred site is the anterior tibia. Special intraosseous needles are used (generally a 15-gauge needle for older children, 18-gauge for younger children). The needle is inserted using a firm twisting motion slightly away from the growth plate. Any medications or fluids that can be administered using an IV site can be given using this route. Alternative sites include the femur, the iliac crest, the sternum, and the distal tibia.Restoring Fluid Volume Administer IV isotonic fluids, such as Ringer's lactate or normal saline (the isotonic fluids of choice) rapidly. Administer 20 mL/kg of the prescribed fluid as a bolus, infusing the fluid as rapidly as possible. In general, a large-bore syringe, such as a 35- to 60-mL syringe attached to a three-way stopcock, is the preferred method for rapid fluid delivery in children. Infusing the fluid via gravity is too slow. The fluid bolus may be repeated up to two times (for a total of three times) if required. Take Note! Dextrose solutions are contraindicated in shock because of the risk of complications such as osmotic diuresis, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and worsening of ischemic brain injury (AHA, 2007). Children in septic shock will often require larger volumes of fluid as a result of the increased capillary permeability. Children in shock due to trauma will usually receive a colloid, such as blood, when there is an inadequate response to crystalloid isotonic fluid. After each fluid bolus, reassess the child for signs of positive response to the fluid administration. Insert an indwelling urinary catheter to allow for accurate and frequent measurement of urine output. Indicators of improvement include: Improved cardiovascular status: the central and peripheral pulses are stronger. The line of demarcation of extremity coolness is diminishing and capillary refill is improved (time is decreased). BP is improved. Improved mental status: the child is more alert. For example, the child's eyes are open and watching personnel. If the child is younger, he or she may be pulling at the IV line. Improved urine output: this may not be noted initially but should be noted over the next few hours; the goal is 1 to 2 mL/kg/hour. The process of fluid resuscitation involves giving the fluid, assessing and reassessing the child, and documenting findings. Children in shock may require as much as 100 to 200 mL/kg of resuscitative fluid during the initial hours of shock management. Most children in shock need and can tolerate this large volume of fluid. Continued reassessment will determine if the child is beginning to experience fluid overload in the form of pulmonary edema (this is rare but may occur in children with preexisting cardiac conditions or severe chronic pulmonary disease) (AHA, 2007; Schwarz & Hilfiker, 2011). Take Note! Do not focus solely on the child's circulatory status; you may overlook signs and symptoms of respiratory deterioration. Administering Medications In some circumstances, such as septic shock or distributive shock, fluid alone does not adequately improve the child's status and adjunctive medications may be ordered. Vasoactive medications are used either alone or in combination to improve cardiac output, to increase SVR, or to decrease SVR. The selection of medications is dictated by the child's cardiac and vascular status. For example, dobutamine is a medication with significant -adrenergic effects and thus can improve cardiac contractility. Epinephrine, which affects the heart muscle, is also a powerful vasoconstrictor. Dopamine affects the heart at lower doses but increasingly affects the vasculature with increased doses. These medications may be given as a loading dose, followed by a continuous infusion. When vasoactive drugs are administered, monitor for improvement in heart rate, BP, perfusion, and urine output.CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIAS AND ARREST Unlike adults, in whom cardiopulmonary arrest is most often caused by a primary cardiac event, children typically have healthy hearts and thus rarely experience primary cardiac arrest. More commonly they experience cardiopulmonary arrest from gradual deterioration of respiration and/or circulation (Kleinman et al., 2010a). In particular, children experiencing a respiratory emergency or shock may deteriorate and eventually demonstrate cardiopulmonary arrest. Thus, the standard of care for managing a child in this situation is vastly different from that for an adult. Nurses should be skilled in evaluating and managing respiratory alterations and shock in children, as discussed in previous sections. Overwhelming evidence suggests that if primary respiratory compromise or shock is identified and treated in the critically ill child, a secondary cardiac arrest can be prevented. Rare exceptions do exist, however. For example, electrolyte abnormalities and toxic drug ingestions are primary insults to the cardiovascular system that may lead to a sudden cardiac arrest rather than a gradual progression. Other exceptions in which the child is at risk for a primary and sudden cardiac arrest include: History of a serious primary congenital or acquired cardiac defect Potentially lethal arrhythmias, such as prolonged QT syndrome Hyper- or hypotrophic cardiomyopathy Traumatic cardiac injury or a sharp blow to the chest, known as \"commotio cordis\" (e.g., when a high-velocity ball hits the chest) The overwhelming majority of children rarely experience cardiac arrhythmias, so it is beyond the scope of this chapter to discuss the myriad possible complex rhythm disturbances. Therefore, this discussion will be limited to the management of emergent cardiac conditions that are more typically found in children. COMPARISON CHART 31.2 CAUSES OF SINUS BRADYCARDIA VERSUS HEART BLOCK Pathophysiology The AHA (2007) has simplified the nomenclature used to describe pediatric cardiac compromise and has established three major categories of cardiac rhythm disturbances: Slow: bradyarrhythmias Fast: tachyarrhythmias Absent: pulseless, cardiovascular collapse The pathophysiology, causes, and therapeutic management of each of the categories of rhythm disturbances are discussed below. Bradyarrhythmias Bradycardia is a heart rate significantly slower than the normal heart rate for age. Bradycardia in children is most commonly sinus bradycardia. In other words, there is not a cardiac nodal abnormality associated with the slowed heart rate. In sinus bradycardia, the P waves and QRS complex remain normal on the ECG. Brief dips in heart rates can be normal, such as when the child sleeps. Children are also susceptible to brief drops in heart rate that are associated with vagal stimulation. For example, passing an orogastric tube down the esophagus of a young infant may induce a temporary bradycardic response. These normal decreases in the child's heart rate should recover with or without stimulation and are not normally associated with signs of altered perfusion. Less commonly, children manifest bradycardia as a result of cardiac abnormalities and heart block. Infants with bradycardia related to heart block may exhibit poor feeding and tachypnea, whereas older children may demonstrate fatigue, dizziness, and syncope. Comparison Chart 31.2 compares the causes of sinus bradycardia and heart block in children. In contrast, the child with a serious and possibly life-threatening bradyarrhythmia will have a heart rate below 60 bpm, with signs of altered perfusion. The most common causes of profound bradycardia in children are respiratory compromise, hypoxia, and shock. Sustained bradycardia is commonly associated with arrest. It is an ominous sign and should be taken seriously.Tachyarrhythmias Children normally have faster heart rates than adults, and fever, fear, and pain are common explanations for significant increases in the heart rate of a child ( tachycardia ). This normal elevation in heart rate is known as sinus tachycardia. However, once the fever is reduced, the child is comforted, or the pain is managed, the heart rate should return close to the child's baseline. Hypoxia and hypovolemia are pathologic reasons for tachycardia in the child. The signs, symptoms, and management of these concerns were discussed in previous sections. If the child has sinus tachycardia that results from any of these causes, the focus is on the underlying cause. It is inappropriate and dangerous to treat sinus tachycardia with medications aimed at decreasing the heart rate or with a defibrillation device. Tachyarrhythmias in children that are associated with cardiac compromise have unique characteristics that present differently from sinus tachycardia. Examples of these include SVT and ventricular tachycardia. SVT is a cardiac conduction problem in which the heart rate is extremely rapid and the rhythm is very regular, often described as \"no beat-to-beat variability.\" Comparison Chart 31.3 explains the differences between SVT and sinus tachycardia. The most common cause of SVT is a reentry problem in the cardiac conduction system. Commonly, SVT is the result of a genetic cardiac conduction problem such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. SVT may also be associated with medications such as caffeine and theophylline. Children often can tolerate the characteristically higher heart rate that is associated with SVT for short periods of time. However, the increased demand that is placed on the cardiovascular system usually overtaxes the child and results in signs of congestive heart failure if the SVT continues unchecked for a prolonged time. Ventricular tachycardia is a rhythm involving an elevation of the heart rate and a wide QRS (greater than 0.08 seconds) that is the result of an abnormal, rapid firing of one or both of the ventricles. Ventricular tachycardia is a rare arrhythmia in children and usually is associated with a congenital or acquired cardiac abnormality. In addition, prolonged QT syndrome is a conduction abnormality that can result in ventricular tachycardia and sudden death in children. Less commonly, ingestion of medications and toxins, acidosis, hypocalcemia, abnormalities of potassium, and hypoxemia have been associated with the development of ventricular tachycardia in children. COMPARISON CHART 31.3 DISTINGUISHING SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA (SVT) FROM SINUS TACHYCARDIA Collapsed Rhythms (Pulseless Rhythms) A collapsed rhythm, as defined by PALS, is one that produces cardiac arrest with no palpable pulse and no signs of perfusion (cardiac arrest) (AHA, 2007). Typically, the most common pulseless arrest rhythms in children are asystole or pulseless electrical activity (PEA). Asystole occurs when there is no cardiac electrical activity, commonly referred to as \"a straight line\" on the ECG. The child with PEA has some appreciable rhythm on the ECG but no palpable pulses. PEA may be caused by hypoxemia, hypovolemia, hypothermia, tamponade, toxic ingestion, tension Ventricular tachycardia may also present as pulseless. Ventricular fibrillation, once thought to be rare in children, occurs in serious cardiac conditions in which the ventricle is not pumping effectively. It may develop from ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is characterized by variable, high-amplitude waveforms (coarse VF) or a finer, lower-amplitude waveform with no discernible cardiac rhythm (fine VF). In either case, cardiac output is insufficient. Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment of the child with a cardiac emergency includes the health history and physical examination as well as laboratory and diagnostic testing. The nursing assessment must be performed quickly and accurately so that resuscitation can be instituted if needed.Health History Obtain a brief health history of the child with a cardiac emergency while simultaneously assessing the child and providing life-saving interventions. Key areas to inquire about include: History of cardiac problems, asthma, chromosomal anomaly, delayed growth Symptoms such as syncope, dizziness, palpitations or racing heart, chest pain, coughing, wheezing, increased work of breathing Activity tolerance with play or feeding: Does the child get out of breath, turn blue, or squat during play? Can the child keep up with playmates? Does the infant tire with feedings? Precipitating illness, fever, unexplained joint pains, ingested medications Participation in a sport before the cardiac event occurred or injury to the chest Family history of cardiac problems, sudden death from a cardiac condition, heart attacks at a young age, chromosomal abnormalities Treatment measures performed at the scene: Was CPR initiated? Was an AED used? Physical Examination Quickly establish the child's status. A child who is obviously in distress or is arresting must receive emergent life-saving interventions. Briefly perform the assessment while simultaneously providing life-saving interventions. INSPECTION AND OBSERVATION Assess the child's airway patency and efficiency of breathing. Observe the child's color, noting circumoral pallor or duskiness or central pallor, mottling, duskiness, or cyanosis. Note any increased work of breathing, grunting, head bobbing, or apnea. Inspect the chest for barrel shape, which may be associated with chronic pulmonary or cardiac disease. Observe the pericardium for the presence of lifts or heaves. Note diaphoresis, anxious appearance, or dysmorphic features (40% to 50% of children with Down syndrome also have a congenital cardiac defect [Chen, 2011]). Determine if neck vein distention is present. Inspect the fingertips for clubbing, which is indicative of chronic tissue hypoxemia. AUSCULTATION Auscultate the breath sounds, noting any crackles or wheezes. Auscultate the heart rate. If the child does not have an adequate pulse, initiate CPR. If the child has a strong, perfusing pulse, complete the cardiac assessment. Auscultate with the diaphragm of the stethoscope first and then listen with the bell. Evaluate all of the auscultatory areas, listening first over the second right interspace (aortic valve) and then over the second left interspace (pulmonic valve); next move to the left lower sternal border (tricuspid area); and finally auscultate over the fifth interspace, midclavicular line (mitral area). Evaluate the rate and rhythm of the heart. Listen for any extra sounds or murmurs. Note and describe the quality, intensity, and location of any cardiac murmurs. Take Note! Murmurs are most often systolic and can be benign or associated with pathology. Murmurs that radiate to the back and are grade III or louder are more likely to be due to a cardiac defect. True diastolic murmurs are rare and almost always have a pathologic origin (Menashe, 2007). PERCUSSION AND PALPATION Percuss between the costal interspaces and note the heart's size. Palpate the heart to find the point of maximal impulse (PMI) and to evaluate for an associated thrill. A thrill feels like a fluttering under the fingers and is associated with cardiac pathology. Palpate and note the quality of the pulses. Evaluate each of the pulses bilaterally and note whether they are absent, faint, normal, or bounding. Compare the quality of pulses on each side of the body and also those of the upper and lower body. Note the skin temperature and evaluate the capillary refill. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing The major diagnostic test used is the ECG. Identify the arrhythmia according to the ECG reading ( Fig. 31.7 ). Nursing Management Provide oxygen at 100%. Institute cardiac monitoring and assess oxygen saturation levels via pulse oximetry. Obtain the child's preprinted code drug sheet or use the Broselow tape to obtain the child's height to estimate the tracheal tube sizes and medicationdosages that are appropriate for the child. Always remember to intervene in this order: first airway, then breathing, then circulation. The remainder of this discussion will assume that the nurse has initiated interventions for airway and breathing as discussed earlier in the chapter. Take Note! Pay attention to the rhythm on the monitor, but continually monitor the child's pulse. If the child does not have a pulse or has a pulse of less than 60 bpm, perform cardiac compressions despite the monitor reading (AHA, 2007). Managing Bradyarrhythmias The management of sinus bradycardia is focused on remedying the underlying cause of the slow heart rate. Since hypoxia is the most common cause of sustained bradycardia, oxygenation and ventilation are necessary. The newborn is particularly susceptible to bradycardia in relation to hypoxemia. Continue to reassess the child to determine if the bradycardia improves with adequate oxygenation and ventilation. If bradycardia persists, administer epinephrine and/or atropine as ordered. Epinephrine is the drug of choice for the treatment of persistent bradycardia. Other causes of bradycardia such as hypothermia, head injury, and toxic ingestion are managed by addressing the underlying condition. Warming the hypothermic child may restore a normal sinus rhythm. Children with head injury may have bradycardia without any cardiac involvement, and with successful management of the head injury, the bradycardia will resolve. Antidotes to toxins may be necessary in children whose bradycardia is the result of a toxic ingestion. Managing Tachyarrhythmias The tachyarrhythmias include SVT (stable or unstable) and ventricular tachycardia with a pulse. Examine the ECG to determine if the child is experiencing ventricular tachycardia or SVT. Clinically, determine whether the child in SVT is showing signs that require emergent intervention or if the child is stable. In compensated SVT, the child will appear to be alert, breathing comfortably, and well perfused. The child who is demonstrating signs of compromise, such as a change in consciousness, respiratory status, and perfusion, is considered to be in uncompensated SVT. Uncompensated SVT requires emergent intervention. The child who has ventricular tachycardia with a pulse will have poor perfusion and also requires immediate intervention. The evaluation and approaches to the tachyarrhythmias are discussed in Table 31.6 . Take Note! Adenosine has a rapid onset of action and an extremely short half-life. Administer it extremely rapidly with a generous amount of IV flush; otherwise, it will be ineffective (Kleinman et al., 2010a).FIGURE 31.7 Arrhythmias. (A) Sinus tachycardia: normal QRS and P waves, mild beat-to-beat variability. (B) Supraventricular tachycardia: note rate above 220, abnormal P waves, no beat-to-beat variability. (C) Ventricular tachycardia: rapid and regular rhythm, wide QRS without P waves. (D) Coarse ventricular fibrillation: chaotic electrical activity. Managing Collapsed RhythmsAs in any pediatric emergency, support the ABCs. Manage the airway, provide oxygen, and give fluids. In addition, if the child is pulseless or has a heart rate less than 60 bpm, initiate cardiac compressions (see the section on providing cardiopulmonary resuscitation earlier in the chapter). Additionally, some children may require medications and/or defibrillation or synchronized cardioversion. The pulseless rhythms include ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, asystole, and PEA. ECG characteristics and management of these rhythms are summarized in Table 31.7 . Also treat the underlying causes of the arrhythmia, if known. The AHA emphasizes the importance of cardiac compressions in pulseless individuals with arrhythmias (Kleinman et al., 2010a). Give compressions before and immediately after defibrillation (see defibrillation section earlier in the chapter). Administer medications such as epinephrine, lidocaine, or amiodarone as ordered. In the past it was recommended that individuals who required defibrillation be given three shocks in a row, but recent research findings have shown that the individual should be defibrillated only once, followed by five cycles of CPR. For defibrillation to be most effective, cardiac compressions must be performed effectively with minimal interruptions (Kleinman et al., 2010a).NEAR DROWNING Water can be a great source of fun and exercise for children and adolescents, but drowning is the second-leading cause of preventable death in children and adolescents in the United States and worldwide (World Health Organization, 2010). In warm- weather states where swimming pools are more common, drowning is the primary cause of death in young people. Most drowning deaths are preventable, and the World Health Organization (2010) notes that \"lapse in adult supervision is the single most important contributory cause for drowning.\" Near drowning is defined as a submersion injury in which the child survives. Survival and neurologic outcome of near drowning depend on early and appropriate resuscitation. In recent years, with appropriate resuscitation efforts and treatment, children have demonstrated better neurologic outcomes (Verive, 2011). Pathophysiology Typically, a child who is drowning will struggle to breathe and eventually will aspirate water. Aspiration of relatively small amounts of water leads to poor oxygenation, with retention of carbon dioxide. Alveolar surfactant is depleted during the drowning event and pulmonary edema commonly occurs. Hypoxemia results in increased capillary permeability and resultant hypovolemia. Even small amounts of aspirated water may lead to pulmonary edema within a 24- to 48-hour period after the near-drowning episode (Verive, 2011). A near-drowning survivor is also at risk for renal complications due to altered renal perfusion during the hypoxemic state. Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment of the near-drowning survivor is crucial and must take place quickly and accurately. Health History Obtain the history rapidly while providing life-saving interventions. Ask about the circumstances of the event: Where did the incident occur? Was the child in a lake, river, ocean, or swimming pool? Was the child submerged in a toilet, bucket, or bathtub? Did someone witness the child's entry into the water? Was the water fresh or salty? Cold or warm? Is it likely the water was contaminated? Were there any extenuating circumstances, such as a diving or automobile accident, associated with the near drowning? What was the approximate length of time of the submersion? Was the child conscious or unconscious when rescued? What was done at the scene? Was CPR initiated? If so, when? If a cervical spine injury was suspected, was the cervical spine immobilized? Was an AED used? When did the child last eat (to prepare for possible intubation)? Physical Examination Evaluate airway patency and breathing. Auscultate all lung fields for signs of pulmonary edema, such as coarseness or crackles. Evaluate the heart rate, pulses, and perfusion. Note the cardiac rhythm on the monitor and report evidence of arrhythmias. Evaluate the child's neurologic status. Use a pen light to determine pupillary reaction. Use the pediatric coma score to further assess the neurologic status. Does the child open the eyes spontaneously, to stimuli, or not at all? Is there any spontaneous movement? Is the younger child crying? Can the older child speak? Measure the child's temperature, as hypothermia often occurs with near drowning. Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing While awaiting laboratory and diagnostic testing results, continue resuscitative efforts as addressed below. Laboratory and diagnostic tests typically include the following: Arterial blood electrolytes: imbalance related to development of shock Nursing Management Because of the potentially devastating effects that drowning-related hypoxia has on the child's brain, airway interventions must be initiated immediately after retrieving a child from the water. Every second counts. Initial interventions in a near-drowning event are always focused on the ABCs; commonly, resuscitative efforts have begun before the child arrives at the acute care facility. If a cervical spine injury is suspected (as in the case of a diving accident), provide stabilization either manually or with a cervical collar. As with any suspected neck injury, do not remove the cervical collar until injury to the cervical spine has been ruled out through a radiograph and clinical evaluation. Suction the airway to ensure airway patency. The child may have aspirated particles from a contaminated water source or emesis, a relatively common complication associated with near drowning. A large-bore suction catheter (e.g., Yankauer) is an effective tool for clearing the upper airway. Administer supplemental oxygen at 100%. Children who have poor or absent respiratory effort most likely will require intubation. Insert a nasogastric tube to decompress the stomach and prevent aspiration of stomach contents. Initiate chest compressions if a pulse is not present. Usually, the child exhibits some degree of hypothermia and will require warming. Generally, the core body temperature should be raised slowly, as warming a drowning victim too quickly may have deleterious effects. Remove any wet clothing, dry the child, and cover him or her with warmed blankets. Warm IV fluids and use other warming methods as prescribed. Consider This T eva Dawson, a 2-year-old girl, is rushed to the emergency room by ambulance after experiencing a near drowning in the family swimming pool. Teva was resuscitated at the scene and is now breathing spontaneously. She is lethargic and coughs occasionally. What health history information would you obtain from the parents or caregivers? What immediate management is necessary? What education may be necessary for this family?POISONING Emergency care of the pediatric poisoning victim consists of rapid nursing assessment and prompt management. Take Note! If a normally healthy child (particularly a young child) suddenly deteriorates without a known cause, suspect a toxic ingestion. Nursing Assessment Nursing assessment of the poisoning victim focuses on a thorough health history, followed by physical examination and laboratory and diagnostic testing. Health History Obtain the health history from the parents or caregiver or, in the case of an older child or teenager, from the child. Inquire about the approximate time of poisoning and the nature of the toxin. Was the toxin ingested, inhaled, or applied to the skin? In the case of pill ingestion, does the caregiver have the medication bottle? Did the child experience nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, or neurologic changes such as disorientation, slurred speech, or altered gait? Determine the progression of the symptoms. Did the parent or caregiver call the National Poison Control Center Hotline? Has any treatment been given? In the case of older children and teens, inquire about any history of depression or threatened suicide. Take Note! The National Poison Control Center Hotline number is 1-800-222-1222. Physical Examination Ingestion of medications or chemicals may result in a wide variety of clinical manifestations. Perform a thorough physical examination, noting alterations that may occur with particular ingestions, such as: Hyper- or mydriasis (pupillary dilatation) Pay particular attention to the child's mental status, skin moisture and color, and bowel sounds (Penny & Moriarty, 2009). Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing The suspected poison may direct the laboratory and diagnostic testing. A variety of blood tests may be performed: Chemistry panel: to detect hypoglycemia or metabolic acidosis and assess renal function ECG: to identify arrhythmias or conduction delay Liver function tests: to assess for liver injury Urine and blood toxicology screens (available for a limited number of medications; may vary per institution) Specific drug levels if the substance ingested is known or highly suspected Nursing Management When poisoning occurs, give priority to the child's ABCs. Treat alterations as discussed earlier in this chapter. Monitor vital signs frequently and provide supportive care. Few specific antidotes are available for medications or other toxins. Ipecac is rarely used in the health care setting to induce vomiting and is no longer recommended for use in the home setting (AAP, 2010; Penny & Moriarty, 2009). Gastric lavage, administration of activated charcoal (binds with the chemical substance in the bowel), or whole bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol electrolyte solutions may be used. Occasionally, dialysis is required to lower the level of toxin in the bloodstream. The intervention is based on the source of the ingestion. For example, activated charcoal is an effective method for preventing the absorption of many medications but is not effective in the case of an iron overdose. If opiate or other narcotic ingestion is suspected, administer naloxone to reverse the respiratory depression or altered level of consciousness. Treatment of seizures and alterations in thermoregulation may also be needed.Specific treatment of the poisoning will be determined when the toxin is identified and poison control is queried. Maintain ongoing assessment of the poisoned child because many toxins exhibit very late effects.TRAUMA The leading cause of death in children and adolescents is unintentional injuries (Heron, 2010). Falls are the most common cause of pediatric injury and automobile accidents continue to cause the deaths of about five children daily, with significant numbers experiencing injury (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2008). Childhood trauma also results from pedestrian accidents, sporting and bicycling injuries, and firearm use. Children of varying ages are susceptible to various forms of injury due to their developmental level as well as their environmental exposure. Young children rely on their caregivers to promote their safety. Young children also are not developmentally equipped to be able to recognize dangerous situations. Because pediatric injury is so common, nurses must become adept at assessment and intervention in the pediatric trauma victim. Nursing Assessment The trauma survey includes a brief health history as the child is being assessed and life-saving measures are being instituted. Health History Begin the health history by asking when the injury happened. If the child sustained a motor vehicle-related injury, ask how fast the vehicle was going. Determine if the child was appropriately restrained in the automobile. If the child was riding a bicycle, skateboarding, or using in-line skates, was he or she wearing a helmet, knee pads, and wrist guards? Determine what interventions were performed at the scene. Was the child immobilized on a backboard to protect the cervical spine? If the child is bleeding, ask the person who transported the child to estimate the amount of blood lost. If the child experienced a fall, ask if the fall was witnessed and the height from which the child fell. Did the child fall onto a hard surface such as concrete? How did the child land: on the head or back, or did the child catch himself or herself with the hands? Younger children and boys are at higher risk for injuring their head. Did the child lose consciousness at the scene? What kind of behavior did the child exhibit after the fall? Since the fall, has the child complained of a headache or been vomiting? While obtaining a detailed history about the fall, think about the child's developmental stage. For example, does it seem plausible that a toddler might fall down the stairs? In contrast, what is the likelihood that a 2-month-old would suffer a fractured femur from a fall? Keep in mind the possibility of child abuse. Critically evaluate the reported circumstances and try to determine if the history, developmental stage of the child, and type of injury sustained match. In addition, evaluate the type of injury that the child sustained and the history given by the caregiver. For example, children who fall from significant heights often suffer skeletal fractures, but abdominal and chest injuries rarely result from falling from significant heights. Physical Examination Physical examination of the child with a traumatic injury should be approached with an evaluation of the ABCs (primary survey) first. Assess the patency of the airway and establish the effectiveness of breathing (as discussed earlier in the chapter). Examine the child's respiratory effort, breath sounds, and color. Next, evaluate the circulation. Note the pulse rate and quality. Observe the color, skin temperature, and perfusion. If bleeding has occurred, the child's circulation may become compromised. After assessing and intervening for the child's ABCs, proceed to the secondary survey. Assess for disability (D). Rapidly assess critical neurologic function. Determine the level of consciousness, pupillary reaction, and verbal and motor responses to auditory and painful stimuli. If the child is a young infant, palpate the anterior fontanel: a full and bulging fontanel signals increased intracranial pressure. The traumatized child's neurologic status may range from completely normal to comatose. Take Note! Unequal pupils or a fixed and dilated pupil is considered a neurosurgical emergency. Immediately report this finding. Following the ABCs and D (disability) is E (exposure). Expose the child to observe the entire body for signs of injury, whether blunt or penetrating. Perform a systematic, thorough inspection of the child's body. Note active bleeding and extremity deformity, as well as any lacerations and abrasions. Observe for movement and any complaints of immobility or pain with movement. Inspect the abdomen for redness, skin discoloration, or distention. Auscultate for bowel sounds in all four quadrants. If the child is verbal, ask if he or she has any pain in the stomach. If the child is younger, ask, \"Do you have a tummy ache?\" If the child reports abdominal pain, ask the child to point to where it hurts. Note any guarding of the abdomen, which is an indication of abdominal pain. If bowel injury is a possibility, only light palpation is acceptable. Always assess the least tender areas first and palpate the more sensitive areas last.Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing As in other pediatric emergencies, never delay life-saving measures to wait for laboratory or diagnostic test results. In addition to routine laboratory tests, common laboratory and diagnostic tests for the pediatric trauma victim include: Type and cross-match: to assess the child's blood type before blood products are given Prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time: to evaluate for clotting dysfunction Amylase and lipase: to identify pancreatic injury Liver function tests: to assess for liver injury Pregnancy test (in any female who has reached puberty) CT scan, ultrasound, or MRI of the head, abdomen, or extremities: to evaluate the extent of the injury Nursing Management Nursing management of the pediatric trauma victim focuses initially on the ABCs. Providing Immediate Care If head or spinal injury is suspected, open the airway using the jaw-thrust maneuver with cervical spine stabilization (see Fig. 31.4 ). The guidelines for basic life support recommend that if the airway cannot be opened using the jaw-thrust maneuver, it may be opened using the head tilt-chin lift maneuver since opening the airway is a priority (Berg et al., 2010). The head and neck of a trauma victim should be stabilized manually. Take Note! Infants and young children require unique cervical spine management because they have prominent occiputs that result in flexion of the neck in the supine position. To maintain the optimal neutral spinal position in the young child, use a special pediatric backboard with a head indentation, or use a folded towel to elevate the child's torso. Clear the airway of obstruction using a large-bore suction device such as a Yankauer. If the child is breathing on his or her own, give oxygen at the highest flow possible (such as with a nonrebreathing mask). If the child is not breathing on his or her own, intervene with basic life support discussed earlier in this chapter (Berg et al., 2010). If a BVM device is available, connect it to the oxygen source and use the bag to ventilate the child. Observe the chest rise and be careful not to overventilate, as this results in abdominal distention. Deliver breaths at a rate of one breath every 3 seconds (Berg et al., 2010). Do not hyperventilate. In the not-too-distant past, head injury in children was managed using hyperventilation. This resulted in hypocapnia (decreased amounts of carbon dioxide in the blood). The physiologic effect of hypocapnia is the induction of vasoconstriction, which in turn results in tissue ischemia. Therefore, current management of head injury in children does not use hyperventilation. The only exception to this rule is in an acute situation, if the child is showing signs of a possible brain stem herniation, hyperventilation may be used initially and briefly. Assess the child for a strong central pulse. If the child has no pulse, initiate CPR immediately. When perfusion is compromised, administer IV fluid resuscitation. Trauma victims are more likely to require colloids or blood products due to blood loss from the injury. Take Note! Children with head injury who have signs of shock such as poor perfusion and bradycardia should receive fluid volume resuscitation (Kleinman et al., 2010b). KEY CONCEPTS Young children's smaller airways and immature respiratory and immune systems place them at higher risk for respiratory distress than older children and adults. Children generally have healthy hearts and cardiovascular systems and thus rarely present with primary cardiac arrest. Younger children and adolescents are at higher risk for injury due to normal development at those ages. Children present with a variety of emergencies and injuries and must be evaluated and treated in an appropriate and timely fashion to achieve a positive outcome. The health history is obtained rapidly while life-saving measures are performed simultaneously. Assess the airway, then breathing, then circulation, providing interventions for alterations before moving on to the next assessment. Provide continuous reassessment, as children respond quickly to interventions and deteriorate quickly as well. Pulse oximetry and capnometry can be useful tools for evaluating respiratory status. Never delay intervention pending laboratoryresults if the child's clinical status warrants immediate action. Provide support and education to the child and family involved in an emergency. Teach families why certain procedures are being done, explaining technical medical interventions in simple terms and, for the child, at his or her developmental level. Small amounts of edema or secretions can contribute to significant respiratory effort in infants and young children. Children dehydrate more quickly than adults and experience alterations in perfusion related to hypovolemia. Children in respiratory distress and shock require supplemental oxygen. Intubation is necessary for the apneic child or the child whose airway is not maintainable. Accurate assessment of perfusion status and appropriate fluid resuscitation are critical in the prevention and treatment of shock in children. Life-threatening arrhythmias in children, though uncommon, often must be quickly treated with defibrillation or synchronized cardioversion in addition to CPR. In the case of near drowning, maintain ongoing assessment and intervention of pulmonary status. Maintain airway, breathing, and circulation in the child who has experienced an accidental ingestion and prepare for gastric lavage or administration of activated charcoal. In addition to intervening for airway, breathing, and circulation problems in the pediatric trauma victim, assess for altered neurologic status and extent of bleeding or injury.

He had been feeling faint off and on and today fainted at school. On the cardiac monitor an abnormal cardiac rhythm is noted. At present the child is stable. What questions would be most appropriate for the nurse to ask when obtaining the child's health history? What objective assessments should the nurse make? 2. Charlie is a 2-year-old who is admitted to the hospital after accidentally ingesting a medication. His mother, who brought Charlie to the hospital, is upset and crying. How does Charlie's age and stage of development affect his risk for accidental ingestion? How should the nurse respond to the mother's distress? Develop a discharge teaching plan for Charlie and his family related to poison prevention. 3. A 7-month-old is brought to the acute care facility with a chief complaint of difficulty breathing. The infant's mother says that his cold has gotten worse and he won't eat. What additional questions should the nurse ask about the infant's health history? How would the nurse appropriately manage this infant's airway? STUDY ACTIVITIES 1. Spend a day in the pediatric emergency department or urgent care center and document the role of the triage nurse. 2. Observe the pediatric emergency medical team at work or observe a pediatric code in the hospital. Compare and contrast the measures performed for the child with those that would be performed for an adult in a similar emergency situation. 3. Develop a teaching project related to injury prevention and present it at a local elementary, middle, or high school. Ensure that the education is geared toward the children's developmental level. 4. Interview the parents of a child who has experienced an emergency situation about how they felt during and after the emergency. Present the information to your classmates. 5. When providing care to a child in an emergency, the nurse performs the following assessments. Place them in the proper sequence. a. Pupillary reaction b. Presence of cough or sputum c. Heart rate and capillary refill d. Presence of bruises and abrasions e.
