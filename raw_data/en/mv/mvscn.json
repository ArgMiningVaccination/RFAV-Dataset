Watson, DO, MBA Executive Director, DC Board of Medicine HAPPY NEW YEAR! Since our last publication, while our nation's health care experts and policy makers have been busy tackling health care reform and much more, the DC Board of Medicine (BOMed) has also been busy with reform efforts. We believe these efforts will continue to put us on track toward providing better servic-es to our licensees, educating and protecting the public, and becoming a best-practice board in the nation's capital. It's hard to believe that in a few weeks I will have been serving in the role of Execu-tive Director for one year. I am extremely pleased with the progress our team has made to improve our efficiencies and the steps we are taking to ad-dress the important challenges still ahead of us. I am happy to report that, with the diligent help of the Mayor's Office of Boards and Commissions, all vacant BOMed member slots have been filled. This has allowed us to overcome one of the most significant challenges that the board faced for quite some time. I welcome our new board chair, Dr. Janis Orlowski, and new members Dr. Shivani Kam-dar, and consumer member, Melissa Musiker. Now, with a full complement of skilled board members, I believe we are well positioned to take full advantage of the opportunity this presents for the board to evaluate its functions and make the bold and decisive changes necessary to be leaders in this new era of medical regulation. Our FY 2010 began in Oc- tober with a visit from the Fed-eration of State Medical Boards (FSMB) executive leadership presenting their organization's strategic vision for improving the system of medical licen-sure. They also announced the opening and significance of their new DC Advocacy Office, which will advocate for policies to improve the integrity of our health care system and protec-tions for the public. Their open-ing reception was attended by members of the DC Board, and the Director of the DC Depart- ment of Health, Dr. Pierre Vigi-lance (see page 7). The FSMB presence in the District places BOMed in the fortunate position of being able to partner with FSMB, and serve as a beta site in best practices health regula-tion model development. I have been invited to be a member of their recently resurrected emer-gency preparedness Readi-ness and Response Workgroup that will work on developing guidelines for medical boards on preparing for, and manag-ing, the deployment of health professionals across state lines in an emergency. Understanding that \"it takes a village\" to build a best-prac-tice board, we continue to stra-tegically cultivate relationships and seek out partnerships that will allow us to achieve that goal. I visited with my Virginia colleagues in Richmond to ob-serve their proceedings, share experiences, and discuss chal-lenges and meaningful ways to work together in the region to protect the public and strength-en the medical profession. The visit was mutually rewarding and has resulted in the Virginia Board Chair and the Executive Director paying a visit to the DC Board in February. We have also been reaching out to stakeholders and across District governmental agen-cies to engage in efforts and collaborate on health initiatives that will allow us to improve our core functions and help the District with health care plan-ning. In December, I was in-vited by the president of the DC Hospital Association, Robert Malson, to update their Board of Directors on activities within BOMed. In January, the Board heard presentations from the Of ce of the Chief Technology Of cer on how to utilize the DC Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping data system and from the Director of the State Health Planning and Develop-ment Agency (SHPDA) on how to capture and share statistical information that will facilitate adequate planning for the Dis-trict's health care workforce. ACTIVITIES: The Board voted to eliminate the postgraduate physician in training enrollment program and replace it with a medi-cal training license (MTL) for residents. This has been well received by the Gradu-ate Medical Education (GME) directors of all the hospitals who agree that the MTL would be a more efficient and effective monitoring oversight system. At the direction of the board, our attorney has submitted the necessary language requesting the regulatory changes and the board awaits a decision from the DC Council. The Board has begun to take necessary steps to improve the management oversight of impaired physicians under an order with the board. The board has been working closely with the Medical So-ciety of DC (MSDC) to sign a Memorandum of Understand-ing (MOU) that will establish clear standards and outline a more transparent and reliable reporting process. The Board has established three working subcommit- tees\u2014 Licensing; Monitoring; and Policy\u2014to more ef-ficiently carry out its duties. The subcommittees consist of a subset of board mem-bers who meet on the 2nd Thursday of every month to analyze special cases, review and develop new policies, oversee disciplinary hearings, and make recommendations for action to the full board. L. to R.: William L. Harp, MD, Executive Director of the Virginia Board of Medicine; Jane E. Piness, MD, Chairperson of the Virginia Board; Attorney Jennifer L. Deschenes, JD, MS, Deputy Executive Director of Discipline; and Jacqueline Watson, DO, MBA. The Board continues to explore new and effective communication channels\u2014 such as social media platforms Twitter, Facebook, Blogs\u2014to educate and keep licensees and the public informed. Please remember that you can let us know what you think about any health related issue or service we provide by sending us an email at dcdocsspeak@ dc.gov . BOMed continues to work on improving its data collection methods and on becoming more GREEN . We are currently gathering relevant demographic information, and also assessing the benefits of publishing an e-newsletter only. Please take a moment to complete the brief survey ( http://www.surveymonkey. com/s/dcbomed ) that will allow us to make informed decisions about your needs and those of the District of Columbia. As you see, we have indeed been busy. BOMed staff contin-ue to work on building new skill sets in order to improve our level of efficiency and provide the necessary administrative support to board members and the public. I remain energized and enthusiastic about being a part of a great new team and look forward to the important work ahead of us. Happy Reading and Be Well until our next issue in May!

Board of Medicine TO BE OR NOT TO BE \"IN AFFILIATION WITH A COMPARABLE HEALTH PROFESSIONAL \" WHAT DOES THE PHRASE MEAN AND WHEN IS IT USED? By John C. Greenhaugh, Esq. Senior Assistant Attorney General & Board Legal Advisor Counsel's Column From time to time, a physician not licensed in the District but licensed in another jurisdiction, wishes to practice in the Dist rict for a short period of time by treating a group or an individual, or by giving a clinic or demonstration. This fact pattern is one of several examples when the visiting health professional is exempted from local licensure requirements. What are the rules fo r this scenario? D. C. Official Code \u00a7 3 - 1205.02 (3) permits a physician licensed in another state to come to the District for the purpose of \"providing care to an individual or group for a limited period of time, or who is called from a state in professional consultat ion by or on behalf of a specific patient or client to visit, examine, treat, or advise the specific patient or client in the Distr ict, or to give a demonstration of a procedure or clinic in the District; provided, that the individual engages in the provision of car e, consultation, demonstration, or clinic in affiliation with a comparable health professional licensed, registered, or certified pursuant to this chapter\". The cited law raises a number of questions that the Board of Medicine has recently addressed through the issuance of a policy statement. You will be able to find the full policy statement on the Board of Medicine's website [ www.hpla.doh.dc.gov/bomed ]. Briefly stated, the Board has implemented the following requirements and procedures: 1. The physician wishing to practice in the District under this provision must be in good standing in each state licensed and possess an unencumbered license in each state licensed. 2. The visiting physician must request permission from the Board of Medicine at least thirty (30) days prior to the start of practice in the District. 3. The request must contain the purpose of the practice visit and whether or not it is for voluntary services or for fee, the anticipated duration of the visit, medical license number in each state licensed, an affidavit that he/she is in good standing in each jurisdiction licensed, and that during the visit the visiting physician will be affiliated with a named physician who i s locally licensed. 4. The request must be accompanied by a notarized statement from the locally licensed physician that he/she consents to being affiliated with the visiting physician for the duration of the visit. The term \"in affiliation with\" means to be \"associ ated with\" or with\" a comparable health professional. A \"comparable health professional\" means only a physician licensed in the District. There is no requirement that the locally licensed physician practice in the same medical specialty. 5. The Board expects that the visiting non-D.C. licensed physician will be in the District to practice medicine no more that f ive (5) days at any one time, and that the practice would be non-reoccurring. Exceptions to the length or non-reoccurring nature of the visit should be clearly set forth in the initial request. DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN EACH CASE, THE BOARD MAY REQUIRE THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA TO BE MET: 1. The locally licensed physician agreeing to be \"in affiliation with\" the visiting physician may be required to be in attenda nce at the location of the practice, clinic or demonstration by the visiting physician, depending on the number of physicians visiting at the same time and the nature or purpose of the visiting physician's practice in the District. 2. No locally licensed physician shall be in affiliation with more than a specific number of physicians at any one time, the r atio of visiting physicians to the locally licensed physician to be determined by the Board in each case. The phrase \"in affiliation with a comparable health professional\" does not mean a superior-subordinate relationship exists and does not imply \"supervision\" over the visiting physician. It might be helpful if the reader thinks of the locally licensed physician as the host of the visiting physician who is here for a brief and temporary period for a specific purpose. It may no t be necessary for the host physician to be \"in attendance\" when the visiting physician is treating one patient or conducting a clinic or demonstration, but it would be expected that the host physician was aware of where and when the treatment, clinic or demonstration was taking place. The Board would address each request to practice medicine in the District using this licensure exemption on a case-by-case basis, but all requests would be processed within the policy framework expressed above.January 2010 z Page 6 D.C. Board of Medicine New FSMB President & CEO Humayun Chaudhry, DO, addresses the Board. Dr. Chaudhry chose DC as the first board to visit because of its location in the nation's capital, and to announce the scheduled opening of their DC advocacy office. Below, Dr. Chaudhry answers a few questions for the BOMed newsletter: 1. When did you assume your new position at the FSMB? I assumed my position as President and CEO of the FSMB on October 19, 2009. 2. What are your top priorities in your new position? My top three priorities are to strengthen the FSMB's abilities to fulfill its mission, to help our state member and osteopathic boards achieve their mission of public protection, and achieve greater national awareness of our efforts in medical licensure and regulation as we head into our second century of operations. 3. What are the major challenges facing the FSMB in 2010? The biggest challenge facing the FSMB in 2010 is helping our state member boards effectively fulfill their mission of public Front row (left to right): Lawrence A. Manning, MD, Physician Member; Jacqueline A. Watson, DO, MBA, Board Executive Director; Frederick C. Finelli, MD, JD, Outgoing Physician Member and Immediate Past Chairperson; Martin Crane, MD, Chairman of FSMB Board of Directors; Humayun J. Chaudhry, DO, FSMB President and CEO; Cheryl R.

Vowels, MD, MPH, DOH Designee; and BOMed attorney John Greenhaugh, Esq.EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP OF THE FEDERATION OF STATE MEDICAL BOARDS VISITS DC The DC Board of Medicine welcomed visitors from the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) during their October board meeting. FSMB is a national non-profit organization representing the 70 medical boards of the United States and its territories. Its mission is to continuously improve the quality, safety and integrity of health care through developing and promoting high standards for physician licensure and practice. Board members and the FSMB executives discussed strategies for improving the regulatory and licensure process in the District and throughout the country. protection in a recessionary economy. One of the ways we can help is to improve the efficiency of state member board operations through enhancing the Federation Credentials Verification Service (which is accepted by 62 of 69 state medical boards) and widespread adoption of the Uniform Application (UA) for Physician Licensure. Both of these products are being strengthened in 2010 and should help medical boards accomplish their tasks faster and more efficiently. 4. What do you think is the greatest barrier faced by medical boards as they do their work, and how can FSMB help? Probably the biggest barrier faced by state medical boards is the lack of understanding by the public of the critical role played by the boards in protecting the public. The FSMB recognizes this area as an opportunity and a new FSMB office in Washington, D.C. should help achieve greater national awareness for the FSMB and for the roles played by state medical boards, their board members, their legal counsel, their investigators and their Executive Directors. 5. How can boards ensure that adverse-event reporting will lead to higher levels of quality care? Ever since the reports of the Institute of Medicine a decade ago about medical errors and adverse events, there has been an abundance of research looking at medical error reporting, investigation and the prevention of adverse events. Helping health care providers prevent errors and mistakes is far better than addressing the errors after they have occurred. This requires a collaborative approach focusing on education and I am pleased that medical schools and graduate medical education programs are improving the training of future physicians in this area, and that medical licensing exams like the USMLE and COMLEX are beginning to assess future physicians' knowledge and understanding of how errors and bad outcomes can be avoided. 6. Are there any specific actions or policies that you would like to see state boards adopt throughout the country? The FSMB would like to see the Uniform Application (UA) for Physician Licensure adopted by all state medical boards because it facilitates license portability (the ability of physicians to obtain medical licensure with more than one state medical board), which is essential in the age of telemedicine, where physicians seek to practice medicine in multiple jurisdictions, and in the event of a national disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, when expedited physician licensure is required for qualified physicians from other states offering their services. 7. In your opinion, what changes or additions would you like to see made in medical school curricula (across the nation or globally), and why? (changes that could have an impact once those students become licensed physicians) There is research that demonstrates that physicians who received a board action (e.g., license revocation or suspension) more often than not displayed behavior or attitude problems while in medical school. The challenge for medical educators and medical regulators alike, of course, is to intervene before such a board action takes place. Ohio University School of Medicine recently tried to address this issue by partnering with the Ohio Medical Board to educate medical students about how state medical boards function and how to stay out of trouble. I look forward to working with the DC Board. NEW PRESIDENT & CEO OF FSMB VISITS DC BOARDJanuary 2010 z Page 7 D.C. Board of Medicine FSMB TO HOST 2010 DC BOARD RETREAT In April, the Board will hold a strategic visioning retreat facilitated by the FSMB, to examine current policies and processes and develop a blueprint for addressing short and long term goals that will position BOMed to be a best-practice board.

Health Professional Licensing Administration DOH - BOMed 717 14th Street NWSuite 600Washington, DC 20005By John C. Greenhaugh, Esq., Senior Assistant Attorney General & Board Legal Advisor \"Legalization of Marijuana for Medical Treatment Initiative Amendment Act of 2010\" DISTRICT COUNCIL CONSIDERS BILL TO PERMIT USE OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA The DC Council is considering a Bill to permit the use of medical marijuana in the District. The Bill, if passed in its current form, will by rulemaking specify the qualifying medical conditions that result in a medical necessity for the medicinal use of marijuana, and a list of qualifying medical treatments, which are medical treatments that have side effects that result in a medical necessity for the medicinal use of marijuana. One of several dispensaries speci cally authorized to ll marijuana \"recommendations\" from physicians for patients and located in the District, will ll the recommendation from the physician. In order to be a qualifying medical condition or a qualifying medical treatment, the medical condition or the side effects of the medical treatment shall be 1) chronic or long-lasting, and 2) be debilitating or interfere with the basic functions of life, and either produce intractable pain which does not respond to ordinary medical or surgical measures, or be a serious medical condition that cannot be effectively treated by any ordinary medical or surgical measure. For more details or to view the Bill in its then current form, go to the DC Council website ( www.dccouncil.washington.dc.us/ ). The Bill, Bill 18-0622, is cited as the \"Legalization of Marijuana for Medical Treatment Initiative Amendment Act of 2010.\" PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR CME CREDIT As every DC licensed physician is aware, you must have fty (50) hours of CME during every two-year licensure period after the rst renewal. As part of the SafeRX Law, which had as one of its primary goals the licensing of pharmaceutical detailers, there is a requirement to establish a pharmaceutical education program within the Department of Health. The Department has established such a program, known as the Academic Detailing Program, by contracting with the Alosa Foundation, Inc., which is associated with the Harvard University Medical School. The Board of Medicine has approved the Academic Detailing Program for CME credit to physicians who take and successfully complete the course of instruction. CME credit shall be on an hour-for-hour basis and physicians may apply those CME hours earned against the fty (50) hours of CME required during the two-year licensure period. For further information, see the May 2009 edition of the DC Board of Medicine newsletter (online at www.hpla.doh.dc.gov/bomed ) or contact the program at 1-877-410-5750; www.RxFacts.org, info@RxFacts.org.Legal Briefs January 2010 z Page 9 D.C. Board of Medicine GETTING A LICENSE IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIAMEDICAL SOCIETY OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA MEETS WITH MEDICAL BOARD The DC Board is working to improve its monitoring oversight of impaired physicians under an order from the Board. The Medical Society of the District of Columbia (MSDC) visited with the Board to discuss ways to assist, and both pledged to work together on a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) outlining expectations around accountability, transparency and efficiencies. MSDC is part of the federation of state, county and specialty medical societies that constitute the American Medical Asso-ciation. MSDC has approximately 1,500 physician members. We are often asked by new applicants: \"How long will it take to get my license in DC?\" The path to approval involves three distinct steps: 1) Processing , 2) Analysis , and 3) Decision . PHASE 1 - PROCESSING: Application, photos and fees, made payable to \"DC Treasurer\", must be submitted, and all supporting documents required must be received by the processing department within 120 business days of submission of an application. Loose documents, without an associated application form, will be discarded. Notifications regarding missing documentation will be sent at the 30-, 60-, and 90-day mark. Once all documents have been received, an applicant will have successfully completed phase 1 and the application is then referred to the Health Licensing Specialist (HLS) for analysis. PHASE 2 - ANALYSIS: The HLS will conduct a more detailed review of all the documents provided. If necessary, further information may be requested from the applicant in order for the HLS to complete the analysis phase. Once phase 2 is completed, the application is marked as pending board approval and referred to the Board of Medicine (the Board) for review. PHASE 3 - DECISION: All applications for licensure are thoroughly reviewed by the Board. Once an application has been reviewed by the Board, and found to be in accordance with the statutes and regulations for licensure in the District, the privilege to practice medicine is granted and a license certificate is mailed to the applicant.

DC Board of Medicine Mission Statement \"To protect and enhance the health, safety, and well-being of District of Columbia residents by promoting evidence- based best practices in health regulation, high standards of quality care and implementing policies that prevent adverse events.\"Medical Society representatives Barbara Allen; Dr. Peter Lavine; and Ed Shanbacker. January 2010 z Page 10 D.C. Board of Medicine In July 2009, a law became effective that repealed the registration program for persons who practice or offer to practice naturo p- athy or naturopathic healing in the District and who are not trained as naturopathic physicians to practice naturopathic medici ne under the purview of the Boards of Allied and Behavioral Health staff. Beginning with the effective date of the statute repeal ing the registration program, no new applications for registration were accepted. Individuals then currently registered were allow ed to continue to use their registration to practice naturopathy until the registration period is over on February 28, 2010. Rene wals for the registration program will not be accepted and there is no \"grandfather\" provision for those who currently hold registra tions. The registration program for naturopaths has never been under the Board of Medicine. There is now in the District a licensing program to license those who are qualified as naturopathic physicians and wish to prac - tice naturopathic medicine. The law can be found at D. C. Official Code \u00a7 3-1206.21 and District of Columbia Municipal Regula-tions (DCMR), Chapter 52. The profession is regulated by the Board of Medicine in conjunction with an Advisory Committee on Naturopathic Medicine. A license to practice naturopathic medicine requires a degree of doctor of naturopathic medicine from a n accredited college or university and a passing score on the examination sponsored by the North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners (NABNE) and called the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examination, or NPLEX examination. See Chapter 52 of the DCMR for the complete requirements for licensure. NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE: NATUROPATHIC PHYSICIAN ADVISORY COMMITTEE CHAIR SPEAKS TO THE BOARD I had the pleasure of giving a presentation to the DC Board of Medicine at the full panel meeting on November 18, 2009. The presentation covered two proposed changes to the DC Municipal Regulations for Naturopathic Medicine. The first change proposed a formulary to clarify what the \"natural remedies\" are that licensed Naturopathic Physicians in the District can administer or prescribe for their patients. Currently this term is not defined and is subject to interpretation, which can cause confusion for practicing Naturopathic Physicians. The second change sought to expand the scope of practice of Naturopathic Physicians in the District, including allowing them to perform physical examinations and order laboratory testing and diagnostic imaging. This change takes into account the high level of academic and clinical training of Naturopathic Physicians and matches their scope of practice in other licensed states. While the Board is still in talks about the steps needed to define \"natural remedies,\" I am pleased to report that the second change in regard to the expanded scope of practice has been approved. I would like to thank the Board of Medicine, especially Dr. Jacqueline Watson and Dr. Frederick Finelli as well as Dr. Feseha Woldu, John Greenhaugh, Esq. and Aisha Williams for their assistance in these matters. \u2014 Charlene Kannankeril, ND By John C.
