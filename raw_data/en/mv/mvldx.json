Heavy metals contribute to sensory and language issues as seen in autism. Homeopathy can effectively address metal toxicity. There are other options available also so let's look at them too. 3 of the Main options for Heavy metal detox - Zeolites - Andy Cutler Chelation - Homeopathic Detox Nano Zeolites like TRS seem to be the buzz word on the street now. These Nano Zeolites look like that are preferable over the chelating agents in Andy Cutler Chelation which use acid-based chelators. However, there are still some issues with them. They are often made from synthetic materials, there is not a lot of studies on these materials as they have not been around for very long. Other Naturally sourced Nano Zeolite are high in heavy metals as they are so effective at attracting these metals that they have already done so and therefore lead to more heavy metal toxicity Toxa prevent is one Zeolite option that I like they seem to have managed to find a solution to a natural material being loaded with heavy metals. Toxa prevent uses clinoptilolite. It must be processed to clean out anything which it has already absorbed. Cleaning out clinoptilolite turns it into an empty \"sponge\", maximising the amount of toxins it can absorb from the body. The second part of the process optimises the particle size - only particles which are sized between 6 and 10 microns (thousandth of a millimetre) are used in Toxaprevent. This ensures they cannot pass through the stomach or intestinal barrier into the bloodstream but are eliminated through natural bowel movements instead. The ACC (Andy Cutler Chelation) uses acid based chelating agents like DMSA, DMPS & EDTA. Often using these sorts of chelating products, they do not differentiate well between heavy metals and mineral. The bind to it all which can leave the body deficient in minerals. These protocols usually come with a mineral protocol to follow but how do you stop the chelators from binding to the minerals you are taking and eliminated the right way? Acid based chelators also put a strain on the liver, adrenals and other organs. Homeopathic detox Homeopathic detox is uses homeopathic (highly diluted) metals to stimulate the body to bring all minerals back into balance. Remembering the basic principal of homeoapthy is like cures like. So, if you have an issue with too much Iron then we can use iron in some form to bring the body back into balance with the iron production and storage. Similarly, if you were anaemic then homeopathic iron would be used to stimulate the body to bring the iron back into healthy range. Using the homeopathic zinc, copper and all other minerals we can help the body back in to healthy balance. Once this is achieved the body will naturally use, distribute and eliminate metals and minerals as needed. Frequently, children with autism have high levels of copper and many other toxic metals in these cases we can use a poly metals detox where this is the case, when necessary. The poly metal remedy is a combination of 26 heavy metals in one remedy. Other things to consider - It is important that the person doing the detox is eliminating well and that their gut health is supported through the process. Often there is a history of constipation and this must be addressed first. Otherwise if the toxins are being pulled into the bowel and this is not being cleared regularly then it can reabsorb back through the bowel wall causing terrible detoxing symptoms. There can be times where the metals are being pulled out too quick for the person to eliminate them causing detox symptoms. Simple slow the detox process down. Homeopathic detox has been well used and written about for many years right back to the early 1900's. I think with the new technologies in the Nano Zeolites this can support the homeopathic detox after pulling the metals out of the tissues these Nano zeolites support, he elimination of the metals. "}
