I am an Accredited Exercise Therapist (PTX THERAPY) and Postural PAIN FREE Specialist as well as Nationally Certified Athletic Trainer. - FORM beats Repetition FORM beats EFFORT. Better FORM Leads to Better Athletic Performance and Function- Less Injuries Faster Recovery. The Focus of the Training is NOT Aesthetics although your body will be Aesthetically appealing . I train the body as a unit ....You will be Stronger....You Will Be Powerful ...You will Be Lean, You will be Mobile & Agile You will Realize YOUR Potential with ZERO LIMITATIONS. YOU WILL FEEL and LOOK AMAZING!!! Although I do a fair amount of work with clients who are in pain or not functioning optimally ( Hips Back Knees Shoulders Wrists Neck etc) I have a strong background in COMPETITIVE Athletic Training and conditioning. I am a former Division I Athlete ( Boston College Track and Field (800M/ 1.50 and Mile 4.20 ) and Rugby additionally I am a Boxing and Mixed Martial Arts enthusiast. Brief History....I have always been active; seeking better performance and a competitive edge in sports and my business endeavors. I have always enjoyed training HARD to get Faster Stronger and a Physique that reflected the work. In 2006 my world was turned upside down. I was struck by truck while mountain biking home from the gym. The accident left me in agonizing pain and nearly disabled. My Orthopedic Doctor and Chiropractor told me Id likely never have an active lifestyle again..No Lifting No Sprinting No Jumping. To me THIS was UNACCEPTABLE . My orthopedic doctor only recommendation was surgery (50% or less long term success) to mitigate the intense hip and back pain,- herniated and bulging discs , -burning sciatic nerve issues daily for three years despite regular Massages, Spinal Adjustments, Physical Therapy, Tens Unit, Dry Needling, Acupuncture and etc> I opted to explore an alternative path---Smarter Exercise- (Non Traditional) I was convinced that could regain my health and wellness and active lifestyle itself If I found the underlying cause of the pain and Not just the Pain (Symtoms) . Fortunately I was introduced by chance to Specialists in California- The Egoscue Method. Their methodology did NOT treat the PAIN but the CAUSE of the pain....Major structural and Muscular imbalance that lead to Dysfunction and Compensating patterns that contributed to my condition -- I was so impressed with the result that I enrolled in their University program to learn in depths their methodology. TODAY I am in the best shape of my LIFE. You would be hard pressed to envision me disable or hobbling with pain. I am Stronger, More Mobility, More Energy, Better Flexibility, Better Sleep and much more Vitality!! and Completely Pain Free Working SMARTER Enables you to get the RESULTS you Want. My style of training incorporates all the Methodologies I learned in my recovery as well as Athletic Training and Conditioning required to compete at the Division I level . I am Focused on my Clients and Driven by RESULTS. My methodologies are based on science, physics and neurological pathways. These methods are proven to be most effective for Building Strength ,Endurance ( Vo2 Max), Mobility, Flexibility and Eviscerating FAT. Although I am NOT a Licensed Nutritionist- Nutrition and Diet are a key component of every program. For my clients that at looking to lose fat I provide complete meal plans, YELLOW BRICK ROAD DIET ( MOST EFFECTIVE for FAT loss ), 21 Day Purification Programs ( Stand Process GOLD STANDARD) Clinically Tested Comprehensive 30 Day Cleanse ( Unicity) as well as supplements to improve Adrenals, Cholesterol, Digestion , Skin, Glucose and Reduce Inflammation . If you have any questions or concern feel free to ask I look forward to working with you at my NEW State of the Art Training Facility located in Midtown 1924 Piedmont Rd David Johnson aka Big Dave I enjoy helping clients realize their potential. Many clients think they are weak- ie, \" I cant do a pull up\". Once I show them the progressions they are amazed how quickly they see results. I have worked with many clients that seek significant weight loss.( many over 50lbs) All clients are encouraged to seek lifestyle change--- LESS Sugar Less Simple Carbs, Less Salt, Less Starches- Processed Foods should NOT be part of a balanced diet. Due to most clients hectic schedule I suggest Keeping it SIMPLE and Quick to prepare meals or utilize a quality meal replacement service. Many clients use Meal Replacement Shakes, Supplements to keep on track. Although Rapid Weight loss is the norm emphasis is gradual sustainable approach that can be easily managed . Almost all my clients take advantage of our Unicity and Standard Process Supplement and Nutritional Health Programs (30%- 40% Discount) For my clients that are in PAIN--I am rewarded every time they leave with a smile on their face( no chiropractor or doctors appt needed)--I believe in empowering my clients with my wealth of knowledge and application of Exercise Science to optimize their health and minimize any and all pain or discomfort.
