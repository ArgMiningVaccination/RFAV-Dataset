Moderna is a Massachusetts-based vaccine developer that has been in existence since September, 2010. The company partnered with the National Institutes of Health to develop and test a coronavirus vaccine known as mRNA-1273. A clinical trial demonstrated that the vaccine has an efficacy rate of 94.1 percent in preventing COVID -19 (see New England Journal of Medicine Research Summary for some more details). The Moderna COVID 19 Vaccine is authorized for use under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for active im - munization to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19). Someone infected with COVID-19 can have anything from no symptoms, to mild upper respiratory symptoms, to severe acute respiratory syndrome. The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is approved for adults 18 years of age and older. The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is still being studied in clinical trials. The FDA decision to authorize Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is based on the totality of the scientific evidence available showing that the prod - uct may be effective to prevent COVID-19 during the COVID 19 pandemic and that the known and poten - tial benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product. What you should do if experiencing SIDE EFFECTS? If you experience a severe allergic reaction, call 9-1-1, or go to the nearest hospital. Call your vaccination provider or your healthcare provider if you have any side effects that bother you or do not go away. Report vaccine side effects to FDA/CDC Vac - cine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The VAERS toll-free number is 1 800-822-7967 or report online to https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html. Please include \"Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA\" in the first line of box #18 of the report form. In addition, you can report side effects to Moderna by calling 1-866-MODERNA, or 1-866-663-3762. What is the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine? ? Moderna Vaccine What is V-safe? You may also be given an option to enroll in v-safe. V-safe is a new voluntary smartphone-based tool that uses text messaging and web surveys to check in with people who have been vaccinated to identify potential side effects after COVID-19 vaccina - tion. V-safe asks questions that help CDC monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. V-safe also provides second-dose reminders if needed and live telephone follow-up by CDC if participants report a significant health impact following COVID-19 vaccination. For more information on how to sign up, visit: www.cdc. gov/vsafe. Sign up for V-safe with your smart - phone's browser at vsafe.cdc.gov or you can aim your smartphone's camera at this code.

The Moderna vaccine is given in a two-dose series separated by 28 days apart, to prime the immune system well enough to fight off the coronavirus. If you receive one dose of the Moderna vaccine, you will need the second dose, 1 month later to complete the vaccination series. However, because the vac - cine is so new, researchers are not sure how long its protection might last. The Moderna COVID 19 Vaccine contains messenger RNA (mRNA), and a fatty shell to allow the mRNA to enter into our cells. The mRNA contains the code for our body to produce proteins just like the outer shell of the COVID-19 virus. When the proteins (aka spike proteins) are produced, this allows our immune system to be primed against the COVID-19 virus. The spike proteins are broken down by our immune system and our immune system develops memory in order to create a long-lasting defense against the COVID-19 virus. The Moderna COVID 19 Vaccine contains no preservatives, no latex, no antibiotics, and no products from human or animal origin.How the mRNA vaccine works? mRNA vaccines have strands of genetic material called mRNA inside a special coating. That coating protects the mRNA from enzymes in the body that would otherwise break it down. It also helps the mRNA enter the dendritic cells and macrophages in the lymph node cells near the vaccination site. mRNA can most easily be described as instructions for the cell on how to make a piece of the \"spike protein\" that is unique to SARS-CoV-2. Since only part of the protein is made, it does not do any harm to the vaccinated person, but it is an anti - gen. An antigen is something that triggers an immune response. After the piece of the spike protein is made, the cell breaks down the mRNA strand and disposes of it using enzymes in the cell. The mRNA strand never enters the cell's nucleus or affects a cell's or person's genetic material. Once displayed on the cell surface, the spike protein causes the immune system to begin producing antibodies which means the immune system is primed to protect against future infection.

A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to one hour after getting a dose of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. For this reason, your vaccination provider may ask you to stay at the place where you received your vaccine for monitoring after vaccination. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include: Difficulty breathing Swelling of your face and throat A fast heartbeat A bad rash all over your body Dizziness and weakness These may not be all the possible side effects of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. Serious and unex - pected side effects may occur. What is "}
