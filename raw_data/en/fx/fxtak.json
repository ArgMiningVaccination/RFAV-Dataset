Holistic Medicine: Healing a Person Mind, Body, and Spirit Holistic Medicine: Healing a Person", "sitename": "CourseHero", "date": "2016-07-03", "cleaned_text": "Holistic Medicine: Healing a Person Mind, Body, and Spirit \"Socrates said in the 4thcentury B.C, \"the part can never be well unless the whole is well.\" [Wil96] Holistic medicine is a form of healing that considers the whole person in the pursuit for optimal health and wellness. Holistic health practitioners believe the ancient idea that healing is most effective when considering the whole person, rather than specific illnesses, body parts, and symptoms. A holistic doctor may use all forms of health care, from conventional medications to alternative therapies, to treat their patients. Conventional physicians often criticize patients for adding alternative medical practices into their overall health, but everywhere you look you can find ads for meditation, acupuncture, herbal supplements and Thai Chi classes, along with business cards for homeopaths and naturopaths, faith leaders and Chinese herbalists. There has been an extraordinary rise in the availability and visibility of alternative and holistic medicine that even some conventional doctors are starting to add this culture to the way they practice medicine; which can change the way we view health care. Patients worry about being criticized for using a holistic approach to healing, but there are no limits to the range of diseases and disorders that can be treated in a holistic way; as the principle of holistic healing is to balance the body, mind, spirit, and emotions so that the person's whole being functions smoothly.
