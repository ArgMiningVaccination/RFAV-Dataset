Scripps physicians, nurses and staff are on the front lines, tirelessly caring for our patients and community every day. That commitment and dedication is profoundly evident this year during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our heroic teams are caring for the sick so that others can stay safe at home and avoid spreading the virus. This is one example of the many ways Scripps is committed to serving the community. In our report, you'll read about some of the people, additional programs and partnerships that make San Diego a healthier place. LETTER FROM THE CEO The Scripps story began with a strong commitment to the San Diego community . -A commitment that continues today - Our founders, Ellen Browning Scripps and Mother Mary Michael Cummings, were both women ahead of their time. Their commitment to provide for the health care needs of a growing community resulted in the Scripps Health of today. Miss Ellen, as she was known, preferred the term \"investment\" over \"donation\", and her contributions were carefully considered as much for their future promise as for their immediate impact. Decades earlier, Mother Mary Michael's patient logs illustrated her fundamental mission to make quality health care available to all who needed it. Today, more than 15,000 employees, physicians and volunteers continue to build on our rich history and keep the spirit of community service alive. The pages that follow provide a comprehensive account of how we achieve that: our community benefit programs and services, and our plans for continued action in the future. In Fiscal Year 2019, Scripps' community benefit contributions totaled $442,735,122. This includes $404,234,464 in uncompensated care, $ 27,907,934 in professional education and health research, $568,399 in community building activities, $6,478,774 in community health services and $ 3,545,551 in subsidized health. Health care will continue to change in San Diego and across our country. At Scripps we are continually changing to better meet our patients' needs, improve access in our communit y, reduce our costs, and simply bring more value to the patients we serve. When Ellen Browning Scripps and Mother Mary Michael Cummings brought quality health care to San Diego around 100 years ago, they could never have imagined the care we provided today or the more than 700,000 lives we touch each year. As a private, tax -exempt heath care system, Scripps will continue our legacy of making a vital and measurable difference in our community. Chris Van Gorder, FACHE President and CEO MISSION, VISION, AND VALUES MISSION Scripps strives to provide superior health services in a caring environment and to make a positive, measurable difference in the health of individuals in the communities we serve.

For more information, visit Scripps.org/CommunityBenefit .Scripps Facts More than 3,000 affiliated physicians and 15,000 employees treat and support more than 700,000 patients each year. Scripps cares for people throughout San Diego with four acute care hospitals on five campuses, 30 outpatient locations, 14 Scripps HealthExpress sites and a home health network. Three highly respected graduate medical education programs and two pharmacy resident programs train the next generation of caregivers. Operating revenue: $3,356 billion Operating expenses: Emergency visits: 225,1473On the Front Lines of COVID-19 Care Scripps mobilizes to fight the pandemic Across the Scripps Health system, our doctors, nurses, caregivers and support staff are rallying and working together \u2014 some on the front lines and some behind the scenes \u2014 united in caring for our community during the fast-moving and rapidly changing COVID-19 national health crisis. As cases of the new coronavirus first appeared in the country, Scripps' clinical and administrative leaders mobilized with both short- and long-term strategies to deal with the spread of COVID-19. In February 2020, Scripps began to build up our supplies and equipment, and implement protocols for delivering care to infected patients. In early March, Scripps prepared for a surge of COVID-19 patients by cancelling non-essential surgeries, activating a 24-hour corporate command center, and launching enhanced protective precautions for staff above and beyond Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines. Also at that time, an important collaboration was launched among the hospitals and health systems across the region, to monitor cases, discuss clinical care, assess resources, equipment and supplies, and work together for our community. And all of these efforts continue to this day. \"It's a slow-moving tsunami,\" says Chris Van Gorder, Scripps president and CEO. \"We are continually working with our physicians, staff and operating executives across our system, and with hospitals across our region, to be prepared for any surge of patients, trying to avoid many of the challenges communities in other parts of the nation have experienced.\" To support patients with symptoms, Scripps established the first COVID-19 nurse line in San Diego County. The dedicated help line is staffed to answer questions and screen concerned callers to reduce the influx of potential COVID-19 patients at Scripps locations. The first day phones were operational, the team fielded 2,000 calls. Callers identified as having significant symptoms are connected with health care providers via phone or video for further evaluation, and some are directed to outdoor testing cabanas. Scripps has also set up triage/surge tents outside our hospital emergency departments and clinic urgent care centers. This provides a safe health care environment for potential coronavirus patients, while offering distancing from patients receiving other types of health care. Testing for the presence of the COVID-19 virus is important in understanding and controlling the spread of the virus. Scripps was an early provider of COVID-19 testing in our region. A Scripps testing \"turning point\" was its launch of the fastest available molecular point- of-care test for detecting COVID-19 for patients and those admitted to all five Scripps hospitals. Continued on page 4Scripps set established triage/surge tents outside each of our hospital emergency departments and clinic urgent care centers for intake of patients with COVID-19 symptoms, providing a safe environment to provide the best possible care. Scripps also has several outdoor testing cabanas for patients to drive up and get tested from their cars, to minimize contact and exposure with others. 4 \"The ability to deliver test results in a very short period of time at our hospitals is central to our physicians' ability to make faster and better decisions in the treatment of COVID-19,\" says Ghazala Sharieff, MD, Scripps chief medical officer. \"All our hospitals, physicians and staff work together to ensure each patient receives the best possible care. This is an incredible and impressive team effort.\" Scripps is joining the efforts along with other health systems and government agencies to expand COVID-19 testing as part of our ability to contain and significantly reduce COVID-19 in our region. Support from the San Diego community in fighting COVID-19 has been seen everywhere, as individuals and businesses provide donations, from safety googles and equipment to food for front-line staff. An innovative partnership with local schools and the San Diego Central Library uses 3D printing technology to print and donate face shields and visors. Plus, monetary donations made to the Scripps COVID-19 Fund, including a $1 million challenge grant from The Conrad Prebys Foundation, are helping purchase PPE and supplies for the care of critically-ill patients, and help offset some of the financial challenges of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. This report was written and distributed during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 will be a central part of health care delivery for months and beyond, until effective vaccine and treatment medications are available across our communities. Throughout this unprecedented time, Scripps is committed to provide exceptional health care to our region. It has never been a more important or challenging role.Our heartfelt thanks go out to our physicians, nurses, clinical and non-clinical staff - 18,000 strong - who regardless of their role continue to serve on the front lines of this pandemic, dedicated to saving lives. And we thank and are deeply grateful to the San Diego community for supporting our health care mission. We are stronger together. Learn more at #ScrippsHealthStrong. Continued from page 3 Marcus Yam/Los Angeles Times Banners, posters and homemade signs are posted outside of Scripps hospitals during the pandemic with words of encouragement to thank Scripps caregivers. Inside hospitals, front-line clinical teams in Scripps intensive care units work around the clock to care for critically ill COVID-19 patients, often requiring the use of ventilators and other specialized equipment. 5GME Physicians Care for Underserved Patients Near and Far A key component of Scripps' mission is to advance the education of physicians and health care professionals. Scripps has been training future physicians for more than 70 years\u2014longer than any other institution in San Diego. Scripps has a comprehensive range of graduate medical education programs at Scripps Green Hospital, Scripps Mercy Hospital, San Diego, and Scripps Mercy Hospital, Chula Vista. In fiscal year 2019, Scripps had a total of 143 residents and 43 fellows enrolled. Scripps graduate medical education programs are well-known for excellence, provide a hands-on curriculum that focuses on patient-centered care and offer residencies in a variety of practices, including internal medicine, family medicine, podiatry, pharmacy and palliative care. The GME programs at Scripps Health provide much- needed care to underserved populations both locally and internationally. The Family Practice Medicine Residency Program The Family Practice Medicine Residency program at Scripps uses health care professionals, such as medical residents, dieticians, nurses and doctors, to enlighten high school students on health care careers and health related topics. Interactive sessions are presented on topics such as nursing, nutrition, stroke prevention, breast health, teen pregnancy, substance use, and mental health Issues that impact them. Students receive health career tools/brochures that include information on education requirements, scholarships and ways to pay for college. St. Leo's Mission Scripps residents and many attending physicians maintain an evening clinic at St. Leo's Mission Community Clinic in North County. Two residents volunteer every Wednesday to provide medical care to uninsured patients with a variety of conditions, including diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. They also identify many acute conditions, including viral infections, skin infections, eye problems and musculoskeletal issues, and educate patients about their health. Patients may get flu vaccinations and some basic lab tests. If needed, St. Leo's patients are referred to providers who offer care at a reduced cost. During FY19, St. Leo's cared for approximately 800 of our county's most vulnerable residents. Migrant Shelter Clinic In response to the urgent need for physician volunteers to help screen migrants seeking asylum in the US, multiple GME residents volunteered for a refugee health assessment program at a South Bay shelter. Scripps residents screened between 30 and 150 patients daily during approximately eight months. Solomon Islands Medical Mission Through International Medical Missions, senior Scripps internal medicine residents provide medical care and surgical screenings for underserved Solomon Island populations that have no access to basic medical care. In exchange our residents receive exceptional clinical education experience. The Loloma Foundation provides medical care to these islanders in association with Scripps Health.Uninsured patients at St. Leo's Mission Community Clinic in North County receive care from Scripps GME residents at weekly volunteer clinics. 6 Opioid Stewardship Program Offers Help and Hope for Addiction According to the Centers for Disease Control, anyone who takes prescription opioids for pain management can become addicted. One in four people on long- term opioid therapy struggles with addiction. The Opioid Stewardship Program (OSP) at Scripps helps reduce opioid use, educates patients and providers about opioid risks, and promotes alternative ways to manage pain. In addition to providing support with treating those already suffering from addiction and preventing new dependencies, clinicians learn effective opioid prescribing and multi-modal pain management techniques. Starting in 2018, the program established prescribing standards for opioids, resulting in a 25-percent reduction in the number of pills per prescription at Scripps hospitals and outpatient centers. Scripps also opened three year-round drug take-back kiosks at its on-site pharmacies. Scripps has received more than $435,000 of state grants from the California Bridge Program and The Center at Sierra Health Foundation to remove barriers to identifying and treating patients with opioid use disorders and provide Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT). Scripps actively promotes MAT access for patients in the form of buprenorphine. In the first 10 months, Scripps identified more than 300 MAT-eligible patients and treated more than 160 patients. Out of the 160 patients treated, 210 accepted linkage to outpatient MAT services. The California Bridge grant also enabled Scripps to hire substance use disorder counselors to facilitate treatment and entry into a community-based MAT program. Scripps collaborates with community resources, including Family Health Centers of San Diego to provide MAT, McAllister Institute for detox beds and the Betty Ford Center for outpatient care. Making Strides Against Breast Cancer Making Strides Against Breast Cancer walks unite communities across the nation in the fight against cancer. Funds raised help the American Cancer Society fund groundbreaking breast cancer research and provide patient services. Scripps MD Anderson Cancer Center participated as the Prevention Tent Sponsor at the Making Strides Walk in San Diego in October 2019. Scripps MD Anderson Cancer Center sponsored the Prevention Tent at the Making Strides Against Breast Cancer walk in San Diego. Scripps Opioid Stewardship Program brings physicians, nurses and other professionals together to help reduce opioid use and provide opioid addiction education and treatment.7Scripps Cares for Residents Displaced by Deadly Camp Fire When the Camp Fire devastated the Northern California town of Paradise and surrounding areas in late 2018, the Scripps Medical Response Team (SMRT) immediately mobilized to help the thousands suddenly forced to evacuate. Comprised of clinical staff and others from across the organization ready to mobilize when needed, SMRT is available to deploy when the State of California Emergency Medical System Authority activates the California Medical Assistance Team and requests medical assistance to respond to a crisis. Scripps deployed three response teams to Chico; each team stayed for about a week, working around the clock to offer services and support. Nursing and logistics teams provided medical care to patients of all ages at area evacuation centers, as well as logistical and administrative support to help residents find temporary shelter.\"As we have done in the aftermath of many disasters \u2014 whether in California, elsewhere in the country or around the world \u2014 we made our Scripps Medical Response Team available to area hospitals and disaster relief authorities almost immediately,\" wrote Scripps president and CEO Chris Van Gorder in a memo to employees. \"We always want to help in disaster situations, but it's always important for us to have a clear mission and for us to be part of a broader organized effort.\" Blood Drive Celebrates Heroes and Helps Save Lives On Valentine's Day 2019, Scripps joined News 8 Sports Director Kyle Kraska and the American Red Cross to sponsor the Celebration of Heroes Blood Drive. Scripps contributed financially and with staffing to the event, which brought in 178 attendees and 412 units of blood donations. In 2015, Kraska suffered multiple gunshot wounds. Thanks to the expertise of San Diego Fire and Rescue and the trauma professionals at Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla, he survived. His injuries required multiple blood transfusions, so a blood drive was a way to say thanks and help save the lives of others. Scripps emergency and trauma care team members donated blood and presented trauma prevention, helmet safety education and other safety programs to attendees. They also demonstrated how to use a tourniquet to \"Stop the Bleed\" and save a life via television and live social media. Scripps sponsors employee blood drives year-round and encourages community donations. The Scripps Medical Response Teams (SMRT) offered medical services and support around the clock to people affected by California's deadliest wildfire. Kyle Kraska and a team of Red Cross phlebotomists helped make the Celebration of Heroes a success. \u00a9 2020 Scripps Health, (5/20) MCOM-1450Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute Engages Community in Health Research At the 11th Annual San Diego Festival for Science & Engineering at Petco Park in March 2019, team members from the new Scripps Hub Academic Research Core (SHARC) team partnered with Scripps Research Community Lab to share advances in diabetes research. The SHARC team is funded by a Clinical Translational Science Award grant to support research activities at Scripps Health locations. Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute was also invited to share science experiments and demos related to diabetes research and education. Numerous visitors expressed concern about their diabetes risk and were pleased to find information from Scripps about diabetes care, including diagnosis, treatment, self-management and education. The SHARC team hopes to continue to connect with the local community to teach attendees about the fun side of science and how research can help improve health. Scripps Expands Access to Breastfeeding Education and Resources in Chula Vista Through funding from a Centers for Disease Control Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) grant, awarded to reduce health disparities among racial and ethnic populations with the highest burden of chronic disease, Scripps has expanded education, resources and support to breastfeeding mothers in the South Bay. Women learn about the benefits of breastfeeding and receive support, if they face challenges. The objective is to reduce barriers that can make breastfeeding difficult. This includes providing information to workplaces in an effort to create a safe, nurturing environment for women returning to work. Scripps continues to implement and support lactation work through a partnership with the County of San Diego Department of Health and Human Services and additional REACH funding. More partners have been added in southeast San Diego and more certified lactation educators are in training to expand the workforce with women who represent and reflect the diverse cultures and languages of this region.

Passed in 1994, the bill requires California's, not -for-profit hospitals to annually describe and document the full range of community benefits they provide. Scripps has taken this legislative requirement a step further. This report incorporates not only documentation of community benefits , but also a more detailed explanation of the specific community benefit activities provided by our five acute- care hospital campuses, home health care, wellness centers and ambulatory care clinics. The report details programs and services that provide com munity benefits above and beyond standard practices of care. Scripps divides community benefit services into three main categories ; community health services , professional education and health research and uncompensated health care. Uncompensated care incl udes charity care, bad debt, Medi-Cal and Medicare shortfalls. Community Health Services Professional Education and Health Research Uncompensated Care The report covers the period of October 1, 2018 through September 30, 201 9 (Fiscal Year 2 019). During this fiscal year, Scripps devoted $ 442,735,122 to community benefit programs and services in the three areas listed above (see figures 1:1 and 1:2). Our programs emphasize community -based prevention efforts and use innovative approaches to reach residents at greatest risk for health problems. Due to rounding, numbers presented throughout this report may not add up precisely to the totals indicated and percentages may not precisely reflect figures for the same reason. The documen tation and activities described in this report are commitments we make to improve the health of both our patients and the diverse San Diego communities. As a longstanding member of these communities, and as a not -for-profit community resource, our goal and responsibility are to assist all who come to us for care, and to reach out especially to those who find themselves vulnerable and without support. This responsibility is an intrinsic part of our mission. Through our continued actions and community partner ships, we strive to raise the quality of life in the community . Definitions of terms used in this report can be found in Appendix A. 2020 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 3 Community benefit is defined as programs or activities that provide treatment of promote health and healing in response to an identified community need. Community benefit programs must meet at least one of the following criteria: Respond to a public health need Responds to needs of special populations Involves education or research that improves overall community health Relieves or reduces the burden of government or other community efforts SCHEDULE H (FORM 990) Hospitals with tax -exempt status are required to provide information specific to their organization on Schedule H, Form 990 (the annual information return filed by tax - exempt organizations.) The entire Schedule H was mandatory beginning with tax year 2009. 1 Scripps has aligned the 2020 Community Benefit Plan and R eport to the Schedule H categories. According to the IRS, community building activities, bad debt and Medicare shortfalls are reported, but not included in the community benefit totals.

Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 7 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA) Scripps Health has a long history of responding to the health needs of the communities it serves, extending beyond traditional hospital care to address the health care needs of the region's most vulnerable populations. Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) originated from California statewide legislation in the early 1990s. SB 697 took effect in 1995, which required private not -for-profit hospitals to submit detailed information to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and D evelopment (OSHPD) on their community benefit contributions. Annual hospital community benefit reports are summarized by OSHPD in a Report to the Legislature, which provides valuable information for government officials to assess the care and services provided to their constituents. The SB 697 requirement was supplemented in 2010 by requirements in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA that not -for-profit hospitals conduct community health needs assessments with community stake holders to determine significant health needs of the community they serve and i mplementation strategies to help meet those needs. Additional information on the ACA requirements for not -for-profit hospitals can be found at http://www.irs.gov , keyword: \"Charitable Organizations.\" For more detailed information on the CHNA regulatory requirements and Implementation Strategy see Appendix E . As part of the federal reporting requirement for private, not -for-profit (tax exempt) hospitals, Scripps conducts a consolidated Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA ) and corresponding joint Implementations strategy for its licensed hospital facilities every three years. This comprehensive account of health needs in the community is designed for hospitals to plan their community benefit programs together with other lo cal health care institutions, community -based organizations and consumer groups. The 2019 Scripps Health Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) is designed to provide a deeper understanding of barriers to health improvement in San Diego County. The repor t will help us understand our community's health needs and inform community benefit planning and the i mplementation strategy for Scripps Health. In addition, the assessment allows interested parties and members of the community a mechanism to access the fu ll spectrum of information relative to the development of the Scripps Health 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment Report. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 8 Scripps strives to improve community health through collaboration. Working with other health systems, community groups, government agencies, businesses and grassroots movements, Scripps is better able to build upon existing assets to achieve broad community health goals. The complete report is available online at Scripps Health 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment Report. CHNA EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This Executive Summary provides a high- level summary of the 201 9 CHNA methodology and findings. The full CHNA report contains in- depth information and explanations of the data that participating hospitals and healthcare systems will use to evaluate the health needs of their patients and determine, adapt, or create programs at their facilities . Grounded in a longstanding commitment to address community health needs in San Diego, seven hospitals and health care systems, including Scripps Health came together under the auspices of the Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties (HASD&IC) to conduct a triennial Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) that identifies and prioritizes the most critical health- related needs of San Diego County residents. Participating hospitals will use the findings to guide their c ommunity programs and meet IRS regulatory requirements. Per legislation hospitals conduct a health needs assessment in the community once every three years. The 2019 Scripps Health Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) is designed to provide a deeper understanding of barriers to health improvement in San Diego County and build on the results of the 2016 CHNA. It includes three types of community engagement efforts: focus groups with residents, community -based organizations, service providers, an d health care leaders; key informant interviews with health care experts; and an online survey for residents and stakeholders. In addition, the CHNA includes extensive quantitative analysis of national and state- wide data sets, San Diego County emergency d epartment and inpatient hospital discharge data, county mortality and morbidity data, and data related to social determinants of health. These different approaches allowed the CHNA Committee to view community health needs from multiple perspectives. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 9 Participating hospitals will use this information to inform and guide hospital programs and strategies. This report includes an analysis of health outcomes and associated social determinants of health which create health inequities \u2014'the unfair and avoidable differences in health status seen within and between countries2 and communities with the understanding that the burden of illness, premature death, and disability disproportionally affects racial and minority population groups and other underserved populati ons3. Understanding regional and population- specific differences is an important step to understanding and ultimately strategizing ways to make collective impact. These new insights will allow participating hospitals to identify effective strategies to address the most prevalent and challenging health needs in the community . OVERVIEW AND BACKGROUND HASD&IC contracted with the Institute for Public Health (IPH) at San Diego State University (SDSU) to provide assistance with the collaborative health needs assessment that was officially called the HASD&IC 201 9 Community Health Needs Assessment (201 9 CHNA). The objective of the 2019 CHNA is to identify and prioritize the most critical health -related needs in San Diego County based on feedback from community r esidents in high need neighborhoods and quantitative data analysis. The 2019 CHNA involved a mixed methods approach using the most current quantitative data available and more extensive qualitative outreach. Throughout the process, the IPH met bi -weekly with the HASD&IC CHNA committee to analyze, refine, and interpret results as they were being collected. The results of the 2019 CHNA will be used to inform and adapt hospital programs and strategies to better meeting the health needs of San Diego County resi dents. COMMUNITY DEFINED For the purposes of this 201 9 CHNA, the service area is defined as the entire County of San Diego due to a broad representation of hospitals in the area. Over three million people live in the socially and ethnically diverse County of San Diego. Current population demographics and cha nges in demographic composition over time play a defining role in the types of health and social services needed by communities. Population size change in population, race and ethnicity, and age distribution of a population are all important factors in understanding communities and their residents. 2 World Health Organization.

The population density for this area, estimated at 781 persons per square mile, is greater than the national average population density of approximately 91 persons per square mile. Age: The median age for San Diego County is 35.4 years. The distribution of the population by age shows that 22.2% of the population is under the age of 18, 64.9% is between the ages of 18 and 64, and 12.9% is 65 years old or greater ( Figure 1). TABLE 1.

Because of its large geograp hic size and population, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) organized their service areas into six geographic regions. Central, East, North Central, North Coastal, North Inland and South. When possible, data is presented at a regi onal level to provide more detailed understanding of the population. The geographical regions are represented below in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. SAN DIEGO COUNTY WITH HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY REGION 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 12 SCRIPPS HEALTH COMMUNITY SERVED Hospitals and health care systems define the community served as those individuals residing within its service area. A hospital or health care system service area includes all residents in a defined geographic area surrounding the hospital. Scripps serves the entire San Diego county region with services concentrated in North Coastal, North Central, Central and Southern region of San Diego. Community outreach efforts are focused in those areas with proximity to a Scripps facility. Scripps hosts, sponsors and participates in many community- building events throughout the year. Per calendar year 2017, OSHPD annual financial data there were 19 other hospital facilities serving the San Diego community. Scripps Mercy Hospital (including San Diego and Chula Vista campuses) provides 65 percent of the charity care within the Scripps system. Scripps Mercy's service area has a more economically disadvantaged population compared to the county as a whole, with the lowest numbers of insured adults in the county and a much higher percentage of ethnic minorities, primarily Hispanic and Asian. As a disproportionate- share hospital, Scripps Mercy San Diego and Chula Vista campuses play important health care service rol es in the Central/Southern San Diego County service area (ranging from I nterstate 8 to the United States -Mexico border). More than half of Scripps Mercy San Diego and Chula Vista patients are government insured Medicare and Medi -Cal. Scripps hospitals hous ed 24.5% 5 percent of the county's general acute- care licensed beds. Scripps provides significant and growing volumes of emergency, outpatient and primary care. In FY1 9, Scripps provided 2,724,998 outpatient visits. Nearly half (38.8%) of San Diego County's 60,325 ( see Table 2 & 3) safety net discharges are from central and south suburban regions. Safety net discharges include county indigent programs, Medi -Cal and self -pay.

The CHNA Committee reviewed these analyses and applied a pre- determined set of criteria to them to prioritize the top health needs in San Diego County. This p rocess is represented in Figure 4. For a complete description of the HASD&IC 2019 process and findings, see full report available at https://www.hasdic.org/2019- chna . 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 18 FIGURE 4. 2019 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS MAP 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 19 QUANTITATIVE Quantitative data were drawn from several public sources. Data from Dignity Health/Truven Health Community Needs Index (CNI) and the Public Health Alliance of Southern California's Healthy Places Index (HPI) were used to identify geographic communities in San Diego County that were more likely to be experiencing health inequities, which guided the selection of communities for the engagement and the development of engagement questions. Hospital discharge data exported from SpeedTrack 's California Universal Patient Information Discovery, or CUPID application were used to identify current and three- year trends in primary diagnosis discharge categories and were stratified by age and race. This allowed for the identification of health disparities and the conditions having the greatest impact on hospitals and health systems in San Diego County. Data from national and state- wide data sets were analyzed including San Diego County mortality and morbidity data, and dat a related to social determinants of health. In addition, Kaiser Permanente consolidated data from several national and state- wide data sets related to a variety of health conditions and social determinants of health in San Diego County and conducted a com prehensive statistical analysis to identify which social determinants of health were most predictive of negative health outcomes. Kaiser Permanente then created a, web- based data platform (chna.org/kp) to post these analyses for use in the CHNA. These anal yses guided the design of the online survey, interview, and focus group questions. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT Community engagement activities included focus groups, key informant interviews, and an online survey which targeted stakeholders from every region of San Diego County, all age groups, and numerous racial and ethnic groups. Collaboration with the County of San Diego Health & Human Services Agency, Public Health Services was vital to this process. A total of 579 individuals participated in the 2019 Commu nity Health Needs Assessment: 138 community residents and 441 leaders and experts. Please see Figure 5 for details on the types of participants engaged. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 20 FIGURE 5. 2019 CHNA COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PARTICIPANTS 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 21 2019 CHNA PRIORITIZATION OF THE TOP HEALTH NEEDS The CHNA Committee collectively reviewed the quantitative and qualitative data and findings. Several criteria were applied to the data to determine which health conditions were of the highest priority in San Diego County. These criteria included: the severity of the need, the magnitude/scale of the need; disparities or inequities and change over time. Those health conditions and social determinants of health (SDOH) that met the largest number of criteria were then selected as top priority comm unity health needs. 2019 FINDINGS : TOP 10 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS The CHNA Committee identified the following as the highest priority community health needs in San Diego County (in alphabetical order by SDOH or health condition). FIGURE 6. 2019 TOP 10 COMM UNITY HEALTH NEEDS Figure 6 above illustrates the interactive nature of SDOH and health conditions - each impacting the other. In addition, an underlying theme of stigma and the barriers it creates arose across community engagement. For instance, stigma impacts the way in which people access needed services that address SDOH (CalFresh, Medi -Cal, other economic support), which consequentially i mpacts their ability to maintain and manage health conditions. Stigma was also discussed in relation to specific health conditions, 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 22 including behavioral health, cancer, diabetes, obesity and others . Due to the complexity of this underlying theme, the CHNA Committee plans to explore and understand ways in which hospitals and health systems could better address stigma in patient care during Phase 2 of the CHNA process. Access to health care. Overcoming barriers to health care, such as lack of health insurance and insurance issues, economic insecurity, transportation, the shortage of culturally competent care, fears about immigration status, and the shortage of health care providers emerged as a high priority community need. In addition, specific services were identified as challenging to obtain, including behavioral health care, dental care, primary care, and specialty care. Aging concerns. Conditions that predominantly affect people who are 65 and older such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, dementia, fall s, and limited mobility were identified as a high priority health need. Community engagement participants most often described aging concerns in relation to the social determinants of health, including: transportation, access to fresh food, social isolation and inadequate family support, and economic insecurity. Behavioral health. Greater access to behavioral health care was cited as a priority health need. Three types of behavioral health care were identified as challenging to access: urgent care service s for crisis situations; inpatient psychiatric beds and substance abuse facilities; and transitional programs and services for post -acute care. In addition, several barriers to behavioral health care were named as priorities to address, including a lack of availability of needed services and appointments, insurance issues, logistical issues, such as transportation and time off work, and the inability to pay co -pays and deductibles. Cancer. Health needs related to cancer were described in relation to the ef fects on well-being beyond physical health. These include financial, practical, and emotional impacts on individuals and families; these effects are exacerbated by barriers to cancer care. Chronic conditions . Three chronic conditions were identified as pri orities: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. Key factors that individuals struggle with to prevent chronic diseases include access to fresh, health foods and safe places to exercise and play. In addition, economic issues, transportation to medic al care, fears about immigration status, and a lack of knowledge about chronic conditions were named as particular challenges related to the management of chronic conditions. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 23 Community and social support. A high priority for the well -being of San Diego residents is ensuring that individuals have adequate resources and substantial support within their neighborhood. Valuable neighborhood resources include federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and those that are culturally and linguistically competent. Without adequate support from others, community engagement and community spirit are affected. Economic security. Economic security was named as vitally important to the well - being of San Diego residents and was described as impacting every aspect of residents' daily life. The health of those who are economically insecure is negatively affected by food insecurity, chronic stress and anxiety, and the lack of time and money to take care of health needs. In S an Diego County, 13.3% of residents have incomes below the federal poverty level and 15% experience food insecurity. Those who are economically insecure are at greater risk of poor mental health days, as well as, asthma, obesity, diabetes, stroke, cancer, smoking, pedestrian injury and visits to the emergency department for heart attacks. Factors identified as contributing to economic insecurity include housing and child care costs as well as low wages. Education. Receiving a high school diploma, having the opportunity to pursue higher or vocational education, being health literate, and having opportunities for non- academic continuing education were identified as important priorities for the health and well -being of San Diego residents. Family stress and a lack of school and community resources were identified as factors underlying low levels of educational attainment. Homelessness and housing instability. Homelessness and housing instability were named as important factors affecting the health of San Diego County residents. They were described as having serious health impacts, such as increasing exposure to infectious disease, creating substantial challenges in the management of chronic diseases and wound care, and increasing stress and anxiety. Poor housin g conditions were also cited as impactful of physical and mental health; crowded housing leads to the spread of illness, and environmental hazards can exacerbate conditions like asthma. Unintentional injury and violence. Exposure to violence and neighborh ood safety were cited as priority health needs for San Diegans. Neighborhood safety was discussed as influencing residents' ability to maintain good health, while exposure to violence was described as traumatic and impactful on mental health. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 24 COMMUNITY RESOURCES The 2019 CHNA identified many health resources in San Diego County, including those provided by community -based organizations, government departments and agencies, hospital and clinic partners, and other community members and organizations engaged in addressing many of the health needs identified by this assessment. In addition, 2- 1-1 San Diego is an important community resource and information hub that facilitates access to services. Through its 24/7 phone service and online database, 2- 1-1 San Diego helps connect individuals with community, health, and disaster services. In addition to community input on health conditions and social determinants of health, a wealth of ideas emerged from community engagement participants about how hospitals and health systems could support, expand, or create additional resources and partner with organizations to better meet San Diego's community health needs. S ee Figure 7 for the types of resources that were identified by community engagement participants . 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 25 FIGURE 7. RESOURCES & OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 26 CONCLUSIONS AND NEXT STEPS The 2019 CHNA will be utilized by Scripps Health and participating hospitals and health systems to e valuate opportunities for next steps to address the top identified health and social needs in their respective patient communities. In addition, the CHNA report will be made available to the broader community and is intended to be a useful resource to both residents and health care providers to further communitywide health access and health improvement efforts. The CHNA Committee is in the process of planning Phase 2 of the 2019 CHNA, which will include gathering community feedback on the 2019 CHNA process and strengthening partnerships around the identified priority health needs and social determinants of health. SCRIPPS HEALTH IMPLEMENTATION PLAN With the 2019 CHNA complete and health priority areas identified, Scripps Health has developed a corresponding Implementation Strategy - a multifaceted, multi -stakeholder, plan that addresses the community health needs identified in the CHNA. The Implementation Plan translates the research and analysis presented in the Assessment into actual, measurable strategies and objectives that can be carried out to improve community health outcomes. Scripps Health anticipates the implementation strategies may evolve due to the fast pace at which community and health care industry change. Therefore, a flexible approach is best suited for the development of its response to the Scripps Health Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). On an annual basis Scripps Health evaluates the implementation strategy and its resources and interventions; and makes adjustments as needed to achieve its stated goals and outcome measures as well as to adapt to changes and resources available. Scripps describes any challenges encountered to achieve the outcomes and makes modifications as needed. In addition, Scripps Health Implementation Plan is filed with the Internal Revenue Service using Form 990 Schedule H on an annual basis. In response to identified unmet health needs in the 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment, during FY 20-FY22 Scripps Health is focusing on the strategies and initiatives, their measures of implementation and the metrics used to evaluate their effectiveness. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 27 Scripps will monitor and evaluate the strategies listed in the Implementation Plan for the purpose of tracking the implementation of those strategies as well as the document the anticipated impact. Plans to monitor will be tailored to each strategy and will include the collection and documentation of tracking measures. The complete FY20-FY22 Implementation Plan Report is available online at Scripps.org. Uncompensated Care 2020 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 27 UNCOMPENSATED HEALTH CARE Scripps contributes significant resources to provide low and no- cost health care for our patients in need. During FY19, Scripps contributed $ 404,234,464 in uncompensated health care, including $14,767,038 in charity care, $ 377,559,072 in Medi - Cal and Medicare shortfall, and $11,908,354 in bad debt . Scripps provides hospital services for one- quarter of the county's uninsured patients. Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego and Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista provide 65 percent of Scripps' charity care (refer to figure 3:3). The health care safety net in San Diego County is highly dependent upon hospitals and community health clinics to care for uninsured and medically underserved communities. Finding more effective ways to coordinate and enhance the safety net is a critical policy challenge. While public subsidies help finance services for San Diego County's uninsured populations, these subsidies do not cover the full cost of care. Combined with Medi -Cal and Me dicare funding shortfalls, Scripps and other local hospitals absorb the cost of caring for uninsured patients in their operating budgets. This places a significant financial burden on hospitals and physicians.

Population size change in population, race and ethnicity, and age of a population are all important in understanding communities and its residents. San Diego is the second most populous county in California and fifth most populous in the United States. San Diego has: Close to 3.3 million residents Majority minority population Busiest land border crossing in the world - 1 of every 13 people who enter the US come through San Ysidro. 70 miles of c oastline 16 naval and military installations 18 federally qualified recognized Indian reservations A total of 4,526 square miles, larger than Rhode Island and Delaware combined. 2020 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 29 Population: Over three million people (3, 337,685) live in the 4, 526 square mile area of San Diego County (SDC) according to the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 2009- 13, 5- year estimates. The population density for this area, estimated at 746 persons per square mile, is greater than the national average population density of approximately 88 persons per square mile. Approximately 96.7% of the population lives in an urban area compared to just 3.3% living in rural areas . Population Change: According to the U.S. Census Bureau Decennial Census, between 2000 and 2010 the population in S an Diego County (SDC) grew by 281,480 persons, a change of 10.0%. This is similar to the percentage population change seen during the same time period in California (10.0%) and the United States (9.7%). A significant shift in total population over time impacts the demand for health care providers and the utilization of community resources. Race/Ethnicity: In the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 2009- 2013, data for race and ethnicity are collected separately. Of those who identified as non- Hispanic (67.7%) in SDC, the majority identified their race as w hite (70.9%), followed by Asian (16.1%), black (7.1%), Multiple Races Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (0.6%), and American Indian/Alaskan Native (0.5%). Of thos e who identified as Hispanic or Latino (32.4%) in SDC, the majority also identified their race as w hite (72.4%), followed by other (19.9%), Multiple Races (5.1%), American Indian/Alaskan Native (1.1%), b lack (0.8%), Asian (0.6%), and Native Hawaiian/Pacifi c Islander (0.1%). SAN DIEGO'S UNINSURED The lack of health insurance is a significant barrier to accessing needed health care and to maintaining financial security. Between 2010 and 2013 uninsured rate was relatively stable in the United States, California and in San Diego County. In the past, gaps in the public insurance system and lack of access to affordable private coverage left millions without health insurance, and the number of uninsured Americans grew over time, particularly during economic downturns. By 2013, the year befor e the major coverage provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) went into effect, more than 44 million nonelderly individuals lacked coverage. 6 Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), millions of Californians have gained health coverage. These gains have come either through the expansion of 6 Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of 2013 National Health Information. 2020 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 30 Medicaid (called Medi -Cal in California) to low income adults earning up to 138% of the federal poverty guideline (FPG), or through Covered California, the state's ACA health insurance marketplace, where people earning up to 400% FPG can purchase subsidized insurance coverage. The major coverage expansions of the ACA were implemented starting i n 2014, and by 2016 the uninured r ate among nonelderly Californians had fallen from 15.5% to a historic low of 8.5%. 7 (This percentage includes children). KEY FINDINGS Since 2010, generally all age groups experienced a decline in the percent uninsured for both the county and state. The 18- 64-year age group experienced the greatest decline in number of people uninsured under the ACA. 8 FIGURE 1. PERCENT UNINSURED : UNITED STATES , CALIFORNIA & SAN DIEGO COUNTY , 2012 - 2017 Note: Important to show the uninsured rate for adults 18- 64 as those who are 65+ have Medicare which creates a large impact on the uninured rate in the overall population (reducing the uninsured significantly). 7 California Health Care Foundation, \"ACA Reduces Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Health Coverage\".

Small Area Estimates of Health Insurance Coverage, Community Health Statistics Unit, www.sandiegocounty.gov . 2020 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 31 FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ASSISTING LOW-INCOME , UNINSURED PATIENTS The Scripps financial assistance policy is consistent with the language of both State (AB774) California Hospital Fair Pricing legislation and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 501(r) Regulations. These practices reflect our commitment to assisting low -incom e and uninsured patients with discounted hospital charges, charity care and flexible billing and debt collection practices. These programs are available to everyone in need, regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, religion or national origin. Scripps makes every effort to identify patients who may benefit from financial assistance as soon as possible and provide counseling and language interpretation. Additionally , Scripps does not apply wage garnishment or liens on primary residences as a way of collecting unpaid hospital bills. Eligibility for financial assistance is based on family income and expenses. For low - income, uninsured patients who earn less than twice the federal poverty level (FPL), Scripps forgives the entire bill. For those patients who earn between two and four times the FPL, a portion of the bill is forgiven. Patients who qualify for financial assistance are not charged more than Scripps' discounted financial assistance amount. For 20 20, the Department of Health and Human Services defined a family of four at 200 percent federal poverty level as $52,400. 2020 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 32 ESTIMATED ECONOMIC VALUE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS PROVIDED BY SCRIPPS HEALTH IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 Senate Bill 697 Category Programs & Services Included Estimated FY19 Unreimbursed Costs Medical Care Services Charity Care $ 14,767,038 Medi -Cal & Other Government Means Tested Programs (Shortfall) * $ 95,484,099 Medicare & Medicare HMO (Shortfall) ** $ 282,074,973 Bad Debt $ 11,908,354 Total Costs of Uncompensated Care $ 404,234,464 Benefits for Vulnerable Population Definition: Any population that is expose d to medical or financial risk, by virtue of being uninsured, underinsured, or eligible for Medi -Cal, Medicare, California Children's Service Program, or county indigent programs.

Community Health Services 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 40 COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICES Community Health Services include prevention and wellness programs, screenings, health education, support groups and health fairs, supported by operational funds, grants, in- kind-donations and philanthropy. Through a prioritization process described in Section 2 , Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA), the following health conditions and social determinants of health (SDOH) were identified as the most critical health and social needs within San Diego County ( listed below in alphabetical order) : 1. Access to Health Care 2. Aging Concerns 3. Behavioral Health 4. Cancer 5. Chronic Conditions 6. Community and Social Support 7. Economic Security 8. Education 9. Homelessness and Housing Instability 10. Unintentional Injury and Violence FIGURE 1. 2019 CHNA TOP HEALTH NEEDS The figure above illustrate s the interactive nature of the SDOH and health conditions \u2014 each impacting the other. In addition, an underlying theme of stigma and the barriers it creates arose across community engagement. For instance, stigma impacts the way in which people access needed services that address SDOH (CalFresh, Medi -Cal, other economic support) , which consequentially impacts their ability to maintain and manage health conditions. Stigma was also discussed in relation to specific health conditions, including behavioral health, cancer, diabetes, obesity and others. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 41 The programs incl uded in this section raise public awareness and understanding of the community health needs documented in Scripps 20 19 Community Needs Assessment Report (Refer to Section 2, Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) .14 Included in this section are other health conditions and needs that Scripps addresses via community benefit programs and initiatives. Scripps defines Community Health services according to the Schedule H 990 IRS categories. The categories are broken down into five main areas: (see the Scripps Community Health Services Summary list for more details, page 120). These costs are included in the IRS Form 990 Schedule H Part I Lines 7 e, g and i. Community health improvement services Community benefit operations Cash and in- kind contributions Subsidized health services Community building activities During Fiscal Year 2019 (October 2018 to September 2019 ), Scripps invested $6,478,774 in co mmunity health services (does not include subsidized healt h). This figure reflects the costs associated with providing these programs, salaries, materials, and supplies minus revenue. Scripps Health strives to improve community health through collaboration with a wide range of partners and like- minded organizatio ns. Working with other health systems, community groups, government agencies, businesses and grassroots movements, Scripps is better able to build upon efforts to achieve broad community health goals and partner with a wide variety of organizations on comm unity health improvement programs. See Appendix F for a list of our community partners. The rest of this chapter highlights Scripps activities , programs and services conducted by Scripps during FY19. Refer to Figure 4:1 for a graphic representation of the FY 19 Scripps System Community Health Services program distribution. 14 Demographic and community need information data presented throughout the body of this document are based upon the findings of the Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment and the most recent San Diego C ounty community health statistics (unless otherwise indicated).

To access care, people need health insurance coverage and a consistent source of care that provides evidence- based, culturally competent preventive and emergency medical services in a timely ma nner. A lack of health insurance coverage represents a major barrier to health care services. In San Diego County, 12 % of people are uninsured. Certain groups, including those who identify as \"Other,\" Native American/Alaska Natives, Hispanics, Pacific Isla nders, and Blacks, have higher rates of being uninsured than others. 16 15 County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA), Public Health Services, Community Health Statistics Unit, 2018. 16 U.S. Census Bureau. American Community Survey, 2013- 2017 1- Year Estimates. Includes civilian non- institutionalized population ages 18- 64.

Types of care that are difficult to access Behavioral Health Care Dental Care Primary Care Specialty Care 2. Barriers to accessing care & associated SDOH Culturally competent care Economic security Fear related to immigration status Lack of health insurance & insurance issues Shortage of health care providers Transportation A lack of health insurance is a predictor of many health conditions, including more poor mental health days, more visits to the ED for heart attacks, a higher prevalence of asthma, and obesity, more low birth weight babies, and higher prevalence of smoking. Reduced access to basic health care services increases illness, injury and mortality an d is a major burden on hospitals and health providers, who must provide uncompensated care for the uninsured. Access to health care emerged as a high priority health need in both the secondary data analyses and community engagement events in the 2019 Scripp s Community Health Needs Assessment. Through the community engagement conducted we heard from the community that even when insurance is secured, lack of transportation (especially for seniors ) and lack of culturally and linguistically competent care are main barriers. In an effort to provide for people in need, Scripps sponsored a number of programs and activities in FY19 . MERCY OUTREACH SURGICAL TEAM PROVIDES LIFE-CHANGING CARE TO CHILDREN IN MEXICO For three decades, the Mercy Outreach Surgical Team (M.O. S.T) has been crossing borders and changing lives. Working in Mexico, the Mercy Outreach Surgical Team provides reconstructive surgeries for children suffering from birth defects or accidents. In special circumstances, surgeries are also provided for adults. During FY19 , the M.O.S.T team served in two outreach mission trips and the team volunteered over 2,800 hours to provide reconstructive surgeries for more than 200 people. The M.O.S.T program celebrated its 32 nd anniversary this year. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 44 OCTOBER 2018 In October 2018, a team of 48 M.O.S.T. volunteers including three plastic surgeons, one urologist, and a general surgeon traveled over 1,500 miles from San Diego to Morelia, Mexico. The team helped 168 patients on this mission. MAY 2019 With so many patients in need, M.O.S.T. traveled to Hermosillo in the state of Sonora to offer eye surgeries in early May of 2019. During this 4- day mission trip, the team provided 105 eye surgeries and provided eyeglasses to 41 children. SCRIPPS RECUPERATIVE CARE PROGRAM S (RCU) The Scripps/SD Rescue Mission Recuperative Care Unit (RCU) Project provides a safe discharge for chronically homeless patients with ongoing medical needs. All patients are unfunded or underfunded. Most have substance abuse and/or mental health issues. Lack of funding, mental illness, as well as alcohol and/or substance abuse, makes post -acute placement of these homeless patients difficult. RN Case Management assists with appointment s, medications, d urable medical equipment (DME), and plans of care, while working closely with RCU staff. Oversight is provided by Scripps with physician backup to ensure completion of their medical recovery goals. Scripps pays the Rescue Mission a daily r ate for housing and services provided to the patients. The Rescue Mission provides a safe, secure environment, with 24- hour supervision, medication oversight, meals, clothing, and counseling, assistance with Medi -Cal, and disability applications, referral s to rehab and other programs, and help finding permanent or transitional housing using county resources. Patient transportation needs are coordinated and provided by both the Rescue Mission and Scripps. To maintain the patient's medical stability, medicat ions, DME and other needed services are provided by Scripps when funding is not available. Patients with psychiatric disorders are established with a psychiatrist in the community if they are willing. All patients are referred to a medical home in the comm unity. The RCU located at the San Diego Rescue Mission closed its doors on January 14, 2019. This year, 15 patients accounted for RCU admissions. As a group, the RCU patients had a cumulative 223 hospital days of stay, an average of 14 hospital days of stay, before going to RCU. The RCU has taken medically complex patients, including those with: IV antibiotics, wound vacs, skin grafts, fractures, abscesses, osteomyelitis, paraplegia, dog ketoacidosis ( DKA), gastrointestinal pancreatitis, end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) on dialysis, end stage liver 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 45 disease, diabetes, traumatic brain injury or encephalopathy, ostomies, complex trauma, motor vehicle accident ( MVA ), versus auto, CVA), cancer (lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, brain mass), HIV/Aids, sepsis, respiratory failure, pneumonia, congestive heart failure ( CHF). Patients were assault victims with gunshot and stab wounds, facial trauma, and surgic al post op patients. Many are diabetic and have psychiatric conditions. Over 70% of this group were either positive for alcohol, drugs on drug screen or had a drug history addressed by the physician in the history and physical ( H & P ). More specifically, 43% of RCU clients had used heroin or meth. The following are outcome metrics tracked by Scripps for the SD Rescue Mission program . For year 2018- 2019, total cost savings for Scripps was $ 703,385. Of RCU patients, 27% had standard Medi Medi -Cal and Community Health Group. Further, 13% had out of state or out of county and 6% had Restricted M edi-Cal and 6% CMS. Approximately 38% were involved with RCU social worker to secure income from government programs, Social Security and C alifornia short t erm disability. 94% patients were connected to a primary care provider or had established care at one of the community clinics and 6% stayed less than 1 day and did not complete the primary care physician ( PCP) appointment. This year, 80% did not return to the streets: 26 % discharged to family or friend, 27% to a community program, 27% of the residents transitioned to a shelter , and many participants went to S ingle Room Occupancy ( SRO ), Independent Living Facility ( ILF) or established residence which was 13%. Housing programs and resources continue as challenges for our community. City of Refuge Partnership After the closure of the San Diego Rescue Missions RCU in January 2019, Scripps facilitated an outreach partnership with the City of Refuge that began taking patients routinely in March of 2019. This year 20 patients so far have met the need for RCS admission. As a group, the RCS patients had a cumulative of 224 hospital days of stay, an average of 10 hospital days of stay, before going to RCS beginning March 2019 to date. The RCS has taken medically complex patients, including those with: IV antibiotics, wound vacs, skin grafts, fractures, abscesses, osteomyelit is, amputation, paraplegia, dog bites , DKA, GI bleeds, pancreatitis, ESRD on dialysis, end stage liver disease, diabetes, mild encephalopathy, ostomies, MVA, pedestrian pancreatic cancer), HIV/Aids, sepsis, 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 46 respiratory failure, pneumonia, CHF. Patients were assault victims with gunshot and stab wounds, facial trauma, and surgical post op patients. Many are diabetic. Psych problems are common, occasionally the main problem for RCS clients. Over 70% this group were either positive for alcohol, drugs on drug screen or had a drug history addressed by the physician in the H & P. More specifically, 30 % of RCS clients had used opiates, heroin or meth. The following are outcome metrics tracked by Scripps for th e City of Refuge program . For FY19 , total cost savings for Scripps was $623,410.00 for March 2019- September 2019. Of RCS patients, 25% had standard Medi -Cal insurance, 25% HPE (Health Presumptive Eligibility) Medi -Cal, 40 % Medi -Cal HMO's, such as Molina, Community Health Group Medi -Cal, Health Net Medi -Cal, and Alameda Medi - Cal. Of these managed plans, Molina Medi -Cal was the highest utilizer. Further,10% had out of state or out of county Medicaid/ Medi -Cal and there were no clients with Restricted Medi -Cal. Approximately 25% sought to secure income from government programs, Social Security and C alifornia short term di sability: four total clients applied or received income benefits. F our have applied and received Medi -Cal HMO's while at the RCS. Seventy five percent of patients were connected to a primary care provider or had established care at one of the community cli nics. Ten percent of the patients admitted to RCS were established with ongoing oncology care and treatment. Thirty five percent did not complete the PCP appointment and several patients were introduced to FHC mental health services . Following the stay at City of Refuge, 50% did not return to the streets ; 5% went back to the hospital, (most returned to the RCS after a short stay); 15% to family or friend, 30% to a community progr am, 50% of the RCS participants discharged to the streets. Two continue their stay at the RCS and will go home to family with assistance to transport via Greyhound Bus. Housing programs and resources continue as challenges for our community. GRADUATE MEDIC AL EDUCATION STAFF SUPPORT , ST. LEO'S CLINIC The Graduate Medical Education (GME) program at Scripps Green Hospital and Scripps Clinic focuses on physician training and clinical research, with 45+ residents and 43 fellows. GME residents and many attending physicians maintain an evening clinic at St. Leo's Mission Community Clinic in North County. Two residents volunteer 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 47 every Wednesday to provide medical care to uninsured patients with a variety of conditions, including diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. They also identify many acute conditions, including viral infections, skin infections, eye problems and musculoskeletal issues, and educate patients about their health. Patients may get flu vaccinations and some basic lab tests. If needed, S t. Leo's patients are referred to providers who provide care at a reduced cost. During FY19, St. Leo's cared for approximately 800 of our county's most vulnerable residents. MIGRANT SHELTER CLINIC In response to the urgent need for physician volunteers to help screen migrants seeking asylum in the US, multiple GME residents volunteered for a refugee health assessment program at a South Bay shelter. Medical interpreters on site helped residents communicate with migrants and facilitate the screenings. Scripps residents screened between 30 and 150 patients daily over approximately eight months. FIJI SOLOMON ISLANDS MEDICAL MISSION The medical mission consists of Scripps Health general medical specialists and residents setting up clinics on rural islands for the purpose of providing much needed medical care, medical supplies and surgical screening for an underserved population that have no access to basic medical care. The International Medical Missions provide an exceptional clinical education experience to our senior Internal Medicine residents at Scripps Clinic and Scripps Green Hospital. The 2019 mission brought our residents to the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific, where the ratio of doctors to population is 1:20,000. The Loloma Foundation provides medical care to these islanders in association with Scripps Health. Residents experienced the challenges of providing care in Third World conditions, without technology, and using only their excellent academic and practical training to diagnose and treat patients. Islanders with serious medical conditions are referred to the nearest hospital, which is several hours away by boat and car. Along with evaluating and treating up to 150 patients a day, residents provided training to medical professionals on the island. SCRIPPS -SPONSORED AMERICAN RED CROSS BLOOD DRIVES Scripps Health partnered with the American Red Cross in FY 19 to host 15 blood drives ; 478 Scripps employees donated blood throughout the year. Scripps Health collected 478 pints of blood (for every pint donated 3 lives are saved) , which saved approximately 1,434 lives. Scripps promoted the blood drives through our system wide communication channels and our Wellness All Around You C ampaign. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 48 CELEBRATION OF HEROES BLOOD DRIVE Scripps sponsored the Celebration of Heroes Blood Drive event with CBS 8 television stations Kyle Kraska, sportscaster and the American Red Cross. Kraska was the victim of multiple gunshot wounds on February 10, 2015, Kraska was transported to Scripps Memo rial Hospital La Jolla Trauma department. Due to his injuries, Kraska was the recipient of multiple blood transfusions and with the quick response of San Diego Fire Rescue and care of the Scripps Trauma team they saved his life. Kraska chose Valentine's Day 2019 to show his appreciation to all that had saved his life and to honor the community by hosting a b lood drive to save the lives of others. The central engagement of the event was to sign up people on- line and for people to come to the event to donate blood. Scripps had staff at the event for outreach engagement, Stop the Bleed, and helmet safety education was presented to about 50- 75 people. Scripps public relations provided support for multiple social media post, live television and radio interviews with Scripps employees who were able to demonstrate on TV, and live social media, how people in the community can use a tourniquet and \"Stop the Bleed\" and save a life. The event brought in 178 attendees and 412 units of blood were donated with on -line pled ges and walk -ins. SCRIPPS HEALTH COMMUNITY BENEFIT (CB) FUND In FY19, Scripps Health continued to deepen its commitment to philanthropy with its Community Benefit Fund. Over the course of the year, it awarded $ 221,000 in community grants to programs in San Diego (four grants ranging from $10,000 to $120,000). The funded projects address some of San Diego County's high priority health needs, seeking to improve access to vital health care services for at risk populations, including the homeless, economically disadvantaged, mentally ill and others. Since the Community Benefit Fund began, Scripps has awarded $ 3.9 million. Programs funded during F Y19 include d: CONSUMER CENTER FOR HEALTH EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY (CCHEA) Funding provides low income, uninsured Mercy Clinic and behavioral health patients help obtaining health care benefits, SSI and related services, while reducing uncompensated care expenses at Mercy. The project provides advocacy services for time intensive government benefit cases . The Consumer Center stresses the importance of accessing community- based services for routine health care instead of using the ED's and hospital departments. They also emphasize the importance of establishing medical homes. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 49 CATHOLIC CHARITIES Funding provides short term emergency shelter for medically fragile homeless patients upon discharge from Scripps Mercy Hospital, San Diego and Chula Vista. Case Management and shelter are provided for homeless patients discharged from Scripps Mercy Hospital. While these patients no longer require hospital care, t hey do need a short -term recuperative environment. Patients who demonstrate a willingness to change receive one week in a hotel, along with food and bus fare to pursue a case plan. The focus of the case management is to stabilize the client by helping them connect to more permanent sources of income, housing and other self -reliance measures. The partnership seeks to reduce emergency room recidivism in this population and improve their quality of life. 2-1-1 HEALTH CARE NAVIGATION PROGRAM Locally, 2- 1-1 San Diego was launched in June 2005 as a multilingual and confidential service committed to providing 24/7 access. There was an overwhelming need for a dependable service to help people navigate today's complex health care system. Scripps Health has been a longtime supporter of 2- 1-1 San Diego's Health Navigation Program which creates a record for every person who calls, in order to provide a service that navigates clients through different referrals and tracks their success toward achieving improved social determinants of health. All 2- 1-1 staff are trained to identify individuals who need care coordination services, particularly individuals who are having difficulties managing their chronic health conditions. Health Navigators are trained to determine client risk using the Risk Rating Scale (RRS). The RRS determines a client's status ranging from \"In Crisis\" to \"Thriving\" using social determinants of health such as Housing, Nutrition, Primary Care and Health Management. Health Navigators assess on the followin g to determine whether a client has decreased in vulnerability for health management: Understanding of prescription medication: Does the client understand how and when to take their medicine, and do they understand the use/importance of each medication? Health Condition Management: Does the client understand the illness/disease that they have been diagnosed with, what their prognosis is, and what they need to do in order to remain healthy? Health Insurance/ Medical Home: Does the client have health insurance, and do they know how to utilize it? Does the client have a primary care doctor and/or specialist that they see, and do they know how to make appointments with each? 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 50 Does the client know in what situation they should make an appointment with the PCP v ersus going to an e mergency room for an immediate medical need? Transportation: Does the client have the means to get to their doctor's appointments? During this grant period 2- 1-1 provided care coordination services to 576 clients with complex chronic conditions. Clients decreased vulnerability in the following social determinants of health: housing, nutrition, primary care, and health management by 67%. Clients also reported feeling better to manage their health condition by 71% increase. 2- 1-1 Heal th Navigators provided individualized needs assessments, case planning, information, education and referrals and provided ongoing client contact and progress checks via phone over a period of time relevant to the client's needs to check on and document cli ent progress. CANCER/ONCOLOGY Cancer is a term used to describe a group of diseases that cause the uncontrolled growth, invasion, and spread (metastasis) of abnormal cells. Cancer is caused by external factors such as environmental conditions, radiation, infectious organisms, poor diet and lack of exercise, and tobacco use, as well as internal factors such as genetic mutations, and hormones. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Cancer causes one out of every four deaths in the United States. According to the American Cancer Society, cancer survival is more likely to be successful if the cancer is diagnosed at an early stage. Such diagnosis is an indication of screening and early detection. Regular screening that allow for the early detection and removal of pr ecancerous growths are known to reduce mortality for cancers of the cervix, colon and rectum. Five -year relative survival rates for common cancers, such as breast, prostate, colon and rectum, cervix, and melanoma of the skin, are 93 percent to 100 percent if they are discovered before having spread beyond the organ where the cancer began. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 51 A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of cancer is described below: The HASD&IC 201 9 CHNA continued to identify Cancer disease as one of the top priority health conditions among S an Diego County hospitals . In 2016 , cancer was the leading cause of death in San Diego County, responsible for 24. 1 percent of all underlying causes of death.17 In 2016, t here were 5,096 deaths due to cancer (all sites) ,18 and an age adjusted death rate of 146.6 deaths per 100,000 population.19 In 2016, 19.3 percent of all cancer deaths in San Diego County were due to lung cancer, 9.3 percent to colorectal cancer, 7.4 percent to female br east cancer, 7.2 percent to pancreatic cancer, 6.7 percent to prostate cancer, 5.7 percent to liver and female reproductive cancers, and 3.6 percent to Leukemia. According to the American Cancer Society (ACS) 2017 California Cancer Facts & Figures report, in 2014 there were 13,625 observed new cancer cases and 4,868 cancer deaths in S an Diego County . According to the ACS Cancer Statistics Center, in 2018 there will be an estimated 29,360 new cases of breast cancer and 4,500 breast cancer deaths for females in California . In 2016, the age- adjusted mortality rate for breast cancer in San Diego County was 20.0 per 100,000 women. This falls slightly below the HP2020 target of 20.7 breast cancer deaths per 100,000 women. According to the 2015 Susan G. Komen for the Cure\u00ae San Diego Affiliate Community Profile Report, in SDC there were 46.1 late- stage cases of breast cancer per 100,000 women, exceeding the HP2020 target of 42.4 cases per 100,000 women. The report projects that SDC will meet the HP2020 target within five years. The 2015 Susan G. Komen for the Cure\u00ae San Diego Affiliate Community Profile also reported that, in 2013, breast cancer mortality rates in SDC were highest 17 American Cancer Society. Cancer Facts & Figures for African Americans The County of San Diego HHSA's Community Health Statistics Unit Collects annual data on leading causes of death using methodology established by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Data is based on \"underlying cause of death\" information from all death certificates filed in SDC in 2016. Causes are ranked according to the number of deaths assigned to all rankable causes, which are a subset of ICD -10's \"List o f 113 Selected Causes of Death and Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile\". (Pe\u00f1a, M., County Hyattsville, Maryland: National Center for Health Statistics. 2018.) 19 County of San Diego HHSA, Public Health Services, Community Epidemiology Branch. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 52 among African American women, at 27.7 deaths per 100,000. This exceeded the mortality rate for Caucasian (23.9), Latina (17.3) and Asian/Pacific Islander (13.2). According to the ACS 2017 California Cancer Facts & Figures report, 72.4 percent of breast cancer cases among non- Hispanic white women in S an Diego County were diagnosed at an early stage, compared to 69.3 percent of African American cases, 68.1 percent of Hispanic cases and 70.4 percent of Asian/Pacific Islander cases. Data suggests that early breast cancer detection resources are needed in minority communities. According to 2015- 2016 CHIS data, 85.6 percent of women in S an Diego County between the ages of 50 to 74 reported having a mammogram in the past two years. This exceeds the HP2020 target of 81 .1 percent for breast cancer screenings. Approximately 2.9 percent of women in this age range in SDC reported that they had never had a mammogram. According to findings from the ACS 2018 Cancer Facts & Figures report, screening offers the ability for secon dary prevention by detecting cancer early. For example, the 39 percent decrease in the female breast cancer death rate between 1989 and 2015 is attributed to improvements in early detection, namely screening and increased awareness. In addition, over the p ast three decades, five-year relative survival rates for all cancers combined increased by 20 percent among whites and 24 percent among blacks, reflecting earlier diagnosis for some cancers as well as improvements in treatment (ACS, 2018). Study findings f rom the 2015 Susan G. Komen for the Cure\u00ae San Diego Affiliate Community Profile indicate a critical need for culturally competent outreach, especially for Hispanic, Middle Eastern and African American women (Susan G. Komen, 2015). A recent study by the ACS found that 42 percent of newly diagnosed cancer cases in the U.S. are potentially avoidable. Many of the known causes of the cancer and other non- communicable diseases are attributable to behavioral factors including tobacco use and excess body weight due to poor dietary habits and lack of physical activity (ACS, 2018). The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) emphasizes the importance of patient navigators as part of a multidisciplinary oncology team with the goal of reducing mortality among underserved patients. A patient navigator may assist with various tasks, including psychosocial support; assistance with treatment decisions; assistance with insurance issues; arrangement of transportation; coordination of additional services (i.e., fertilit y preservation); and tracking of 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 53 interventions and outcomes. The navigator works with the patient across the care continuum, ensuring coordination and efficiency of care, and removal of barriers to care (ASCO, 2016). According to the NIH, clinical trials, a part of clinical research, are at the heart of all medical advances. Clinical trials look at new ways to prevent, detect or treat disease by determining the safety and efficacy of a new test or treatment. Greater clinical trial enrollment benefits medical research and increases the health of future generations as well as improves disease outcomes, quality of life and health of trial participants. Scripps Health currently cares for on e-third of cancer patients in San Diego. Scripps has developed a series of prevention and wellness programs to educate people about the importance of early detection and treatment for some of the most common forms of cancer. At Scripps, cancer care is more than just medical treatment, and a wide array of resources are provided such as counseling, support groups, complementary therapies and educational workshops. Here are a few examples of Scripps cancer programs during FY19: SCRIPPS MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER DIRECTORY OF COMMUNITY RESOURCES Scripps collaborates with the communit y and develops a cancer directory of a comprehensive list of resources available for cancer survivors, thei r families, and the community.

AMER ICAN CANCER SOCIETY (ACS) MAKING STRIDES AGAINST BREAST CANCER Scripps Health participated and sponsored the Making Strides Against Breast Cancer walk in the amount of $10,000 to raise money for breast cancer research. The walk raises critical funds to save lives from breast cancer and ensure no one faces breast cancer alone. A series of educational events are coordinated with the American Cancer Society awareness months. The events focus on various types of cancer, including breast, lung, cervical, colorec tal, skin, ovarian/gynecological and prostate. A registered nurse clinician answers questions and provides educational materials. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 57 CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE 'Diseases of the heart' were the second leading cause of death in San Diego County in 2016. In addition, 'cerebrovascular diseases' were the fourth leading cause of death, and essential hypertension and hypertensive renal disease' was the tenth. Coronary Heart Disease is the most common form of heart disease. High blood pressure, high chol esterol, and smoking are all risk factors that could lead to CVD and stroke. About half of Americans (49%) have at least one of these three risk factors. RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE : Behaviors: Tobacco use, obesity, poor diet that is high in saturated fats, and excessive alcohol use. Conditions: High cholesterol levels, high blood pressure and diabetes. Heredity: Genetic factors likely play a role in heart disease and can increase risk. A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of cardiovascular disease is described below: The Scripps 2019 CHNA continued to identify cardiovascular disease (including cerebrovascular disease/stroke) as a priority health issue affecting members of the communities served by Scripps. According to data presented in the Scripps 2019 CHNA, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and smoking are all risk factors that could lead to cardiovascular disease and stroke. About half of all Americans (47 percent) have at least one of these three risk factors. Additional risk factors include alcohol use, obesity, physical inactivit y, poor diet, diabetes and genetic factors (CDC, 2015). Heart disease is the leading cause of death for people of most racial/ethnic groups in the United States, including African Americans, Hispanics and Whites. In 2016, cerebrovascular diseases including stroke were the fourth leading cause of death for San Diego County overall. The World Health Organization defines cardiovascular disease (CVD) as a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels that include: Coronary heart disease Cerebrovascular disease Peripheral arterial disease Rheumatic heart disease Congenital heart disease Deep vein thrombosis Pulmonary embolism Coronary Heart Disease is the most common form of heart disease and the leading cause of death in the U.S. high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking are all risk factors that could lead to CVD and stroke. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 58 In 2016, there were 1,362 deaths due to stroke in San Diego County 20, a 17.2 percent increase from 2015. The age- adjusted death rate due to stroke was 38.3 per 100,000 populati on, which was higher than the HP2020 target of 34.8 deaths per 100,000. In 2016, there were 6,346 hospitalizations for stroke in San Diego County, with an age- adjusted rate of 183 per 100,000 population. The rate of hospitalization for stroke increased 2.8 percent from 2015 to 2016\u2014the first increase since 2011, when S an Diego County recorded a stroke rate of 218.4 per 100,000 population. In 2016, there were 2,371 stroke -related ED visits in San Diego County . The age- adjusted rate of ED visits was 68.9 per 100,000 population. According to 2016- 2017 CHIS data, an estimat ed 23.9 percent of adults in San Diego County were obese, 9.7 percent smoked cigarettes and 62.0 percent did not regularly walk for transportation, fun, or exercise. In 2016, 16.3 percent of adults in SDC reported eating fast food four or more times in the past week. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) reports that 25 percent of people who recover from their first stroke will have another stroke within five years (NINDS, 2016). The CDC estimates that up to 80 percent of strokes are preventable through the recognition of early signs/symptoms and the elimination of stroke risk factors. According to the CDC, healthy lifestyle choices can help prevent stroke. Behaviors that can mitigate the risk of stroke include choosing a healthy diet full of fruits and vegetables, maintai ning a healthy weight, engaging in at least 2.5 hours of moderate- intensity aerobic physical activity each week, refraining from or quitting smoking, and limiting alcohol intake (CDC, 2018). Not only is Scripps a nationally recognized heart care leader, consistently ranked by U.S. News & World Report as one of America's Best Hospitals for cardiology and heart surgery, but we treat more heart patients than any other health care provider in San Diego.

SENIOR HEALTH CHATS A wide variety of senior chats are offered at local senior centers in South Bay to address education and prevention of heart disease. Some topics include heart health 101, stroke, and a variety of prevention education. A total of 10 presentations are given yearly to more than 264 individuals. THE ERIC PAREDES SAVE A LIFE FOUNDATION Each year, 7,000 teens lose their lives due to sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). SCA is not a heart attack, it is caused by an abnormal ity in the heart's electrical system that can easily be detected with a simple Electrocardiogram (EKG ). Unfortunately, heart screenings are not part of a regular, well -child exam or pre- participation sports physical. The first symptom of SCA could be death. San Diego alone loses three to five teens from SCA annually . Scripps efforts began when a registered nurse at Scripps created the foundation af ter her 15-year-old son, Eric passed away from sudden cardiac arrest in 2009. Turning tragedy into an opportunity, the Paredes ' established the organization to prevent sudden cardiac arrest in school -age children and adolescents. As a sponsor for the Eric 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 62 Paredes Save A Life Foundation, Scripps has held more than 20,000 free cardiac screenings to local teens, including the homeless, uninsured and underinsured. In FY19, Scripps made an $8,500 contribution to help pay for screenings. In FY 19, Scripps supported screening events at area high schools and screened 4,269 teens , identifying 46 with abnormalities and 20 who were at risk. The following are additional metrics tracked: Teens Uninured: 6% Teens Without a Pediatrician/Family Doc: 525 Teens Who Use a Family Clinic: 714 Average percent of Moderate to Extremely Low Household Income: 62% Ethnicity: 58% represent diverse ethnicities Parents unaware of 55% Parents unaware of warning signs/risk factors: 68% Number youths screened who participate in 78% Scripps Volunteers: 100 Scripps Volunteer Hours: 500 SWEETWATER UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT - SPORTS SCREENINGS Every year, three to five student athletes in San Diego County die suddenly and unexpectedly from Sudden Cardiac Arrest/Death (SCA/D). SCA is an abnormality in the heart's electrical system that can happen without symptoms or warning signs. However, this life -threatening condition can be detected with a cardiac screening exam. Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista Family Medicine Residency, Southwest Sports Wellness Foundation and the Sweetwater Union High School District partner to prevent sudden cardiac arrest and death among high school students by increasing awareness of the importance of healthy lifestyles and cardiovascular screenings among acti ve students. Family Medicine residents offer yearly cardiac screening and sports physicals before students participate in organized sports and implement an injury clinic during football season to evaluate and treat possible concussions and other injuries. SU VIDA, SU CORAZON / YOUR LIFE, YOUR HEART COMMUNITY INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE EDUCATION AND AWARENESS OF HEART DISEASE Heart disease is one of the most widespread and costly health problems facing our nation, even though it's also one of the most prevent able. Heart failure and stroke account for more than $500 billion in health care costs per year. Heart failure is a progressive disease, primarily caused by high blood pressure, high cholesterol/lipids and damage to the heart muscle from coronary artery di sease. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 63 Scripps Health offers a three- week educational based community intervention program to support improved quality of life for patients diagnosed with heart disease. Tobacco use, alcohol abuse, lack of physical activity, poor nutrition, stress and depr ession are some of the major contributing factors leading to heart disease, heart failure and readmission. Recent literature suggest s that post discharge, social support and education are important to prevent readmission. Group sessions provide education and social support. Discharge planning that uses transitional coaches has been proven to reduce readmission rates. The overall goal of Your Life, Your Heart is to decrease the readmission rates for heart failure patients, which reduces medical costs for the patient and improves their quality of life. A total of 125 community members have participated in this educational series for those affected by hypertension, angina, cardiac heart failure or any other heart health concerns. Topics covered include the risk of heart disease, signs of heart attack, diabetes, cholesterol, physical activity, healthy eating and much more. Health assessments are reviewed including waist circumference, weight, height, BMI and blood pressure . Overall, participants have made a positive impact from the course. 2019 BE THERE SAN DIEGO PREVENTING HEART ATTACKS AND STROKES SUMMIT Be There San Diego is an unprecedented, nationally recognized collaboration and community -wide activation focus ed on preventing heart attacks and strokes in the San Diego region. Scripps sponsored t he 2019 Summit as it is a unique opportunity to bring together physicians, community leaders, healthcare systems, and community partners to impact the region's health by sharing best practices and discussing strategies for future progress . 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 64 DIABETES Diabetes is an important health need because of its prevalence, its impact on morbidity and mortality, and its preventability. An analysis of mortality data for San Diego County found that in 2016 'Diabetes mellitus' was the seventh leading cause of death. A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of diabetes is described below: The Scripps 2019 CHNA continued to identify diabetes as a priority health issue affecting members of the communities served by Scripps. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identify diabetes as the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S., as well as the leading cause of kidney failure, non- traumatic lower limb amputations and new cases of blindness among adults. The number of adults diagnosed with diabetes in the U.S. has more than tripled in the last 20 years (CDC, 2017). In 2016, there were 734 deaths due to diabetes in San Diego County overall , 21 a 3.7 percent increase when compared to 2015 (708 deaths). The a ge-adjusted death rate due to diabetes was 20.7 per 100,000 population. In 2016, there were 4,132 hospitalizations due to diabetes in San Diego County. The age- adjusted rate of hospitalization was 120.9 per 100,000 population in 2016, which was slightly l ower than the age- adjusted rate in 2015 (123.1 per 100,000 population). 21 The County of San Diego HHSA's Community Health Statistics Unit collects annual data on leading causes of death using methodology established by the National Center for Health St atistics (NCHS). Data is based on \"underlying cause of death\" information from all death certificates filed in SDC in 2016. Causes are ranked according to the number of deaths assigned to all ranked causes, which are a subset of ICD -10's \"List of 113 Selec ted Death and Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile.\" (Pe\u00f1a, M., County of San Diego HHSA Public Health Services, Community Health Statistics Unit, 2018; Heron, M., Deaths: Leading causes for 2016. National Vital Statistics Reports; vol. 67 no. 6. Hyattsville, Maryland: National Center for Health Statistics. 2018.) Type 2 diabetes, once known as adult onset or noninsulin- dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition that affects the way the body metabolizes sugar (glucose), which is the body's main source of fuel. With Type 2 diabetes, the body either resists the effects of insulin a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into the cells or does n't produce enough insulin to maintain a normal glucose level. If left untreated, Type 2 diabetes can be life threatening. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 65 In 2016, there were 5,168 diabetes -related ED discharges in SDC, an 8 percent increase from 2015 (4,783 ED discharges). The age- adjusted rate of diabetes related ED discharges were 151.9 per 100,000 population in 2016, which was higher than the age- adjusted rate in 2015 (143.5 per 100,000 population). According to 2016- 2017 CHIS data, 8.6 percent of adults living in San Diego County indicated that they had ever been diagnosed with diabetes, which was lower than the state of California (9.9 percent). Diabetes rates among seniors were particularly high, with 18.8 percent of San Diego County adults over 65 reporting that they had ever been diagnosed with diabetes. Accor ding to 2016- 2017 CHIS data, 12.3 percent of San Diego County residents had been told by their doctor that they have pre or borderline diabetes. According to the CDC's 2017 National Diabetes Statistics Report, 87.5 percent of adults diagnosed with diabetes were overweight or obese. To prevent or delay the onset of diabetes, the CDC recommends lifestyle changes such as losing weight, eating healthier, and getting regular physical activity. The CDC estimates that 30.3 million people in the U.S. have diabetes . Of those individuals, 1 in 4 is not aware they have the disease (CDC National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2017). The percentage of adults aged 20 and older who have ever been diagnosed with diabetes was 9.4% in 201 7 in San Diego County and has been steadily rising since 2005 according to the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Type 2 diabetes is an important target for intervention because hospitalizations due to diabetes related complications are potentially preventable w ith proper management and a healthy lifestyle. There are three major types of diabetes: Type 1, Type 2 and gestational. All three types share similar characteristics, the body loses the ability to either make or use insulin. Without enough insulin, glucose stays in the blood, creating dangerous blood sugar levels. Over time, this accumulation damages kidneys, heart, nerves, eyes and other organs. Type 2 diabetes, once known as adult onset or noninsulin dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition that affects the way your body metabolizes sugar (glucose), which is your body's main source of fuel. With Type 2 diabetes, your body either resists the effects of insulin, a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into your cells or doesn't produce enough insuli n to maintain a normal glucose level. If left untreated, Type 2 diabetes can be life threatening. Clinical symptoms can include frequent 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 66 urination, excessive thirst, extreme hunger, sudden vision changes, unexplained weight loss, extreme fatigue, sores that are slow to heal, and increased number of infections. Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions, and people of Hispanic origin have dramatically higher rates of the disease and the complications that go along with its poor management, including c ardiovascular disease, eye disease and limb amputation. In fact, it is estimated that one out of every two Hispanic children born in 2000 will develop diabetes in adulthood. This is especially true in the South Bay communities in San Diego. Specifically, t he city of Chula Vista is home to 26,000 Latinos with diagnosed diabetes and tens of thousands more who are undiagnosed, have pre- diabetes and are at high risk of developing diabetes. Some facts about Type 2 diabetes: Diabetes is a major cause of heart di sease and stroke and is the 7 th leading cause of death in the United States and California. More than 1 out of 3 adults have prediabetes and 15 to 30% of those with prediabetes will develop Type 2 diabetes within 5 years. Nine out of 10 people with prediabetes don't know they have it. Some risk factors for developing diabetes include: Being overweight or obese Having a parent, brother or sister with diabetes. Smoking Having blood pressure measuring 140/90 or higher. Being physically inactive, exercising fewer than three times a week. A history of gestational diabetes If you are 65 years of age or older A study by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Center for Health Policy Research found that 13 million adults in Califor nia (46 percent) are estimated to have prediabetes or undiagnosed diabetes, while another 2.5 million (9 percent) have already been diagnosed with diabetes (UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, 2016). The complications related to diabetes are serious and can be reduced with preventive practices. Diabetes is a serious community health problem, leading to school and work absenteeism, elevated hospitalization rates, frequent emergency room visits, permanent physical disabilities and sometimes death. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 67 During Fiscal Year 2019 , Scripps sponsored the following diabetes management programs and initiatives: WOLTMAN FAMILY DIABETES CARE AND PREVENTION CENTER IN CHULA VISTA The Woltman Family Diabetes Care and Prevention Center in Chula Vista serves one of San Diego's communities hit hardest by the diabetes epidemic. Nearly 40 percent of patients admitted to Scripps Memorial Hospital Chula Vista, and nearly 32 percent of patients in the heart catheterization lab, have diabetes. County statistics tell us that the rates of death, hospitalizations and emergency room visits are twice as high in Chula Vista compared to all of San Diego County. With the generous support of philanthropist Richard Woltman, the Center has added critical classroom space to meet the high de mand for services. The Center offers a full range of wellness, prevention, diabetes education, and nutrition services and endocrinology specialty visits in English and Spanish. PROJECT DULCE Project Dulce is a comprehensive, culturally sensitive diabetes m anagement program for underserved and uninsured people in San Diego County. The program is team based and incorporates the chronic care model. Project Dulce has been active in communities across San Diego for the past 24 years, providing diabetes care and self -management education. Nurse led teams strive for measurable improvements in their patients' health, nurse educators lead multidisciplinary teams that pr ovide clinical management; and peer educators from each cultural group, known as Promotoras, provid e public and patient education for their communities. This innovative program combines state of the art clinical diabetes management with proven educational and behavioral interventions. One of the primary components of the program is recruiting peer educators from the community to work directly with patients. These educators reflect the diverse population affected by diabetes and help teach others about changing eating habits, adopting exercise routines and nurturing their wellbeing to manage this chronic disease. In FY19 , Project Dulce provided 650 diabetes care, retinal screenings and education visits for low income and underserved individuals throughout San Diego and enrolled 3,075 new Project Dulce patients. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 68 MEDICAL ASSISTANT HEALTH COACHING (MAC) FOR DIABETES IN DIVERSE PRIMARY CARE SETTINGS Diabetes affects nearly 30 million individuals in the U.S., and if current trends continue, 1 of 3 adults will have diabetes by 2050. Diabetes S elf-Management Education and Support (DSME) is a cornerstone of effective care that improves clinical control and health outcomes; however, DSME participation is low, particular ly among underserved populations, and ongoing support is often needed to maintain DSME gains. In 2015, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIH/NIDDK) granted Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute $2.1 million to fund the MAC Trial, which is studying an innovative team care approach that trains medical assistants (MAs ) to provide health coaching in the primary care setting to patients with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes, help them problem solve, and improve their diabetes -related health outcomes. The goals include improving diabetes self -management and clinical outcomes, such as blood glucose levels, cholesterol and blood pressure. The study is being conducted in two diverse settings: a Scripps Health primary care practice, and a community health center, Neighborhood Healthcare. DIABETES PREVENTION The UCLA Center for Health Policy and Research recently published data that revealed nearly half of California adults have prediabetes or diabetes. While the Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute has been providing the best care for people with diabetes for decades, the Insti tute continued with the Scripps Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), which is a yearlong intervention where people with prediabetes meet weekly for 16 weeks, then monthly thereafter. The DPP is an intensive lifestyle behavior change intervention program that has been proven to prevent diabetes in large- scale national studies. The primary objective is to lose 5 to 7% of body weight through healthy eating and physical activity. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) has been thoroughly evaluated in NIH sponsored randomized controlled trials and has been found to decrease the number of new cases of diabetes among those with prediabetes by 58%. Among people over age 60, there was a 71% reduction in new cases. In FY19 , 1,759 patients attended 31 Scripps DPP orientation sessions. Much of t he effort is focused in the South Bay for the Latino population, which is at higher risk of getting diabetes than their white counterparts. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 69 DIGITAL DIABETES -ME: AN ADAPTIVE MHEALTH INTERVENTION FOR UNDERSERVED HISPANICS WITH DIABETES Diabetes is a fast -growing epidemic . In the US, nearly 11% of adults were living with diagnosed diabetes in 2017,22 which represented an annual economic burden of $327.2 billion, with an average annual cost of $13,240 per case.23 Hispanics face a higher risk of developing the disease\u201413.9 percent compared with 7.6 percent for non- Hispanic whites. The NIH's National In stitute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases awarded $2.9 million, the largest NIH award to Scripps Whitt ier Diabetes Institute to date, to study an innovative approach to helping Hispanics with diabetes better manage their disease. Dulce Digital- Me provided patients with tools to help them manage their diabetes day to day and improve their health, including text messaging, wireless blood glucose and medication monitoring, diet and exercise assessments, and personalized feedback and goal setting . This study was conducted in collaboration with Neighborhood Healthcare, San Diego State University and the University of California San Diego. The participants received health- related text messages every day for six months and they saw improvements in thei r blood sugar levels that equaled those resulting from some glucose- lowering medications. The Dulce Digital -Me clinical trial represents the first randomized controlled study to look at the use of text messages to help underserved Hispanics better self -manage their diabetes through glycemic control. The results were published by Diabetes Care in an online pre- print version of the study, which is scheduled to be published in a future issue of the journal. HEALTHY LIVING In 2015, Scripps began Healthy Living classes which are open to anyone interested in learning about the benefits of good nutrition, physical activi ty, and avoiding tobacco. These behaviors can help to prevent the four chronic diseases (lung disease, cancer, Type 2 diabetes and, cardiovascular disease) that contribute to 50 percent of all the deaths in the US. The three- class series is held at locatio ns throughout the community. One hundred sixty- eight people attended Healthy Living classes that were provided throughout the County, again with special attention to the Latino community of the South Bay. 22 International Diabetes Federation (IDF).

Diabetes care. 2019. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 70 SCRIPPS WHITTIER DIABETES INSTITUTE PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute professional education teams provide state of the art education and training for people who wish to increase their diabetes management knowledge and skills. With the rise in diabetes related devices, there is a great need to equip clinicians with the latest information and clinical skills. The Whittier's professional education program is led by a team of experts, including endocri nologists, nurses, dieticians, psychologists and other diabetes specialist. These individuals train practicing professionals to deliver the best possible care for their diabetes patients. Courses are tailored to the needs of allied health professionals seeking to understand new and complex clinical treatment options for Type 1, Type 2 and gestational diabetes. Professional education was provided for 249 people on insulin management, incretin therapy, and diabetes diet and diabetes basics. Participants came from local health institutions and throughout the United States to learn from the Whittier In stitute's most experienced diabetes experts. Over the last fiscal year, the Whittier Institute's professional education department provided four CME programs for physicians, nurses, pharmacists, dietitians, midlevel providers and social workers and made numerous academic and research presentations at professional association meetings. RETINAL SCREENING PROGRAM It is estimated that every 24 hours, 55 people will lose their vision as a result of diabetic - related eye disease ( diabetic retinopathy ) even though 95 percent of diabetic blindness could be prevented with early diagnosis and treatment. For more than a decade, Scripps has been screening people in underserved communities for diabetic retinopathy using a mobile camera. Our free or low -cost eye exams dia gnose individuals at high risk for retinal damage and help patients get treatment and referrals to specialists. In FY19 , 1,617 people were screened, and 6.4 percent had some degree of diabetes -related eye disease. This program referred 38 people who had advanced disease, 2.4 percent of all screened or nearly 36.9 percent of positives , to specialists for further care. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 71 HEALTH RELATED BEHAVIORS Health related behavior is one of the most important elements in people's health and well-being. Its importance has grown as sanitation has improved and medicine has advanced. Diseases that were once incurable can now be prevented or successfully treated. Health related behaviors, such as immunization, smoking cessation, improved nutrition, increased physical activity, oral health and injury prevention, have become important components of long-term life. The risk factors for many chronic diseases are well known. In particular, an unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and substance use have been cited by the World Health Organization ( http://www.who.int/chp ) as important health behaviors that contribute to illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, and others including mental disorders and oral diseases. The HASD&IC and Scripps 2019 CHNA identified ten top health and social needs in San Diego County. These ten social determinants are: access to care, community and social support, economic security, education, homelessness and housing instability, unintentional injury and violence, aging concerns, behavioral health, cancer and chronic conditions. Key informant interviews conducted as part of the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA suggested several health improvement strategies to address the health issues identified for San Diego County. These strategies include behavioral health prevention and stigma reduction; education on disease management and food insecurity; integrating physical and mental health care; better coordination of care; greater cultural competence and diversity; and engagement of patient navigators and case managers in the community. Fruit/Vegetable Consumption: According to data from California Health Interview Survey, 48.3% of children age 2 and older reported consuming less than five servings of fruits and vegetables a day compared to 47.7% in California, overall. Adults age 18 and over reported even less fruit and vegetable consumption. Approximatel y 70.5% of adults reported eating the recommended amount each day. Unhealthy eating habits are a significant contributing factor to future health issues including obesity and diabetes. Physical Inactivity: According to the CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 14.9% of adults age 20 and older self -reported that they perform no leisure time physical activity. Higher rates of limited leisure time activity were reported at the state and national level (16.6% and 22.6% respectively). For youth results of the FITNESSGRAM physical fitness test show 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 72 that 29.35% of children in grades 5,7 and 9 ranked within the \"High Risk\" or \"Needs Improvement\" zones for aerobic capacity for the 2013 -2014 year. The percentage of children that ar e not in the healthy fitness zone varies among ethnic groups with the lowest being non- Hispanic Asians at 20.6% and the highest being Hispanic or Latinos at 42.1%. Although this is smaller than the state average of 36.9%, it is still cause for concern and may lead to significant health issues, such as obesity, diabetes, and poor cardiovascular health. Alcohol Consumption: The percentage of adults age 18 and older who self -report heavy alcohol consumption (defined as more than two drinks per day on average for men and one drink per day on average for women) is 17.2% in San Diego County according to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Behaviors such as excessive alcohol consumption are detrimental to future health and may illustrate or prec lude significant health issues, such as cirrhosis, cancer, and untreated mental and behavioral health needs. Tobacco Usage: The BFRSS also reports that 12.1% of adults age 18 and older self-reported currently smoking cigarettes some days or everyday compar e to 18.1% in the United States, adjusted for age. Tobacco use is linked to leading causes of death including cancer and cardiovascular disease. The HHSA's Live Well San Diego (LWSD) 3 -4-50 initiative identified three behaviors (poor diet, physical inactiv ity and tobacco use) that contribute to four chronic conditions (cancer, heart disease/stroke, Type 2 diabetes and pulmonary diseases), which result in more than 50 percent of deaths worldwide. In 2015, 54 percent of all deaths in SDC were attributed to 3- 4-50 conditions. In 2016, 16.3 percent of adults ages 18 and older in SDC self -reported eating at fast-food restaurants four or more times each week (CHIS, 2016). Understanding that personal behaviors play a significant role in an individual's overall health status, Scripps has developed a series of prevention and wellness programs that help people take charge of their own, and their families,' health. During Fiscal Year 2019, Scripps sponsored several health behavior modification efforts: COMMUNITY BASED HEALTH IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES Community members participated in a variety of classes, prevention lectures and support groups. Approximately 2,582 attended these programs held at the Chula Vista Well Be ing Center. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 73 PATIENT COMMUNITY SERVICES Services are offered directly to patients and their family post discharge to decrease the risks of readmission and to increase patient continuity. Support services are referral based and provide assistance with the f ollowing: housing/homelessness, senior issues, chronic disease issues, drug/alcohol and mental health, cancer and more. This service is currently only available at the Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista campus . Since January 2019, a total of 464 referrals have been received. Through support of the Center's staff, programs and activities m ost of the patients have remained out of the hospital for more than 30 days . COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PARTNERS (CHIP) AND RESIDENT LEADERSHIP ACADEMY MODEL Scripps is a partner with CHIP and collaboratively works on a resident leadership model that has empowered 700+ citizens across the County (and beyond) to affect change in a wide range of community health areas such as public safety, access to healthy foods, and incr eased opportunities for physical activity. HEALTH EDUCATION AND SUPPORT GROUPS Scripps e ducation and support groups are provided to San Diego County residents for a wide variety of health concerns. Topics include, fall prevention, stroke awareness, bladder and pelvic floor wellness, postpartum issues, and gynecological cancer . PRESCRIPTION TAKE BACK DAY Prescription drug abuse is a growing problem in the United States. About 54 million people, or more than 20 percent of those aged 12 and older, have used prescription medications such as powerful pain- reducing opioids like oxycodone and hydrocodone for non- medical reasons at least once in their lifetime, according to the most recent National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Every day, 5,750 more Americans misuse prescription drugs for the first time. And 62 percent of teens who admit taking medications for non- medical reasons say they got those drugs from medicine cabinets in their homes. Scripps encourages patients to remove expired, unwant ed and unused medicines from their homes as quickly as possible and to avoid throwing them into the trash or flushing them down the toilet because this unwittingly risks exposing others to the drugs and damages the environment. The semi -annual event offers a no-questions -asked method to safely dispose of such medications, such as the remainder of the 20- day oxycodone supply from that outpatient procedure last year. Scripps collaborates with the County of San Diego on the Prescription Drug Take Back Day which provides an opportunity for 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 74 safe disposal of left-over medications. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, local law enforcement agencies and county officials host collection events for unwanted prescription drugs at 44 sites across the county. OPIOID STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM (OSP) AND BRIDGE PROGRAM According to the CDC, anyone who takes prescription opioids can become addicted to them, and one in four on long- term opioid therapy struggles with addiction. In San Diego, the rate of discharge from emergency departments for chronic substance use increased by 559% from 2014 to 2016, and the rates of ED discharges for acute substance use rose as well. Heavy alcohol consumption is also a problem in San Diego, with near ly 20% of all adults ages 18 and older self -reporting excessive alcohol use. The Opioid Stewardship Program (OSP) at Scripps is combatting this national epidemic by working with physicians to decrease the number of opioids prescribed to patients and educ ating patients on pain management . The program has established prescribing standards for opioids, resulting in a 25 percent reduction in the number of opioid pills per prescription at Scripps hospitals and outpatient centers in 2018. Scripps also has opened three drug take- back kiosks at its on -site pharmacies, offering patients year - round access to dispose of unused, unneeded or outdated medications . California Bridge Program Scripps received more than $435,000 of state grants at each Scripps Mercy campus from the California Bridge Program and the Center at Sierra Health Foundation to remove barriers to identifying and treating patients with opioid use disorder and provide Medication- Assisted Treatment (MAT). Scripps actively promotes MAT access for patients in the form of buprenorphine. The Bridge Program aims to help hospitals and health centers expand patient access to treatment for opioid use disorder, including on-the-spot medical treatment and coordinated outpatient care. As part of the grant, Scripps now has Bridge counselors at both Mercy campuses to help patients with opioid addiction. Bridge counselors are certified through the California Consortium of Addiction Programs and Professionals or the California Association for Drug/Alcohol Educators. They meet patients in the emergency departm ent and other inpatient areas of both Scripps Mercy campuses to provide rapid evidence- based medication- assisted treatment. They also connect patients directly to continued treatment in the community. In the first ten months, Scripps identified more than 300 MAT -eligible patients and treated more than 160 patients. Out of the 160 patients treated 210 accepted linkage to outpatient MAT services. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 75 The California Bridge grant also enabled Scripps to hire Substance Use Disorder Nurses (SUDS) to facilitate trea tment and entry into a community -based MAT program. Scripps deploys specialized nurses certified in addiction to see patients at their bedside and work closely with the patient's entire health care team in facilitating a safe detox treatment while hospital ized. They identify patients who are at risk or are currently experiencing withdrawal from alcohol and other addictive substances. Substance Use Disorder Service ( SUDS ) nurses evaluate patients who meet certain criteria and work directly with the nurse and physician to ensure the patient is adequately medicated in order to control symptoms of withdrawal. SUDS nurses at Scripps function in a proactive and reactive role at all Scripps hospitals and collaborate with community resources, including Family Health Centers of San Diego to provide MAT, McAllister Institute for detox beds and the Betty Ford Center for outpatient care. ENCINITAS STREET FAIR Scripps participated in the Encinitas Street Fair and provided conversations and demonstrations on fall risks, St op the Bleed, head injury, seat belt, child seat safety, and educated the community on the effects and impairment of alcohol and drugs through demonstrations/simulation s. SPONDYLITIS ASSOCIATION Scripps Health provides meeting space to the Spondylitis Association of America (SAA). This is a non- profit organization founded in 1983 to address t he needs of people affected by spondyl arthritis . Since that time, SAA has been at the forefront of the fight to promote medical research, educate both the medical community and general public and advocate on behalf of the people they serve. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 76 AGING CONCERNS In San Diego County, the population of older adults aged 55 and older was more than 820,000 in 2015. By 2030, that number is projected to be more than 1.1 million. In addition, the fastest growing age group is those over the age of 85. Aging concerns are defined as those conditions that predominantly affect senior people who are 65 and older such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, dementia, falls and limited mobility. Per the 2019 CHNA, conditions that disproportionally affect older adults were identified as a high priority health need through both community engagement events and the secondary analyses. Community engagement participants most often descr ibed aging concerns in relation to the SDOH that affect seniors such as: Access to fresh food Economic insecurity (especially food insecurity and housing unaffordability) Social isolation and inadequate family support (lack of companionship, anxiety, depression, hopelessness. Inadequate family support or support at home to recover, maintain one's health, or manage their medications including ordering refills, picking up prescriptions, and taking the right dose of medications at the right time, can be chall enging for older adults who do not have adequate support ). Transportation (lack of accessible or reliable transportation options to and from appointments, to go grocery shopping, or just socialize with others) In addition, Alzheimer's disease was the third leading cause of death and Parkinson's disease was the 12 th leading cause of death among San Diego County residents in 2016. Dementia is a clinical syndrome of decline in memory and other thinking abilities. It is caused by various diseases and conditions that result in damage to brain cells and lead to distinct symptom patterns and distinguishing brain abnormalities. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive brain disorder that gradually destroys a person's me mory and ability to learn, reason, make judgements, communicate and carry out daily activities such as bathing and eating An estimated 84,405 adults age 55 and older are living with some form of dementia and this number is projected to increase to more tha n 115,000 by 2030. Alzheimer's disease is the most expensive disease in the nation, with associated costs higher than those of both cancer and heart disease. Researchers 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 77 estimate that between informal caregiving, out -of-pocket costs, and Medicaid and Medicare expenditures, the lifetime cost for a person living with dementia is over $320,000 24 In San Diego, thousands of residents 65+ years and older visit an emergency department (ED) for fall -related injuries. The following are the hospital discharge and death rates for falls, age 65+, 2016 (rates per 100,000 population). Death - 60 ED Discharge - 4,695 Inpatient Discharge - 1,859 A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of aging conditions are described below: The 2019 HASD&IC and Scripps CHNA identified Aging Concern as one of the top health conditions among S an Diego County hospitals . The 2019 HASD&IC and Scripps CHNA identified physical and non- physical barriers to care. Seniors accessing health care can be particularly diff icult. When seniors can no longer drive, finding reliable, affordable transportation can be challenging. Seniors most often have limited income and area constantly shifting their financial priorities between paying for housing, food, or costs associated with seeking health care. High cost of medications, co- pays and deductibles were cited as creating financial barriers to accessing health care. Physical barriers to care, such as limited mobility, hearing or vision issues may also create challenges for seniors needing additional assistance. For those who do not speak English as a first language, language can also be a barrier to accessing care. After discharge from a hospital stay, seniors may have inadequate support at home to recover well and follow -up care is hard for seniors to locate and secure. These needs identified by the community overall spoke to the overwhelming need to increase awareness of community and social support programs and services for this particularly vulnerable group. In 2016, Alzheimer's disease was the 6 th leading cause of death in the United States and 3rd leading cause of death in San Diego County. In 2016, the top 10 leading causes of death among adults ages 65 and older in San Diego County were (in rank order): overall cancer, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (ADOD), coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, chronic 24 The Alzheimer's Project. San Diego Unites for a Cure and Care. County of San Diego HHSA, April 2019. SDHealthStatistics.com . 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 78 obstr uctive pulmonary diseas e (COPD), chronic lower respiratory diseases, overall hypertensive diseases, diabetes, unintentional injuries, Parkinson's disease and falls. In 2016, hospitalization rates among seniors were higher than the general population due to CHD, stroke, COPD, nonfatal unintentional injuries (including falls), overall cancer and arthritis. The top three causes of ED utilization among San Diego County residents ages 65 and older in 2016 were unintentional injuries, falls and arthritis/other rheumatic conditions. Seniors in S an Diego County use the 911 system at higher rates than any other age group. The most common complaints include general medical, altered neurological state, respiratory distress, cardiac chest pain and trauma to the extremities (HHSA, 2015). Accor ding to the CDC, 2.8 million older adults, or more than one in four, are treated in the ED for falls every year. One in five falls causes a serious injury, such as broken bones or a head injury, and with each fall, the chance of falling again doubles. Thes e injuries may result in serious mobility issues and difficulty with everyday tasks or living independently. The direct medical costs for fall injuries are estimated at $31 billion annually (CDC, 2018). In 2013, an estimated 62,000 San Diegans ages 55 and older were living with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (ADOD), which accounted for 8.3 percent of this age group. Assuming current trends continue, by 2030, nearly 94,000 residents 55 years and older will be living with ADOD, which is a 51 percent increase from 2013 (Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias in San Diego County, HHSA, 2016). In 2016, an estimated 71.4 percent of San Diego County residents ages 65 and older reported that they were vaccinated for influenza in the past 12 months (CHIS, 2016). In 2016, 26 of the 46 recorded influenza deaths in San Diego County occurred among residents ages 65 and older. The age- adjusted rate of influenza death among this group was 6.0 per 100,000 (HHSA, 2016). Research shows that caregiving can have serious physical and mental health consequences. According to findings from the Stress in America survey described in a report titled \" Valuing the Invaluable\" , caregivers to older relatives report poorer health and higher stress levels than the general population. Fifty - five percent of surveyed caregivers reported feeling overwhelmed by the amount of care their family member needs (AARP Public Policy Institute, updated July 2015). 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 79 According to AARP, more than 40 million people in the U.S. act as unpaid caregivers to people ages 65 and older. More than 10 million of these caregivers are Millennials with separate full or part -time jobs, and one in three employed Millennial caregivers earns less than $30,000 per year (AARP, 2018). According to a report from the National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC) and AARP titled Caregiving in the U.S. 2015, 60 percent of unpaid caregivers are female, and nearly 1 in 10 caregivers are ages 75 or older (AARP and NAC, 2015). The UCLA Center for Health Policy Research conducted a study highlighting the plight of California's \"hidden poor,\" finding 772,000 seniors who live in the gap between the FPL and the Elder Economic Security Standard. The highest proportion of seniors living in this gap includes renters, Latinos, women and grandparents raising grandchildren (Padilla- Frausto & Wallace, 2015). During Fiscal Year 2019, Scripps engaged in the following programs and services to meet the needs of the aging population. THE ALZHEIMER 'S PROJECT - SAN DIEGO UNITES FOR A CURE AND CARE The Alzheimer's Project is a countywide initiative aimed at accelerating the search for a cure and helping the estimated 60,000 San Diegans with the disease, along with their caregivers. Participants began meeting in early 2016 to craft a regional roadmap to address the disease, focusing on cure, care, clinical, and public awareness and education initiatives. The Board of Supervisors approved the roadmap in December 2014 and later voted in support of an implementation timetable. Dr. Michael Lobatz from Scripps Health is a leading participant of this initiative as a Co- Chairperson of the Clinical Round Table and is a member of the Steering Committee. STANDING STRONG FOR FALL According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than one third of adults 65 and older fall each year in the United States and 20 to 30% of people who fall suffer moderate to severe injuries. Scripps held a free interactive event on fall prevention. Participants learned about improving balance and flexibility and strength. It also included balance and fall risk screening assessment by Scripps physical therapy department occupational therapy specialist . SENIOR HEALTH AND WELLBEING PROGRAMS Each month a variety of senior programs are held in partnership with local senior centers, churches, and senior housing. The following programs are conducted as part of Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista San Diego Border Area Health Education Center and Scripps Family Medicine Residency Program. Th ese senior health chats are 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 80 designed to provide health education to the older adult community. Approximately 25 seniors attend these monthly throughout the year. These presentations include a variety of health and age- related topics that include nutrition, hearing loss, dementia , Alzheimer's, pain management and maintaining a healthy lifestyle . These presentations are facilitated by various health care professions and residents. Topics are all chosen by the seniors themselves to meet their local needs. Also, the health chats provide an interchange between the community members and our medical r esidents and other health care professionals to foster healthy lifestyles and health prevention. The program is conducted in collaboration with Norman Park Center, Congregational Towers Senior Living and St . Charles Nutrition Center. Family Medicine Residents rotate through these programs to learn more about geriatric medicine, health and wellness and overall public health and community training. Over 264 seniors participated in these programs. PARKINSON 'S LSVT (LEE SILVERMAN TRAINING ) BIG EXERCISE : Scripp s provides a maintenance class for those who have completed the LSVT BIG Exercise protocol. This class is taught by a physical therapist and is designed for Parkinson's patients to improve strength and mobility for a healthier life. FALL PREVENTION AND HOME SAFETY WORKSHOPS Many older adults experience concerns about falling and restrict their activities. Scripps Social Workers and nurses lecture on ways to reduce fall risk, improve safety awareness and utilize available resources to promote independence and overall safety. Balance classes are designed to help building balance, posture and coordination through strengthening and balance exercises. This importance aspect to healthy living for seniors provides education on preventing falls through exercise and being proactive through safety measures in the home. Scripps P hysical Therapy department and Physical Therapy school volunteers provide fall risk assessments. Seniors may attend from all over the San Diego county region. A MATTER OF BALANCE : MANAGING CONCERNS ABOUT FALLS Scripps educates older adults on preventing falls through exercise and being proactive through safety measures in the home. An 8- week program and lecture series provide practical strategies to manage falls, improve safety awareness and utilize available resources to promote independence and overall safety. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 81 OBESITY, WEIGHT STATUS, NUTRITION, ACTIVITY & FITNESS Obesity is an important health need due to its high prevalence in the U.S. and San Diego. Although it is not a leading cause of death, it is a significant contributor to the development of other chronic conditions. A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of Obesity, Weight Status, Nutrition and Activity & Fitness is described below: The Scripps 2019 CHNA continued to identify obesity as a priority health issue affecting members of the communities served by Scripps. According to 2017 CHIS data, the self - reported obesity rate for adults ages 18 and older in S an Diego County was 22.5 percent. According to a new report released in 2019 by the San Diego Childhood Obesity Initiative, 34%, or nearly 1 out of every 3 children in San Diego County's schools were overweight or obese. These rates These rates vary by grade, with 5th graders having the highest rates of overweight and obese children ( 36%) compared to 7th graders (34%) and 9th graders (33%). I n examining trends across longer periods of time, overweight and obesity prevalence among children in San Diego County appears to be leveling off and even declining slightly. For example, a 2005 UCLA study estimated 36% of children in San Diego County were overweight or obese, with that number decreasing to 35% in 2010. Based on these data, childhood overweight and obesity prevalence in 2018 has decreased by two percentage points since 2005. This small decrease from 36% to 34%, however, would represent approximately 8,600 fewer students across public school districts who were overweight and obese in 2017 -2018. More information can be found at, www.sdcoi.org . Obesity is a medical condition in whic h excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have an adverse effect on health. Overweight and obesity ranges are determined using weight and height to calculate a number known as \"body mass index\" (BMI). For adults: BMI between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight. BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese. For children and adolescents (ages 2 -19): BMI at or above the 85th percentile and lower than the 95th percentile for children of the same age and sex is considered overweight BMI at or above the 95th percentile for children of the same age and sex is considered obese. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 82 In 2017, between 25 and 30 percent of adults in California self -reported being obese. Obesity levels decreased as education levels increased, indicating a need for health education as a tool for reducing obesity rates (CDC, 2017). Obesity has been linked to environmental factors, such as accessibility and affordability of fresh foods, park availability, social cohesion and neighborhood safety (UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, 2015). According to data from the 2016 National Study of Children's Health, nearly one- third of children in California are obese. California has one of the highest childhood obesity rates in Western states (The State of Obesity, 2018). According to the CDC, some of the leading causes of preventable death include obesity -related conditions, such as heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer. In 2016, 39.8 percent of Americans were obese (CDC, 2017). Obesity is largely categorized as a secondary diagnosis in hospital discharge data. When examining inpatient hospital discharge data with obesity as a secondary diagnosis, it was found that the most common primary diagnosis of those patients was nonspecific chest pain in ages 25- 64, abnormal pain for those ages 15- 24, and those over 65 years their primary diagnosis was osteoarthritis, septicemia followed by congestive heart failure. Research has shown that as weight increases to reach the levels of \"overweight\" and \"obesity\" the risks for the following conditions also increases: Coronary heart disease Type 2 diabetes Cancers (endometrial, breast and colon) Hypertension (high blood pressure) Stroke Liver and gallbladder disease Sleep apnea and respiratory problems Osteoarthritis Obesity is addressed through general nutrition and exercise education and resources provided at Scripps as well as programs that address a healthy lifestyle as part of care for heart disease, cancer, diabetes and other health issues influenced by healthy w eight and exercise. During FY19, Scripps engaged in the following obesity prevention and treatment activities : 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 83 SAN DIEGO CHILDHOOD OBESITY INITIATIVE The San Diego County Childhood Obesity Initiative ( COI) was established in 2006 and is a private public partnership with the mission of reducing and preventing childhood obesity through policy, systems, and environment change. Core funding for The Initiative is provided by the County of San Diego, First 5 Commission of San Diego County, The California Endowment, and Kaiser -Permanente. Scripps is a strong partner with CHIP and the outcomes of The Initiative have shown an overall reduction in childhood overweight and obesity, from 36% in 2005 to 34% in 2015 (many areas have seen increases). A new State of Childhood Obesity Supplemental report released by the San Diego County Childhood Obesity Initiative released in 2019, www.sdcoi.org , finds that d espite the potential improvements in San Diego County, disparities among children who are overweight or obese persist, particularly among diverse racial, ethnic, and economic groups. For example, in 2018, 43% of Hispanic students were overweight or obese. Compared to White students with an overweight and obesity prevalence of 24%, Hispanic students were nearly twice as likely to be overweight or obese. These findings are relevant as nearly half o r 48% of all students tested in San Diego County identified as Hispanic or Latino, compared to 29% of students identifyin g as White for the 2017- 2018 school year.3 Students who identified as American Indian or Alaskan Native, or Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, had overweight and obesity rates of 44% and 49%, respectively. For students identifying as Black or African American, the story was similar with 37% being overweight or obese. Only students identifying as Asian have rates lower than White children\u201422% compared to 24%. During the 2017- 2018 school year, more than half, or 53% of San Diego County students in both publ ic and charter schools, were identified as socioeconomically disadvantaged. Socioeconomically disadvantaged is defined as students who are: migrants, in foster care or homeless at any time during the academic year, eligible or had direct certification for the Free or Reduced- Priced Meal (FRPM) program or are in a family where both parents did not receive a high school diploma. Among these students, 42% were overweight or obese. Compared to their non- economically disadvantaged peers, socioeconomically disadvantaged students were almost twice as likely to be overweight or obese (42% vs 24%). Overweight and obesity prevalence among these students has held steady at 42% since 2014; however, alarming disparities continue to grow across racial and ethnic groups. American Indian or Alaskan Native students, for example, had a 10% increase in overweight and obesity prevalence between 2014 and 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 84 2018, and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander students had an even greater increas e\u2014 12%\u2014during this time period. DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM (DPP) A large clinical trial concluded that people with prediabetes could reduce their likelihood of developing diabetes by 58- 70 percent if they lost just 5 -7 percent of their body weight. The Di abetes Prevention Program is a scientifically validated lifestyle intervention- based model. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) promote widespread adoption of the DPP due to its demonstrated effectiveness. Scripps is recognized by the Centers for Disease Control as a national DPP provider and rolled out the program to patients and community members in 2016. Scripps aims to decrease the incidence of Type 2 diabetes by managing a major diabetes risk factor, ob esity in the underserved, ethnically diverse populations by testing the effectiveness of lifestyle curriculum. The program uses trained lifestyle coaches and a standardized curriculum; participants meet in groups with a coach for 16 weekly sessions and six to eight bimonthly follow -up sessions. Participants must have prediabetes and be overweight to enroll. No physician referral is required, although many physicians do refer their patients to this valuable resource. Orientation sessions are held in Spanish and English throughout the county. HEALTHY LIVING PROGRAM Diabetes, heart disease, cancer and respiratory disease are the four most prevalent serious chronic diseases in California. These diseases cause 50 percent of all deaths in San Diego and throughout the U.S., and many people have more than one of these conditions. Because lifestyle can play a major role in preventing these chronic illnesses, Scripps introduced Healthy Living, a free, interactive education program to help the San Diego community learn about and adopt practical ways to improve three behaviors : smoking, poor diet and physical inactivity that contribute to these four diseases. Participants learn how to make healthy food choices using low costs options, make physical activity part of their daily life and learn how to stay motivated and maintain healthy habits. Scripps implements a series of three free sessions that encourage participants to identify and adopt practical ways to improve their health habits. Sessions are offered throughout San Diego County in English and Spanish, with special emphasis on the Latino and underserved communities. Sessions include health 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 85 screenings , healthy cooking tips, and mindful eating practice sessions. Participants also receive a prediabetes screening; those who score high are then referred to the Scripps Diabetes Prevention Program. PROMISE NEIGHBORHOOD INITIATIVE Scripps also addresses childhood obesity at the high school level in San Diego's South Bay communities through its partnership with the Promise Neighborhood initiative, which implements activities related to the national 5210 campaign. The message is to promote a healthy lifestyle ( 5 Servings of Fruits and Vegetables, 2 Hour Screen Time Limit, 1 Hour of Physical Activity and 0 Sugary Drinks) per day. This five -session series is designed to increase knowledge and behaviors regarding a healthy lifestyle. The series includes hands -on activities and demonstrations. Scripps partners with the Promise N eighborhood Initiative and Castle Park Elementary School to increase education and awareness about healthy lifestyles for students, their parents and school staff. Promise Neighborhood developed a Wellness Committee composed of the school principal, teachers, parents and Scripps staff aimed to implement activities that support 5-2-1-0. School administrators and staff are closely involved in the program, which includes five educational sessions, a health assessment survey and health plan, and support to help the students pass their yearly physical education requirements. Since 2013, more than 400 children and 200 parents have participated in wellness activities on campus. As a result of activities, lesson plans and advocacy for healthy living, the amount of p hysical activity and consumption of fruits and vegetables by children, parents and staff has increased. Student responses via a post health assessment survey showed that there was an 80% improvement rate for knowledge after participating in the 5210 sessions. And a 38% improvement rate for behavior after participating in the 5210 sessions. CITY HEIGHTS WELLNESS CENTER La Maestra Famil y Clinic, Inc. joined the City Heights Wellness Center (CHWC) collaborative partnership with Scripps Mercy Hospital and Rady Children's Hospital as the lease holder of the Wellness Center starting September 1, 2016. Since its inception in 2002, the City Heights Wellness Center has been a dynamic, community -based program developed by Scripps Mercy Hospital and Rady Children's Hospital, working with residents to improve their lifestyle behaviors and self -sufficiency skills. Multiple not -for-profit and governmental organizations, philanthropic foundations 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 86 and grassroots groups have joined the effort conducting health promotion and educational activities for community residents. A unique aspect of the City Heights Wellnes s Center is the Teaching Kitchen that is known throughout the community as a place where residents and providers come together to cook, discover and communicate in a safe and trusted environment. La Maestra Family Clinic brings a new perspective to the par tnership as a community health center and primary care provider serving the culturally diverse populations within the City Heights community. La Maestra is committed to maintaining the collaborative nature of the partnership and continue s to work with curr ent CHWC agencies as well as look for opportunities to expand health promotion services. The Scripps Mercy Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), collocated in the Wellness Center, continues to provide WIC services as one of the program s within the City Heights Wellness Center. COLLABORATIVE FOR HEALTHY WEIGHT Collaborate for Healthy Weight is a program of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the National Initiative for Children's Healthcare Quality (NICHQ). The shared vision is to create partnerships between primary care, public health, and community organizations to discover sustainable ways to promote healthy weight and eliminate health disparities in communities across the United States . Collaborate for Healthy Weight meets monthly and al l three sectors collaborate, using evidence- based approaches, to reverse the obesity epidemic and improve the health of our communities. This program will continue in 2019 and several manuscripts are under development. FOOD ADDICTS ANONYMOUS Scripps Health provides Food Addicts Anonymous meeting space to meet. Food Addicts Anonymous is an international fellowship of men and women who have experienced difficulties in life as a result of the way they eat. TAKE OFF POUNDS SENSIBLY (TOPS) MEETING Scripps Health provides meeting space to Take Off Pounds Sensibly (TOPS). TOPS ( Take Off Pounds Sensibly ) is the short name for TOPS Club, Inc., the original non-profit, non -commercial network of weight -loss support groups and wellness education organization. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 87 OVEREATERS ANONYMOUS - SPANISH Scripps Health provides meeting space for Overeaters Anonymous. This is a support group that provides dietary education for individuals who desire to lose weight. The groups are held in Spanish. GREATER LA JOLLA MEALS ON WHEELS Greater La Jolla Meals on Wheels is a non- profit senior service organization. It provides nutritious meals to seniors, the homebound and the disabled residing in the communities of La Jolla and University City. Scripps La Jolla provides office space to the La Jolla chapter of Meals on Wheels. This allows Meals on Wheels to conduct business and interact with volunteers from a central, established location. FOOD HANDLERS TRAINING COURSE Scripps Health provides the use of a classroom to Full Spectrum Nutrition Services to provide a three -hour course which provides certification for food handlers and meets requirements of the San Diego County Food Handlers Ordinance. MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH & HIGH -RISK PREGNANCY Mothers, infants and children makeup a large segment of the U.S. population and thei r well-being is a health predictor for the next generation. There is tremendous focus on maternal illness and death, and infant health and survival, including infant mortality rates, perinatal and other infant deaths. According to a New York Times article, \"Huge Racial Disparities Found in Deaths Linked to Pregnancy, May 2019, African American, Native American and Alaska Native women are about three times more likely to die from causes related to pregnancy, compared to white women in the United States. Maternal and infant health issues include: Alcohol, tobacco and illegal substances during pregnancy, which are major risk factors for low birth weight and other poor outcomes. Very low birth weight associated with preterm birth, spontaneous abortion, low pre-pregnancy weight and smoking. Infant death rates are highest among infants born to young teenagers and mothers 44 years and older. Being pregnant, or trying to become pregnant, is only a small portion of a woman's life. Unintended pregnancy, either mistimed or unwanted at the time of conception, accounts for an estimated 49 percent of pregnancies in the U.S. These pregnancies are asso ciated with increased morbidity, as well as behaviors linked to adverse health. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 88 Women who can plan the number and timing of their children experience improved health, fewer unplanned pregnancies and births, and lower abortion rates. HIGH RISK PREGNANCY High Risk Pregnancy can be the result of a medical condition present before pregnancy or a medical condition that develops during pregnancy for either mom or baby and causes the pregnancy to become high risk. A high- risk pregnancy can pose problems before, during or after delivery and might require special monitoring throughout the pregnancy. Risk factors: Advanced maternal age: increased risk for mother's 35 years and older. Lifestyle choices: smoking, alcohol consumption, use of illegal drugs. Medical histor y: prior high-risk pregnancies or deliveries, fetal genetic conditions, family history of genetic conditions. Underlying conditions: diabetes, high blood pressure and epilepsy. Multiple pregnancy. Obesity during pregnancy. A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of Maternal and Child Health & High -Risk Pregnancies are described below: In 2016, there were 42,654 live births in S an Diego County (SDC) overall. 25 The 2016 fetal mortality rate26 was 3.2 infant deaths per 1,000 live births i n the north inland region, 3.4 in the north coastal region, 3.7 in the east region and SDC overall, 3.8 in the central region, 3.9 in the north central region, and 4.3 in the south region. In 2016, 159 infants died before their first birthday in SDC. Inf ant mortality was higher among male infants (93 deaths) than female infants (66 deaths). African American/black infants had the highest mortality rate (10.7 infant deaths per 1,000 live births) when compared to infants of all other races and ethnicities. Hispanic infants had the second highest mortality rate of 4.5 deaths per 1,000 live births. In addition, there were 3,628 preterm births (less than 37 weeks gestation) in SDC during 2016. Compared to all other races and ethnicities, Hispanic mothers had the highest total number of births (16,978), 8.2 percent of 25 County of San Diego, Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA), Public Health Services, Maternal, Child, and Family Health. 26 Fetal mortality refers to the number of fetuses at least 20 complete weeks of gestation per 1,000 live births and fetal deaths. Reporting of fetal deaths is known to be complete. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 89 which were preterm. Despite having fewer total births than Hispanic mothers (1,781), 11.6 percent of births by African American/black mot hers were preterm. Similarly, although women ages 25 to 39 had the highest total number of births compared to other age groups, mothers age 40 and above were more likely to give birth preterm compared to younger age groups (45.8 percent preterm births amon g mothers age 40 and above compared to 15.4 percent preterm births among mothers ages 25 to 39) 27. In 2016, all SDC regions met the HP2020 national targets for prenatal care, preterm births, low birth weight (LBW) infants, very low birth weight (VLBW) infants and infant mortality 28 See Table 2 for a summary of maternal and infant health indicators in S an Diego County in 2016 and Table 3 for a summary of maternal and infant health indicators by region. TABLE 2. MATERNAL AND INFANT HEALTH INDICATORS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY , 2016 Maternal and Infant Health Indicator Rate HP2020 San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA), Public Health Services, Maternal, Child, and Family Health Services (MCFHS) Statistics 27 County of San Diego, Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA), Public Health Services, Maternal, Child, and Family Health. 28 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' HP2020 initiative represents the nation's prevention agenda for the second decade of the 21st century. HP2020 has four overarching goals: to attain high quality, longer lives free of preventable disease, disability, injury, and premature death; to achieve health equity, eliminate disparities, and improve the health of all groups; to create social and physical environments that promote good healt h for all, and to promote quality of life, healthy development, and healthy behaviors across all life stages. 29 Early prenatal care is defined as care beginning during the first trimester of pregnancy. This does not account for frequency of care. 30 Prete rm birth refers to births prior to 37 completed weeks of gestation. 31 Very low birth weight refers to birth weight less than 1,500 grams (approximately 3 pounds, 5 ounces). 32 Low birth weight refers to birth weight less than 2,500 grams (approximately 5 pounds, 8 ounces). 33 Infant mortality refers to the number of deaths of infants under one year of age per 1,000 live births. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 90 TABLE 3. MATERNAL AND INFANT HEALTH INDICATORS BY REGION IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY , 2016 Indicator Central East North Central North Coastal North Inland South Prenatal Care H ealth Services, MCFHS Statisti cs Scripps Health continued to enhance prenatal education for low income women in San Diego County in Fiscal Year 201 9. The following are some examples: COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICES Offered more than 1,200 maternal child health classes throughout San Diego County to enhance parenting skills. Low income women in San Diego who were eligible attended classes at no charge or on a sliding fee schedule. Maintained existing prenatal education services in all regions of the county, ensuring that programs continued t o demonstrate a satisfaction rating above 90 percent. Provided and supported weekly breastfeeding support groups at six locations throughout San Diego County, including three with bilingual services. Offered maternal child health classes throughout the community, such as Getting Ready for the Baby and Grand Parenting Today . Offered the Dogs and Babies programs quarterly, with more than 40 attendees. Offered classes in pelvic floor and postpartum changes for new mothers throughout the community. FIRST 5 PARENTING EDUCATION Parenting classes are offered at Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista Well -Being Center for parents with infants, toddlers and preschoolers. A wide variety of topics are covered including issues related to health, learning/development, f amily/safety, advocacy as well as parenting tips. Developmental assessments are conducted by Rady Children's Hospital. More than 400 services were received for first time mothers including: home visits, referrals received, data entry, follow up phone calls, parenting classes and other 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 91 support services. A total of 240 unduplicated parents participated in parenting education workshop series and 150 sessions were provided. MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH NURSING STUDENTS Scripps Perinatal Education program supports local nursing students with the opportunity to observe prenatal educational classes. This critical aspect of the nursing education allows the hours and information to meet their clinical rotation requirements in maternal child health. SCRIPPS MERCY 'S SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION PROGRAM FOR WOMEN , INFANTS AND CHILDREN (WIC) The Special Supplement Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) w as established as a permanent program in 1974 to safeguard the health of low -income women, infants and children up to age 5 who are at nutritional risk. Scripps Mercy Hospital is one of five regional organizations that administer the state funded WIC progr am. The program serves six locations conveniently situated near community clinics and/or hospitals in the central San Diego area. WIC targets low income pregnant and postpartum women, infants and children (ages 0 to 5 years). Scripps Mercy WIC serves approximately 6,500 women and children annually, 44 percent in the City Heights community. In City Heights clients are 91 percent Hispanic and include pregnant and postpartum women (24%), infants (20%) and children (56%). In FY19 , the program provided nutrition services, counseling and food vouchers for 67,625 women and children in South and C entral San Diego. The Scripps Mercy WIC program plays a key role in maternity care by reaching low income women to promote prenatal care, good nutrition and breastfeeding during pregnancy and offer lactation support (one on one and group), as well as breast pumps , pads, and other supplies during the postpartum period. CENTERING PREGNANCY , SCRIPPS FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY Raising healthy families and caring f or the next generation of San Diegans before they're born help create a healthier community for years to come. The Scripps Family Medicine Program at Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista is providing access, education and clinical services to nearly 200 preg nant women in south San Diego County. The goal of the program, \"Improving Perinatal Care for Underserved Latina Women - Healthy Women, Healthy Babies\", is to provide access to perinatal care for underserved Latina women in order to improve birth outcomes. The program applies the principles of 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 92 the Center Health Care Institute and focuses on changing the way patients experience their care through assessment, education and group support. Centering Pregnancy is the institute's model devoted specifically to impr oving maternal and child health and has been shown to result in increased prenatal visits, greater levels of breastfeeding and stronger relationships between mothers and their healthcare providers before, during and after pregnancy. Women who gave birth r eported an enhanced prenatal experience, gained less weight throughout their pregnancy and showed improved healthcare knowledge. Services include home visits, referrals, data entry, follow up phone calls, and other support services. Home visiting is offere d together with Family Medicine Residency and parenting education. MIRACLE BABIES Scripps Health partnered with Miracles Babies on their 5k Walk/run on May 5, 2019. The mission is to unite families with their sick newborns through financial assistance and supportive services to reduce pregnancy complications through prevention, education and research. Scripps provided information on breastf eeding and a diaper changing station for parents to use. UNINTENTIONAL INJURY AND VIOLENCE Per the Healthy People 2020, \"unintentional injuries and violence- related injuries can be caused by a number of events, such as motor vehicle crashes and physical assault can occur virtually anywhere.\" Unintentional injury and violence were identified as a priority health need in the community engagement process of the 2019 CHNA . Exposure to violence and neighborhood safety were cited as priority health needs for San Diegans. Neighborhood safety was discussed as influencing residents' ability to maintain good health, while exposure to violence was described as traumatic and impactful on mental health. In 2016, accidents (unintentional injuries) were the fifth leading cause of death for San Diego County overall. The deaths associated with unintentional injuries are significant ; yet represent only a small part of a much larger public health problem. Hospitalization data is a better measure of the injury problem than th e death data alone. Unintentional injuries, motor vehicle accidents, falls, pedestrian related, firearms, fire/burns, drowning, explosion, poisoning (including drugs and alcohol, gas, cleaners and caustic substances) choking/suffocation, cut/pierce, exposure to electric current/radiation/fire/smoke, natural disasters and injuries at work, are one of the 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 93 leading causes of death for S an Diego County residents of all ages, regardless of gender, race or region. Most events resulting in injury, disability or death are predictable and preventable. There are many risk factors for unintentional injury and violence, including individual behaviors and choices, such as alcohol use or risk taking; the physical environment both at home and in the communi ty; access to health services and systems created for injury related care; the social environment, including individual social experiences. A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of unintentional injury and violence is described below: Drugs, alcohol, v ehicles, falls, guns and suicide continue to be leading causes of deaths investigated by the San Diego County Medical Examiner's Office. Under law, the County Medical Examiner's Office investigates all \"unnatural\" deaths, such as suspected homicides, suici des, accidents, and natural deaths that are sudden and unexpected. According to a 2018 annual report, suicides increased from 458 in 2017 to 465, continuing a trend that has seen suicide numbers increase 13% over the past 10 years, taking population growth into account. Homicides decreased from 106 to 104. And accidental deaths, which include fatalities from drugs, alcohol, falls, traffic, drowning, choking, asphyxiation and other causes, increased from 1,522 in 2017 to 1,583. Some of the 2018 Annual Report 's findings included: The three leading causes of accidental and sudden, unexpected deaths \u2014accounting for 88% of all accidental deaths \u2014were drugs, falls, and being killed in or by vehicles. 577 deaths were caused by overdoses: from illegal drugs, from misused or illegally obtained prescription drugs, and alcohol. Of those, fentanyl deaths continued to rise, from 33 in 2016, to 84 in 2017 and 92 in 2018. Methamphetamine deaths also increased by 21% in 2018. 488 people were killed by falls, mainly in the home, but also at jobs, outdoors in rural and urban areas, from bridges, mountains and beach cliffs. 316 people (24) more than 2017 were killed by being hit by vehicles, or in vehicle accidents. That included 107 pedestrians, an increase of six over 2017, which was already the highest number of pedestrian deaths in San Diego County in 24 years. Motorcycle wrecks killed 48 people, a 51% decrease. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 94 Accidental drownings in bathtubs and spas increased significantly, from eight to 18 in bathtubs and from three to 10 in spas. Firearms killed 235 people: 61 in homicides and 174 in suicides. Men made up 68% of all the deaths the Medical Examiner's office fully investigated: 2,196 men to 1,034 women. The HASD&IC 201 9 CHNA continued to identify unintentional injury and violence as one of the top priority health conditions among S an Diego County hospitals. In 2016, there were 1,071 deaths due to unintentional injury in San Diego County . 34 The County's age-adjusted death rate due to unintentional injury was 31.1 deaths per 100,000 population. In 2016, unintentional injury accounted for 5.1 percent of total deaths in San Diego County. In 2016, there were 20,247 hospitalizations related to unintentional injury in San Diego County. The age- adjusted rate of hospitalizations due to unintentional injury was 589.4 per 100,000 population. In 2016, there were 169,017 ED discharges related to unintentional injury in SDC. The age- adjusted rate of discharges due to unintentional injury was 5,160.3 per 100,000 population. CDPH injury data reports that in 2016, unintentional injuries caused over 13,000 deaths, 200,000 non- fatal hospitalizations, and 2.3 million non -fatal ED visits (CDPH, Safe and Active Communities Branch, 2016). In 2016, unintentional injury was the third leading cause of death across all age groups in the U.S., accounting for over 160,000 deaths. Unintentional injury was the leadin g cause of death in the U.S. for people ages 1 to 44, and the seventh leading cause of death for those over age 65 (CDC, 2018). According to data from NCHS, in 2016, over 130,000 deaths in the U.S. were attributed to three causes: poisoning (26 percent), m otor vehicle traffic accidents (16.9 percent), and falls (16.5 percent). Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death among children in the U.S., while nonfatal unintentional injuries can result in children having long -term disabilities (LWSD Repo rt Card on Children, Families, and Community, 2017). 34 The County of San Diego HHSA's Community Health Statistics Unit collects annual data on leading causes of death using methodology established by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Data is based on \"underlying cause of death\" information from all death certificates filed in SDC in 2016. Causes are ranked according to the number of deaths assigned to all ranked causes, which are a subset of ICD -10's \"List of 113 Selected Causes of Death and Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile.\" (Pe\u00f1a, M., County of San Diego HHSA Public Health Services, Community Health Statistics Unit, 2018; Heron, M., Deaths: Leading causes for 2016. National Vital Statistics Reports; vol. 67 no. 6. Hyattsville, Ma ryland: National Center for Health Statistics. 2018 .) 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 95 Traumatic injury is the leading cause of death among children, with many survivors enduring the consequences of brain and spinal cord injuries. The physical, emotional, psychological and learning problems that affect injured children, along with the associated costs, make reducing traumatic injuries a high priority for health and safety advocates throughout the nation. Educational programs from the ThinkFirst National Injury Prevention Foundation increas e knowledge and awareness of the causes and risk factors of brain and SCI, injury prevention measures, and the use of safety habits at an early age , www.thinkfirst.org/kids . San Diego County has made strides to decrease deaths from unintentional injuries as well as non- fatal unintentional injury rates, though non- fatal unintentional injury rates continue to exceed state and federal rates. SDC has focused injury prevention efforts on the most vulnerable populations, including children of all ages (especially older children), Native American and rural children. Successful interventions include safety campaigns, educational strategies and changes in parenting practices (LWSD Report Card on Children, Families, and Community, 2017). According to HP2020, most events resulting in injury, disability or death are predictable and preventable. There are many risk factors for unintentional injury and violence, including individual behaviors and choices, such as alcohol use or risk-taking; physical environment both at home and in the community; access to health services and systems for injury -related care; and social environment, including individual social experiences (e.g., social norms, education and victimization history), social relationships (e.g., parental monitoring and supervision of youth, peer group associations and family interactions), community environment (e.g., cohesion in schools, neighborhoods and communities) and societal factors (e.g., cultural beli efs, attitudes, incentives and disincentives, laws and regulations). 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 96 Scripps Health continued to address unintentional injury and violence in FY 19. The following are some examples: CAR SEAT PROGRAM Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla Emergency Department provides car seats to patients who have been in an automobile accident and their child's car seat has been rendered unsafe to use. The service provides the ease of mind for the patient in their ability to transport their child home safely. SAN DIEGO BRAIN INJURY FOUNDATION Scripps Health provides meeting space to the San Diego Brain Injury Foundation. The organization provides quality of life improvements for brain injury survivors and support to family members. BRAINMASTERS Brainmasters is a supportive communication group for adults coping with acquired brain injury. It is offered as a community benefit through the Rehabilitation Center at Scripps Memorial Hospital Encinitas. The main goal of Brainmasters is to help brain inj ury survivors to build confidence by practicing thinking on their feet. This helps to alleviate challenges with communication and social isolation that so many brain injury survivors experience. EVERY 15 MINUTES Alcohol can be attributed to more than 100, 000 deaths in the U.S. annually, including 41% of all traffic fatalities. Every 15 Minutes program i s a two -day immersion experience for teens on the realistic consequences of drinking and driving, which involves the schools, law enforcement, courts, emergency service providers, and the mortuary. The \"injured\" students are taken to Scripps Mercy Trauma Center. This program is sponsored jointly by local high schools, county police and sheriff's departments, ambulance services, and emergency departments. BEACH AREA COMMUNITY COURT PROGRAM The program is an educational program for first time offenders for quality of life crimes. This is a collaboration with the San Diego Police Department, Parks and Recreation, District Attorney's Office and Discover Pacific B each. Education is provided to the participants regarding these quality of life crimes and their effects on the community, the effects of smoking and alcohol consumption and the rules and regula tions for the beach community. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 97 SAN DIEGO COUNTY LIFEGUARD EDUCATION CONFERENCE In FY19, the Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla Trauma department at Scripps La Jolla hosted the second San Diego County Lifeguard Education Conference. More than 157 lifeguards representing all 11 San Diego County lifeguard agencies attended the event. Information was shared on several topics critical for lifeguards, including downing resuscitation, snorkeler drowning and shallow water blackout, human factors in lifeguarding: reducing distractions and improving surveillance, marine mammal update: sharks and sting rays and skin cancer prevention. The trauma department plans to continue this partnership with the county lifeguards to provide education and help them further identify opportunities for community outreach and injury prevention. SAN DIEGO HUMAN TRAFFICKING TASK FORCE AND PROJECT LIFE Scripps has partnered with the San Diego Human Trafficking Task Force and Project Life to offer \"soft rooms\" at all Scripps hospital facilities except Scripps G reen Hospital. These soft rooms will be available to Project Life on a moment's notice to serve as a safe, confidential environment for law enforcement to interview victims of human trafficking and for service providers to connect with the victims with em ergency shelter and community resources. The San Diego Human Trafficking Task Force receives 3,000 to 8,000 human trafficking victims every year in San Diego County. Approximately 80 percent are born in the United States. SAVING LIVES THROUGH STOP THE BLEED CAMPAIGN Whether from a bullet wound or other traumatic injury, severe blood loss can kill in just five minutes. However, one- fifth of trauma deaths, the leading cause of death for Americans under age 46, could be prevented by sta unching the bleeding. Scripps doctors are getting behind the national Stop the Bleed campaign. Supported by the American College of Surgeons, the Department of Homeland Security and numerous police departments, it aims to teach bystanders how to properly pl ace pressure on a wound or apply a tourniquet in an emergency. Scripps providers participate in this program by teaching nonmedical audiences to control life- threatening bleeding until professional medical help arrives. The 90- minute course includes a pres entation and practice on applying direct pressure, wound packing and using a tourniquet. TRAUMA AWARENESS CONFERENCE Scripps participates with local agencies giving attendee s the opport unity to learn more about Trauma Services. Education was provided on injury prevention and the latest trauma research. Participants had the opportunity to meet San Diego's first responders, explore equipment, and learn about careers from San Diego Fire, SAWT, SDPD Canine 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 98 unit, Cal Fire, a mbulance, and rescue helicopters. Int eractive booths educated families on important issues like the dangers of distracted/impaired driving, drowning prevention, fall prevention, and helmet safety. DISASTER PREPAREDNESS EXPO Scripps Mercy hospital held a disaster preparedness expo on March 23, 2019. The event included a sidewalk CPR, Stop the Bleed which include learning basic techniques of bleeding control, learning the signs and symptoms of stroke and meeting the members of the trauma team at Scripps Mercy hospital.

The foundation fundraises for equipment, training and outreach programs for the police department in order to fight crime . 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 99 645 SQUAD CLUB - LAW ENFORCEMENT MEMORIAL FOUNDATION Scripps Health sponsored the San Diego County Law Enforcement Memorial Foundation. The San Diego County Law Enforcement Memorial Foundation honors those law enforcement members who have given the ultimate sacrifi ce to ensure public safety. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 100 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH Behavioral health encompasses many different areas including mental health and substance abuse. Because of the broadness of this health issue, it is often difficult to capture the need for behavioral health services with a single measure. Mental health can be defined as \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well -being, and not merely the absence of disease\". Mental illness is defined as \"collectively all diagnosable mental disorders\" or \"health conditions that are characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or behavior (or some combination thereof) associated with distress and/or impaired functioning\". Behavioral health is an important health need because it impacts an individual's overall health status and is a comorbidity often associated with multiple chronic conditions, such as diabetes, obesity and asthma. An analysis of mortality data in San Diego County found that in 2016, intentional self - harm (suicide) was the ninth leading cause of death. In 2016, the age- adjusted suicide rate in San Diego was 11.9 per 100,000. Rates were highest among whites (18.7), followed by blacks (11.5), Asian Pacific Islanders (8.2) and Hispanics (5.3). While the rate of suicide decreased slightly (1.3%) from 2014- 2016, the rates of suicide for people who identify as Asian/Pacific Islander, black, and \"other,\" increased in those same years by 13.3%, 47.2%, and 93.0% respectively. 35 A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of behavioral health is described below: The Scripps 2019 CHNA continued to identify behavioral health as a priority health issue affecting members of the communities served by Scripps. The HASD&IC 201 9 CHNA identified behavioral health a top priority health issue both in the secondary data analyses and in the community engagement events. HASD&IC 2019 CHNA conducted a community engagement analysis and across all types of community engagement \u2014focus groups, key informant interviews, and the online survey . Behavioral health issues were identified as both prevalent and debilitating in the community. In the online survey, behavioral health was ranked 35 Live Well San Diego.

Mental illness is defined as \"collectively all diagnosable mental disorders\" or \"health conditions that are characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or behavior (or some combination thereof) associated with distress and/or impaired functioning\". 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 101 as the health condition having the greatest impact on the health and well- being of San Diego County residents and as the second most impactful condition when health conditions and social determinants of health were combined (only access to care ranked higher). In addition, 63% of survey respondents indicated that they bel ieve behavioral health is worsening in San Diego County. Respondents were also asked to rank specific behavioral health conditions having the greatest impact in San Diego. The top seven conditions identified were as follows: 1. Alcohol Use Disorder 2. Mood Disor ders 3. Substance Use Disorder 4. Anxiety 5. Opioid Use 6. Suicide and Suicide Thoughts/Ideation 7. Self-Harm or Self -Injury The community engagement events conducted in the 2019 CHNA, identified that while San Diego has innovative programs to address mental health, residents face challenges in accessing timely, consistent mental health care. Care was described as especially difficult to obtain when the mental health issue was not considered an emergency. Mental health issues affect nearly 1 in 5 people, and when left untreated, are a leading cause of disability, are associated with chronic disease, and may lead to premature mortality. In San Diego County, 12.4 people per every 100,000 die from suicide annually, and approximately 10% of all adults seriously consider committing suicide. While the rate of suicide decreased slightly (1.3%) from 2014- 2016, the rates of suicide for people who identify as Asian/Pacific Islander, black, and \"other,\" increased in those same years (13.3%, 47.2%, 93.0%). In addition, more people are being discharged emergency departments for anxiety than in the past , rates increased by 4.3% between 2014- 2016, while rates of inpatient discharges for anxiety decreased by 7.9% during the same time period. People who identify as \"other race\" and Black/African American had the highest rates of ED and hospital discharge for anxiety. 36 An analysis of 2016 mortality data for San Diego County revealed Alzheimer's disease and suicide as the third and ninth leading causes of death for San Diego County, respectively. 36 California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, OSHPD Patient Discharge Data. 2014- 2016. SpeedTrack\u00a9 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 102 Rates of discharge from emergency departments due to anxiety incr eased by 4.3% between 2014- 2016, while rates of inpatient discharges for anxiety decreased by 7.9% during the same time period. People who identify as \"other race\" and Black/African American had the highest rates of ED and inpatient discharge for anxiety . 37 ED discharges for mood disorders also increased (5.9%) from 2014 -2016, while inpatient discharges for mood disorders decreased by 2.9%. Discharge rates for mood disorders were higher for people who identify their race as Black/African American than for any other race. 38 According to 2017 data from the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD), anxiety disorders were the top primary diagnosis for behavioral health- related ED discharges among those ages five to 44 and ages 65 and older. For those ages 45 to 64, the top ED discharge for behavioral health was alcohol -related disorders, followed by anxiety and mood disorders. According to 2017 CHIS data, 11.8 percent of adults in SDC have ever seriously thought about committing suicid e, a 40.5 percent increase since 2013 (8.4 percent) . In 2016, there were 1,080 hospitalizations due to overdose/poisoning in SDC. The age- adjusted rate of hospitalizations due to overdose/poisoning was 31.2 per 100,000 population. In 2016, the age- adjusted rate of overdose/poisoning- related ED discharges in SDC was 162.3 per 100,000 population. Age- adjusted rates for overdose/poisoning- related ED discharges were higher among males, blacks and individuals ages 15 to 24 years in comparison among groups. While ED discharges for acute substance use rose by 51.0% from 2014- 2016, inpatient discharges dropped by 18.5%. The highest discharge rates of both types were among Black/African Americans. Steep increases in both types of discharge occurred for chronic substa nce use; ED discharge rates increased by 559.3%, and inpatient discharge rates increased by 195.1%.

Across age groups, r ates of ED discharge for chronic substance abuse increased the most for those over 65 years by 714%. In addition, nearly 20% of adults ages 18 and older self -report excessive alcohol use.39 Heavy alcohol consumption is also problem in San Diego County. Nearly 20% of adults ages 18 and older self -report excessive alcohol use. Participants in the community engagement process discussed the link between mental health and substance misuse, arguing that the failure to provide preventive and acute menta l health services often leads to self -medicating with drugs and alcohol. They also an insufficient supply of substance use disorder outpatient and in- patient drug treatment programs as a critical need in San Diego County . ED discharges for opioid misuse increased by 267.2% from 2014- 2016, while inpatient discharges increased by 239.3%. The steepest increases in both discharge rates were among people 65+, who experienced a 1,734.4% increase in ED discharges and an 863.1% increase in hospital discharges. 40 11.8% of adults in San Diego seriously considered committing suicide in 2017.41 In 2016, the age- adjusted suicide rate in San Diego was 11.9 per 100,000.

Suicide and Suicide Attempts Suicide is a major complication of depression and a leading cause of non- natural death for all ages in San Diego County, second only to motor vehicle accidents. According to a San Diego County Suicide Prevention Council's 2019 r eport the number and rate of people who died by suicide in San Diego County rose slightly. There were 465 deaths by suicide in 2018, up from 458 reported in 2017. The annual report provides a comprehensive look at suicide in the region and brings together data from multiple sources for the years 2014 through 2017. 39 California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, OSHPD Patient Discharge Data. 2014- 2016.

Suicide rate (per 100,000 population): 13.9 compared to 13.8 in 2017. Emergency department discharges due to self -inflicted injury: Down slightly to 3,091 in 2017 (most recent year available) compared to 3,098 in 2016. The percentage of suicide crisis calls, as opposed to calls about other mental health issues, to the County's Access and Crisis Line saw a sharp 52 percent increase to 47.6 percent of calls compared to 31.4 percent in 2017. Firearms have been the primary means used in suicide deaths in San Diego County and have been increasing over the last three years. Firearms account for 37 percent of the deaths by suicide, followed by hanging and suffocation at 33 percent. In 2010, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) launched a suicide prevention planning process, which was formed by the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention and the California Strategic Plan on Suicide Prevention. Scripps is a member of the Community Health Improvement Partners (CHIP), which collaborates with the county on this initiative. For more information on the status of suicide and suicide prev ention in San Diego County: 201 -content/uploads/2019/09/2018- San-Diego -County - Suicide.pdf . The Report Card brings together the most recent data available from multipl e sources (for the years 2014 through 2018) to present a profile of suicides for all ages in San Diego County.

BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INPATIENT PROGRAMS Individuals suffering from acute psychiatric disorders are sometimes unable to live independently or may even pose a danger to themselves or others. In such cases, hospitalization may be the most appropriate alternative. The Behavioral Health Inpatient Program at Scripps Mercy Hospital helps patients and their loved ones work t hrough short -term crises, manage mental illness and resume their daily lives. Challenges Like many behavioral health programs across the country, funding is difficult, as payment rates have not kept pace with the cost to provide care. In FY19, the Scripps Mercy Behavioral Health Program experienced a $4. 1 million loss in total operations, however 3. 4 million of this is captured in Medi - Cal/CMS and Charity Care. In FY19, 1.8 percent of patients in the inpatient unit were uninsured. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OUTPATIENT PROGRAMS Scripps Behavioral Health entered into an agreement in May 2016 to transition the intensive behavioral health outpatient program to the Family Health Centers of San Diego and expand outpatient behavioral health offerings to the population served. SCRIPPS MERCY AND FAMILY HEALTH CENTERS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PARTNERSHIP Scripps Mercy has established an initiative with Family Health Centers of San Diego (FHCSD) to create a more robust behavioral health care system for Medi -Cal patients that receive care at S cripps Mercy Hospital . The goal is to strengthen the continuum of 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 106 integrated primary and mental health services for patients discharged from various hospital set tings (medical and behavioral health inpatient and emergency care) through a variety of timely patient engagement strategies including the expansion of community - based behavioral health services adjacent to the hospital. The goal is to involve patients in appropriate outpatient care before their behavioral health issues become acute, preventing return s to the Emergency Department. MENTAL HEALTH OUTREACH SERVICES , A-VISIONS VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAM Behavioral Health Services at Scripps Mercy Hospital, in partnership with the San Diego chapter of Mental Health of America established the A -Visons Vocational Training Program (social rehabilitation and prevocational services for people living with mental illness) to help decrease the stigma of mental illness and offer volunteer and employment opportunities to persons with mental illness. This supportive employment program provides vocational training for people receiving mental health treatment, potentially leading to greater independence. This year, Behavioral Health Services continued participating in the A -Visions program. Since its inception, 611 inquiries have come in, 165 of these resulted in qualified candidates with 100 volunteers and 54 employees thus far. Currently, there are a total of 23 active candi dates: 22 employees and one volunteer who participate in this supportive employment program. The average length of employment for the 54 employees is 5.6 years, with a range of 2 months to 14.7 years. The current paid employees have been employed between 1.9 years to 12.6 years, with the average length of employment being 7 years. A-Visions participants have been employed on a casual/per diem basis by Scripps Environmental Services, Food Services and clerical support for Health and Information Serv ices, Emergency Services, Nursing Research, Human Resources , Access, Behavioral Health, Credentialing, Labor and Delivery, Laboratory, Medical Staffing, Performance Improvement, Spiritual Care and Palliative Care Services. Paid A -Visions candidates typical ly limit their work to eight hours per week, which allows them to maintain eligibility for the disability benefits, medications and ongoing behavioral healthcare that supports their work. INCREASING AWARENESS OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES In FY19, Scripps Behavi oral Health Services improved awareness of mental health issues by providing information and supportive services for more than 900 people at community events . 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 107 COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PARTNERS (CHIP) AND THE SUICIDE PREVENTION COUNCIL The San Diego Co unty Suicide Prevention Council (SPC) is a collaborative community - wide effort focused on realizing a vision of zero suicides in San Diego County. Its goal is to prevent suicide and its devastating cons equences in San Diego County. Since 2010, with support from the County of San Diego Behavioral Health Services, CHIP provides direct oversight and guidance toward the implementation of the Suicide Prevention Action Plan. The core strategies of the S uicide Prevention Council are: Enhancing collaborations to promote a suicide- free community Conducting needs assessments to identify gaps in suicide prevention services and supports Disseminating vital information on the signs of suicide and effective help-seeking Providing resources to thos e affected by suicide and suicidal behavior Advancing policies and practices that contribute to the prevention of suicide PSYCHIATRIC LIAISON TEAM (PLT) The Psychiatric Liaison Team is a mobile psychiatric assessment team. Clinicians provide mental health evaluation and triage services to accurately assess patients and provide them with the best and safest community resources to promote ongoing care. The team aims to help people adhere to treatment plans, reduce hospital readmission rates, relieve symptoms and ultimately ensure the long- term stabilization of the patient's mental health. Scripps will continue to provide a dedicated Psychiatric Liaison Team at all Scripps Hospitals Emergency Departments and urgent care settings (Rancho Bernardo and Torrey Pines). MI PUENTE : \"MY BRIDGE \" TO BETTER CARDIOMETABOLIC HEALTH AND WELL BEING Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute received a $2.4 million study grant from the NIH's National Institute of Nursing Research in 2015 to evaluate Mi Puente, a program at Scripps Me rcy Chula Vista hospital that uses a \"nurse + volunteer\" team approach to help hospitalized Hispanic patients with multiple chronic diseases reduce their hospitalizations and improve their day -to-day health and quality of life. Individuals of low socioeconomic (SES) and ethnic minority status, including Hispanics, the largest U.S. ethnic minority group are disproportionately burdened by chronic cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (\"cardiometabolic\" e.g. obesity, diabetes, 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 108 hypertension, heart disease). High levels of unmet behavioral health in this population contribute to striking disparities in disease prevalence and outcomes. A behavioral health nurse provides in- hospital coaching to patients, who are then followed post discharge by a volunteer community peer mentor to assist them in overcoming barriers that may interfere with achieving and maintaining good health. Mi Puente aims to improve continuity of care and address the (physical and behavioral) health needs of the at -risk Hispanic population. This program holds promise for impactful expansion to other conditions and underserved populations. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION PROGRAM (BHIP) IN DIABETES Many people find that the day -to-day tasks associated with having diabet es testing one's blood sugar, planning meals, getting enough physical activity and remembering to take medications can be stressful. A common condition known as \"diabetes distress\" can be the result of feeling like it's all too much. Scripps Diabetes Care and Prevention has a Diabetes Behavioral Specialist on staff to help people manage their diabetes without being overwhelmed or unduly distressed. The Behavioral Health Integration Program (BHIP) in Diabetes is an integrated, interdisciplinary approach to m anaging the emotional and behavioral needs that often leads to burnout of individuals with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The collocation of medical and behavioral health services in the same facility allow for a convenient, warm hand- off from physician to be havioral health specialist. It also affords opportunities for physicians, diabetes educators and others to receive consultation on behavioral health concerns, and in turn, more comprehensively address the multi -faceted needs of their patients with diabetes . GUIDING VETERAN 'S TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES San Diego is home to more than 250,000 veterans. A substantial number of our service members have suffered or are struggling with Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety and other psychological conditions related to military service and repeated deployments. Partnering with community -based organizations, Scripps is actively working to assist these veterans through informational sessions designed to improve knowledge of veteran's mental health issues and access to community -based services. Scripps is working with San Diego State University to implement a v eteran's mental health course in the Social Work Department. MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT SERVICES AT LOCAL SCHOOL -BASED CLINICS Scripps Family Medicine Residency and Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista Well -Being Center have partnered to offer clinical training opportunities for Master Social Work 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 109 students in training from San Diego State University at Southwest and Palomar High Schools. These students work with local providers that address the mental health needs of vulnerable adolescents. A variety of mental health issues are present for local high school students. Many of these issues include depression, anxiety and suicide related concerns. The program works to improve overall mental health care for local students through a school -based clinic. Approximately 240 hours were spent in the school -based clinics offering services for adolescents to an average of 12 students per week. PATIENT COMMUNITY SERVICES Patients are referred from Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista, for assistance with a wide variety of behavioral health needs including addiction, loss, anxiety and other mental health issues. The Well -Being Center offers weekly counseling and/or refer patients to local mental health counseling services. ALCOHOLIC ANONYMOUS Scripps H ealth provides meeting space for members of Alcoholic Anonymous. A fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and support of each other. GRIEF RECOVERY AFTER A SUBSTANCE PASSING (GRASP) Scripps Health provides meeting space for members of GRASP. GRASP was founded to help provide sources of help, compassion and most of all, understanding, for families or individuals who have had a loved one die as a result of substance use or addi ction. NATIONAL ALLIANCE OF MENTAL ILLNESS (NAMI) SIBLINGS SUPPORT Scripps Health provides meeting space for members of NAMI Sibling Support.

SURVIVORS OF SUICIDE LOSS - SAN DIEGO CHAPTER Scripps Health provides meeting space for members of the Survivors of Suicide Loss - San Diego Chapter. The organization reaches out to and supports people who have lost a loved one to suicide. The goal is to give survivors a place where they can be comfortable expressing themselves, a place to find support, comfort, resources and hope in a judgment -free environment. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 110 TRANSITIONS OF CARE INITIATIVE (TOC) Family Health Center of San Diego (FHCSD) received funding from Blue Shield Promise to hire two social work staff positions that are embedded into operations at Scripps Mercy Hospital for the goal of connecting patients to FHCSD for needed services. The ToC initiative is designed to help patients at all levels of care within the hospital, with especially those with mental health and drug and alcohol problems to connect with appropriate FHCSD resources. The goal is to connect patients wit h an array of outpatient health and social service resources to prevent readmissions. SCRIPPS DRUG AND ALCOHOL RESOURCES There are in excess of 25 million illicit drug users in the US. There are an estimated 136.9 million current drinkers of alcoholic bev erages and of those, approximately 23 percent binge drank in the last 30 days and 6.3 percent are considered heavy drinkers. It is estimated there are 8.7 million under -age drinkers. Substance use, particularly opioid misuse, is a health crisis that has reached epidemic proportions both nationally and locally. In San Diego, the rate of discharge from emergency departments for chronic substance use increased by 559% from 2014 -2016; rates for those 65 years and older increased the most by 714%. The rate of discharge for opioid misuse for this age group was even more startling\u2014it rose by 1.734% over this two -year period. Rates of discharge from emergency departments for acute substance use also rose. Rates increased for people of all racial and ethnic backgrounds; however, the most substantial increases (177%) was for b lacks. Heavy alcohol consumption is also a problem in San Diego. Nearly 20% of all adults ages 18 and older self -report exc essive alcohol use. SCRIPPS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICE (SUDS) NURSES Aware of the impact drugs and alcohol can have on our community, Scripps has developed innovative ways to treating this destructive disease. Scripps has deployed specialized nurses c ertified in addiction; they see patients at their bedside and work closely with the patient's entire health care team to help facilitate a safe detox while hospitalized. The Substance Use Disorder Service (SUDS) nurses act in a proactive and reactive role in all Scripps hospitals, helping to identify patients who are at risk, or are currently experiencing withdrawal from addictive substances. This mobile group of specially trained drug and alcohol resource nurses provide education, interventions and discha rge placement assistance to patients in the Scripps hospitals. The resource nurses work directly with the nursing staff at each of the hospitals in search of patients 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 111 who may be at risk for alcohol/drug withdrawal and assist with implementing a standardized protocol withdrawal process. Scripps has changed the way we deliver drug and alcohol treatment by collaborating with others to deliver a continuum of care that improves the health of our community. When patients need additional care, Scripps has linked itself to t wo separate treatment programs designed to meet the community needs. B ETTY FORD CENTER In 2016, Scripps partnered with the Betty Ford Center, which expanded its drug and alcohol treatment programming into San Diego. This treatment center brings world- renowned alcohol and drug rehab to more people through weekday and weeknight outpatient serv ices. FAMILY HEALTH CENTERS OF SAN DIEGO Family Health Centers of San Diego provides an array of services, including outpatient drug and alcohol treatment along with medication- assisted treatment and harm reduction programs. Their services also include individual counseling and one- on-one support, educational sessions, HIV resting, Hepatitis B & C testing and treatment. OPIOID STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM (OSP) The Opioid Stewardship Program has spearheaded multiple projects at Scripps to educate patients and prov iders about the risks of opioids and the benefits of alternative multi- modal pain management options to reduce opioid use. The program has established prescribing standards for opioids, resulting in a 25 percent reduction in the number of opioid pills per prescription at Scripps hospitals and outpatient centers in 2019. Scripps also has opened three drug take- back kiosks at its on -site pharmacies, offering patients year -round access to dispose of unused, unneeded or outdated medications. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 112 SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH Per Section 2, Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA), in addition to the health needs that were identified in the CHNA, social determinants of health (SDOH) were also identified in all the community engagement activities. Approximately 80 percent of modifiable risks for diseases are attributable to non- medical (upstream) determinants of health, such as health behaviors, socioeconomic status, and environmental conditions. To prevent chronic conditions and promote health, greater emphasis should be placed on population health, which has been defined to focus on outcomes as well as on the broader factors that influence health at a population level, including medical care systems, the social environment, and the physical environ ment.42 The CHNA identified economic security as a priority SDOH need in the secondary data analyses and in the community engagement process. Economic security refers to the ability to meet essential financial needs sustainably, including those for food, shelter, clothing, hygiene, health care, and education. 43 Economic insecurity is associated with:44 Poor mental health days Visits to the ED for heart attacks Asthma Obesity Diabetes Stroke Cancer Smoking Pedestrian Injury Economic insecurity may also lead to food insecurity, which is linked to:45 Fair or poor health, anemia, and asthma in children Mental health problems, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and oral health problems in adults Fair or poor health, depression, and limitations in activities of daily living in seniors 42 UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. \"Emerging Models of Diabetes and Hypertension Prevention in Los Angeles\", Ying Ying Meng, Susan H.

Health Affairs. 2015. 34(11): 1830- 1839. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 113 Economic security is also linked to wages. Educational attainment is directly related to economic insecurity by way of low wages and/or limited access to employment In San Diego, adul ts who had less than a high school diploma was highest in South (21.9%) and Central (19.9%) regions. FOOD INSECURITY Food Insecurity is the inability to afford enough food for an active, healthy life. The HASD&IC 2019 CHNA identified food insecurity and access to healthy food as a social determinant impacting San Diego's priority health needs . According to the latest research from the San Diego Hunger Coalition, alm ost half a million San Diegans, 1 in 7 residents, or 1 5 percent of the San Diego County population are considered food insecure, an economic and social condition characterized by limited or uncertain access to adequate food. To put the total number of food insecure San Diegans into perspective, it is roughly equivalent to the entire populations of Chula Vista, Oceanside, Imperial Beach, Coronado, and Solana Beach combined. Rates in Imperial County are even higher, with 17% of the general population suffering food insecurity. Even more alarming is that the rate of food insecurity among children in Imperial County is the highest in California at over 33%. In San Diego County: 14% of people experience food insecurity, 1 in 7 people 22% of children are in food insecure households, more than 1 in 5 children 9% of seniors experience food insecurity, 1 in 11 seniors. In addition, s tudies demonstrate that hunger significantly impacts health. Lack of access to healthy food, often due to availability and cost, are stressors that contribute to diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and other behavioral health issues in a myriad of ways: Food insecure adults with diabetes have higher average blood sugars. Food i nsecure adults are more likely to be obese. Food i nsecurity is significantly more prevalent in adults with mood disorders. Food i nsecurity is associated with increased risk of suicidal thoughts and substance use in adolescents. Food i nsecure seniors have a significantly higher likelihood of heart disease, depression and limited activities of daily living. Food i nsecure adults delay buying food in order to purchase medications. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 114 CALFRESH PROGRAM The CalFresh Program, federally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), issues monthly electronic benefits that can be used to buy food at participating markets and stores. In San Diego County, an estimated additional 185,000 people are \"food secure\" but rely on CalFresh and/or WIC to supplement their food budget. This represents 96,000 adults and 89,000 children who are at risk of food insecurit y should they lose CalFresh or WIC benefits. The total population in San Diego County that is either food insecure or food secure with CalFresh or WIC assistance is 671,000 or 1 in 5 people. Federal Reduced -Price Meals program (FRPM) According to a new r eport released in 2019 by the San Diego County Childhood Obesity Initiative , www.sdcoi.org , the effect of poverty and food insecurity on students' overweight and obesity rates can perhaps most profoundly be observed when looking at districts with high concentrations of students enrolled in the Federal Reduced- Price Meals program (FRPM). All students can participate in school nutrition programs; however, students with family incomes under 130% of the Federal Poverty Level are eligible for free meals, and those with incomes between 130% and 185% of the poverty level are eligible for low -cost (or \"reduced price\") meals. Students enrolled in this program not only come from lower income households but are also likely to be food insecure. Fifty percent, or half of all students in San Diego County are enrolled in the Federal Reduced- Price Meals Program . Source: California Department of Education. 2018- 2019 Student Poverty FRPM Data. The programs highlighted below are ways that Scripps Health is addressing food insecurity ; screenings and eligibility benefits . SCRIPPS HEALTH CALFRESH SCREENINGS As health care delivery systems moves towards a population health paradigm that incentivizes keeping patient's healthy, hospitals and clinics are recognizing the significance of addressing social determinants of health, such as Food Insecurity (FI). Hospitals have been more proactive in intervening at some level of care to aid the individuals suffering from FI and t heir ability to gain control over their health. Accordingly, food assistance provided by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) \u2014known as CalFresh in California, significantly reduces the rate and severity of poverty throughout the state (Cali fornia Budget & Policy Center, 2018). While SNAP and Women's, Infants, Children (WIC) have been successful in assisting low - income children and their families with additional funding for purchasing healthy foods, 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 115 there is evidence that suggests screening f or FI in healthcare settings is the best indicator for patients to access food- related assistance. Scripps Health began screening for CalFresh in June 2017 through the support of the Public Resource Specialist (PRS) team. The PRS are experienced staff with strong knowledge of the county programs. They screen all uninsured patients who have received services at any of the five Scripps hospital facilities. The in- house application process can take up to 45 minutes as they are screening for multiple programs concurrently. Once an application has been completed, the PRS staff submits it to the county via the Hospital Outstation Point of Entry (HOPE ) program. Once submitted, a county H OPE worker is assigned and the PRS team tracks the application, advocating for the patients throughout the process that can take up to 45 days to receive an eligibility response. In some instances, having to go through the appeal process that may add an addit ional 30 days. In doing so, the PRS team helps patient's maneuver a complex application process that otherwise may deter them from seeking much needed acute and preventative care. The team has been successful in having the important conversation about food insecurity with 46 % of the patients they have screened in this past fiscal year.

With La Maestra servi ng as the lead agency, Scripps Mercy and Rady Children's hospitals are contributing resources to support operational costs of the Center in order to provide capacity for need ed community linkages . Eligibility Workers from La Maestra Family Clinic are avail able to counsel people and assist filling out applications for Food Stamp Assistance. CHWC not only provides the needed space for the activity, but also actively participates by developing outreach flyers, scheduling community residents, and overall coordi nation for the class. Applications and assistance for CalFresh to supplement food budget and allow families/individuals to buy nutritious food. SCRIPPS MERCY WIC PROGRAM The City Heights Wellness Center is home to the S cripps Mercy Hospital -WIC Program that provides nutrition education and counseling, breastfeeding education and support and food vouchers to pregnant and parenting women, and children 0 -5 years of age. FOOD FINDERS - RESCUING FOOD, REDUCING HUNGER Scripps Corporate Food Service partnered with Food Finders, a multi -regional food bank and food rescue program that connects businesses to charitable institutions in need of donations. Food Finders connected Scripps with Interfaith Community Services in Escondido, which dis tributes food to people in need. All leftover food from Scripps Corporate facilities is packaged, picked up each day and transferred to the Scripps 4S Ranch Food and Nutrition Services freezer for storage. The cost is minimal, as Scripps uses the same amount of labor to package the food as it would to dispose of it, and unsold \"grab and go\" items are already packaged. Interfaith Community Services picks up the frozen food twice per week and transports it to one of their facilities to help feed the community . Between food donated by Scripps and others, Interfaith distributes an average of 126,000 hot meals and packed lunches and 23,000 emergency meals, feeding approximately 17,000 people every year. 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 117 COOKING FOR HEALTH Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine and Bastyr University 's Master of Science in Nutrition for Wellness Program collaborate on offering free classes that teach individuals how to make vegetarian and vegan meals that are delicious and easy to prepare. Participants learn h ow to cook healthy meals and are educated on why ingredients are chosen and the health benefits. These cooking classes focus on disease prevention, reducing obesity and improving chronic health issues. FOSTERING VOLUNTEERISM Scripps believes that health i mprovement begins when people take an active role in making a positive impact on their community. For this reason, Scripps supports volunteer programs for Scripps employees and affiliated physicians who want to make an even larger impact on their community . Scripps matches the talents and interests of employees and physicians with community needs, such as mentoring partnerships with local schools and providing free medical and surgical care for patients in need. In addition to the financial community benefi t contributions made during FY19, Scripps employees and affiliated physicians donated a significant portion of their personal time volunteering to support Scripps sponsored community benefit programs. With close to 9,801 hours, the estimated dollar value of this volunteer labor is $ 496,563.74*, which is not included in the Scripps FY 19 community benefit programs and services totals.

Professional Education and Health Research 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 126 PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION & HEALTH R ESEARCH Quality health care is highly dependent upon health education systems and medical research programs. Without the ability to train and inspire a new generation of health care providers, or to offer continuing educati on to existing health care professionals, the quality of health care will be greatly diminished. Medical research also plays an important role in improving the community's overall health by developing new and innovative treatments. Each year, Scripps alloc ates resources to advance health care services through clinical research, medical education and health professional education. During Fiscal Year 2019 (October 2018 to Septemb er 201 9), Scripps invested $27,907,934 46 in professional training programs and clinical research to enhance service delivery and treatment practices in San Diego County. This section highlights some of our professional education and health research activities.

Scripps and FHCSD already work together in several areas that benefit the medical ly underserved, including a pediatric residency training program, a collaborative prenatal care and delivery program, a coordinated behavioral health program, and emergency room referrals for patients without medical homes. This program has given its patie nts access to increased services, including case management, onsite psychiatric services, dental care, onsite phlebotomy, adjacent 2020 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 160 HIV/AIDS/Hepatitis C treatment, physical therapy, acupuncture, sports medicine and other services. From a GME perspective, this is an opportunity for our residents to practice within a broader interdisciplinary setting and regularly collaborate with other community health care providers. Mercy Clinic's mission of providing quality health care to the community's underserved will continue. Note: Mercy Clinic expenses are included within Scripps Mercy Hospital financials for FY19. In 2019, the Scripps Mercy Graduate Medical Education (GME) program move d its outpatient primary care and specialty clinics from Mercy Clinic to a new l ocation with Family Health Centers of San Diego in Hillcrest . 2020 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 161 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INPATIENT PROGRAMS Individuals suffering from acute psychiatric disorders are sometimes unable to live independently or may even pose a danger to themselves or others. In suc h cases, hospitalization may be the most appropriate alternative. Scripps Mercy Hospital's Behavioral Health Inpatient Program helps patients and their loved ones work through short -term crises, manage mental illness and resume their daily lives. Challenges Like many behavioral health programs across the country, funding is difficult, as payment rates have not kept pace with the cost to provide care. In FY 2019 , the Scripps Mercy Behavioral Health Program experienced a $ 4.1 million loss in total operations however $3.4 million of this is captured in Medi - Cal/CMS and charity care. In FY 2019 , 1.8 percent of patients in the inpatient unit were uninsured. BEHAVIORA L HEALTH COLLABORATION Scripps will be partnering with Acadia- Healthcare Company, Inc. to develop a new inpatient behavioral health facility in Chula Vista. The facility will provide treatment for three times as many patients as existing behavioral health unit at Scripps Mercy San Diego. Acadia provides behavioral health services through a network of 586 health care facilities with approximately 18,000 beds in 40 states, the United Kingdom and Puerto Rico. This new center which is planned to open in 2023 will serve as a regional resource to meet the needs of patients across San Diego County and will be operated through a joint venture between Scripps and Acadia. Scripps continues to offer behavioral health support at all hospital emergency departments and urgent care centers on an ongoing basis. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OUTPATIENT SERVICES Scripps Behavioral Health entered into an agreement in May 2016 to transition the intensive behavioral health outpatient program to the Family Health Centers of San Diego and expand outpatient behavioral health offerings to the population served. 2020 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 162 FIGURE 8:1 FY 2019 SCRIPPS SUBSIDIZED HEALTH DISTRIBUTION BY CATEGORY $3,545,552 SUBSIDIZED HEALTH SERVICES Subsidized health services are clinical programs that are provided despite a financial loss so significant that negative margins remain after removing the effect of charity care, bad debt, and Medi -Cal shortfalls.

This figure reflects the cost associated with providing community health improvement activities, including salaries, materials and supplies, minus billable revenue. The section below highlights some of Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego and Mercy Clinic FY19 community health achievements. SCRIPPS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH A-VISIONS VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAM The innovative A -Visions Vocational Training Program at the San Diego campus helps prepare mental health patients for volunteer and employment opportunities by exposing them to a variety of work activities and training. The total expense for the A -Visions program for FY19 was $147,296,150. Since its inception, 611 inquiries have come in, 165 of these resulted in qualified candidates with 100 volunteers and 54 employees thus far. Currently, there are a total of 23 active candidates: 22 employees and one volunteer who participate in this supportive employment program. The average length of employment for the 54 employees is 5.6 years , with a range of 2 months to 14.7 years. The current paid employees have been employed between 1.9 years to 12.6 years, with the average length of employment being 7 years. Behavioral Health Services at Scripps Mercy Hospital, in partnership with the San Diego chapter of Mental Health of America established the A -Visons Vocational Training Program (social rehabilitation and prevocational services for people living with mental illness) to help decrease the stigma of mental illness and offer volunteer and employment opportunities to persons with mental illness. This supportive employment program provides vocational training for people receiving mental health treatment, potentially leading to greater independence. This year, Behavioral Health Services continued participating in the A -Visions program. 2020 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 170 A-Visions participants have been employed on a per -diem basis by Scripps in Environmental Services, Food Services and clerical support for Health and Information Services, Emergency Services, Nursing Research, Hum an Resources, Access, Behavioral Health, Credentialing, Labor and Delivery, Laboratory, Medical Staffing, Performance Improvement, Spiritual Care and Palliative Care Services. Paid A -Visions candidates typically limit their work to eight hours per week, wh ich allows them to maintain eligibility for their disability benefits, medications and ongoing behavioral healthcare that supports their work. OPIOID STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM (OSP) AND BRIDGE PROGRAM According to the CDC, anyone who takes prescription opioids can become addicted to them, and one in four on long- term opioid therapy struggles with addiction. In San Diego, the rate of discharge from emergency departments for chronic substance use increased by 559% from 2014 to 2016, and the rates of ED discharges for acute substance use rose as well. Heavy alcohol consumption is also a problem in San Diego, with nearly 20% of all adults ages 18 and older self -reporting excessive alcohol use. The Opioid S tewardship Program (OSP) at Scripps is combatting this national epidemic by working with physicians to decrease the number of opioids prescribed to patients and educating patients on pain management. The program has established prescribing standards for opioids, resulting in a 25 percent reduction in the number of opioid pills per prescription at Scripps hospitals and outpatient centers in 2018. Scripps also has opened three drug take- back kiosks at its on -site pharmacies, offering patients year - round acces s to dispose of unused, unneeded or outdated medications. The Opioid Stewardship Program (OSP) at each Scripps Mercy campus received grants from two different state organizations \u2014the California Bridge Program and the Medication Assisted Treatment Access Points Project. California Bridge Program Scripps received more than $435,000 of state grants from the California Bridge Program and the Center at Sierra Health Foundation to remove barriers to identifying and treating patients with opioid use disorder and provide Medication- Assisted Treatment (MAT). Scripps actively promotes MAT access for patients in the form of buprenorphine. The Bridge Program aims to help hospitals and health centers expand patient access to treatment for opioid use disorder, including o n-the-spot medical treatment and coordinated outpatient care. As part of the grant, Scripps now has Bridge counselors at both Mercy campuses to help patients with opioid addiction. Bridge counselors are 2020 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 171 certified through the California Consortium of Addict ion Programs and Professionals or the California Association for Drug/Alcohol Educators. They meet patients in the emergency department and other inpatient areas of both Scripps Mercy campuses to provide rapid evidence -based medication- assisted treatment. They also connect patients directly to continued treatment in the community. In the first ten months, Scripps identified more than 300 MAT -eligible patients and treated more than 160 patients. Out of the 160 patients treated 210 accepted linkage to outpat ient MAT services. The California Bridge grant also enabled Scripps to hire Substance Use Disorder Nursed (SUDS) to facilitate treatment and entry into a community -based MAT program. Scripps deploys specialized nurses certified in addiction to see patient s at their bedside and work closely with the patient's entire health care team in facilitating a safe detox treatment while hospitalized. They identify patients who are at risk or are currently experiencing withdrawal from alcohol and other addictive subst ances. Substance Use Disorder Service (SUDS) nurses evaluate patients who meet certain criteria and work directly with the nurse and physician to ensure the patient is adequately medicated in order to control symptoms of withdrawal. SUDS nurses at Scripps function in a proactive and reactive role at all Scripps hospitals and collaborate with community resources, including Family Health Centers of San Diego to provide MAT, McAllister Institute for detox beds and the Betty Ford Center for outpatient care. PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION AND HEALTH RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS Quality health care is highly dependent upon health education systems and medical research programs. Without the ability to train and inspire a new generation of health care providers, or to offer continuing education to existing health care professionals, the quality of health care would be greatly diminished. Medical research also plays an important role in improving the community's overall health by developing new and innovative treatments. Each year, Scripps Mercy Hospital (San Diego Campus, Chula Vista Campus and Mercy Clinic) allocate resources to advance health care services through clinical 2020 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 172 research and medical education. To enhance service delivery and treatment practices for San Diego County, Scripps Mercy Hospital (San Diego Campus, Chula Vista Campus and Mercy Clinic) invested $ 11,473,19654 in professional training programs and health res earch during Fiscal Year 201 9 (October 2018 to September 2019). The section below highlights the activities for Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego Campus. GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION (GME) PROGRAM Scripps Mercy Hospital is a major teaching hospital with the longest existing medical education program in San Diego County.

There are 18 Kaiser Emergency Medicine residents who do some of their training at Scripps Mercy Hospital. In 2006, the Internal Medicine Program at Scripps Mercy Hospital became one of 17 programs nationwide to be invited to participate in a multiyear educational innovation project, linking measurable improvements in resident education to measurable improvements in patient care. The educational innovation project program continues to produce high quality research resulting in peer -reviewe d publications in the areas of cardiovascular limited ultrasound examination; teaching cost -effective medicine to residents; employing ACGME milestones to evaluate r esident readiness for indirect supervision in the ambulatory environmen t; and team training to enhance family communication in the intensive care unit, among many other projects. In 2008, Scripps Mercy Hospital became the sponsor for the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education- Accredited Palliative Care Fellowship provided by San Diego Hospice and the Institute for Palliative Care. The program provides a palliative care se rvice for inpatients and outpatients at Scripps Mercy Hospital. In 2015, the sponsorship of the program transitioned to UCSD. 54 Reflects clinical research as well a professional education for non- Scripps employees, nursing resource development and other health care professional education.

MAKING A FINANCIAL COMMITMENT During FY19, Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute devoted $200,555 to community benefit programs, including uncompensated health care, community health services, professional education and health research. The programs offered by Scripps Whittier emphasize community based prevention efforts and use innovative approaches to reach residents at greater risk for health problems. The diabetes epidemic permeates every facet of our community. The percentage of individuals entering hospitals with diabetes is rising, the number of children developing diabetes is growing, and larger number s of people are experiencing complications from diabetes, such as renal failure and heart disease, at an earlier age. Developing unique and innovative clinical programs and community -based research is urgently needed to combat this epidemic. The diabetes and obesity epidemic have a disproportionate impact on low -income ethnic groups, yet there is little research demonstrating clinically and cost -effective care and treatment models for these populations. Diabetes leads to school and work absenteeism , elevated hospitalization rates, frequent emergency room visits, permanent physical disabilities and sometimes death. Diabetes is an important health need because of its prevalence, its impact on morbidity and mortality, and its preventability. Diabetes is a major cause of heart disease and stroke and an analysis of mortality data for San Diego County found that in 2016 'Diabetes mellitus' was the seventh leading cau se of death. The percentage of adults aged 20 and older who have ever been diagnosed with diabetes was 9.4% in 2017 in San Diego County and has been steadily rising since 2005 according to the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Type 2 diabetes is an important target for intervention because hospitalizations du e to diabetes related complications are potentially preventable with proper management and a healthy lifestyle More than 1 out of 3 adults have prediabetes and 15 -30% of those with prediabetes will develop Type 2 diabetes within 5 years. This is especially true in the South Bay 2020 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 201 communities in San Diego. Specifically, the city of Chula Vista is home to 26,000 Latinos with diagnosed diabetes and thousands mor e who are undiagnosed, have prediabetes and are at high risk of developing diabetes. PROJECT DULCE MODEL , 23 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE The key element s of Project Dulce are m ultidisciplinary clinical teams and peer educators ( Promotor es) who work together to improve health and empower patients. This model has improved clinical outcomes for glucose, blood pressure and LDL- C. It has improved behavior outcomes and patient satisfaction and l owered costs to the health system through fewer ER visits and hospitalizations. Over 35,000 individuals have been treated in San Diego alone.57 57 Philis -Tsimikas A, et al. Community Created 2012; 30; 4; 156- A. et al.

This section highlights some of Scripps system wide FY19 community health services achievements. SCRIPPS HEALTH COMMUNITY BENEFIT (CB) FUND In FY 19, Scripps Health continued to deepen its commitment to philanthropy with the Community Benefit Fund. Over the course of the year, it awarded $ 220,5 00 in community grants to programs throughout San Diego. Scripps awarded four grants ranging from $10,000 to $120,000 each. The projects that received funding address some of San Diego's County's high- priority health needs. The goal is to improve access to vital health care services for a variety of at -risk populations, including the homeless, economically disadvantaged, mentally ill and others. Since the Community Benefit Fund began, Scripps has awarded $3. 9 million dollars. P rograms funded during Fiscal Year 2019 include: 2-1-1 HEALTH CARE NAVIGATION PROGRAM Locally, 2- 1-1 San Diego was launched in June 2005 as a multilingual and confidential service committed to providing 24/7 access. There was an overwhelming need for a dependable service to help people navigate today's complex health care system. Scripps He alth has been a longtime supporter of 2- 1-1 San Diego's Health Navigation Program which creates a record for every person who calls, in order to provide a service that navigates clients through different referrals and tracks their success toward achieving improved social determinants of health. All 2- 1-1 staff are trained to identify individuals who are in need of care coordination services, particularly individuals who are having difficulties managing their chronic health conditions. Health Navigators are trained to determine client risk using the Risk Rating Scale (RRS). The RRS determines 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 223 a client's status ranging from \"In Crisis\" to \"Thriving\" using social determinants of health such as housing, nutrition, primary care and health m anagement. Health Navig ators evaluate on the following to determine whether a client has decreased in vulnerability for health management: Understanding of prescription medication: Does the client understand how and when to take their medicine and do they understand the use/importance of each medication? Health Condition Management: Does the client understand the illness/disease that they have been diagnosed with, what their prognosis is, and what they need to do in order to remain healthy? Health Insurance/Medical Home: Does the client have health insurance, and do they know how to utilize it? Does the client have a primary care doctor and/or specialist that they see, and do they know how to make appointments with each? Does the client know in what situation they should make an appointment with their Primary Care Physician vs. going to an Emergency Room for an immediate medical need? Transportation: Does the client have the means to get to their doctor's appointments? During this grant period 2- 1-1 provided care coordination services to 576 clients with complex chronic conditions. Clients decreased vulnerability in the following social determinants of health: housing, nutrition, primary care, and health management by 67%. Clients also reported feeling better to manage their health condition by 71% increase. 2- 1-1 Health Navigators provided individualized needs assessments, case planning, information, education and referrals and provided ongoing client contact and progress checks via phone over a period of time relevant to the client's needs to check on and document client progress . CATHOLIC CHARITIES Funding was awarded to provide short -term emergency shelter for medically fragile, homeless patients being discharged from Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego and Chula Vista campuses . Case management and shelter are provided for previously homeless patients discharged from Scripps Mercy Hospital who no longer require hospital care but still need a short -term, supportive environment. Patients demonstrating a readiness for change are assisted with one week in a hotel along with food and bus fare to pursue a case plan. The focus of the case management is to stabilize the client by helping them connect to more permanent income sources, housing and ongoing support for self -2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 224 reliance. The goal of this partnership is to reduce the incidence of ER recidivism and improve quality of life for the patients. CONSUMER CENTER FOR HEALTH EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY (CCHEA) Funding provides low -income, uninsured and behavioral health patients who need assistance obtaining health care benefits, SSI and related services, while simultaneously reducing uncom pensated care expenses . This project provides advocacy services for time -intensive government benefit cases. CANCER /ONCOLOGY In 2016 cancer was the leading cause of death in San Diego County, responsible for 24.1 percent of deaths. There were 5,096 deaths due to cancer (all sites) and an age- adjusted death rate of 146.6 deaths per 100,000 population.59 In response to this serious health concern, Scripps has developed a series of prevention and wellness program s to educate people on the importance of early detection and treatment for some of the most common forms of cancer. During F iscal Year 2018 , Scripps engaged in the following cancer programs and activities. AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY (ACS) MAKING STRIDES AGAINST BREAST CANCER Scripps Health participates in this fundraising event to raise money for breast cancer research.

Retrieved from the World Wide Web. http://www.hasdic.org/chna.htm 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 226 DISASTER PREPAREDNESS COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND EDUCATION Having the ability to provide emergency services for those injured in a local disaster, while continuing to care for hospitalized patients, is a critical community need. Our employees' connection to our Missio n is apparent ever y day \u2014including during times of crisis. Following the terrorist attack s of September 11, 2001, Scripps developed a system wide disaster preparedness program. As part of this effort , Scripps created the volunteer Scripps Medical Response T eam (SMRT). SCRIPPS MEDICAL RESPONSE TEAM (SMRT) Scripps maintains active readiness for the Scripps Medical Response Team (SMRT). The SMRT is available to deploy when the State of California Emergency Medical System Authority activates the California Medical Assistance Team, and requests team augmentation to respond to an active event like a wildfire or earthquake where medical assistance is needed in the affected area(s). SMRT includes clinical staff and others from across the organization ready to mobilize during times of crisis to provide care where it's needed. Currently, the team has 76 active members, plus hundreds of other employees who have joined a reserve list to volunteer their services. The team has responded to numerous local, national and international emergencies. This genuine response in times of need sends a powerful message about the organization's dedication to be helping our community and beyond. The following is an example of SMRT in action: CAMP FIRE DEVASTATION When the Camp Fire devastated Northern California, Scripps stood ready to help. In support of Camp Fire evacuees, collaborating with the California Medical Assistance Team and Emergency Medical Services Authority, Scripps deployed three re sponse teams to Chico, C alifornia, each for approximately a week. The nursing and logistics teams provided medical care at area evacuation centers, as well as logistical and administrative support. When the Camp Fire destroyed Paradise, California a nd surrounding areas, more than 20,000 residents were directly impacted\u2014many losing their homes and possessions. In August 2019, Scripps received HealthTrust's most esteemed honor, the Member Recognition Award, which acknowledges excellence in supporting providers, patients and communi ties. Scripps was honored in the category of Social Stewardship for deploying volunteer medical response teams and providing non- clinical support to 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 227 thousands of residents displaced by the Camp Fire in Paradise, California. Among more than 1,500 hospitals and health systems, Scripps was one of only five to receive the Member Recognition Award this year. SAN DIEGO COUNTY NATIONAL COMMUNITY SUPPORT AND OUTREACH EDUCATION Scripps Health maximizes awareness and encourages participation in disaster preparedness activities to affect change at the community level. Scripps participated in San Diego County and State of California advisory groups to plan, implement and evaluate key disaster preparedness response plans and exercises. Scripps is an advisor to San Diego County for federal and state grant development and planning. Scripps Health participated in San Diego County Healthcare Disaster Coalition and State of California advisory groups to plan, implement and evaluate key disaster preparedness response plans and exercises. Scripps Health is also an active member in the Nat ional Hospital Incident Command (HICS) Advisory Committee , and currently working on the review/revision of HICS . In FY 19, Scripps participated in the following: SAN DIEGO COUNTY MEDICAL & HEALTH FULL SCALE EXERCISE On May 7, 2019 Scripps Health participated in the San Diego Operational Area Full Scale Exercise. The exercise included the activation of Scripps Health's Incident Command Centers, Emergency Medical Services, Public Health Preparedness & Response, SD County Department Operations and Medical Operations Centers, medical facilities, local government jurisdictions, and health and medical community partners. SAN DIEGO COUNTY COALITION SURGE TEST NO NOTICE EXERCISE June 21, 201 9 Scripps Health participated in the no notice evacuation s cenario exercise. The Coalition Surge Test used an evacuation scenario to help health care coalitions assess how well their members can work together to respond t o a sudden health care crisis. It was designed to test a coalition's functional surge capacity and to identify gaps in surge planning. Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego was the chosen hospital to evacuate and the other four hospitals prepared to receive evacuated patients. CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE MEDIC AL & HEALTH FULL SCALE EXERCISE (SWMHE) November 15, 2018 Statewide Medical & Health Full Scale Exercise. The 2018 SWMHE program was a progressive exercise program comprised of a series of 2020 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 228 training exercises tied to a set of common program priorities. The scenario was an Influenza Pandemic. SAN DIEGO COUNTY PRESCRIPTION TAKE BACK DAY Prescription drug abuse is currently being reported by law enforcement agencies across the country as their greatest threat. In addition, unsafe disposal of prescription medications is costly to the environment . The \" Safe Prescription Drug Drop- Off\" pilot program is available to the community. Residents can drop off unused or expired prescriptions \u2014no questions asked. Police officers check the boxes daily, coll ect the contents and prepare for disposal that is eco- friendly and in accordance with Federal and State laws. This program not only helps to protect the environment, it can also deter the usage of prescription drugs by unintended parties \u2014including young people facing peer pressure and new ways to \"get high.\" The San Diego Police Department constantly strives to be proactive in enhancing public safety and saving lives. Scripps has become the first health care provider in the region to offer -year-round access to safe, free disposal of unused and outdated prescription medications. Three drug take- back kiosks were opened adjacent to on- site ambulatory pharmacies at Scripps Mercy San Diego, Scripps Green and Scripps Encinitas. These drug take- back kiosks are par t of the Scripps Opioid stewardship Program, which aims to reduce the use of opioids and to help prevent patients from becoming dependent on these useful but potent pain reducing medications. Scripps Health participated in this initiative on October 27, 2018 and May 19, 2019 with four hospital/clinic sites participating.

Without the ability to train and inspire a new generation of health care providers, or offer continuing education to existing health care professionals, the quality of health care would be greatly diminished. Medical research also plays an important role in improving the community's overall health by developing new and innovative treatments. Each year, resources are allocated by Scripps System wide programs and services to advance health care services through professional health education programs and research. To enhance service delivery and treatment practices for San Diego County; $1,364,189 61 was invested by Scripps System wide programs and services in professional training and health research programs during Fiscal Year 2019 (October 2018 to September 201 9). This section highlights some of Scripps System wide professional education and research activities . SCRIPPS HIGH SCHOOL EXPLORATION PROGRAM AND HEALTH AND SCIENCE PIPELINE INITIATIVE (HASPI) Launched by Scripps Health, the program reaches out to young people to pique their interest on health care occupations in dire need of recruits. From the emergency room to surgery, the s tudents rotate through numerous departments, exploring career options and learning life lessons about health and healing along the way. During FY 19, Scripps Health partnered with HASPI to provide continuing education internships for their students. The program offered five-week internships, in which 25 students rotated through clinical and non- clinical departments to learn about health care. In addition, Young Leaders in Healthcare participants were eligible for the five -week summer program. 61 Reflects clinical research as well as professional education for non- Scripps employees, nursing resource development and other health care professional education.

The assessment is adopted for the hospital facility by an authorized body of the hospital facility. Community H ealth Needs - those requisites for improvement or maintenance of health status in the community. Cost A ccounting - Cost accounting systems generally provide the most accurate portra yal of the true cost of community benefit activities. Measurement of the costs associated with specific activities and programs to provide information meaningful to management. For example, cost accounting is used to determine the amount of an organization's total expense that reasonably can be attributed to community benefit, to 2020 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 234 assign indirect (overhead) expense to the direct cost of a program, and to estimate the cost associated with serving a subset of patients, such as Medicaid recipients. Direct C osts - \"Direct costs\" means salaries and benefits, supplies, and other expenses directly related to the actual conduct of each activity or program. Direct Offsetting Revenue - Revenue from the activity during the year that offsets the total community benefit expense of that activity. Includes any revenue generated by the activity or program, such as reimbursement for services provided to program patients.

These fees are included in community benefit accounting as Medicaid cost, and any revenues they yield also included in Medicaid \"direct offsetting revenue\". Implementation S trategy - the written document that describes the hospital facility's strategy t o meet the community health needs identified through the hospital facility's Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) . In-Kind C ontributions - Donations made (or received) using resources that are not legal tender (e.g., cash, checks, credit cards). Donati ons of supplies (e.g., pharmaceuticals), equipment, or staff time that benefits another organization are examples of in- kind contributions. In community benefit accounting, in- kind contributions are valued fairly. For example, the hospital donates a two- year old computer to a community clinic. The community benefit expense would be $1,000 if the computer was purchased for $3,000 and after two years of use it has depreciated to a value on the books of the hospital of $1,000. 2020 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 235 In-Lieu of Funds - Funds used for unfunded or under -funded patients and their post - discharge needs. Funds are used for board and care, skilled nursing facilities, long- term acute care, and home health. In addition funds are also used for medications, equipment, and transportation serv ices.

Costs for medical residents and interns may be included as health professions educations costs. Calculations based on total program expense. Restricted Contributions (Grants) - Donations, gifts, bequests and other transfers of money or property made by a donor or grantor that has stipulated a temporary or permanent use for the resources provided. Donors or grantors provide restricted contributions with the intent of supporting a particular activity or program. Restrictions generally are stated in writing by the donor or grantor when they make a gift or grant. Subsidized Health S ervices - Patient care services the organization provides despite a financial loss, (even) after removing the effects of charity care and Medi -Cal shortfalls (and bad debt). Clinical programs provided at a loss because they are needed by the community. The service meets an identified community need if it is reasonable to conclude that if the organization no longer offered the s ervice, the service would be unavailable in the community, the community's capacity to provide the service would be below the community's need, or the service would become the responsibility of government or another tax -exempt organization. Example of such services are: inpatient psychiatric units, satellite clinics serving low -income communities and burn units. 2020 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 236 Total Community Benefit E xpense - Total gross expense of the activity incurred during the year. Uncompensated Health C are - Includes charity, under -reimbursed care and bad debt. Shortfalls are derived using the payer based cost allocation methodology.

During fiscal year 2019, Scripps contributed $404,234,464 to uncompensated health care, $14,767,038 in charity care, $377,559,072 in Medi -Cal and Medicare shortfall, and $11,908,354 in bad debt. Schedule H Methodology \u2014 Schedule H requires the uncompensated care to be divided into four categories: Charity care, under -reimbursed Medi -Cal and Other Means - Tested Government Programs, Bad Debt, and under -reimbursed Medicare. Bad debt and Medicare shortfalls are reportable under the Schedule H guidelines but do not count towards the community benefit totals. Thus, the categories are reported in a specific order/hierarchy. Charity Care and under -reimbur sed Medi -Cal and Other Means -Tested Government Programs are counted first. Charity Care Methodology \u2014 Uncompensated cost is estimated by appl ying ratio- cost-to-charge (RCC) percentages for the hospital to the gross charity adjustments. The following costs are excluded: Community health services, professional education and research, and expenses excluded in the Medicare cost report. Traditional Charity Care is included in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 990 Schedule H Part I Line 7a. Medi -Cal Shortfall \u2014 The shortfall is derived by computing operating margin at the patient level and summarizing the patients with Medi -Cal, Medi -Cal HMO. Operating margin is defined as net revenue less all variable, fixed, and overhead costs. Profitability is estimated a s follows: Net revenue is equivalent to payments plus an estimation of the account balance for all open accounts, plus revenue from uncompensated care pools including Medi -Cal DSH. Cost is derived using the relative value allocation methodology per the Cha nge Health Care HPM system. The following costs are excluded: Charity adjustments at cost for Medi -Cal patients, community health services, professional education and research, and expenses excluded in the Medicare cost report. These costs are included in the IRS Form 99 0 schedule H Part I Line 7b. In the State of California the Medicaid program is called Medi -Cal. Medicare and Medicare HMO Hospitals \u2014 Shortfall is derived by computing operating margin at the patient level and summarizing the patients with Medicare and Medicare Senior primary insurance carriers. Operating margin is defined as net revenue 2020 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 238 less all variable, fixed, and overhead costs. Profitability is estimated as follows: net revenue is equivalent to payments plus an estimation of the capitation account balance for all open accounts, plus other revenue. Cost is derived using the relative value allocation methodology per the Change Health Care HPM c ost accounting system. These costs are included in the IRS Form 990 Schedule H Part III Section B. Bad Debt Methodology \u2014 Uncompensated cost is estimated by applying ratio- cost- to-charge (RCC) percentages for the hospital to the gross bad debt adjustments less recoveries. The following costs are excluded: Bad debt adjustments at cost for Medi -Cal and CMS patients, community health services, professional education and research, and expenses excluded in the Medicare cost report. These costs are included in t he IRS Form 990 Schedule H Part III Section A. Shortfall Methodology Clinics \u2014 Shortfall is derived by computing operating margin at the patient level and summarizing the patients with Medicare and Medicare Senior primary insurance carriers.

Cost is derived using the relative value allocation methodology per the Change Health Care HPM cost accounting system. These costs are included in the IRS Form 990 Schedule H Part III Section B. Hospital Provider Fee Program The State of California enacted legislation for a hospital fee program to fund certain Medi -Cal coverage expansions. The program charges hospitals a quality assurance fee that is used to obtain federal matching funds for Medi -Cal with the proceeds redistributed as supplemental payments to California hospitals that treat Medi -Cal patients. The provider fee program that had activity in 2018 and 2019 was the 30- month provider fee program covering the period from January 1, 2017, through June 30, 2019. Historically, the Organization's policy was to record revenue and expense upon approval of the program. During 2018, the organization determined that, for all provider fee programs through June 30, 2019, the supplemental payments met all criteria related to revenue recognition and the quality assistance fees are both probable and estimable. Accordingly, all related supplemental payments have been recognized as revenue and related quality assurance fees have been recognized as expense as of September 30, 2019 and 2018. Federal and state payments received from these programs are included as provider fee revenue in total patient service revenue, and fees or payable to the state and California Heath Foundation and Trust (CHFT) are included in provider fee ex pense 2020 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 239 in operating expenses. The provider fee programs beginning July 1, 2019, has not yet been approved by CMS, and therefore, no amounts have been recognized for the program during the three months ended September 30, 2019. Provider f ee program revenue recorded for the years ended September 30 is summarized below (in thousands): 2019 2018 Provider fee revenue $ 93,107 $ 241,538 from provider fee $ 19,737 $ 55,253 2020 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 240 APPENDIX C 2020 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 241 APPENDIX D SAN DIEGO COUNTY HHSA GEOGRAPHIC SERVICES REGIONS62 Source: County of San Diego: https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/dam/sdc/live_well_san_diego/indicators/Map_and_Re gional_Data.pdf 62 These regions have been designated by the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) for the purpose of service delivery.

In 1994, California legislators passed Senate Bill 697 (SB 697), which requires all private not -for-profit hospitals in the state to conduct a CHNA every three years. Since 1994, these programs have been created based on an assessment of needs identified through hospital data, community input, and major trends. Previous collaborations among not-for-profit hospitals, healthcare systems, and other community partners have resulted in numerous well regarded Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNA) reports. Informatio n is gathered through the CHNA for the purposes of reporting community benefit, developing strategic plans, creating annual reports, providing input on legislative decisions, and informing the general community of health issues and trends. Federal Requirem ents In 2010, Congress added several new requirements for hospital organizations to maintain federal income tax exempt status under Section 501 (r) of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\") as part of the Affordable Care Act. One of the requirements set fo rth in Section 501 (r) of the Code is for each hospital organization to conduct a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) at least once every three tax years. The requirement to conduct a CHNA applies to Scripps Health, which is a health system that operates four hospital facilities. In addition, Scripps Health must adopt a triennial Implementation Plan which is a separate written document to address certain community heal th needs identified in the CHNA. Additional information on the ACA requirements for nonprofit hospitals can be found at www.irs.gov , keyword: \"Charitable Organizations\". 2020 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 243 Required Components of the Community Health Needs Assessment Per IRS requirements, (Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.501 (r) -3(b) (6) (i)) the f ollowing are components the CHNA must include: A description of the community served by the health system and how it was determined A description of the processes and methods used to conduct the assessment A description of how the hospital organization took into account input from persons who represent the broad interests of the community served by the hospital facility Prioritized description of all of the community health needs identified through the CHNA, as well as a description of the process and criteria used in prioritizing such health needs. A description of the existing health care facilities and other resources with the community available to meet the community health needs identified in the CHNA. An evaluation of the impact of any actions that wer e taken since the hospital finished conducting its immediately preceding CHNA to address the significant health needs identified in the prior CHNA. Make the CHNA widely available to the public via the hospital's website. Required Components of the Implementation Strategy Provisions in the Affordable Care Act permit a hospital facility that adopts a joint CHNA report to also adopt a joint implementation strategy which, with respect to each significant health need identified through the joint CHNA, either des cribes how one or more collaborating facilities plan to address the health need or identifies the health need as one collaborating facilities do not intend to address. The join implementation strategy adopted for the hospital facility must: (Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.501 (r) -3(c) (4). Meet community health needs identified in the CHNA. Describe any needs identified in the CHNA that are not being addressed and the reasons for not addressing them Be clearly identified as applying to the hospital facility Clearly ident ify the hospital facility's particular roles and responsibilities in taking the actions described in the implementation strategy, and the programs and resources the hospital facility plans to commit to such actions Include a summary or other tool that helps the reader easily locate those portions of the joint implementation strategy that relates to the hospital facility. 2020 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 244 APPENDIX F SCRIPPS HEALTHCARE PARTICIPATION IN COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS The list below highlights Scripps community partners and coalitions in Fiscal Year 2019.
