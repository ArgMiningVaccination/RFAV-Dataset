Four of the st udents from this class advanced the research into the Fall Clinic Report. Lexis\u00ae Semantic Search Semantic search uses the science of meaning in lan guage (\"semantics\") to produce highly relevant search results. While semantic search engines are not uncommon, most contain limitations - including lack of transparency and user control - which can ultimately undermine the overall value of results. For example, they typically do not show precisely how search results are generated and the user must simply trust that the right relevance between the origin al query and the semantic application are, in fact, appropriate to the intent of the searcher. http://www .lexisnexis.com/semantic-search-1/ LANL HIV/SIV Vaccine Trials Database We used the HIV/SIV Vaccine Trials Database was developed as a tool for compilation, search and comparison of published studies on SIV, HIV and SHIV vaccine trials in nonhum an primates for purposes of brainstorming and keyword identification. LANLe used a set of criteria to scan Pubmed for relevant studies to enter into the database. In selecting stud ies for entry, priority was given to recently published studies in journals generally regarded as the primary source of information pertaining to HIV and SIV vaccine research in nonhuman primates. In most cases, they give priority to ch allenge studies, where the animals received a live virus to measure the 'efficacy' of the immunogen(s) inoculat ed during the course of the investigation. http://www.hiv.lan l.gov/cgibin/vaccine/search /adjuvant_search.cgi?search_string=&process=Go Added Position: Science & Technology Director Due to the technical complexity of the subject, we added a Ph.D. level student [CTA] assigned to facilitatate the technical capacity of the team.

As research has pr ogressed towards a better understanding of the virology, pathogenesis and immunological properties of HIV, vaccine designs that incorporate adjuvants in the vaccine have em erged as viable candidates for de veloping effective preventative treatments for HIV. Adjuvant additions to a vaccines enhance both antibody and cell-mediated immune responses to antigens without the require d multiple boots typical of these inoculations. An immunologic adjuvant is any substance that when incorporated into a vaccine formulation acts generally to accelerate, prol ong, or enhance the quality of specific immune responses to vaccine antigens. The purpose of this patent landscape study was to search, identify and categorize patent documents that are relevant to the research, developm ent and distribution of adjuvants for HIV vaccines. 1 Ross P.

Rather, it is an informational resource to facilitate a better unders tanding of the internatio nal patent literature landscape with regard to adjuvant s applicable to HIV vaccines. This report is not a list of all potentially rele vant patents. It is not a Freedom to Operate (FTO) opinion, but instead constitutes an educationa l analysis of potentially relevant material. While the search engines utilized in this proj ect are extensive, it is likely that the entire spectrum of patents was not obtained utilizing the various search strategies and methods articulated herein. Therefore, it is not the suppositi on of this team that all relevant patents were discovered during the creati on of this report. As the team members are not experts in the fi eld of adjuvants applicable to HIV vaccines, it is also highly possible that the categorization of the patents found and coded are incomplete. The team cannot guarantee that the patents discov ered were evaluated at the level of expert scientific sophistication. Due to the limited time frame (15 weeks) and press of business imposed upon this project, the number of patents evaluated was establishe d by this constrained scheduled, the overall semester demands, and the general press of busine ss. As such, additional patents may have been available for evaluation but without the necessary time within which to consider them they may not have been considered. Again, this report is not a Free dom to Operate (FTO) opinion. It is an educational report. 9I. About the Technology 1. Introduction of HIV vaccine1,2 Since the discovery of Autoimmune Defici ency Syndrome (AIDS) in 1981, a safe and effective vaccine has been sought for the Huma n Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). An ideal HIV vaccine will generate adaptive immune responses sufficient to completely clear the virus during early infection, producing steriliz ing immunity. However, HIV is highly mutagenic, and researchers still lack complete knowledge of imm une correlates of protect ion to AIDS. An HIV vaccine that achieves sterilizi ng immunity by producing a potent neutralizing antibody response is still not available. Several types of vaccines against HIV have b een developed during the past three decades including (1) Live attenuated vaccines, (2) Inactivated vaccines, (3) Virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines, (4) Envelop glycoprotein vaccines, (5 ) Peptide vaccines, and (6) Naked DNA and live recombinant vaccines. A combination of different types of vaccines or different vial vectors in a prime-boost regimen, multiple immunizations requiri ng the vaccine to be successful, 3 would increase the immunogenicity of the vaccine strategy, such as using DNA vacci ne for priming and following by an Adenovirus vaccine. 1.A Live Attenuated vacci ne and inactivated vaccines HIV vaccines have been tested in humans since the late 1980's. A common goal of current HIV vaccines is to induce cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses. A CTL-based vaccine can limit viral replication so as to increase disease free infected individuals and decrease the spread of AIDS. One of the earliest approaches of HIV vaccines is the attenuated live virus vaccine, such as vaccinia virus or poxvirus vaccine. The v accinia virus vaccines induced HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses. Weak CD8+ CTL responses co uld also be generated when using a prime-boost combination of vaccinia virus and recombinant g p120 protein vaccines. However, these viruses caused serious diseases in healthy testers. Thereaf ter, replication-deficient vectors, because of safety concerns, have replaced the replication- competent vaccinia vectors. These replication- deficient vectors have been evaluated in human trials but no positive results have occurred. Vaccinia virus recombinants were tested in prime-boost combination with recombinant gp120 vaccine in several trials. For example, a research plan for a prime-boost vaccination approach of canarypox vector priming and gp120 boosting was performed by HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) during 2001 and 2002. The result showed that the antigen productions in human cells increased but the level of CD 8+ T cell responses was too low to prove a 1 Paul Spearman, Current Progress in the Development of HIV Vaccines , 12 C URRENT PHARM .

HVTN later abandoned the phase III trial and further study.4 More studies on live vector-based vaccines c ontinue. Scientists have not abandonded this approach because live vectors can generate stro ng and long-lasting cellular immune responses. However, researchers have to consider the ba lance between virus safe ty and the capacity to generate immune response. Wild-type viruses are no longer acceptable due to the level of toxicity. Most of these live vector approaches are highly attenuated or are viral vector systems that are competent for only a sing le round of infection in the host. There are several types of live vector-based HIV vaccines used in current human trials including adenovirus vaccine, poxvirus vaccine, alphavirus vector vaccine, adeno-associated virus (AAV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSU )- based HIV vaccine and poliovirus vector vaccine.5 Currently, none of these vaccin es show viable results. The adenovirus vaccine is the leading C TL vaccine candidate. It can produce potent cellular immune responses but it will not wo rk for people already immunized from the adenovirus. Almost one-third of North American volunteer s have preexisting immunity for adenovirus. 6 The other live vector vaccines have co mmon problems of high production cost, low stability and limited serotypes. 1.B DNA vaccines, Peptide vac cines and Glycoprotein vaccines Other current HIV vaccine approaches includ e DNA, peptide and glycoprotein vaccines. Usually these vaccines are not used in isolation; they instead would be arranged in a prime boost regime such as DNA prime and protein boost.7 The primary goal for these vaccine approaches is to elicit HIV-specific CD8+ CTL responses a nd to generate a population of supportive HIV- specific CD4+ T cells. 1.B.1 Glycoprotein vaccines There are two major approaches for HIV vaccines in the early study, the first is the attenuated live viral vaccine, and the other is the monomeric gp120-based vaccine. The monomic gp120-based vaccine was safe and could generate neutralizing antibodies to gp120 protein. Two gp120 subunit vaccines were valued in a phase II tr ial in the USA and one of which was tested in a phase III trials in Thailand. The second vacc ine is a monomeric gp120 vaccine with alum (VaxGen) as an adjuvant.8 None of these trials showed a significant reduction of HIV infection after vaccination. 4 Spearman, supra note 1, at 1149 5 Id. at 1160 6 Id. at 1157 7 Id. at 1154 8 Girard et al, supra note 2, at 4067 11Further research showed this kind of vaccine behaved differently for laboratory-adapted HIV isolates and naturall y occurring HIV isolates.9 Results of two Phase III trials showed that this approach did not produce relevant antibodies in human subjects. Scientists then stopped pursing this approach. Later studies show that the monomeric gp-120- based vaccine would fail because the native structure of HIV envelope glycopr otein is in a trimeric conforma tion, not in a monomreic format. See Figure 1 below for the native conformation of the trimeric glycopro tein. The glycoprotein vaccine is then designed to generate neutra lizing antibodies against HIV virus by using the glycoprotein in its native conforma tion of the trimeric complex. Figure 1: Trimeric Conformation of the HIV gp120 Envelope Glycoprotein 10 As of yet, no positive results occurred for the trimer glycoprotein approaches; most of them are still under valuation. One appro ach using an oligomeric gp140 (gp120 with ectodomain of gp41) vaccine is being investigated at Chiron. Studies by Chiron show that a DNA prime and gp140 in MF59 adjuvant boost elic ited in rabbits and macaques. 11 conducted research on a gp140-GCN4 trimer immunogens which wa s emulsificated in 9 Spearman, supra note 1, at 1150 10 National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Structure of HIV , http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/HIVAI DS/Understanding/Biology/structure.htm (last visited Sept. 21, 2009) 11 Girard al., supra note 2, at 4067 or AS03.12 Further, Merck and unive rsity of Maryland designed another approach for glycoprotein vaccine. Th ey use covalently couple monomeric gp120 molecules to induce broadly neutralizing antibody responses.13 1.B.2 DNA vaccines DNA vaccines and peptide vaccines are two common approaches for designing a HIV vaccine. The two approaches share several common ch aracteristics: they all have great potential, they have achieved good results in animal trials and all are safe in human trials. However, studies so far have reported that these appr oaches only generate weak immune response in humans. DNA vaccines use a plasmid DNA vector to ge nerate HIV proteins or protein subunits within host cells. 14 The HIV proteins are antigens and induce immunization response against the HIV virus. The plasmid DNA vector is taken up by host cell. This might be procured by simply intramuscular injection. However, there will not be enough antigens if the cellular uptake is inefficient. Ways to improve the cellular uptak e include the use of gene guns, formulation into micro-particles and the use of adjuvants that may increase uptak e by antigen presenting cells (APCs).15 Studies show DNA vaccines for HIV can generate cellular a nd humoral immune responses. Several reports indi cated DNA vaccines elicit reasonab le levels of HIV-specific immune responses in mice and one report showed that a DNA/MVA vaccination approach provided longstanding prot ection from SHIV 89.6P. 16 However, there were no convincing conclusions resulting from human trials of DN A vaccines against HIV. Only weak CD8+ CTL responses were reported. 1.B.3 Peptide vaccines The concept of the peptide vaccine is si mple: peptides that present the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I or class II molecules as antigens are used to trigger immunization responses against HIV virus. See Figure 2. 12 Id. 13 Id. at 4068 14 Spearman, supra note 1, at 1154 15 Id. 16 Id. at 1155 13 Figure 2: MHC Molecule binds T-cell receptor and antigen17 The peptide vaccine can be designed to produce particular immunogens for a special target which may produce combinations of T-he lper and CTL epitopes representing specific conserved regions of HIV. Another advantage of peptide vaccines is that it can direct the immune response toward subdominant epitopes that may not elicit responses of viral infection or other broad immune responses. Positive results were reported in small animals. However, a human trial using a live virus pr ime/peptide boost vaccine showed only weak and transit cellular immune responses were generate d inside these healthy volunteers. How the scientists could improve the peptide-based HIV vaccines is still unclear. Several drug makers and research organizations are pursuing peptide vaccines which can induce both CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses against HIV, including Epimmune, Wy eth Vaccine, Agencie Nationale de recherch\u00e9 sur le SIDA (ANRS), US National Institute of A llergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), and Aventis Pasteur. 18 The study sponsored by NIAID and ANRS is to use synthetic lipopeptides containing HMC class I-restricted T-cell epitopes. Animal test result was great\u2014it induces strong CD8+ T-cell responses against HIV in mice and non- human primates. However, a phase II trial was po stponed due to a severe ne urological side effect on one of volunteers in US. 19 17 Mi-Hua Tao, , available at http://proj1.sinica.edu.tw/~hispj/program/doc/tao-mi-hua.pdf (last visited Sept. 22, 2009) 18 Spearman, supra note 1, at 1156 19 Girard et al., supra note 2, at 4071 142. Intro to Adjuvants The purpose of vaccination is to generate a strong and last ing immune response providing long-term protection against infection.20 However, many licensed vaccines currently induce only suboptimal immunity, requiring multiple boosts to generate a robust protective response.21 Adjuvant addition to vaccines enhances both antibody and cell-me diated immune responses to antigens without the required multiple boots typical of these inoculations.22 An immunologic adjuvant is any substance that when incorporat ed into a vaccine formulation acts generally to accelerate, prolong, or enhance the quality of sp ecific immune responses to vaccine antigens.23 Adjuvants can be used for various purposes: (1) to enhance the immunogenicity of highly purified or recombinant antigens; (2) to redu ce the amount of antigen or the number of immunizations needed for protective immunity; (3) to improve the effi cacy of vaccines in newborns, the elderly or immuno-compromised pe rsons; or (4) as antigen delivery systems for the uptake of antigens by the mucosa.24 The concept of adjuvants arose from observatio ns that an abscess at the inoculation site assisted the generation of hi gher specific antibody titers. Adjuvant activity was first demonstrated in 1926 with aluminum, when diphtheria toxoid ab sorbed to alum. Despite the discovery of many more potent adjuvants, such as Freund's complete adjuvant or lipolysaccharide, aluminum-based adjuvants remain the most prominent of the vaccine enhancers. Many of the newly discovered adjuvants have prove n to be unsuitable for human use, as they result in local and systemic toxicity and do not meet the rigorous standard s of pre-clinical or clinical trials. 25 Adjuvants have a diverse mechanism of ac tion and must be chosen for use with a particular antigen based on the responses desired. 26 Features associated with adjuvant candidates include: stability, length of sh elf life, reduction or knowledge of side effects, inexpensive production and immunological inertness.27 Administration route is also a major concern.28 There are marked differences in efficacy dependi ng on the current administration routes, such as mucosal or parenteral routes. While intrader mal or subcutaneous immunization is far more effective in stimulating immunity than the intram uscular route, due to local toxicity alum is generally only used intramuscularly.29 These features must be considered, as th ere is a risk of adverse reaction to the incorporation of an adjuvant into a vaccine. Local reactions include pain, local inflammation, swelling, injection site necros is, lymphadenopathy, granulomas, ulcers and the generation of 20 J. C. Aguilar & E. G.

Systemic reactions includ e nausea, fever, adjuva nt arthritis, uveitis, eosinophilia, allergy, organ i.e. cytokines release, immunosuppression or autoimmune diseases.30 With the increase of immunology knowledge ther e is still a surprisi ng reliance on alum- based adjuvants. 31 However, the introduction of new reco mbinant subunit and synthetic antigens in HIV, hepatitis C virus, Malaria and other dis eases will introduce new adjuvants to the clinical trial pipeline.32 New adjuvant formulations can be especially relevant for developing new vaccines against infectious agents causing pathological conditions characterized by immunodeficiency, low responde rs and high-risk groups.33 2.A HIV Vaccine Adjuvants The development of an effective Huma n Immunodeficiency Vaccine (HIV) vaccine remains a critically important yet elusive goal.34 Despite advances in preventing HIV transmission and treating chronic HIV infecti on, investigators have not been successful in developing a vaccine, reflectin g the challenge of generating e ffective antibody and T lymphocyte responses to HIV.35 Traditional vaccine technologies include live attenuated viruses, whole killed viruses and protein subunits. 36 This vaccine approach has been enor mously successful for the development of vaccines against other vi ruses, but they al l have substantial limitations in terms of their utility for HIV. Live attenuated viruses have afford ed substantial protective efficacy against Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) challenges in rhesus monkeys, but they are unlikely to be used in humans owing to significant safety concerns. In contrast, whole killed viruses and protein subunits are limited by their inability to induce broadly reactive neutrali zing antibody responses as well as by their inability to elicit CD8+ T lymphocyte responses.37 Novel strategies include vaccines co mbined with an adjuvant for delivery. 38 New vaccine strategies also include gene-deliver y technologies such as plasmid DNA vaccines and live recombinant vectors that are engineered to express HIV-1 antigens. Plasmid DNA vaccines offer considerable promise in terms of simplicit y and versatility, but multiple injections of high doses of DNA vaccines are typically required to elicit detectable immune responses in non- human primates and humans.39 Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of new 30 Id. 31 Id. at 3758-59 32 Id. at 3759 33 Id. 34 E.

A broad list of these adjuvants can be found at the Nonhuman Primate HIV/SIV Va ccine Trials Database .44 This report takes adjuvants found in litera ture and breaks them down by chemical and immunological properties to better mine the patent lite rature. Here, adjuvants have been grouped based on being Chemical Adjuvants or Immunostimulatory Adjuvants . Adjuvants found under the Chemical Adjuvant category are further separated acco rding to organic or inorganic properties. Adjuvants grouped in as Immunostimulatory Adjuvants are further separated according to endogenous, of the body, or exogeno us, having toxic or non-self properties. 3. Introduction to Chemical Adjuvant A vaccine might include an adjuvant and a carrier system to induce more effective immunity.45 Traditional live attenuated vaccines us ually contain attenuated pathogens and often are sufficiently potent to generate a st rong immune response against infection.46 Similarly, vaccines based on inactivated virus might be sufficiently without Inorganic Adjuvants bon-based compounds.47 The inorganic category c ontains a wide adjuvants, such as aluminum-based compounds, oil- in-water emulsions, and calcium phosphate gels. Due to the large array of adjuvants, each adjuvant maintains its own unique strengths and weaknesses for enhancing HIV vaccines.48 40 Barouch, supra note 36, at 615 41 Rhee & Barouch, supra note 34, at 174 42 Barouch, supra note 36, at 615 43 Morrow, M.

Alum, despite the popularity, maintains some negative drawbacks.52 In addition to a weakness in inducing re sponses, the mechanism for how alum actually functions is unknown. One hypothesis is the formation of an antigen depot at the inoculation site. Another hypothesized mechanism involves comple ment activation, or eo sinophil or macrophage activation. 53 Alums also can have negative side effects. 54 Granulomas, inflamed tissue, can form at the injection site when \"alum is administered via the subcutaneous or intradermal rather than intramuscular route.\"55 56 Other side effects ar e increased IgE producti on, allergenicity, and potential neurotoxicity due to reduced renal function.57 Alum is typically excreted through the kidneys, however a buildup can occu r if kidney function declines.58 Despite the drawbacks, however, the general lower toxicity than other adj uvant options has lead to its popularity over the past 80 years.59 3.A.2 Emulsions Emulsions are a suspension of small globules of one liquid within another liquid which will not mix.60 Most emulsions are typically oil-in-water, water-in-oil, or in some cases water-in- oil-in-water mixtures.61 Emulsions function by forming depot s at the injection sites, which enables the slow release of antigens, and also serve to stimulate antibody producing plasma cells.62 Emulsions can also be used as delivery syst ems for certain immunostimulatory adjuvants, like CpG, MPL and QS21.63 49 Id. at 3753 50 Id. at 3754 51 C.

Frequent side effects include inflammatory reactions, granulomas and ulcers at the injection site.64 However, specific emulsions have shown promise. For example, water in oil in water has been shown to be as potent as Freu nds incomplete adjuvant but more stable, less viscous and easier to administer with less resulting granulomas.65 The safety and tolerability of MF59 has been well established, since it has been included as a component of a licensed vaccine in Europe beginning in 1997. MF59 is a squalene oil-in- water emulsions that was developed without th e presence of additional immunostimulatory adjuvants. Experience has show n MF59 to be safe and well tolerated with a number of vaccines, including recombinant gp120. 66 MF59 has been shown to lead to the recruitment of antigen- presenting cells to the site of injection, and to increase the uptake by these cells of soluble antigen.67 Freunds incomplete adjuvant (FIA) is one of the oldest adjuvants used for immunization. FIA is differentiated from Freund's complete adj uvant (FCA), an extremely potent adjuvant that additionally contains heat-kil led mycobacteria. FIA produces good stimulation of humoral immunity but is less reactogenic than FCA. The main disadvantages of FIA are its relatively weak adjuvanticity, and the occurrence of possi ble side effects including abscesses, muscle indurations and granulomas at the site of injection. 68 There are currently no availabl e therapeutic vaccines against chronic infectious diseases, despite many attempts over the ye ars. Generally, the level of toxicity acceptable for an adjuvant to be used in a therapeu tic situation is likely to be higher than for a ph rophylactic vaccine for use in healthy individuals. The most widely investigated immunotherapeutic strategy against HIV is a combination of whole killed HIV virus de pleted of gp120 and combined with Fruend's incomplete adjuvant (Remune). 69 The Montanide family has also been used in trial vaccines against HIV, as has the water-in-mineral o il (Drakeol) adjuvant, be ing evaluated as an immunotherapeutic vaccine.70 71 3.A.3 Calcium Phosphate Calcium phosphate is the name given to a fa mily of minerals c ontaining calcium ions together with orthophosphates, metaphosphates or pyrophosphates and occasionally hydrogen or hydroxide ions.72 These compounds have been useful in animal vaccinations in HIV trials. 64 Aguilar & Rodriguez, supra note 39, at 3754 65 Id. at 3755 66 O'Hagan & Lavelle, supra note 61, at S118 67 McGeary et al., supra note 45, at 410 68 Id. 69 Id. 70 Aguilar & Rodriguez, supra note 39, at 3755 71 O'Hagan & Lavelle, supra note 61, at S118 72 Calcium Phosphate, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dic tionary/calcium%20phosphate (last visited Dec. 5, 2009) 19Specifically, calcium phosphate has been found to elicit antibodies r ecognizing the gp160 HIV- 1, it induction of high leve ls of circulating antibodies, most of the time without the occurrence of untowar d reactions as are observed with aluminum adjuvants of water in oil emulsions. Ca lcium phosphate adjuvant ed preparations have been commercially available in France for many y ears for the immunization of babies and adults and for hyposensitization treatments of allergic patients. Based on animal trials, calcium phosphate adjuvant show extreme promise for human anti-HIV vaccines.73 3.B Organic Adjuvants Organic adjuvants, specificall y, are adjuvants that are deri ved from or chemically contain carbon.74 a component of the mycobacterial cell wall re lated to the adjuvant as pect of peptidoglycan.75 MDP, potency as adjuvants.76 The physiological effects that have been observed from the administration of MDP include adjuvanticity, pyrogenicity and leucocytopoietic activity. 77 There have been over 300 synthetic derivative of MDP in order to try to maintain the adjuvant activity with a reduction in side-effects.78 When MDP is administered as water-in-oil emulsions, MDP overcomes its reputation as having poor adjuvant quality in aqueous solution, and has potent in vivo adjuvant activity. 79 Thus, numerous lipophilic deriva tives of MDP have been created and have been \"shown to be potent inducers of the cytokines inte interferon- and Murabutide, a derivative of MDP, \"h as been found to target cells of the reticulo-endothelial system and re gulate the release of cytokines in vivo without significant induction of proinfla mmatory mediators.\"81 This derivative triggers \"the maturation and activation of monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells, and thus could be an effective adjuvant for DC-based immunotherapy of ... viral infections.\"82 No peer review ed articles found regarding the use of MDP as an adjuvant in HIV vaccines. 73 E.

Introduction to Immunostimulatory Adjuvants The Immunostimulants or Immunostimulatory class includes adjuvant s that directly act upon the immune system. The Vehicles class descri bes adjuvants that are used as antigen that present itself to the immune system in an optimal manner.103 Typically, Immunostimulatory adjuvants ar e classified according to their component sources, physiochemical properties or mechanis m of action that enhance the efficiency and duration of specific immune response to antigen. Immunostimulants are can also Table 1 depicts a list of immunostimulants adjuvants.104 105 In addition, the vehicle class consists of vaccine antigens that present themselves to the immune system in an optimal manner. For instan ce, the vehicle or chemical class of adjuvants includes the use of delivery system or a contro lled release. Furthermore, the vehicle class can also serve to increase the delivery mechanism of the immunostimulants class mentioned above. Examples of the chemical or vehicle class of adjuvants are seen in Table 2. 106 107 Immunostimulatory adjuvants can also be classified as endogenous and exogenous. Endogenous adjuvants are adjuvants that are originated from within the body.108 Examples of 103 Reed et al., supra note 46, at 23 104 Id. 105 Id. at 24 106 Id. 107 Id. 108 Reed, et.al., supra note 46, at 23 23these adjuvants Monophosphoryl / Proteosomes.109 These adjuvants are formed with either molecu les or compounds originating within the body or through a normal cell metabolism.110 Interestingly, certain molecules released by necrotic cell death and stressed or damage tissues can act as very powerful adjuvants.111 The second class of Immunostimulatory adju vants is exogenous adjuvants, which are defined as adjuvants that are made up of either molecules or compounds that are external to the body. 112 Few examples of these adjuva nts are Multiple Antigenic Pe ptide, with an antigen.113 Certain adjuvants can endogenous depending on whether the compound, or protein used within the adjuvant is found within the body. Typically, endogenous immunostimulatory adjuvants help stimulate the immune system and are not considered foreign bodies. This usually means that side effects a nd drug resistance will be avoided because the endogenous immunostimulatory adjuvant is already found within the body.114 4.A.1 Polysaccharides are a form of carbohydrates. Polysaccharides are carbohydrates which have high molecular weight. They break down to monosaccharides when hydrolysis happens. This is a complex form. Mono-saccharides join together and create the polysaccharide. Glycosidic bonds are the binding force between the mono-saccharides. A general formula that denotes Polysaccharide is C n (H2O) n where the carbon chain may be 200 to 2500 carbons in length.115 Generally 10 or more monosacchar ides make a polysaccharide. 4.A.1.a Polysaccharides as Adjuvants for use in HIV Vaccines Current carbohydrate-based vaccines, while e ffective, do not protec t against the carrier protein and, therefore, an immunogenic response is heterogeneous in nature.116 Using polysaccharides, this objective can be achieve d by preparing well-know n carbohydrate antigens, 109 Id. at 25 110 Id. 111 Albert Bendelac & Ruslan Medzhitov, Adjuvants of Immunity: Harnessing Innate Immunity to Promote Adaptive Immunity, 195(5) J EXPERIMENTAL MED.

This will ensure specifi city in binding as we ll as a strong binding affinity, vital for immunity against the HIV virus.118 Polysaccharides based on glucose and mannose that have glucans , dextrans , T-helper 1 responses. Levans and xyalns also have immune-enhancing activity. Macrophages have glucan and manna High-molecular sulfated and diethylaminoethyl-dextrans have used veterinary adjuvants120. In and Nacetyl- D-glucosamine, obtained by partial deacetylation of chitin, exhibits a range of effects on the immune system. It has been shown to activate macrophages, induce cytokines, and in crease antibody production . Nevertheless chitosan has very low toxicity, is non-al lergenic, and is biodegradable.121 Inulin : The extensive data on inulin-based adju vants indicate that these are excellent candidates to replace alum as the adjuvant of choice for many vaccines. Particular advantages offered by inulin-based adjuvants is that they induce cellular in addition to humoral immunity and offer excellent safety, tolerabilit y, ease of manufacture and formulation.122 Inulin is the term used to describe a family of low molecular wei ght unbranched polymers of fructose and glucose. It is found in Compositae where it serves as the storage carbo hydrate, replacing the normal starch as a reserve food. Gamma inulin is a potent alte rnate complement humoral and cellular immune adjuvant, by increasing production of activat ed C3 and thereby activating macrophages.123 Beta - Glucans : These fungal polysaccharides stimula te innate immunity via TLRs and other PRRs (endocyctic - Pattern Recognition Receptors). B-Glucans are Beta (1 to 3) D-glucose polymers with or without Beta (1 to 6) linked Beta (1 to 3) glu can side-chains forming single or triple helix conformers. B-Gl ucans' immune-modul ating properties ar e dependent on size, branching and conformation, with single helix c onformers being the more effective ones.

The latter stimulates th e excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to septic shock. Also the lipopolysaccharides derived from the cell wall of Gram Negative Bacteria, are potent B-cell mitoge ns, and activate T-cells to produce IFN-gamma and TNF and thereby enhan ce cellular immune responses126. The main structural element responsible for their adjuvant effect is Lipid A, which can be hydrolysed to obtain monophosphoryl lipid A. MGN-3 : An arabinoxylane from rice bran that has been enzymatically modified with extract from Hyphomycetes mycelia, was tested for anti-HIV activity in vitro. MGN-3 activity against HIV-1 (SF strain) was examined in pr imary cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. MGN-3 inhibited ication by: (1) inhibition of HI V-1 p24 antigen production in a dose dependent manner; and (2) inhibition of syncytia formation maximized. Based on these results, it has been concluded that MGN-3 posse sses potent anti-HIV activity and in the absence of any notable side effects, MGN-3 shows pr omise as an agent for treating patients with AIDS. 127 Actinidia eriantha (AEPS) : The plant polysaccharides ar e recognized as an effective biological response modifier with low toxicity. The water-soluble polysaccharide from the roots of AEPS has been evaluated as a safe and e fficacious adjuvant candidate suitable for a wide spectrum of prophylactic a nd therapeutic vaccines.128 Eldexomer : Inclusion of eldexomer (a bio-adhesi ve polysaccharide) in intranasal HIV vaccine preparations may enhance induction of systemic antibody responses, and allow for the use of lower, more cost effective doses of antigen. 129 CpG ODN : Adjuvant effect of CpG ODN for polysaccharide an tigens has been observed to be prominent in neonates. Although CpG ODn may not be an effective adjuvant for many pure polysaccharide antigens, however they are quite eff ective if a protein carrier is conjugated to the polysaccharide.130 124 Dante J.

Hackett & Donald A. Ham eds., 2006) 264.A.2 Liposomes Phospholipids liposomes are the basic buildi ng block of every cell membrane in the human body. Each phospholipid molecule has three major parts, one head and two tails. The head is made from three molecular com ponents: choline, phosphate, and glycerol.131 The head is hydrophilic, that is, it is attracted to water. Each tail is a long, essential fatty acid chain. These fatty acids are hydrophobic, that is, they ar e repelled by water. Liposomes are single or multilamellar bilayer membrane vesicles th at can vary in size from 20 nm to 3 m.132 4.A.2.a Liposomes as Adjuvants for HIV Vaccines Liposomes are another class of oil-in-water emulsion that can transport antigens to lymphoid tissues following local injection. When given orally, they are also able to be endocytosed by M cells, allowing the antigen to be transported to the lymph cells in the Peyer's patches. The lipid components are usually phospho lipids or other amphiphiles, often supplemented with cholesterol and other charge d lipids. Liposomes can entrap both hydrophobic and water-soluble antigens, either within, or betw een the lipid bilayers. Th e first description of the use of liposomes as immunological adjuvants showed that diphtheria toxoid encapsulated in liposomes elicited a stronger humoral immune re sponse after injection in to mice, than the free toxoid. Liposomes are poorly immunogenic themselves , but are useful for presenting antigens to the immune system, either encapsulated within th e liposome, or adsorbed on the surface. It has been shown that the attachment of simple sugars to liposomes led to an increase in the humoral immune response to these antigens. 133 Dehydration-rehydration liposome vesicles (DRVs) : These containing various cytokines were evaluated for their ability to induce de layed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and humoral immunity to the recombinan t envelope protein rgp120 of the MN strain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Inductio n of DTH by vaccines may increase protection from viral pathogens such as HIV. Cytokine-con taining liposomes may be an effective adjuvant for the induction of a DTH response to envelope-antigen subunit vaccines.134 peptide (15 amino acids) of the envelope glycoprotein gp120 of HIV-1 and that are coated with mannopentaose-dipalmitoylphosphatidyletha nolamine conjugate induce a major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted CD8+ CTL response in mice with a single 131 Liposomes: What They Are, What They Do, How Are They Made? , http://www.lyposphere.com/liposomes.html (last visited Oct. 1, 2009) 132 Id. 133 Liposomes as Adjuvants for Vaccines , http://www.stormingmedia.us/89/8911/A891133.html (last visited Sept. 22, 2009) 134 Cytokine-Containing Liposomes as Adjuvants for HIV Subunit Vaccines , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7492439 Sept. 22, 2009) 27subcutaneous immunization, wher eas non-coated liposomes do not. 135 Since no damage to the skin at the injection site was caused by the liposomes, and since th e oligomannose-coated liposomes consist of innocuous materials ubi quitously distributed throughout the human body, they may be highly suitable for use as a safe adjuvant in vaccines inducing a CTL response against HIV.136 CAF01 : This liposome induced cellular immune responses against HIV-1 minimal CTL epitopes in HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice to levels comparable with that of incomplete Freund's adjuvant.137 Liposomes containing lipid A (LA) : This is a potent adjuvant and antigen. Incorporation of lipid A into liposomes renders the liposomes themselves immunogenic, resulting in generation of specific antibodies that recogni ze either the individual liposomal lipids, or the unique pattern presented by the combination of lipids.138 Stable liposomal oil-in-w ater emulsions provide an effective means of obtaining both antibody and CTL responses against an HIV envelope antigen.139 4.A.3 Lipid Polysine Core Peptides Synthetic lipopeptide vaccines are being increa singly investigated mainly because of the advantages they offer over traditional vaccin es, including safety of use in humans, high specificity in eliciting immune responses, greate r purity and large scale/ cost-effective production capacity. 140 The lipid polylysine core peptide (LCP) system essentially combines the MAP and cysteine (Pam3Cys ) systems. The LCP system incorporates lipoamino acids coupled to a polylysine core containing up to two different antigenic peptides, and is uniquely designed to incorporate antigen, carrier and adjuvant in a single molecular entity. There has also been a description about a variati on of his MAP system ('lipidatedMAP') that incorporates lipids in order to boost mucosal immunization 141. LCP-based vaccine candidates inco rporating variable domains of Chlamydia trachomatis outer membrane protein have been shown to si gnificantly enhance pept ide immunogenicity when compared with peptide monomers given alone in adjuvant, a nd an incorporating 135 Masashi Fukawasa, Liposome Oligomannose-Coated with Neoglycolipid, a New Candidate for Adjuvant for Induction of CD8+ Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes , 441 FEBS LETTERS , 353, 353 (1998) 136 Id. 137 A Novel Liposome-Based Adjuvant CAF01 for Induction of CD8+ in HLA-A*0201 Transgenic Mice, http://www.plosone.org/article/info: doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006950 (last visited Sept. 22, 2009) 138 Lipid A and Liposomes Containing Lipid A as Antigens and Adjuvants, http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=20508789 (last visited Sept. 22, 2009) 139 Richards Roberta et al., Liposome-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions as adjuvants: increased emulsion stability promotes induction cytotoxic T lymphocytes against an HIV envelope antigen , 82 I MMUNOLOGY & CELL BIOLOGY 531, 531-38 (2004) 140 Istvan Toth et al., Recent advances in Design and Synthesis of Self-Adjuvanting Lipopeptide Vaccines, 14 Int'l J. of Peptide Research & Therapeutics 333, 333 (2008) 141 McGreary et al., supra note 45, 405-418 28a footand- mouth disease viral peptide im munogenic, resulting in the induction of anti- peptide antibodies in the abse nce of additional adjuvant.142 Recently the LCP system was investigated as a vaccine delivery strategy for group A streptococci (GAS) \u2014 the causative agents of rh eumatic fever (RF) and subsequent rheumatic heart disease (RHD) \u2014 diseases for which curren tly no available vaccine exists. The bacterial surface anti-phagocytic M protein and major GAS vaccine candidate, was the targeted antigen. Mice immunized parenterally, in the absence of conventional adj uvant, with an LCP formulation containing a protective C-region determinant of the GAS M protein elicited hightitre, heterologous opsonic antibodies th at did not cross-react with human heart tissue proteins, indicating the potential of such a vaccine in inducing broadly prot ective immune responses.143 4.A.4 Cytokine Cytokines are a broad range of small proteins, best known for their roles in immunostimulatory function.144 They are released by differe nt cells types in response to immunological stimuli and function to regulate immune system.145 Cytokines act on their target cells by binding to the cell's sp ecific membrane receptors, me diating their immunostimulatory effects in a more contro lled and specific manner.146 The receptors and their corresponding cytokines have been divided into several families based on their structure and immunostimylatory activities: interferons (IFN), interlukin (IL), chemokines etc. 147 Cytokines are involved in virtually all aspects of both cellular and humor al immune responses. Thus, vaccines with limited immunogenicity, such as HI V vaccine comprising inactivated virus or HIV-DNA vaccine, that require more robust immunogenicity, can benefit from the usage of cytokine as adjuvants. Add itionally, cytokies are extremely suitable as adjuvants for HIV vaccine because both cellular and humoral immune responses will be required for optimal and sustained protection against HIV infection. 148 Cytokines that enhance antigen-specific cellular immune respons e include interferon (INF)-, interleukin (IL)-2, and IL-15.149 Whereas, cytokines that immune response include IL -4, IL-10 and granulocyte-macrophage cell stimulating factor (GC-MSF).150 Similarly, chemokines enhance the immune system by increasing Antigen Presenting Cell (APC) availability and antigen presentation151.

IL-2 is an optimal choice as an adjuvant for HIV vaccine because HIV infection results in CD4+ deficiency.157 IL-12- This class of cytokine i nduces the production of INF- and promotes the development of T helper 1 (Th1) cells, and stimulates effector T lymphocytes.158 IL-12 administration has to induc tion of HIV-specific C TL after intrarectal peptide immunogen.159 IL-15- This class of cytokine play s a critical role in establishing and maintaining memory CH8+ T lymphocytes.160 It is also a key regulator of NK and NKT-cell development.161 Studies have demonstrated that IL-15 enhances HIV-1 specific central memory T-cells induced by HIV antigen.162 4.A.4.a Delivery Mechanisms of cytokine adjuvants- 1.

It is a potent adjuvant for mucosally or intramuscularly delivered antigens, and is involved augmentation of both humoral and cell-mediated Intramuscular Gag p24 antigen encap sulated in liposomal lipid A has shown a significant increase in immune response in comparis on to administering the antigen encapsulated in liposome alone.168 However, lipid A is known to be highl y toxic, thus, precluding its use as an adjuvant in human vaccines. The toxic featur e of lipid A is redu ced by removing the 1'- phosphate group. This removal of 1'-phosphate from lipid A results in MPL, a detoxified derivative of lipid A, which has lower t oxicity but strong immu nostimulatory activity. 169 The adjuvant effects of MPL and lipid A is exerted when they bind to TRL-4 receptor on antigen present cells (APCs), which results in activation of APCs, further enhancing APCs' capacities to process and present antigen to T and B lymphocytes. 170 MPL has successfully been used as adjuvants for both protein vaccines and DNA vaccines. As a prot ein vaccine adjuvant, it has been used in formulation with HIV-1 envelope gp120 antigen.171 While, as a DNA vaccine adjuvant, MPL has been injected as a solu tion that comprises a construct expressing env and rev 165 Barouch et al., supra note 144, at 269-71 166 Morrow & Weiner, supra note 149, at 335 167 McGeary et al., Lipid and carbohydrate based adjuvant/carriers in immunology , 9 J.

They are derived from the lipoprotein of bacterial cell wall.174 Lipopeptides function as potent mucosal adjuvants by activating B-lymphocytes, and m onocytes, upon binding to Toll-like receptors (TLR)-2/6 on the target cell surf ace. Lipopeptides also promote the activation and maturation of dendritic cells, further improving their an tigen processing and presenting function.175 In HIV vaccines, lipopeptides were shown to be poten t and antigen-specific mucosal adjuvant when combined with mucosal HIV vaccine.

Coli, Cholera, and Pertussis.192 The toxins are heat-treated or are mutated since any inclusion into a vaccine would norma lly cause ill effects unless the toxins were modified to act as adjuvants and th erefore be non-toxic to the patient.193 Similar to Proteosomes, exogenous toxins are proteins or protein subunits that have found to be effective in protecting mucus membranes and causing a greate r immune response to the antigen.194 5. Conclusion HIV adjuvants can be categorized within desc riptive groups such as Organic, Inorganic, Endogenous and Exogenous. Looking at the various adjuvants shown in the LANL list (see Appendix G), these adjuvants were categorized within the desc riptive groups mentioned above. The technical background for HIV adjuvant proved useful for determining these categories and synonyms for key words such as HIV, Vaccine and adjuvant. Understanding the background of HIV adjuvants also proved helpful in inte rpreting claim language of the patents and understanding the purpose of an adjuvant in a vaccine. 187 Id. at 298 188 J. P.

Patent Search Methodology and Results 1. Patent Search Methodology The search on the project topic began in the Summer 2009 Patent Mining course, taught by Professor Cavicchi with technical supervisi on of Dr. Stanley Kowalski, wherein the team began by reviewing the recent literature on the technology relating to adjuvants used for HIV vaccines. The summer team commenced their s earching with the basic search terms: HIV, vaccine and adjuvant; and reviewed the results. The Intenational Technology Tr ansfer Institute (ITTI Clin ic) continued the search methodology from the summer course and bega n with a conference ca ll between Professor Cavicchi, Dr. Stanley Kowalski a nd Dr. Kerri Clark (the clinic c ontact person at PIPRA) in May 2009. The scope of the project was defined as conducting a patent landscape analysis of technologies pertaining to adjuva nt vaccines applicable to HIV. The team, with the Clinic members, began by reviewing past and recent literature relating to HIV vaccines and, in particular, to developing adjuvant co mpositions used in HIV vaccines. This semester, Thomson Innovation \u00ae, a recently released patent search platform (integrating the best of the su ite of Thomason tools, Aureka, Delphion and Micropatent), was utilized. Thomson Innovation is a single, integrated soluti on that combines intellectual property, scientific literature, business data and news with analytic, collaboration and alerting tools in a robust platform. The six-member team was divided into tw o groups. Each group was headed by a team leader whom the project leader oversaw. The groups were assi gned to research on different aspects of the adjuvant compositions. The topics were separated into two main categories and four sub-categories, each sub- category assigned to a differe nt team member/group. The two categories and four sub-categories were: 1) Immuno-stimulatory compositions a) Endogenous b) Exogenous 2) Chemical Compositions a) Organic b) Inorganic Recent literature and a synonym list developed from the Summer Course were utilized to determine keywords. These keywords were then used to do preliminary searches on Thomson Innovation and/or the USPTO. The initial keywords used in the two main cat egories in the search rounds were: Adjuvant HIV Vaccine Delivery System HIV Vaccine Therapy Antigen Delivery System Infection Immunizing Vaccine Immunogenicity Immunoenhancing Emulsions Immuno-compromised Immune Response Immune System Immunodeficiency Immunotherapy Particulate Infection Recombinant Protein Vaccine 35Particulate Antigen Delivery Systems Immunostimulatory Immunization Cytokines Retro-virus Tensoactive Compounds Retrovirus Immunogen Enhancer Pathogen Associated Depot Formation Pathogen Recognition Receptors Additive T-Cell Response Cell Mediated Immunity Lipid Particles Catalyst Viral Infection TLR-7/9 Microparticles Virus Infection Chemokines The teams the commenced an intense three-m onth journey of patent searching and coding. Thomson Innovation was the primary patent sear ching database used by the team members. These searches utilized keywords derived from the literature reviewed and initial searches to generate useful search strings; the searches also used United State Patent Classifications and International Patent Classifications that were identifie d through subsequent searches and team meetings. The combination of keywords and classificati ons in search strings was useful for parsing the technology into co mpartments and allowing each team member to generate a different set of search results that keywords alone could not provide. This approach generated a broad set of patents. From here, keywords and cla ssifications generated from this broad set of patents were used in subsequent ro unds of searching. After each round of searching, team meetings would identify the most importa nt keywords, and classi fications for use in subsequent search strings that be came more defined and effective. Many of these keywords were searched using the search field of \"Title, Abstract and Claims\" within Thomson Innovation since sear ches under the field of \"Description\" or \"Specification\" were found to be too broad. It wa s useful to limit each search using the specific Adjuvant terms under the search field of \"Claim s\". The keywords above were then combined with U.S. Classifications and subclasses, Intern ational patent classifications and subclasses to generate different sets of search results. Some of the most comm on classifications used were US Classifications 424, 435, 514, 530, 535 and 536, IP C Codes A61K 38, A61K 39, 47, A61N 1, C07, and K61K. 36During the brainstorming session, the Clinic al so decided to use the Non Human Primate HIV/SIV Vaccine Trial online database (LANL), to generate a list of specific adjuvants known to be used in HIV vaccines.195 The LANL list is shown in Appendix G. During the course of our brainstorming, th e ITTI team came across a new technology, Lexis Nexus Semantic Searching\u00ae. Lexus Nexus Semantic Searching\u00ae proposed that utilizing the system would result in more precise and rele vant patents. Lexus Nexus Semantic Searching\u00ae combines semantic search technology with fami liar Boolean search t echnology, which gives the users greater control over the patent research proc ess via a simple, streamlined user interface that matches their typical daily workflow. The results from our search are depicted in Appendix H. 2. Patent Search Results The search strings gave us an out come of more th an 3,500 patents. 2. A.

Patent Search Results Summary 3. A. Categorization Summary Patent Documents for Adjuvants for HIV Vaccine were coded using three relevancy categories and four descriptive categories. The following ca tegories were defined as follows for the purpose of this report. Relevancy Categories: 1. \"Primary\" Relevance - The first requirement to be primary relevant is that the patent must claim subject matter deals with HIV vaccine or vaccines for infectious diseases. In order to be a primary relevant patent cat egory, the patent must claim the adjuvant composition and not the method of enhancing im mune response. For instance, the claim language \"a method of enhanci ng immunizing\" would be insufficient for this category of the report. However, a claim that is descri bed as \"an adjuvant composition comprising\" would be sufficient to be primary relevant. Fu rthermore, a primary relevant patent will also claim the adjuvant using the langua ge, \"an adjuvant comprising\" and not \"an immunological agent\". This distinction was made because a primary relevant patent must claim composition is used as an ad juvant and not a broad category of an immunostimulatory agent. Moreove r, a general patent that claims an immunostimulatory agent can be used to describe a vaccine and not an adjuvant composition. A primary relevant patent requires langua ge specifying HIV in the abst ract or the claims. If the patent only mentions HIV in the specificat ion it will not be considered as a primary relevant patent. Once a patent contains a primary relevant claim then all claims in reference to this claim will also be categorized as primary relevant. 68 2. \"Secondary\" Relevance - Similar to above, th e first requirement to be a secondary relevant patent is that the patent must claim that the subject matter deals with HIV vaccine or vaccines for infectious disease. The secondary relevant patent category differs from a primary relevant patent in th at the patent could cl aim a method for use of a specific adjuvant. For example, a patent claim, \"a method for enhancing the immune response ...with adjuvant, MPL\" would be cons idered as a secondary relevant patent. Also, a secondary relevant patent could also claim a HIV vacci ne with a specific adjuvant. For instance, \"an anti-HIV v accine ... containing the adjuvant, ISCOM\" would fall under a secondary relevant category. In order to fall unde r secondary relevant category the patent must specify the adjuvant being used. 3. \"Tertiary\" Relevance - The tertiary relevant patent category only contains peripherally relevant claim language in the patent for eith er a HIV vaccine or a vaccine for infectious disease. For instance, the claim \"a HIV v accine containing an adjuvant\" would be considered tertiary relevant because it only specifies that he patent deal with HIV vaccines and contain and unknown adjuvant. Since there is no specification on the adjuvant, a tertiary relevant claim merely cl aims that an adjuvant is used in an HIV vaccine. Furthermore, a tertiary relevant pate nt would only further comprise an adjuvant as a dependant claim to an HIV vaccine. Descriptive Categories: 1. Organic Chemical Adjuvants - Patents will fall into this descriptive category if the patent claims an organic chemical adjuvant. Only primary and secondary adjuvants can be properly characterized because they clearly describe the adjuvant. Organic Chemicals Adjuvants are adjuvants which are organic and are typically either vehicles for vaccines or immunostimulatory compounds. The list in Appendix G contains the organic chemical adjuvants from the LANL list. 2. Inorganic Chemical Adjuvants - Patents will fall into this descriptive category if the patent claims an inorganic ch emical adjuvant. Only primar y and secondary adjuvants can be properly characterized because they cl early describe the adjuvant. Inorganic Chemicals Adjuvants are adjuvants which are In organic and are typica lly either vehicles for vaccines or immunostimulatory compounds . The list in Appendix G contains the inorganic chemical adjuvants from the LANL list. 3. Endogenous Immunostimulatory Adjuvants - Patent s will fall into this category describes endogenous stimulatory adjuvant. Only \"prima ry\" and \"secondary\" relevant patents can be properly characterized as endogenous im munostimulatory adjuvants because these patents clearly describe th e specific adjuvant. Endogenous immunostimulatory adjuvants 69are adjuvants that are from within the hu man body, which are used to exert a direct immunostimulatory effects on inna te immune cells. The list in Appendix G contains the Endogenous Immunostimulatory Adjuvants from the LANL list. 4. Exogenous Immunostimulatory Adjuvants - Pate nts will fall into this category describes endogenous stimulatory adjuvant. Only \"prima ry\" and \"secondary\" relevant be properly characterized as exogenous immunostimulatory adj uvants because these patents clearly describe th e specific adjuvant. Exogenous immunostimulatory adjuvants are adjuvants that are from outside the human body, which ar e used to exert a direct immunostimulatory effects on inna te immune cells. The list in Appendix G contains the Endogenous Immunostimulatory Adjuvants from the LANL list. 3. B. Patent De-duplication Process The search strings gave the team an outco me of 3,798 patent/applications, which then were de-duplicated according to the INPADOC Family ID. The de- duplication step refers to the removal of patents/applications within the same family so as to reduce redundancy during the patent coding process. There is no option to dire ctly de-duplicate patents into one-per-family in Innovation\u00ae, we utilized the Display and Sort option in Innovation\u00ae to group together the family members having the same INPADOC family ID, and then manually reduced to 2,040 patents/applications. The manually de-duplication pro cess includes several steps. Fi rst, all issued US patents within one INPADOC family were kept. Second, fo r a family having no US issued patent, all EP issued patents were be kept for coding. Finally, when no issued patent was available within one INPADOC family, patent applicatio ns with earliest priority date was be kept for review, and usually WIPO application or appl ications are the ones with the ear liest priority date within one family. However, some families only contain foreign patents or patent applications such as Japan patents/applications, Korea patents/applications or China patents/applications. For these foreign patents or patent applications, we reviewed the translations ma de by Innovation and coded them accordingly. 3. C. Patent Coding Results Summary Final de-duplication brought in a result of 2,040 patent docu ments. The result was then extracted into PDF files containing title, abstr acts and claims for coding by using MicroPatent\u00ae. The 2,040 patent documents were divided amon g the eight team members for coding. Each team member analyzed the claims in the documents and coded under one or more of the following eight categories. 1. Primary Relevant 2. Secondary Relevant 3. Tertiary Relevant 4. Irrelevant 5. Organic Composition 6. Inorganic Composition 707. Exogenous 8. Endogenous Of the 2,040 patent documents, 315 patent do cuments were found to be relevant. The coding results were inserted into the Master Sheet showing relevancy and categories of each patent document. The result is shown in Section 3.D. On the other hand, 44 out of 2,040 patent doc uments have no English claims for team members to decide its relevancy to adjuvants applicable for HIV vaccine. A list for these can- not-code patent documents is shown in Section 3.E. Each patent/application was initially code d by individual team member and emphasis was placed on claim language to decide whether the pate nt/application was relevant to adjuvant used for HIV vaccine. When the claim scope of a patent/application covered adjuvants but the claim language did not specifically point out the applicability to vacci ne against HIV, the patent/application was originally classified as irre levant. However, after coding more than half of the 2,040 patent documents, team me mbers realized that such pate nt/application might disclose adjuvants applicable to vaccine against HIV in the description portion, even it did not directly claim such usage. Due to the limited coding time (about 7 weeks), it is impractical for each team member to review these \"irrelevant\" patents again by review ing the whole patent spec ification to determine whether these patents were relevant to adj uvant applicable to HIV vaccine. Of the 2,040 patents/applications, 1,679 patent s/applications were the 1,679 \"irrelevant\" patents/applic ations together, and picked out 98 possibly relevant patents/applications among them. The 98 patents were picked out by using the refine search function in Innovation.

Instead of su ch efforts, with severa l adjuvant strategies approaching to requirements for their Clinical application, limitations li ke adjuvant toxicity remain to be fully surpassed. Here we summari ze the current status of adjuvant development, including regulatory recommenda tions, adjuvant requirements, and adjuvant categories a section dedicated to particulate antigen delivery systems. The mechanisms of adjuvantic ity are also discussed in the light of recent findings on Toll-like receptors' biology a nd their involvement on immune activation 2. Nature. 2008 Oct 2;455(7213):613-9. Challenges in the development of an HIV-1 vaccine. Barouch DH . Beth Israel Deaconess Medica l Sc hool, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA. dbarouch@bidmc.harvard.edu The development of a safe and effective human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 vaccine is a critically important global hea lth priority. Despite recent advances in our understanding of HIV- 1 pathogenesis and immunology, however, major scie ntific obstacles rema in. Prototype HIV-1 vaccine candidates aimed at eliciting humoral an d cellular immune responses have so far failed to protect against HIV-1 infecti on or to reduce viral loads after infection in Clinical efficacy studies. A renewed and coordinate d commitment to basic discovery research, preClinical studies and Clinical trials will therefore be required to overcome the hurdles cu rrently facing the field. Here I review key challenges and future prospe cts in the quest to de velop a prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine. 1233. AIDS. 2008 Jan 30;22(3):333-8. Cytokines as adjuvants for improving anti-HIV responses. Morrow MP , Weiner DB . Department of Pathology and La boratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA. Since AIDS was first identified over 25 years ag o, scientific advances have significantly expanded our understanding of th e immune system, providing new tools for immune modulation and immunization strategies. The employment of DNA, protein subunits, and recombinant viral vectors in vaccination against HIV have been reviewed elsewhere . The current article focuses on the use of new adjuvants as additions to HIV vaccination and immunotherapy regimens. By adjuvant, we refer to an immune potentiator in a vehicle . A wide variety of adjuvants has been tested for their abilities to elicit cellular and humoral responses to HIV antigens in vivo. The goal of studies employing new adjuvant s is that their inclusion will promote a stronger and more directed immune response than thos e generated by current approaches 4.

Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Chiron Cor poration, 4560 Horton Street, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA. Vaccines have traditionally consis ted of live attenuated pathogen s, whole inactivated organisms or inactivated bacterial toxins. More recen tly, recombinant protein vaccines have been introduced in combination with traditional ad juvants, based on insoluble aluminum salts (generically called 'alum'), for example Hepat itis B surface antigen adsorbed to alum is an effective vaccine against infection with Hepatiti s B virus (HBV). These various approaches have induced protective immunity against a number of pathogens, mainly through the induction of antibody, responses. However, these approaches have proven unsuita ble or unsuccessful for the development of an effective HIV vaccine. In c ontrast to some viruses, which can be easily controlled by neutralizing antibodies, cell mediated immunity (CMI) and particularly cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) appear to be important fo r the control of HIV C TL specifically recognize and kill virally infected cells displaying foreign antigen in th e context of MHC class I molecules. CTL have been shown to play a particularly impo rtant role in the early control of HIV infection and an inverse correlation has been establishe d between the magnitude of CTL responses in infected individuals and viral load [I]. Unfortuna tely, the alum based adj uvants are poor of CMI and are ineffective for th e induction of CTL. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of new adjuvants and delivery tech nologies to enable the development of an effective HIV vaccine. 1245. Vaccine. 2005 Mar 31;23(19):2522-9. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cy totoxic I/II B/E V-1 vaccine trial DL , de Souza MS ; Thai AIDS Vaccine Evaluation Group, Thailand . Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Bangkok, Thailand. chitrapornk@afrims.org Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC) accine trial in activity was measured using chromium release from gp120 subtype B- and CRF01_AE- coated targets in 95 vaccinees a nd 28 placebo recipients. There was a significant difference in the magnitude of the ADCC response to both targets between vaccinees and placebo recipients. The frequency of responders to subtype B and to CRF01_AE was 96% and 84% in the vaccine group versus 11% and 7% in the place bo group. The results demonstrate that this HIV vaccine is a potent inducer of ADCC activity and may be an a dditional protection of this prime-boost vaccine in preventing HIV disease. 6.

Reed SG , Bertholet S , Coler RN , Disease Research Institute, 1124 Co lumbia St. Suite 400, Seattle, WA 98104, USA. Over the last decade, there has been a flurry of research on adjuvants for vaccines, and several novel adjuvants are now in licensed products or in late stage Clinical development. The success of adjuvants in enhancing the immune res ponse to recombinant antigens has led many researchers to re-focus their vaccine devel opment programs. Successful vaccine development requires knowing which adjuvants to use and kno wing how to formulate adjuvants and antigens to achieve stable, safe and immunogenic vaccines. For the majority of v accine resear chers this information is not readily available, nor is access to well-characterized adj uvants. In this review, we outline the current state of adjuvant research and development and how formulation parameters can influence the effectiveness of adjuvants. 1257. Vaccine. 2005 Apr 8;23(20):2665-75. The immunogenicity-enhancing effect of emulsi on vaccine adjuvants is independent of the dispersion type and antigen releas e rate--a revisit of the role of the hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) value. Yang YW , Wei AC , Shen SS . School of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, Nationa l Taiwan University, 1, Jen-Ai Road, Section , Taipei 100, Taiwan, ROC. ywyang@ha.mc.ntu.edu.tw Effective antigen delivery is one of the most im portant issues in vaccin e development. It has been suggested that adjuvant action results from a depot effect by prolonging the duration of the interaction between antigen and cells, and thus is related to the antigen-releasing properties of emulsion adjuvants. The objective of this study wa s to investigate the effect of the dispersion properties of emulsion-type vaccine adjuvant s on the immune response with the aim of optimizing vaccine adjuvant formulation. Emul sion-type adjuvants with various dispersion properties of either the oil-in-water or water-in -oil type were prepared using emulsifiers with various hydrophilic-hydrophobic bala nce (HLB) values. The physicoc hemical properties of the emulsions, including the conductivity and viscos ity, and antigen releas e rates were then determined. Cell death induced by the vaccine adjuvants was examined in EL4 cells by Annexin V/propidium iodide staining and flow cytometric analys is. Mice were immunized with or without the adjuvants an d the immunogenicity-enhancing effect of the adjuvants determined by measuring antibody production using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The conductivity, viscosity, and antigen release rates varied wide ly among emulsions containing emulsifiers with different HLB values. However, the magnitude of the antigen-specific antibody response was similar in most emulsions adjuvants containi ng Spans or Tweens. L121-adjuvant, the control adjuvant inducing the strongest apoptosis in vitro, was shown to stimulate the highest antibody response in vivo. The results obta ined in this study indicate that the immunogenicity-enhancing effect of emulsion adjuvants is i ndependent of the dispersion type and the antigen release rate of the vaccine delivery system. 8.

Division of Viral Pathogenesis, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA. 126Innate immunity is critical fo r shaping vaccine-elicited adapti ve immune responses. Several classes of immune sensors, including Toll-lik e receptors, retinoic acid -inducible gene-I-like receptors, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors and cytosolic DNA receptors mediate important innate immune path ways and provide potential targets for novel adjuvant development. Understanding how i nnate immunity modulates adaptive immune responses will probably be important for optimizi ng vaccine candidates. Here, we review recent advances in innate immunity, focusing upon their potential applications in developing adjuvants and vectors for HIV vaccines. 9. J Pept Sci. 2003 Jul;9(7):405-18.

There are about 450 Classes of invention and about 150,000 subclasses of invention in the USPC. Classifications are typica lly expressed as \"482/1\". o The first number, 482, represents the class of invention. o The number following the slash is the subc lass of invention wi thin the class. Patents are always classifi ed at the subclass level. A Subclass definition is a complete description of the subclass. The Subclass Definition can incorporate an explanation of the class, a glossary, search notes, references to subclasses within the class, and refere nces to other cla sses and subclasses. Classes and subclasses have titles which pr ovide a short description of the class or subclass. Classes and subclasses also have definitions which provide a more de tailed explanation. Many Classes and subclasses have explicitly defined relationships to one another. One or more classifications (i.e., class/subc lass designations) are assigned to each granted patent and each publ ished application. A patent classification also represents a sear chable collection of patents grouped together according to similarly claimed subject matter. A classification is used both as a tool for finding patents (patentability searches) and for assisting in the assignment of patent applica tions to examiners for examination purposes.

The codes can be used by incorporating them into online search strategies when they are initially being developed. Many of the codes are redundant by coveri ng a single subject under several codes. As a result, the searches are extremely narrow and produce only a handful of relevant search results.

Se mantic searches modified by the searcher and enhanced with Boolean logic generate more co mplete and relevant re sults than traditional searches. With semantic search ing, you use the same data sources you already use, but your search results will contain only the most relevant items. Using simple English terms, sentences, or paragraphs as the search query, the semantic search engine searches across multiple sources stored in multiple locations, even if they have different indexing systems. Semantic analysis is available for STM (Science, Technology, and Medical ) sources, such as a patent or Elsevier Science source. The LexisNexis\u00ae Total Resear ch System service can perform a semantic analysis of your input before runni ng your search, generati ng a weighted list of terms that will be used as search terms. You can review and modify the terms and their weights before submitting your search (by clicking the \"Ana lyze Search Input\" button), or you can run your search without first viewing the weighted list of terms (by clicki ng the \"Search Now\" button). In both cases, you can add field restrictions or additional Boolean logic to fine tune your search. 196 For our research purposes, LexisNexis Semantic Search is not a resourceful tool. While it does come up with a number of reliable search term suggestions, the recall of those terms are less than ideal. This search could be useful for ge neral case searching, however in our situation where we are looking for very specific terms within an extensive number of patent, the search terms do not increase the overall search diversity. In many in stances, search terms that we deem important within found patents are absent in Semantic sear ch suggestions, or the opposite holds true where extraordinarily common terms are given the most weight. In many search examples, names are suggested. The Semantic interface is simple enough to use, however it is difficult to switch terms prior to searching. The suggested terms are lim ited to only twenty, though you may delete terms through the value designation window and add your own terms on the list menu. The results themselves are usefully presented, where the te rms are distinguished by size, color, and order displayed. The terms are designated a number value, where 4 is required and -1 is excluded. The weight of the term may be alte red by clicking the term and sele cting a number along a hierarchy slider. However, clicking the search term won't show you examples of use or link you to relevant patents, which we feel would be a very useful addition to the Semantic Search. In summation, this is could be a useful tool for broad searching, how ever in our situation it is lacking in precision and recall. See below for sample searches.
