Causes of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is thought to be caused by a problem with the immune system, the body's natural defence against illness and infection.

It's not clear exactly why this happens, but it can be triggered by: - an infection, such as [food poisoning](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/encyclopaedia/f/article/foodpoisoning/), [flu](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/encyclopaedia/f/article/flu,seasonal/) or [cytomegalovirus](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/encyclopaedia/c/article/cytomegalovirus/) - a vaccination, such as the [flu vaccine](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/doityourself/vaccinations/Flujab/) (but this is extremely rare and the benefits of vaccination outweigh any risk) - surgery, a medical procedure or an injury Read more about [causes of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/encyclopaedia/g/article/guillainbarresyndrome/#Causes).
