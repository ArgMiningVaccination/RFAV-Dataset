It should be used in any non -traditional vaccination clinic setting, including but not limited to: workplaces, community centers, schools, makeshift c linics in remote areas, and even medical facilities when vaccination occurs in the public areas or classrooms. Temporary clinics also include mass vaccination events, and vaccination clinics held during pandemic preparedness exercises. This checklist outli nes CDC guidelines and best practices that are essential for patient safety and vaccine effectiveness. A clinic coordinator/supervisor at the site should complete, sign, and date this checklist EACH TIME a vaccination clinic is held. To meet accountability and quality assurance standards, all signed checklists should be kept on file by the company that provided clinic staffing. This checklist should be used in conjunction with CDC's Vaccine -handling -toolkit.pdf Influenza Work Group of the National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit. Version 6 (Updated February 8, 2019) CS249275 -A. 4 Scheduling and Protocol for Curbside Visits, Including Vaccines The following guidance was shared with the Maine Immunization Program by two of our local provider offices. Use this template as a guide to set up curbside visits and adjust to meet your facilities needs. For scheduling: At the request of parent/guardian (hereafter referred to as parent), car visits may be scheduled for vaccines only. If the child is 26 months of age or younger, they are strongly encouraged to schedule a complete in office well visit. If the parent rema ins uncomfortable with coming in to the office despite reviewing our safety procedures, they can be scheduled as an office visit with their Primary Care Provider and clinical staff coming to the vehicle. Contact clinical staff for scheduling a car well visit. 5 Template for Protocol Procedures : 1. Determine if curbside visit is appropriate. a. Determine Curbside vs Insid e: Challenges to consider when planning i. Weather ii. Not much space in vehicles even with door open iii. Increased risk of needle stick iv. Animals in vehicle v.

Documentation/Billing a. Provider: document curbside exam is done. Mention any limitations. b. Vaccines: bill as nurse visit 7 Blueprint for conducting a curbside/drive -through clinic: Blueprint for conducting a walk -through clinic: 8 Framework for Planning Vaccine Clinics These recommendations and guidelines were developed to assist with planning vaccination clinics. This document provides general guidance to help ensure smooth operations at vaccine clinics and is broken into 4 phases, each with specific considerations: 1. Planning 2. Clinic Set -up 3. Clinic Operations 4. After -Clinic Activities PHASE 1: Planning Identify leaders for overall vaccination delivery operations. Identify partners to fulfill mass immunization roles . Register your clinics . Develop a communication plan among all clinic partners. Develop clinic processes, including: location, size, # of stations, and staff required. Identify staff to fill the positions. Meet the language needs of the community using mult i-lingual staff as appropriate. Prepare staff members regarding their roles and responsibilities during clinic operations. Cross -train staff members, if possible, to enable flexibility in meeting needs at various stations as demands fluctuate. If possible, provide additional staff to meet fluctuating clinic demands and schedule breaks for staff. Ensure the presence of an onsite emergency medical kit and supplies. Ensure that emergency procedures are in place to respond to urgent medical problems. 9 Vaccine Clinic Location If you plan to vaccinate a large number of patient s at one time, consider holding the clinic in school gyms, auditoriums, or other large covered spaces that can accommodate a large number of patient s and staff. If you plan to vaccinate smal ler numbers of patient s, carefully consider the building layout to ensure adequate clinic flow. Items such as adequate lighting and heating, functional and accessible restrooms, adequate space for all clinic functions such as screening, registration, vacci ne storage, vaccination, and staff breaks are considered. Clinic Notification & Pa tient Consent Ensure that adequate vaccine is available for the clinic. Providing consent forms and information packets to p atients prior to the clinic date and sending remi nders to return the consent forms. Reminders can include mailings , email, personal or automated phone calls, and text messages. Prior to vaccinating patients , staff should review the consent forms to verify that the patients have fully completed the forms. Provide Vaccine Information Sheet (VIS) . A VIS is a document, produced by CDC, that informs vaccine recipients - or their parents or legal representatives - about the benefits and risks of a vaccine they are receiving. All vaccine providers, public or pri vate, are required by the National Vaccine Childhood Injury Act the appropriate VIS to the patient (or parent or legal representative) prior to every dose of specific vaccines. For up to date forms: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/current -vis.html PHASE 2: Clinic Set -up Clinic Lay -out and Specifications You may want to adjust your clinic's lay -out based on items identified during the initial clinic planning phase. Use signs in multiple languages, as needed. Provide seating for patient s and staff if possible. Provide a waiting area where patient s can be observed after vaccination. See \"Example of Influenza Vaccine Clinic Lay -Out\" on next page. Clini c Security/Safety Especially if your facility will be utilizing outside volunteers to help operate your clinic, consider using name tags or ID badges to ensure those inside the clinic are authorized to be there. Assure that vaccine is stored in a safe and secure location that can be locked and access can be restricted to medical personnel only. Recruit local volunteers as needed to assist with clinic flow. Depending on the time of the clinic you may want to coordinate and collaborate with local community re sources. 10 PHASE 3: Clinic Operations Accommodations for patient s with disabilities will need to be taken into account for access into the clinic. Direct arriving patient s into clinic to expedite vaccine delivery. Ensure all patients receiving vaccine ha ve completed all forms, including the consent form and health screen. Based on the results on the health screening process, determine the correct vaccine presentation (multi -dose, pre -filled, nasal mist, etc) for each patient and direct them to the correct vaccination station. In order to keep the flow moving , non-medical clinic staff can be utilized as supply runners to assist in the clinic supply management process. Maintain a steady flow of patient s through the clinic so that vaccinators are never withou t a client at their stations; redirect patient s to other stations if bottlenecks occur. PHASE 4: After -Clinic Activities After -clinic activities need to be part of the initial planning process. Step 1: Close the vaccine clinic o Clear all the patient s for the vaccination area prior to closing o Post clear signage indicating that the site is closed o Assign staff for breakdown of site o Catalog and restock consumable supplies o Collect and dispose of trash o Bag and properly dispose of medic al waste (sharps containers) Step 2: Clean -up o Follow your facility's policy regarding post -event clean -up Step 3: Report doses administered o Delays in doses administered reporting can have multiple effects; Results in delayed billing and reimbursement for v accine Inability of the person's healthcare provider to view up -to-date vaccination history, which may lead to double vaccination of the patient. 11 COMMUNITY HEALTH PARTNER WORKING WITH A SCHOOL - TIMELINE Stage of Development/ Timeframe Task/Activity Responsible Party Prior to SLVC/July Contact school to determine interest in SLVC. Review vaccine inventory from prior year clinic - estimate number of doses needed. Order 40% vaccine doses needed based on state -based estimates.

Individual sections of the Toolkit available for printing Health Screen & Permission Form Vaccine Information Statements links to the CDC. Frequently asked questions. New information. 15 Insert your School Identifier Here Model Plan for Standing Order for School -Located Vaccine Clinics The following order provides direction to be followed at mass immunization clinics designated as School -Located Vaccine Clinics (SLVCs). 1. The school staff may work in coordination with other entities to order vaccine, manage inventory and/or administer vaccine at the school immunization clinics. 2. The school staff will use the Vaccine Health Screen and Permission Form (found in SLVC Toolkit) provided by the Maine Immunization Program to obta in relevant health history for the purpose of determining possible contraindications to receiving vaccine. 3. Vaccine clinic staff will screen for moderate or severe illness (including fever > 100) in clients. Persons who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting flu vaccine. If the client is ill, they should be directed to another SLVC for vaccination or to their healthcare provider. Persons with mild illness can usually get the vaccine. 4. An emergency plan mu st be in place in the event of anaphylaxis or symptoms of immediate hypersensitivity following administration of the vaccine. (See Part 3 of th is Toolkit ). Prior to the clinic, clinic staff shall be familiar with the emergency procedures for anaphylaxi s and the administration of Epinephrine and Benadryl . Note: An Emergency Kit containing the following items must be at the clinic site: Aqueous epinephrine EpiPen). If epinephrine autoinjectors are to be stocked, both junior dose (0.15 mg) and adult dose (0.30 mg) should be available. Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) injectable (50mg/mL solution) and oral (12.5 mg/5 mL suspension) and 25 or 50 mg caps ules or tablets. Syringes: 1 -3 cc, 22 -25g needles for epinephrine and diphenhydramine (Benadryl). Pediatric and adult airways (small, medium, and large). Alcohol swabs Blood Pressure cuffs (child, adult & extra -large) and stethoscope Pedia tric and adult size pocket masks with one -way valve Tongue depressors Flashlight with extra batteries (for examination of mouth and throat). Wrist watch 16 Tourniquet Cell phone or access to an on -site phone Ref: Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine -Preven table Diseases, 12th Edition; U.S. DHHS, CDC; May 2012, Appendix D-19 5. There must be a second responsible person present at each clinic site while vaccine is being administered in order to activate the Emergency Medical Services if necessary. The second person may be from a program other than the school. 6. There shall be no pre -filling of syringes at clinics if using multi -dose vials. All doses of vaccine and emergency medication shall be drawn up at the time of administration. 7. During the clinic, if the vaccine is stored in a transport co ntainer/cooler, the insulating barrier must be left in place between the vaccine and the refrigerated/frozen packs, and cold chain must be maintained. 8. During the clinic, cooler temperatures will be checked at least hourly to ensure that the cold chain is not broken. If the temperature range is out of the acceptable CDC ranges for storage of vaccine ( 36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F) the following action must be taken immediately: a. Label the vaccine that it has been stored out of temperature range. b. Notify the vaccine provider. c. Notify the manufacturer of the product for instructions in handling the vaccine (see contact numbers below). d. Notify the Maine Immunization Program (287 -3746) if vaccine comes from the Maine Immunization Pro gram. 9. The clinic health care staff shall verify that the Vaccine Health Screening and Permission Form is complete and shall be used for the purpose of determining possible contraindications to receiving the vaccine. Recommended best practice is to , keep a copy of the Vaccine Health Screening and Permission Form according to the school health record retention schedule. 10. Persons with a negative health history (no contraindications) or who have written permission from their primary health care provider ma y receive the vaccine. 11. Clinic health care staff shall have their own sharps container at their station. During use, sharps containers shall be: a. Easily accessible to personnel and located at the area where sharps are used or can be found. b. Maintained uprig ht throughout use. c. Replaced when full. d. Accounted for at all times. 17 The clinic health care staff shall notify the client that they are expected to remain at the clinic site for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine for the purpose of observing for a reaction to the vaccine. If an adverse reaction should occur, the clinical health care staff shall refer to \"Medical Management of Vaccine Reactions in Children and Teens\" available at www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3082a.pdf and the Model Emergency Plans provided in Part 3 of the Toolk it.

Background VAERS, administered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control Prevention (CDC), is a safety surveillance program that collects information about adv erse events (possible side effects) that occur after the administration of vaccines licensed for use in the US. Each report provides valuable information that is added to the VAERS database that supplies the information needed for evaluation of vaccine saf ety. Anyone can file a VAERS report; including health care providers, vaccine recipients and parents or guardians. Vaccine recipients and parents/guardians should consult their health care provider if they suspect an adverse event associated with the vacci ne. FDA and CDC do not provide individual medical treatment, advice or diagnosis. What can be reported to VAERS? Report any clinically significant medical event that occurs after vaccination, even if you are not sure whether the vaccine caused the adverse event. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act requires health care providers to report any adverse event listed by the vaccine manufacturer as a contraindication to receive additional doses of the vaccine and any adverse event listed in the \" VAERS Table of Reportable Events Following Vaccination\" that occurs within the specified time period after vaccination. For influenza this includes events described in manufacturer's package insert as contraindications to additional doses of vaccine (interval - see package insert). How to report to VAERS: Anyone may report but preferably Clinic Vaccinator or Clinic Authority should complete the VAERS report if the event occurs in the clinic setting. Download the VAERS Form (located at https://vaers.hhs.gov/uploadFile/index.jsp ) Request a VAERS Form by sending email to info@vaers.org , by calling (800)822 -7967, or by faxing a request to (877)721 -0366. Before you begi n review the Instructions for Completing the VAERS Paper Form. 21 Fax a completed VAERS Form to (877)721 -0366. Mail a completed VAERS Form to VAERS, P.O. Box 1100, Rockville, MD 20849 -1100. A pre - paid postage stamp is included on the back of the form. Federal CDC will send you a confirmation after the report is received. 22 Clinic Guidance During Covid Guidance has been developed for the administration of vaccines at pharmacies, temporary, off -site, or satellite clinics, and large -scale influenza clinics. Other approaches to vaccination during the COVID -19 pandemic may include drive -through immunization services at fixed sites, curbside clinics, mobile outreach units, or home visits. The general principles outlined for healthc are facilities should also be applied to alternative vaccination sites, with additional precautions for physical distancing that are particularly relevant for large -scale clinics, such as: Providing specific appointment times or other strategies to manage patient flow and avoid crowding. Ensuring sufficient staff and resources to help move patients through the clinic flow as quickly as possible. Limiting the overall number of attendees at any given time, particularly for populations at increased risk for severe illness from COVID -19. Setting up a unidirectional site flow with signs, ropes, or other measures to direct site traffic and ensure physical distancing between patients. When feasible, arranging a separate vaccination area or separate hours for p ersons at increased risk for severe illness from COVID -19, such as older adults and persons with underlying medical conditions. Selecting a space large enough to ensure a minimum distance of 6 feet between patients in line or in waiting areas for vaccinat ion, between vaccination stations, and in postvaccination monitoring areas (the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that providers consider observing patients for 15 minutes after vaccination to decrease the risk for injury should they faint). 23 Vaccination Clinic Location and Layout Satellite, temporary, or off -site locations must consider federal, state, and local guidance when establishing measures to protect clinic staff and clients from the virus that causes COVID -19. Regardless of the site type (i.e., walk -through, curbside, drive -through, or mobile clinic), temporary locations must have sufficient capability to accommodate physical distancing, inventory management, and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for staff and face coverings for patients. Clinic locations and processes that were successful in previous years might not be appropriate during the COVID -19 pandemic because of the need for enhanced safety precautions. Even if the same space is used, it will likely need to be set up and function differently because of COVID -19 requirements. Consider conducting appointment -only temporary clinics held in schools, churches, and pharmacies. Smaller clinics can be laid out more efficiently and serve fewer people to help reduce exposure risk for staff and patients. Large -scale clinics, particularly those held indoors, may not be feasible during the COVID -19 pandemic because they might be difficult to implement under federal , state, and local guidance for physical distancing. Curbside and drive -through clinics may provide the best option for staff and patient safety during the COVID -19 pandemic. For walk -through clinics, it's important to establish line queues that maintain separation between individuals or to ask individuals to wait in their vehicles or anothe r location until called. Clinic flow should be one way. individual sites will have benefits and limitations and that site assessments will be required prior to use. Consider using online or phone options for scheduling appointments and completing paperwork , when possible. Such processes should include registration, obtaining insurance information, and billing (if needed), screening for contraindications and precautions, and texting or emailing vaccine information statements (VISs) or emergency use authoriza tion (EUA) forms. 24 Supplies and Materials During the COVID -19 pandemic, protection must be available for staff and patients. Supplies required during the COVID -19 pandemic include: Alcohol -based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol and hand soap Cleaning supplies for more frequent cleanings, using EPA's Registered Antimicrobial Products for Use Against Novel Coronavirus SARS -CoV-2external icon Cloth face coverings for patients who arrive without one Personal protective equipment (PPE) for staff, including face masks, gloves, and eye protection, based on current guidance for the safe delivery of vaccination services . (see page 26 of toolkit.) Thermometers for checking patients' temperatures before they enter the clinic , if required Tissues Note that quantities may be more than was needed prior t o the pandemic. Training Staff training is critical. Ensure all staff is trained to answer common questions about the vaccine. During the COVID -19 pandemic, all staff should be on when to use PPE, what PPE is necessary, how to properly don (put on) and off (take off) PPE, and how to properly dispose of PPE. 25 General Operations During the clinic, ensure physical distancing and enhanced infection control measures are in place and implemented. Measures include: Cleanse and disinfect vaccination stations between each patient. Ensure all patients and accompanying attendants wear a cloth face covering or face mask that covers the nose and mouth. If a patient or attendant is not wearing a cloth face covering, ensure face coverings or face masks are available. (Note: Face coverings should not be placed on a child under 2 years of age, anyone who has trouble breathing, or anyone who is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.) Ensure staff is wearing appropriate PPE. Ensure supplies such as tissues, hand sanitizer, and wastebaskets are readily accessible throughout the clinic. If gloves are worn by those administering vaccine , they should be changed, and hand hygiene should be performed between patients. Make sure there are signs, barriers, and floor markers throughout the clinic to instruct patients to maintain a 6 -foot distance from others and promote use of hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette. Provide extra cleaning and sanitizing support. Frequently clean and disinfect all patient service counters and patien t contact areas, including frequently touched objects and surfaces such as workstations, keyboards, telephones, and doorknobs. For additional information regarding clinic planning, pre -clinic activities, during the clinic, and post -clinic activities, reference the following link: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/mass -clinic -activities/index.html \u00b9CDC.Updated National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases for the Interim Guidance for Immunization Services During COVID -19 Pandemic. 2020. 26 General Practices for the Safe Delivery of Vaccination Services The potential for asymptomatic transmission of the virus that causes COVID -19 underscores the importance of applying infection prevention practices to encounters with all patients, including physical distancing, respiratory and hand hygiene, surface decont amination, and source control while in a healthcare facility. Immunization providers should refer to the guidance developed to prevent the spread of COVID -19 in healthcare settings . To help ensure the safe delivery of care during vaccination visits, providers should: Minimize chances for exposures, including: o Screen for symptoms of COVID -19 and contact with persons with possible COVID -19 prior to and upon arrival at the facility and isolate symptomatic patients as soon as possible. o Limit and monitor points of entry to the facility and install barriers, such as clear plastic sneeze guards, to limit physical contact with patients at triage. o Implement policies for the use of a cloth face covering in persons over the age of 2 years (if tolerated). o Ensure adherence to respiratory hygiene, cough etiquette, and hand hygiene . Ensure all staff adhere to the following infection prevention and control procedures: Follow Standard Precautions , which includes guidance for hand hygiene and cleaning the environmen t between patients. Wear a medical facemask at all times. Use eye protection based on level of community transmission : Moderate to substantial: Healthcare providers should wear eye protection given the increased likelihood of encountering asymptomatic COVID -19 patients. Minimal to none: Universal eye protection is considered optional, unless otherwise indicated as a part of Standard Precautions . Additional considerations for vaccine administrat ion: Intranasal or oral vaccines: o Healthcare providers should wear gloves when administering intranasal or oral vaccines because of the increased likelihood of coming into contact with a patient's mucous 27 membranes and body fluids. Gloves should be changed between patients in addition to performing hand hygiene. o Administration of these vaccines is not considered an aerosol -generating procedure and thus, the use of an N95 or higher -level respirator is not recommended. Intramuscular or subcutaneous vaccines: o If gloves are worn during vaccine administration , they should be changed between patients in addition to performing hand hygiene. Ensure physical distancing by implementing strategies, such as: o Separating sick from well patients by scheduling these visits during different times of the day (e.g., well vis its in the morning and sick visits in the afternoon), placing patients with sick visits in different areas of the facility, or scheduling patients with sick visits in a different location from well visits (when available). o Reduce crowding in waiting areas by asking patients to remain outside (e.g., stay in their vehicles, if applicable) until they are called into the facility for their appointment. o Ensure that physical distancing measures, with separation of at least 6 feet between patients and visitors, ar e maintained during all aspects of the visit, including check -in, checkout, screening procedures, and postvaccination monitoring using strategies such as physical barriers, signs, ropes, and floor markings. o Utilize electronic communications as much as poss ible (e.g., filling out needed paperwork online in advance) to minimize time in the office as well as reuse of materials (e.g., clipboards, pens). \u00b9CDC.Updated National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases for the Interim Guidance for Immunization Services During COVID -19 Pandemic. 2020. 28 Community Vaccination Clinics TOOLKIT Part 3: MODEL EMERGENCY PLANS 3.1 Model Plan: Emergency Plan for Anaphylaxis 3.2 Model Plan: Administration of Epinephrine and Benadryl 3.3 Model Plan: Evaluation and Follow -up of an Exposure to Blood or Other Potentially Infectious Material 3.4 Model Plan: Prevention of Post -Immunization Syncope -Related Injuri es 29 Model Plan: Emergency Plan for Anaphylaxis I. Purpose: To define allergic hypersensitivity to drugs administered by parenteral route as well as the emergency management that is to be provided by the vaccine provider. II. Policy: A plan for contacting emergency medical services that are available in the area shall be established prior to starting any clinic. The plan shall include local emergency telephone numbers. Recipients of medication, vaccine, or biologicals administered by parenteral r oute shall be requested to remain on site for a minimum of 15 minutes for sign of hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reaction. Symptoms of anaphylaxis usually begin within 15 minutes after administration of the drug, and intervention should be implemented i mmediately. A vaccine provider shall remain on site for 15 minutes after each drug is administered. Individuals with symptoms categorized as mild may only require close monitoring on site with notice to their health care provider. Individuals with sympto ms that progress shall require intervention including the administration of epinephrine. (See Toolkit, Model Plan: Administration of Epinephrine and Model Plan: Administration of Epinephrine and Benadryl NOTE: The signs and symptoms of anaphylactic are: hypotension, respiratory distress such as laryngeal edema, dyspnea, wheezing, a sense of retrosternal pressure or tightness, rapid and/or irregular pulse, urticarial, loss of consciousness, agitation, faintness, burning and/or itching eyes, tearing, congestion and itching nose, rhinitis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, flushed skin, general itching, non - pruritic swelling of extremities as well as the face and perioral or periorbital regions, and/or a sense of uneasiness. After an injection of medication and/or vaccine it is determined that the individual has symptoms categorized as mild, the client may only require close monitoring on site with notice to their health care provider. Using clinical judgment, when the individual's symptoms progress to those of anaphylactic shock, vaccine providers shall initiate the emergency procedure for the administration of Epinephrine and Benadryl.

MMWR 2005;54(RR09);1 -17 Post -Immunization Syncope -Related Injuries Syncope, also called fainting, is a temporary loss of consciousness resulting from decreased blood flow to the brain. Immunization providers should be aware of the potential for syncope associa ted with vaccination, particularly among adolescents. Syncope after vaccination itself is usually not a serious event, and patients generally recover within a few minutes. The main concern is injury, especially head injury. Vaccine clinic staff should take appropriate measures to prevent syncope and to readily respond to the patient who feels faint. Steps to Prevent Syncope -Related Injuries Make sure the patient is either seated or lying down at the time of vaccination. Observe patients for 15 minutes after vaccination for signs and symptoms that commonly precede syncope, such as weakness, dizziness, light -headedness, nausea, sweatiness, coldness of the hands or feet, paleness or visual disturbances. If patient is experiencing possible signs or symptoms of fainting, take the following steps to prevent syncope and injury from falling: o Have the patient sit or lie down immediately. o Have the patient lie flat or sit wi th head between knees for several minutes. o Loosen any tight clothing and maintain an open airway. o Apply cool, damp cloths to the patient's face and neck. o Observe the patient until symptoms completely resolve. If patient falls but does not experience loss of consciousness: o Check the patient to determine if injury is present before attempting to move him/her. o Place the patient flat on back with feet elevated. o Observe the patient until symptoms completely resolve. If patient loses consciousnes s: o Check the patient to determine if injury is present before attempting to move him/her. o Place the patient flat on back with feet elevated. o Maintain an open airway. o Call 911 if the patient does not recover immediately. 37 References: The Children's Hos pital of Philadelphia .

If vaccine transportation to another location is required, it is critical that the potency is protected by maintaining the cold chain at all tim es. It is essential that refrigerated vaccine shall be maintained at 3 6 - 46 degrees Fahrenheit during transportation. Instructio ns for all transported vaccine: 1. The vaccine provider shall pack the vaccine in the appropriately sized cooler the day of the clinic according to quantity guidelines outlined below. The vaccine should remain in their original boxes when transported to the home or clinic site. 2. The vaccine provider shall atta ch a label to the outside of the container to clearly identify the contents as fragile vaccines. 3. A calibrated data logger with a buffered probe shall be fixed to the outside of the cooler by velcro and used for all temperature readings. 4. The vaccine provi der shall record the time and temperature inside the cooler on the Vaccine Transport Temperature Log . 5. The vaccine provider shall check the temperature at least hourly to ensure that the cold chain is not broken. Record the time and temperature on the Vacc ine Transport Temperature Log. Do not open the cooler for hourly temperature readings . Retain these records for three years and then destroy. 6. If the temperature of the cooler falls outside of the recommended guidelines the vaccine provider shall take the following actions: Label the Vaccine that it has been stored out of range Notify the manufacturer of the product for instructions in handling the vaccine (Manufacturer's contact numbers are listed below) If the vaccine was obtained from the Maine Immunization Program notify the Maine Immunization Program at 287 -3746 45 Contact Information: Selected Vaccine Manufacturers & Distributors Manufacturer/Website Phone Number : Products : Centers for Disease Control & Prevention www.cdc.gov/ncidod/srp/drugs/drug -service.htm . 404-639-3670 for Refrigerated Vaccine Transport : MIP recommends transporting refrigerated vaccines with a portable refrigeration unit. If this type of unit is not available, a hard -sided insulated cooler with at least 2 -inch walls, a Styrofoam vaccine shipping container, or other qualified co ntainer may be used as long as it maintains the recommended temperature range (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F [2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C]). Using a hard -sided cooler, Styrofoam vaccine shipping container, or other qualified container requires the following: o Coolers should be large enough to hold the supply of refrigerated vaccines. o Label the container with the facility name, \"Fragile Vaccines - Do NOT Freeze\", and the date and time the vaccines was removed from the permanent storage unit. NOT E: Do not use soft -sided collapsible coolers for transporting vaccine. Conditioned frozen water bottles are recommended for keeping vaccines cold. o Use 16.9 oz. bottles for medium/large coolers and 8 oz. bottles for small coolers o Before use, condition the frozen water bottles. This is done by placing them in a sink filled with several inches of cool or lukewarm water until there is a layer of water forming near the inner surface of the bottle. The bottle is properly conditioned when the ice block spins freely within the bottle when r otated. NOTE : Do not reuse coolant packs from original vaccine shipping containers. Insulating material - two each of the following layers is needed: o Corrugated cardboard - two pieces cut to fit the internal dimensions of the coolers(s) and placed between the insulating cushioning material and the conditioned water bottles. o Insulating cushioning material such as bubble wrap, packing foam, or Styrof oam for a layer at least 2 - inches thick above and below the vaccines. Ensure this layer covers the cardboard completely. NOTE : Do not use packing peanuts or other loose material that may shift during transport. A data logger with a buffered probe mus t be used as a temperature monitoring device. o Prepare the probe by pre -chilling it in the refrigerator for at least 5 hours prior to transport. o Ensure the data logger has a current and valid certificate of calibration testing. o Ensure the data logg er certificate is documented to be accurate within +/ - 1\u00b0F (+/ - 0.5\u00b0C). o The data logger currently stored in the refrigerator can be used for transport, as long as there is a device in place to measure the temperature for any remaining vaccines. MIP re commends the following packing assembly for refrigerated vaccines: Line t he bottom of the cooler with a single layer of conditioned water bottles. Place a sheet of corrugated cardboard over the water bottles. Place at least a 2 -inch layer of insulating material (i.e., bubble -wrap, packing foam, or Styrofoam) over the cardboard. Stack boxes of vaccines on top of the insulating material. 47 When cooler is halfway full, place the data logger buffered probe in the center of the vaccines, but keep the display outside the cooler. Cover vaccines with another 2 -inch layer of insulating material. Add the second layer of corrugated cardboard. Fill the remaining space in the cooler with conditioned water bottles. Close the lid of the cooler securely and attach the data logger display and a temperature log to the top of the lid to record and monitor the temperature during transport. Use the temperature recording form to record the time and temperature inside of the storage unit at the time the vaccines were removed. If va ccines are kept in a transport container for longer than an hour, record the temperatures hourly. As soon as the destination site is reached, check and record the vaccine temperature. As long as the vaccine temperature is 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C), pl ace the vaccine in the refrigerator. If the vaccine is below 36\u00b0F (below 2\u00b0C) or above 46\u00b0F (above 8\u00b0C), label the vaccine as \"Do Not Use\", place in the refrigerator, and immediately contact the vaccine manufacturer to determine viability. NOTE: Always keep vaccine properly stored until otherwise instructed by the vaccine manufacturer or MIP. Special Instructions for Frozen Vaccine Transport: Varicella and MMRV vaccines are fragile and must be kept frozen. MIP and the vaccine manufacturer do not reco mmend transporting varicella or MMRV. If these vaccines must be relocated in an emergency, the following steps must be taken: Portable Freezer - MIP recommends transport with a portable freezer unit that maintains the temperature between -58\u00b0F to +5\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C). Portable freezers may be available for rent. Label the portable freezer with the facility name and \"Fragile Vaccines - Keep Frozen\" and the date and time the vaccine was removed from the permanent storage unit. Temperature Monitoring D evice - Use a certified and calibrated data logger with a current and valid certificate of calibration testing. Prepare the data logger by placing it in a freezer unit at least 2 hours before packing the vaccine. Cooler - If a portable freezer is unavai lable, a hard -sided insulated cooler with at least 2 -inch walls, a Styrofoam vaccine shipping container, or other qualified container may be used if temperatures between -58\u00b0F to +5\u00b0F ( -50\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C) can be maintained. Label the container with the facilit y name and 48 \"Fragile Vaccines - Keep Frozen\" and the date and time the vaccine was removed from the permanent storage unit. Use frozen water bottles in the cooler. Dry ice is not allowed to be used for transporting vaccines, even for temporary storage or emergency transport. Dry ice may allow the vaccine to be exposed to temperatures colder than -58\u00b0F ( -50\u00b0C). Line the bottom of the cooler with a single layer of frozen water bottles. Place at least a 2 -inch layer of insulating material (i.e., bubble -wrap, packing foam, or Styrofoam) over the frozen water bottles. Stack boxes of vaccines and diluents on top of the insulating material. When cooler is halfway full, place the data logger buffered probe in the center of the vaccines, but keep the display outside the cooler. Cover vaccines with another 2 -inch layer of insulating material. Fill the remaining space in the cooler with frozen water bottles. Close the lid of the c ooler securely and attach the data logger display and a temperature log to the top of the lid to record and monitor the temperature during transport. Use the temperature recording form to record the time and temperature inside of the storage unit at the time the vaccines were removed. If vaccines are kept in a transport container for longer than an hour, record the temperatures hourly. As soon a s the destination site is reached, check and record the vaccine temperature. Place the vaccines in a freezer that maintains a temperature range between -58\u00b0F to +5\u00b0F ( -50\u00b0C to - 15\u00b0C). Document the time and temperature the vaccine was removed from the transport container and placed in the alternate storage unit. Immediately contact the vaccine manufacturer for viability data and guidance when frozen vaccine has been exposed to a temperature above +5\u00b0F ( -15\u00b0C). Do not discard the vaccine without cont acting the manufacturer. Viability determination will be made on a case -by-case basis. 49 Instructions for Using Cool Cubes VeriCooler Cool Cube 03 Phase Change Material (PCM): A non -toxic biodegradable temperature regulating substance inside the panels in the VeriCooler.
