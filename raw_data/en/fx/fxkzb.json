When Schneck Memorial Hospital, as it was known in 1911, first opened its doors, it held just 17 beds. Today, Schneck has grown into one of the most respected health institutions in the region. Our facility covers thousands of square feet, includes all-private patient suites, and offers expertise in oncology, pain management, rehabilitation, cardiovascular care, women's health, major surgery, emergency care, radiology, hospice, home health and outpatient services. From Joel H. Matlock, the hospital's first president, to today, the unique vision of our strong leadership has allowed Schneck to expand our services to successfully meet the changing needs of our patients and the communities we serve. Perhaps most important is the culture of care that surrounds Schneck. Our patient- first philosophy promotes the development and implementation of innovative models of healthcare that focus on health and nurture body, mind, and soul. In following this patient-first philosophy, Schneck is among the five-percent of hospitals nationwide that have achieved Magnet status from the American Nurses Credentialing Center, and among the twenty-percent that have received Chest Pain Center Accreditation by the Society of Chest Pain Centers. Additionally, Schneck's Cancer Center has been honored for excellence as the recipient of a commenda-tion from the Commission on Cancer by the American College of Surgeons and our Surgical Weight Loss Center was recently named an American Society for Bariatric Surgery Center of Excellence. Employing a highly-qualified staff of more than 775 employees, Schneck has consistently been named as one of Indiana's Best Places to Work by The Indiana Chamber of Commerce and recognized nationally as one of the \"Best Places to Work\" in healthcare by Modern Healthcare magazine. After 100 years, it's the perfect time for us to look back at our many accomplishments and look forward to our exciting future. We see the celebrations in this 100th year as a way to recognize the many people who have contributed time, talent, volunteerism, and donations over the years. When I reflect upon the rich history of this hospital, I am proud to be part of its present and future. 100 YEARS PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE President & CEOA LEGACY OF EXCELLENCE 3 TABLE OF CONTENTS 4 How it All Began 6 Decades of Excellence 1911-1940 10 Decades of Excellence 1941-1950 12 Decades of Excellence 1951-1960 14 Decades of Excellence 1961-1980 16 Decades of Excellence 1981-1990 18 Decades of Excellence 1991-2000 20 Decades of Excellence 2001-2010 22 Schneck's Quality of Care 25 What's New at Schneck 26 Services 27 Schneck Foundation2011 Board of Trustees Rick Smith, Chairman Jack McCory, Vice chairman Doug Hill, Secretary John McCoy, Past Chairman Raphael Carter, MD Terry Gilliland Jerry Hounshel Matt Reedy John Schafstall 4 SCHNECK 100 YEARSIn March of 1910, Mrs. Mary Schneck, a quiet and deeply religious woman, offered the community of Seymour the gifts of a lot at the corner of Bruce and Poplar streets and $5,000, if that amount was matched by the city. The gifts, a memorial to her late husband Louis Schneck, one of Seymour's pioneer indus-trialists, were to be used to build a community hospital. Mrs. Schneck had originially intended to build a home for the aged, but Dr. G. G. Graessle persuaded her that a hospital would serve a greater need. On March 21, 1910, Schneck Memorial Hospital was incorporated as a non- profit charitable institution, thanks to the efforts of a committee of citizens dedicated to the project. An article in The Brownstown Banner of July 13, 1910 reported that a contract for the construction of the Hospital was awarded to Wolf & Ewing of Indianapolis. The contract for plumbing, heating and wir - ing was awarded to W.C. Bevins of Seymour for $3,000. As the construction progressed, community organizations such as the Masons, the Knights of Co-lumbus, and the Medical Association were given the opportunity to provide furnishings for specific rooms. On March 23, 1911, Schneck Memorial Hospital, with 17 beds and the latest medical and surgical equipment, was dedicated. The Hospital, constructed for a cost of $15,000 and $8,000 in equipment, was heated by a hot water system operated by a coal-fired boiler. The Hospital was also equipped with electric-ity throughout and an elevator that was raised and lowered by pulling on an inside rope. Ten years later, an electric elevator was installed.

Louis Schneck served as President of thecompany. In the dedication speech of the hospital on March 23, 1911, Mr. Ben Schneck gave the address on behalf of his mother, and emphasized the fact that all be given fair treatment and in this vein he read the following from the deed of conveyance: \"This conveyance is made as a gratuity but upon these conditions; That the property herein described and the building situated theron are to be used exclusively as a hospital for the relief and accomodation from the public, without discrimination on account of nationality, or religion or other beliefs, and that in management of such hospital no favoritism shall be shown to one school of medicine or another and that the grantee and its officers and its successors, in the ownership and control of the property, shall not derive or retain any pecuniary profit from such use. The hospital will not be a money making institution and as it becomes self-sustaining the income will be devoted to charity service.\" In 1929 the Seymour Clinic Building was constructed at the northeast corner of Second and Walnut streets. Drs. Graessle, Gillespie, Osterman, and Salb oper - ated the clinic in addition to their private practices. The clinic offered additional medical equipment, centrally located in Seymour. Medical Clinic Valuable Asset to Community The new Seymour clinic was a valuable asset to the community and was a for - ward step looking to the improvement and conservation of public health. The interior of the building was one of the most attractive as well as one of the most complete buildings of this type to be found in Hoosierdom. Those who saw the building expressed the opinion that, \"Few cities the size of Seymour are favored with the establishment of an institution of this extent.\" The central feature of the building was a luxuriously fitted reception room. The exterior of the building was unusually attractive, being of Bedford stone stucco MARCH 16, 1917 TOTAL RECEIPTS $6,597.42 TOTAL EXPENSES $5,306.99 FEBRUARY 1918 Wards $2.00 /day Major Operations $10.00 Minor Operations $5.00 Medications Actual Cost Meals $.75 Mary Schneck donated property directly across from the German Methodist Church, which was located on the northwest corner of Brown and Poplar streets.A LEGACY OF EXCELLENCE 7 Seymour Clinic Building Dedicated to Community Service Friday, November 1, 1929.The luxuriously fitted reception area of the Seymour Clinic.1911-1940 The Brownstown Water and Light Company completed arrangements for building a transmission line to Crothersville, by way of Tampico, to supply those towns with electrical current for lights and power. Jackson County received two of the new \"Main Mar- ket Highways.\" One of the routes was known as the north and south route and extended from South Bend to Louisville. The other route extended across the county and was known as the east and west route. It extended from Lawrenceburg to Bedford. These two highways would become U.S. 31 and U.S. 50.Titanic set sail on her maiden voyage from Southamp - ton to New Y ork.

Clinic Equipment has Many Features to Add Efficiency It is doubtful if any city in the United States the size of Seymour had a clinic as well equipped to handle the wide range of services called upon to render as the Seymour Clinic. It is true that a few of the larger cities had extensively equipped clinics in addition to their hospitals, but it is quite out of the ordinary for one of the smaller cities to have a clinic operated upon the scale planned for Seymour's clinic. One outstanding feature of the equipment was the extensive laboratory facili- ties. Half the second floor of the building was devoted to the installation of lab-oratory equipment, which was under the direction of Dr. O. Salb, experienced chemist and bacteriologist of the clinic. A substantial medical library was also located on the second floor. Not only were their works on medical subjects, but also leading periodicals with the latest medical information. The x-ray department, under the direction of Dr. Graessle, was complete and most modern, being equipped for needed types of x-ray work and for fluo-roscopic diagnosis. A physiotherapy department contained the most modern equipment for this branch of practice and special basal metabolism equipment marked the clinic as modern and thorough. The department devoted to the treatment of diseases of the eye, ear, nose and throat, under the direction of Dr. Gillespie, also contained modern equipment. The standard machines for examinations and diagnosis were found together with special equipment such as heat lamps, quartz lamps, and a well equipped operating room. As need appeared, the clinic saw the addition of other devices, so that at all times they had at hand modern and complete equipment.

The services of a County Health Nurse were provided by funds from the local Red Cross chapter. Miss Blanche Pegg, from Western Reserve College, Cleveland Ohio, arrived in Seymour on February 1 to begin her duties. She spent most of her time visiting the schools of the county and suggesting methods conducive to the health of the children. A contract with the County Commissioners to provide free hospital services to the county's poor was approved at the meeting of August 3, 1922. The March 6, 1930 Annual Meeting reported that 409 patients had been admit- ted the previous year. C. D. Billings and C. H. Wiethoff were apppointed to purchase adequate insurance for the Hospital building and properties, which were appraised at $50,000. Mrs. Louise P . Schneck made a kind gift of a home adjoining the hospital and known as the Kasting residence which she purchased and deeded to the Board of Trustees. The property become the Nurses Home and was formally opened on October 24, 1921 with a public reception.

The cost of fuel for the new diesel powered locomotive was 15 cents per mile. Early in 1939, the Fair Association sought a perma- nent home for the fair. On February 6, the Board of Commissioners gave approval for a $25,000 WPA project to rebuild the old county fair grounds, then a part of the County Poor Farm, east of Brownstown.AROUND TOWN...Jazz was the music of popular choice and some of the best known musicians were jazz musicians includ-ing Duke Ellington and Al Jolson. One other popular musician was George Gershwin, composer, many of his songs are still recorded and listened to today. A popular dance of the times was the Charleston. At the end of the 20s after a time of excesses in all areas, the stock market crash on Black Thursday October 24, 1929, caused the start of The Great Depression. 1937 Walt Disney's first full-length animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, hit theaters and became an instant classic.REMEMBER WHEN...

Newspaper clippings dated January 17 and February 25, 1933 reported crowd-ed conditions in the Hospital, partially due to the increasing number of charity cases (140 in 1932). Remodeling of the basement added a men's ward and a private room, bringing the total number of beds to 23. On January 7, 1937, F. H. Montgomery was elected trustee to fill the unexpired term of Charles DeGraff Billings who died on December 18, 1936. Louis R. Cordes was elected trustee to fill the unexpired term of his father C. H. Cordes who resigned. D. A. Bollinger was elected president of the board to fill the unexpired term of C. D. Billings. At the January 29, 1938 meeting, construction of another addition to the Hos- pital was addressed as the number of patients far exceeded the facility capac-ity. The Hospital board met with the City Council in February of that year to determine if a WPA grant could be obtained for the addition. As an increasing number of charity cases put a financial strain on the Hospital, the board began examining management and responsibility alternatives. In August of 1938, board president D. A. Bollinger proposed that the Hospital be taken over by the County to assume responsibility for maintenance of the institution under provision of Indiana law. If approved, the property would be turned over to the County and be under the supervision of a non-partisan board appointed by the County Commissioners. In the discussions, it was debated whether to add on to the Hospital's south side or to construct a new unit on the east side. The physicians favored constructing a new unit and agreed that the Hospital be turned over to the County. At the meeting on September 13, 1938, a plan for takeover was approved.10 SCHNECK 100 YEARS DECADES OF EXCELLENCE In the crowded nursery, it was often necessary to place babies on the low shelves of the bassinets.

After the property had been conveyed and the addition completed, the present corporation would lease from the county the Hospital and manage it.2. That the property would be conveyed to Jackson County with the provision that, after the addition to the Hospital was completed, it would be managed by a Board of Trustees composed of eight persons, five to be appointed by the County Commissioners to serve without pay, four Republicans and four Democrats, with one half of the members residing in Jackson Township and the other half from other parts of the county in order that all parts were represented.That both propositions contain the provision that the name be retained. On May 13, 1940, the county assumed responsiblity for the Hospital. A new Board of Directors appointed by the Jackson County Commissioners began op-eration of Jackson County Schneck Memorial Hospital on October 1 of that year. Eighty thousand dollars raised by a bond issue enabled the construction of a three-story addition, which brought the total number of beds to 49. The nurses' home was moved one lot further east for the construction. Ralph W. Keyes served as administrator of the hospital from December 26, 1947 to January 1, 1968. During the service of his administration, the first complete x-ray and laboratory departments were established at the hospital, the first PBX telephone system was installed and the first dietician was employed. He also es-tablished the first hospital pharmacy, and physical therapy and inhalation therapy departments. Soon after the start of Seymour radio station WJCD April of 1950, Mr. Keyes instituted his hospital program, broadcasting for fifteen minutes each weekday at 10:00 a.m. During his 20 years, he did some 313 broadcasts per year.

The banquet and meeting were given by the medical staff in recognition of the nursing and technical staff of the hospital. Dr. B. W. Thayer, of North Vernon, turned over the duties of chief of staff to Dr. H. P. Graessle, of Seymour, who had been recently elected to that office for the coming year. Dr. Graessle's first act as president was to honor and to present parchment scrolls to the five doctors who represented 279 years of accumulated active service. Lauded by Dr. Graessle were Dr. William H. Stemm, of North Vernon, who had practiced 67 years; Dr. George H. Kamman, of Seymour, who had practiced 54 years; Dr. C. E. Gillespie, of Seymour, who had practiced 53 years; Dr. David Joseph Cummings, of Brownstown, who had practiced 53 years; and Dr. Dennis W. Matthews, of North Vernon, who had practiced 52 years. The parchment scrolls, which bore an emblem and pictured a doctor in a horse and buggy crossing a bridge, were inscribed: \"In honor to you, we subscribe our names with deep humility and devotion in recognition of your over 50 years of service in the practice of medicine. May we each one in our town follow the example thus nobly exemplified.\" Ralph W. Keyes, hospital administrator, spoke on behalf of the nurses and oth- er personnel, thanked the doctors for their hospitality and introduced: James L. Rogers and Mrs. Rogers; E. M.

This increase would lead to the Foundation's drive to add a new wing to the hospital. The county had launched another drive to raise money, by pledge, to build a much needed wing for the Schneck Memorial Hospital. On May 12, 1954, Dr. D. J. Cummings turned the first spade of dirt for the new wing. There was an oversubscription of a goal of $850,000 for the enlargement program. An amount over $855,700.92 was received. 1953 was the first time a physician was invited to attend Board meeetings.

Blizzard of 1978 Jackson County Hospital had a new appreciation of the community. During this storm, the hospital was thrown into an emergency situation. George James faced problems of how to care for patients already hospitalized and be ready for un-foreseen emergencies with a reduced staff. Many evening and night shift employees stayed after their shift and some walked several blocks through the blizzard to reach the hospital. One employee's hus-band returning from work in Columbus became stranded at the hospital and spent the next two days helping wherever needed. Only one dietary employee was able to make it to the hospital, making it a prob- lem to feed the patients. Thanks to this one employee and volunteers from other departments, the hospital was able to serve cereal, toast, pastries and beverages. A hospital neighbor assisted until more of the kitchen employees were trans-ported to the hospital. The hospital switchboard was flooded with calls, not only from employees no- tifying that they were digging out and trying to get to work, but also from many community residents who were volunteering their time so the hospital could function in such a paralyzing winter storm. Many employees found it necessary to remain at the hospital, not only to staff the facility, but also because they were unable to get home. The hospital provided sleeping facilities and meals around the clock for the working shifts and for those employees who were unable to leave the hospital. Mr. George James, adminstrator, began in March of 1968 and served until August 2001.16 SCHNECK 100 YEARS DECADES OF EXCELLENCE Julie Thompson, Dr. Mark Bevers, and Blanche Meek treat Wilma Cole in the ER. The Medical Staff, pictured in 1983. The 1980s could be characterized as a decade of growth for our community. Jackson County experienced an influx of industry, the population increased, and attitudes that go hand-in-hand with economic growth changed. The health-care industry, on a national and local level, underwent transition as changes in the medical reimbursement system forced all hospitals to become more com-petitive and market driven. Success was no longer measured purely on how many patients were in the hospital. Outpatient volume and specialized treament capabilites had to be considered. Research and planning enabled Schneck to strengthen its image, improve per - formance, increase awareness levels, identify consumer needs, and create the programs and services to meet those needs. The Ambulatory Care Center was developed as demand shifted from inpatient to outpatient services... diagnostic technology was expanded... emergency services were strengthened... a home care program was created and a convenient satellite center was established in Brownstown. Being an Outpatient is \"In\" Nearly 50% of all surgical procedures previously classified as \"inpatient\" were handled on an outpatient basis. This translated into two major benefits for pa-tients: lower cost, and with no overnight stays, less time. The Ambulatory Care Center handled many outpatient surgical procedures, including cataract and laser surgery. The center was equipped with a variety of diagnositc tools (some with video capabilities) that allowed physicians to explore and treat many health problems without having to perform surgery. Physical therapy, diagnostic testing, and many routine lab tests and x-rays were also offered on an outpatient basis. Specialty clinics for urology, neurology, cardiology, and thoracic-vascular problems were established. The Speech, Language, and Hearing Center of-fered a comprehensive program for treating communication disorders in both children and adults. The Cancer Services Center offered the expertise of a visit-ing oncologist, chemotherapy treatments, nutritional counseling, and a series of support groups designed to meet the special needs of cancer patients.How much did you pay?

Memorial Hospital offered MRI and CT scans several days a week through visiting mobile units. Echocardiography, a procudure that uses ultrasound to visualize the chambers of the heart, was another addition to the diagnostic technology. Capabilities included x-ray, nuclear medicine, ultrasound, and mammography. Bringing Up Baby The obstetrics department underwent a $90,000 \"facelift\". Purchases included a new birthing bed, furniture, carpet, wall coverings, and window treatments. Nursery monitoring capabilities were expanded and a sophisticated headwall system, which hides oxygen, vacuum, and other connecting outlets behind a rolling screen, was also installed. The \"Bundle of Joy\" program was designed to encourage prospective parents to actively participate in planning for the birth of their baby. The program fea-tured a series of prenatal, exercise, and sibling classes; special programs such as the \"Maternity Tea\" and Two\" candelight seat loaner program; and a number of special gifts. There's No Place Like Home Memorial Hospital's Home Health Care program was formed as a cost-effec-tive alternative to extended hospitalization. The goal of the program was to help patients do as much for themselves as possible while maintaining dignity in their lives. Neighborhood Network The Brownstown Health Services Center opened in the spring of 1989 to pro-vide a number of medical services for residents of western Jackson County. The center offered physical therapy, x-ray, laboratory, and Home Health Care. The Olympic Torch passed through Jackson County in May 1984. The torch traveled from New Y ork to Indianapolis en route to Los Angeles. Timing was ar-ranged so that it could be featured in the Indianapolis 500 Festival Parade before following Highway 31 south from Reddington to Crothersville and on to Scott County.AROUND TOWN...Basketball: During the 80s new stars emerge - Larry Bird, Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Michael Jordan, drawing fans back to the games.

Groub, donated the Serenity Garden at the Cancer Center Heliport In June of 2004, Schneck opened a new heliport, located on the grounds of the facility. The new heliport was a critically needed addition to the community. Until that point, trauma patients had to be transported by ambulance to Free-man Field and an awaiting helicopter. This procedure took valuable, lifesaving time. The new heliport enabled the most critically ill or injured patient to be transported directly from Schneck. The Schneck Foundation spearheaded the community fund drive for the heli- port project raising nearly $200,000. Convenient Care In the first decade of the new century, Schneck opened three Convenient Care facilities in North Vernon, Scottsburg, and Salem. Convenient Care is a walk-in, prompt care medical facility designed to bring an unmatched level of conve-nience to quality medical care in the community. Open 10 hours a day, 6 days a week, board-certified physicians are available through appointments or walk in. Either way, patients receive the finest medical care available from experi-enced physicians and a highly trained staff. Promoting optimal health for the whole family, with general and specific servic-es, Convenient Care takes care of all your health needs\u2014from babies through seniors. Convenient Care also offers laboratory services and diagnostic imaging capabilities that are typically found only in a much larger medical setting. Schneck Cancer Center On August 5, 2007 Schneck opened its new Cancer Center. The facility united the Medical Center's clinical, education, and outreach activities under one roof. The Cancer Center employs 21st century technology in a visually calming en-vironment, so patients can avoid traveling to other locations for treatment. The Center features a premier outpatient oncology center. Radiation oncology and medical oncology are available along with Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) - technology that allows for more precise delivery of radiation to a tumor while sparing nearby normal tissues. 64-slice Lightspeed CT imaging system allows doctors to more accurately diagnose a wider variety of patient conditions. The advanced technology of the Signa HDx 1.5T MRI provides shorter exams and greater comfort for patients, while providing higher diagnostic confidence for doctors. The Discovery ST PET/CT system provides physicians with more sensitivity, speed, resolution, and diagnostic confidence when treating cancer patients. Breast MRI, an extremely powerful imaging tool in evaluating mammogram abnormalities and identifying early breast cancer. Selenia Digital Mammography provides revolutionary breast imaging technology. Definium AMX 700 Mobile Digital Imaging system helps doctors make, quick, confident diagnoses in the critical minutes after a traumatic event, when every second counts. Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) - a new technology that allows for more precise delivery of radiation to a tumor while sparing nearby normal tissues. Discovery Digital Dexa Bone Densitometry - the most widely recognized method in clinical precision and accuracy in bone mass measurement.STATE-OF-THE ART TECHNOLOGYA LEGACY OF EXCELLENCE 21 2001-2010 The first Convenient Care was opened September 2002 in North Vernon.Schneck's state-of-the-art five story tower and outpatient center opened August 2008. Taking Healthcare to a Whole New Level For generations, Schneck Medical Center has been committed to providing the most advanced care for the communities it serves. On July 28, 2008 Schneck again delivered on that promise with the opening of its newly expanded healthcare facility. The expansion added 84,000 square feet of new space, as well as 90,000 square feet of renovated space, nearly doubling the size of the existing facility. In addition to being the only hospital in the region to offer all private rooms, Schneck's expanded facilities feature specialized areas of service including: Outpatient Center The new state-of-the-art outpatient center offers a broad range of healthcare services and clinics, including diagnostic imaging, a pain center, cardiac rehab, and infusion therapy. Schneck also provides same-day surgery suites, enabling patients to check in and receive nearly all the care they need - including educa-tion and recovery - in one convenient setting. Pain Center Schneck offers the only hospital-based pain center in the area dedicated to the effective treatment and management of pain. The center's expansion offers more flexibility and space, and is better equipped to accommodate patient needs. Diagnostic Imaging The newly designed imaging department is equipped with the latest digital im-aging technology to provide greater patient comfort and privacy. A new Wom-en's Imaging Center offers one central location for mammograms, dexascans, ultrasounds and stereotactic breast biopsies, and provides the ultimate in patient comfort and privacy. Emergency Department The expanded emergency department offers larger trauma rooms with more ad-vanced monitoring equipment, two dedicated pediatric exam rooms, an isolation room, an enclosed ambulance garage, a decontamination area, and a fast-track area for patients with less serious injuries and illnesses. Lab Designed for ease of access and increased efficiency, the lab offers outpatient phlebotomy services in an area separate from the main laboratory. Other servic-es include specimen collection, drug-testing, and phlebotomy services specific to local nursing homes. October 2010, 96.3 WJAA in Seymour was looking for a way to help fight breast cancer. Then a light bulb went on. A pink light bulb. Partnering with the Schneck Foundation, they developed Pink Houses. Their idea was simple: convince businesses in the area to sell pink light bulbs to promote breast health and early detection. \"The goal of Pink Houses was to bathe the community in pink lights during October to send out the message to women everywhere to have their breasts checked regularly. \"The general idea was to generate a groundswell of support. This was a simple thing anyone could do,\" said Tony Starkey, WJAA Sales Manager. And sell they did! The Pink Houses Campaign raised $12,755 which was donated to the Schneck Foundation Cancer Fund. The donation will help fund the Schneck Cancer Center's free clinical breast exam program.PINK HOUSES2010 Statistics Admissions & Observations 5,440 Surgical Procedures 5,075 ED Visits 25,070 Births 727 Patient Days 15,578 Laboratory Tests 714,199 Radiology Tests 22,763 Hospice Visits 6,874 Hours of Volunteer Service 16,000 Community Benefit $10,077,30222 SCHNECK 100 YEARS Quality trumps everything in healthcare. Whether you are a patient seeking care, a physician caring for a patient, or a hospital providing for a community\u2014quality is more important than cost, ambience, or any other measurable characteristic. Schneck's goals of demonstrated quality, operational efficiency, and fiscal responsibility have been and continue to be validated by outside impartial reviewers. We are proud of these distinctions and consider them to be a demonstration of our commitment to bringing the highest level of care to the communities we serve.SCHNECK'S QUALITY OF CARE The goal of demonstrating quality at Schneck has been validated by the American Nurses Credentialing Center as we have achieved Magnet Recogni- tion for nursing excellence. Magnet designation signifies that Schneck Medi-cal Center's nurses have high levels of education, adhere to the highest pro-fessional standards, and provide the best patient care. Independent studies of Magnet hospitals show that patients have shorter lengths of stay, higher sat-isfaction, higher nurse-to-patient ratios and lower mortality rates. Nurses are more satisfied with their work and Mag- net recognition strengthens nursing re-cruitment and retention efforts. MAGNET NURSING RECOGNITION Schneck Medical Center has been named an American Society for Bariatric Surgery Center of Excellence by the Surgical Review Corporation, an organization dedicated to pursuing surgical excellence in the delivery of bariatric surgical care.BARIATRIC SURGERY CENTER OF EXCELLENCE A LEGACY OF EXCELLENCE 23 Schneck's Cancer Center has been honored for excellence as the recipient of a Commendation from the Commission on Cancer (COC) by the American College of Surgeons. Receiving care at a CoC-accredited program ensures that a patient will have access to: Comprehensive care, including a range of state-of-the-art services and equipment Multispecialty, team approach to coordinate the best treatment options Information about ongoing clinical trails and new treatment options Cancer-related information, education, and support Cancer registry that collects data on type and stage of cancers and treatment results and offers lifelong patient follow-up Ongoing monitoring and improvement of care Quality care close to homeCOMMENDATION FROM THE COMMISSION ON CANCER Schneck is among the twenty-percent that have received Chest Pain Center Accreditation by the Society of Chest Pain Centers. The Chest Pain Center at Schneck has demonstrated its expertise and commit-ment to quality patient care by meeting or exceeding a wide set of strin-gent criteria. Schneck's Chest Pain Center protocol driven and systematic approach to patient management allows physicians to reduce time to treatment dur - ing the critical early stages of a heart attack, when treatments are most effective, and to better monitor patients when it is not clear whether they are having a coronary event. Such observation helps ensure that a patient is neither sent home too early nor needlessly admitted.ACCREDITED CHEST PAIN CENTER Since 1951, The Joint Commission has set the standard for healthcare by ex-amining hospitals' services and quality of care at every level. Schneck consistently meets and exceeds stringent guidelines that assess the level of quality care. FULLY ACCREDITED BY THE JOINT COMMISSIONSchneck's MRI, Mammography, and Nuclear Medicine ser - vices have been accredited by the American College of Ra- diology (ACR). The ACR awards accreditation to facilities for the achievement of high practice standards and follows a strict process including review of operation policies, staff and physician training, quality assurance, image review, and patient safety practices, to determine those sites that will become accredited. An accreditation demonstrates a com-mitment to the highest level of patient care, and cutting-edge technology. ACCREDITED IN MRI, MAMMOGRAPHY, & NUCLEAR MEDICINE Schneck has been recognized as a Best Place to Work by Modern Healthcare magazine and the Indiana Chamber of Commerce.BEST PLACE TO WORKA LEGACY OF EXCELLENCE 25 Anterior Hip Replacement Schneck now has a procedure that can help those suffering from bone and joint problems get their lives back.

Women's Pelvic Health Program at Schneck takes advantage of the most up-to-date diagnostic tools for women suffering from urinary incontinence. Computerized biofeedback. Pelvic floor retraining. Dietary and behavior modification. Latest minimally invasive surgical procedures. 26 SCHNECK 100 YEARSLooking back, Hospital records highlight citizens who have made valuable contributins. Often sev-eral generations of a family continued to serve: Dr. Harold P . Graessle, one of the Hospital's leading surgeons, is a son of the late Dr. G. G. Graessle, the first surgeon on the Hospital's staff. He is the grandfather of George and Jane Graessle who continue to serve Schneck as mem-bers of the Schneck Foundation Development Council and Board. Dr. Louis H. Osterman was a son of Dr. O. G. Osterman, and Dr. Harold Miller was Dr. Oster - man's grandson. Henry Osterman served as a board member for many years. Mr. Arthur Kaufman, president of the Hospital Foundation from its inception until the completion of the $850,000 wing, is a son of Nathan Kauf-man, a member of the first board of directors and a substantial contributor 75 years ago to the first wing. Dr. C. A. Weithoff is the son of C. H. Weithoff, board treasurer of the Hospital for a quarter of a century, and the father of Dr. R. A. Weithoff, a member of Shcneck's medical staff. Mrs. Arthur Kaufman, former president of the second orgazined Jackson County Hospital Guild, followed in the footsteps of her mother-in-law, an original member of the first auxiliary. Ralph W. Keyes, administrator of the Hospital from December 26, 1947, to January 1, 1968, saw the Hospital's first complete x-ray and labo-ratory departments, the first telephone system, Hospital pharmacy department and physical ther - apy and respiratory departments instituted during his progressive tenure. Mr. George James was past administrator March 1968 to August 2001. Under his leadership the $5,000,000 unit was instituted and many more services continued to be developed to enhance the hospital's commitment to quality healthcare for the people of our community. Gary A. Meyer became President and Chief Ex- ecutive Officer of Schneck Medical Center in Au-gust 2001. Under Meyer's leadership, Schneck, while remaining steadfast in its mission to provide quality healthcare, experienced a dynamic trans-formation. Highlighted by a $60 million expansion and renovation project completed in 2009, which includes a state-of-the-art Cancer Center and Out-patient Care Center and Emergency Department, Schneck has secured a reputation for quality med-ical care and leadership in patient-centered initia-tives. Schneck became a Magnet Nursing facility, received commendation from the Commission on Cancer, Chest Pain accreditation, named a Bariat-ric Surgery Center of Excellence, and continues to be accredited by The Joint Commission. Schneck is also a recipient of the Indiana Chamber of Com-merce Best Place to Work in Indiana and Modern Healthcare's Best Place to Work in Healthcare.OVER THE YEARSSERVICESPROVIDED Schneck Medical Center has been a leader in the provision of progressive healthcare in southern Indiana for 100 years.

The commitment goes back to 1910 when Mary Schneck donated land and funds to open the doors of a 17-bed hospital named Schneck Memorial Hospital. The hospital's mission was to pro- vide quality healthcare with compassion for the citizens of the community. Today, a century later, Schneck Medical Center re- mains true to that original commitment. As the needs of the community grew, so did the hospital\u2014both in size and stature. Services rapidly increased in complexity. The Schneck Foundation has played a key role in fulfilling the needs of Schneck since its inception in 1953 as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization\u2014its mission to develop relationships and financial resources in support of Schneck Medical Center. A mission, that with your partnership, the Schneck Foundation is determined to keep. The value of people like you\u2014enabling us to build on our commitment of caring and healing\u2014cannot be measured.

A Salute to Dr. Bud was published in the Seymour Daily Tribune on October 10, 1977 posthumously; He lights his pipe and tells his story. Learning the business of caring for the sick as a young boy, hitching up the horse and buggy to take his father on house calls. The air becomes filled with Doc Bud's presence. He is deliberate, calm, caring. Thousand of his patients remember this, as he ministered to their needs at all hours of the day and night for nearly half a century. The unexpected house calls after illness or surgery, his just stopping by to see how they were doing. Despite failing eyesight, he still made daily visits to the hospital and returned to his beloved Reelfoot Lake every spring. Full of people stories and fish stories wherever he went, it is hard to imagine any- one who had not sensed that knowing H. P. Graessle, they had brushed shoulders with humanity. There are hundreds of stories revolving around the life of this in-credible man. Some of the family favorites are he always wanted to have dessert first - in case he had to go on a medical call. Wouldn't want to miss a delicious piece of pie or cake... He would sit on the screened porch at the cabin he so dearly loved and would look down to the lake and inform all there were geese on the water...failing eye sight? He was a devoted Cincinnati Red's fan and made it a point to listen to every broadcast. An avid fisherman, he could tell a fish story with the best of them and would at the drop of a hat. His yearly trips to Reelfoot Lake meant the world to him, but before he would even begin fishing, he visited the indigent residents around the lake and provided free medical care. He derived as much satisfaction in performing this service as catching a large bass. Dr. Bud was a good and compassionate man who impacts Jackson County to this day. His presence lives on in the guise of the Dr. Bud Scholarship Golf Tournament which raised thousands of dollars in scholarship money to local nursing students. He would be very proud to know that he has again helped so many achieve their goals. "}
