BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON: PART I NEW SECTION. Sec. 101. The legislature finds and declares that the people of the state of Washington expect to live in a healthful environment, and expect to have access to an appropriate quality of health care at an affordable cost. The economic and social vitality of the state are dependent on a healthy and productive population. The legislature further finds that preservation of health requires action by individual citizens and action by the government to promote healthful ways of life, to prevent disease and injury, and to reduce or eliminate risks and hazards to health. Most public health services are delivered by local communities and the legislature finds it important to encourage participation by, and joint operating efforts with and among, local health departments. The legislature recognizes the need for a strong and clear focus on health issues in the state government to give expression to the needs and concerns of individual citizens and local communities. The legislature intends to create such a focus by creating a single department of state government with a primary responsibility for the preservation of public health, the maintenance of minimum standards of health quality in the delivery of health care, control of costs, and general oversight and planning for all of the state's activities as they relate to the health of the state's population. NEW SECTION. Sec. 102.

The department shall provide leadership, regulatory control, and policy development in areas of cost containment, public health, access to care, and quality assessment.

(3) It is also the intent of the legislature that the department be organized and managed to achieve the following objectives: (a) Prompt and direct access to information and services for the department's clients; (b) An organizational design based on simplicity, clear lines of authority, and a reasonable span of management control; (c) In accordance with the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW, an opportunity for consultation, review, and comment by the department's clients before the adoption of standards, guidelines, and rules; and (d) Other such objectives as may be appropriate.
