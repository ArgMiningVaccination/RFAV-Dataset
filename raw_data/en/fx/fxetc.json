Abstract Introduction: The novel SARS CoV2 coronavirus is believed to have emerged from bats in Wuhan in 2019 last yearAs of July 8, 2021, 20 vaccines worldwide have been licensed; 96 vaccines are in human clinical trials, 32 of which have entered the final stage of test- ing. VLP proved to be a promising alternative to soluble antigens. Because they have the conformation and composition of natural viruses, their shape, size, repeated antigen structure and geometry will trigger stronger humoral and cellular immune responses. Plants have a complex mechanism for eukaryotic protein production and also support the amplification of a large number of plant- specific viruses. Method: 35 articles from Medline, Embase, Google Scholar, Scopus. PubMed were reviewed using the key words SARS CoV-2 plant- based vaccines. Review: Virus-like particles (VLPs) are self-assembling structures derived from viral antigens, which mimic the natural structure of viruses but lack the viral genome. VLPs are similar in size and shape to real coronaviruses, but they lack nucleic acid and are there- fore not infectious. The Phase 1 trial of Medicago's plant virus-like particles started in July 2020, involving 180 healthy volunteers aged 1855. All preparations are well tolerated, and adverse events after vaccination are usually mild to moderate. British American Tobacco, through its US biotechnology subsidiary Kentucky Bioprocessing (KBP), is developing a potential COVID19 vaccine and is currently undergoing preclinical testing. Using its plant-based Fast Pharming\u00ae system, iBio, a biotechnology innovator and biolog- ics contract manufacturing organization, reported on its progress in the development of the second-generation vaccine candidate subunit IBIO202, which aims to prevent SARSCoV2 infection. Conclusion: Now is the time to explore the true potential of plant-based vaccines, proven technologies that have the potential to play an important role in promoting global health.

Crossing the species barrier, it enters humans through human-to-human transmission and in- fection. In the past 20 years, -coronavirus has jumped between species and caused three outbreaks of zoonotic diseases, namely SARS CoV (2002-03), MERSCoV (2012) and SARSCoV-2 (2019 to present). Since its emergence in November 2019, although WHO and gov - ernments have made meticulous efforts to control the infection, it has spread to 188 countries and 25 regions around the world, mainly due to the highly contagious nature of the virus. As of May 22, 2021, a total of 175,733,110 cases have been reported globally, with 3,791,245 deaths. (World Health Organization, 2020) [1-3]. Since the beginning of the pandemic, efforts have been made across the world to develop vaccines. As of July 8, 2021, 20 vaccines worldwide have been licensed; 96 vaccines are in human clinical trials, 32 of which have entered the final stage of testing. At least 77 animal preclinical vaccines are under active research. Most of the COVID19 vaccine candidates administered with viral antigens or viral gene sequences are designed to induce neutraliz - ing antibodies against the viral pico protein (S), avoiding uptake through the human ACE2 receptor, thereby blocking infection [4]. Figure 1 Vaccines and candidate vaccines are not only notable for their number, but also for their diversity, including traditional (such as inactivated virus particles, live attenuated vaccines, and protein + adjuvants) and new types (such as replicating mRNA, DNA, and ad- juvants), vira vectors and non-replicating platform [5-7].S.no Vaccine Type - naty)RNAPfizer/BioN - Tech 13 of India 14 15Inactivated (Vero Cells)InactivatedSinopharm (Wuhan) National Pharmaceutical Group 17 TAK-919 RNATakeda Pharmaceutical Company Table 1: Vaccines approved for emergency use for COVID 19 in various countries.

Results and Discussion Plant based virus like particles COVID 19 vaccines Virus-like particles (VLP) are self-assembled structures derived from viral antigens, which mimic the natural structure of viruses but lack the viral genome. Due to its safety, immunogenicity and manufacturing advantages, VLP has become the premier vaccine platform. The particle nature and high-density presentation of vi- ral framework proteins on its surface also make VLP an attractive carrier for displaying foreign epitopes. Due to its safety, immunoge- nicity and manufacturing advantages, VLP has become the premier vaccine platform. VLP proved to be a promising alternative to soluble antigens. Because they have the conformation and composition of natural viruses, their shape, size, repeated antigen structure and geometry will trigger stronger humoral and cellular immune responses [8- 10]. Plant viruses are non-enveloped particles composed of sim- ple proteins, which can be produced in complex forms in various ways. Therefore, plant cells can efficiently produce protein viruses with very precise 3D structures, including VLPs. As a result, sev - eral VLP-based vaccines have been approved for human use and have achieved significant clinical and economic success. Initial attempts were made to produce vaccines using tobacco plants to express antibodies. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) approved the world's first plant-based vaccine for poultry against Newcastle disease virus (NDV) [11,12] . It has been proven to provide more than 90% protection for chickens. The only au- thorized plant-derived product is a single-chain fragment variable monoclonal antibody (scFv mAb) made from plants, which is used to produce a recombinant vaccine against hepatitis B virus (HBV) in Cuba [13,14] . The herbal vaccine against COVID19 was developed by express - ing the antigenic components of SARSCoV2 to induce active immu- nity or expressing antibodies against the virus to provide passive protection. Part of the SARSCoV2 virus that causes COVID19 is replicated and inserted into plants for rapid reproduction. These plants are then harvested to remove the inactive virus \"lumps\" and chemically attach them to microscopic nanoparticles as carriers or carriers to form vaccine antigens that stimulate the immune re- sponse in the body [15,16] . Canadian biopharmaceutical company Medicago successfully developed virus-like particles (VLPs) of the coronavirus 20 days after obtaining the SARSCoV2 gene sequence. The gene sequence encoding the COVID 19 spike protein was introduced into Agro- bacterium, a common soil bacterium. The resulting plant produces a virus-like particle composed of a plant lipid membrane and the COVID19 spike protein. Medicago is using Nicotiana benthami - ana, a close relative of the tobacco plant, to produce VLPs for the SARSCoV2 virus. VLP is similar to the real coronavirus in size and shape, but it lacks nucleic acid, so it is not infectious [16-18] . The first phase of Medicago's plant virus-like particles began in July 2020, involving 180 healthy volunteers aged 1855. The vac- cine is administered in two intramuscular injection doses of 3.75 \u00b5g, 7.5 \u00b5g or 15 \u00b5g, with an interval of 21 days, with each injection of CpG1018 adjuvant, AS03 or no adjuvant. CpG 1018 and AS03 are compounds commonly added to vaccines to induce a stronger im- mune response in the body. All preparations are well tolerated, and adverse events after vaccination are usually mild to moderate. Ac- cording to their results, in addition to ASO3, a two-dose regimen with a concentration of 3.75 g showed the best results, and these results have been in phase 2/3 trials in Canada and the United States [19]. British American Tobacco, through its US biotechnology sub- sidiary Kentucky Bioprocessing (KBP), is developing a potential COVID19 vaccine and is currently undergoing preclinical testing. KBP experts cloned part of the SARSCoV2 gene sequence, and they used it to develop a potential antigen that was inserted into the to- bacco plant for production. The vaccine passed the preclinical test and the immune response was positive, and it is about to enter the human phase 1 clinical trial. In this study, a total of 180 healthy volunteers were recruited, divided into two age groups, 1849 years old and 5070 years old. Then each group will be subdivided into low-dose and high-dose treatment groups (N ~ 45) and randomly receive a low dose (15 g KBPCOVID19 vaccine + 0.5 mg adjuvant) or placebo, or a high dose ( 45 g KBPCOVID19) vaccine + 0.5 mg adjuvant) or placebo. The results of the study are expected to be ob- tained in mid-2021. If the results are positive, they will be allowed to proceed to the second phase of regulatory approval [20,21] .

IBIO201 is the company's vaccine candidate. It combines an antigen derived from the spike protein (\"Protein S\") with iBio's proprietary LicKM enhancement mol- ecule, and recently completed an IND activation toxicology study. These studies did not find low-dose or high-dose adverse reactions. The company also reported the development of IBIO202, a vaccine candidate subunit for the nucleocapsid protein (\"N protein\") of SARSCoV2. The N protein of many coronaviruses is highly immuno- genic and is expressed in large quantities during infection. iBio has successfully expressed the protein N antigen and initiated intra- muscular and intranasal preclinical studies to determine a favor - able combination of antigen adjuvants. Results are expected early in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Immunization with more conser - vative sequences (such as the N protein) is expected to produce T cells, which can kill spike protein variant viruses in addition to the parent virus. The IBIO202 protein N strategy is a complement to the existing first generation protein S targeted vaccine and may be suitable as a more general coronavirus vaccine [22]. Akdeniz University in southern Turkey's Antalya province has developed a drug and vaccine candidate that can also be used as a protective spray against the new coronavirus. The protein pro- duced by the \"transient plant expression system\" in the leaves of a tobacco plant called \"Nicotiana benthamiana\" is used as the ba - sis of medicine. According to a study, the reduction of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) in the body blocked by the COVID19 virus can cause serious human health problems, noting that most intensive care patients have a small amount of this enzyme unit. With the help of a transient plant expression system, the research- ers achieved a high yield of this enzyme. These proteins that we produce from plants can be used in spray and injection treatment forms. The research is still in the preclinical stage [22]. Two other drug candidates from the University of Shiraz (Iran) and the Baiya Phytopharm/Chula Vaccine Research Center (Thai - land) are in the preclinical stage and use the plant as an expression system and are in the preclinical stage.19Plant-based Vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 Novel Corona Virus - A Review Citation: Lakshmi Jyothi Tadi., et al. \"Plant-based Vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 Novel Corona Virus - A Review\". Acta Scientific Women's Health 3.10 (2021): 15-20.Conclusion Plant-derived VLP have several advantages over tra- ditional vaccines, including cost-effectiveness and the ideal choice for large-scale production, as well as the stability of antigens in long-term storage. Plant-produced vaccines have been shown to elicit strong immune responses in humans and animals. However, there are few risk factors associated with herbal vaccines. Allergic; Compared to natural plant pathogens, genetically modified prod - ucts can undergo different post-translational modifications. This can cause a new allergic reaction in the host during vaccination. At the same time, the use of adjuvants can induce hypersensitiv - ity reactions. Inconsistent doses: Insufficient amounts of antigen may not produce the necessary immune response needed to pre- vent fatal diseases. The wrong frequency or the wrong dose can lead to tolerance and reduce the effectiveness of certain vaccine candidates. With advances in technology and sufficient preclinical and clinical trials, these limitations can be overcome. The approved plant-based influenza vaccine brings hope to the potential of the plant-based COVID19 vaccine. Plant-derived virus particle vaccines have been proven effective against SARS-CoV-1. Therefore, plant- derived VLP vaccine is an effective method against SARS-CoV-2. It takes five to six weeks to produce vaccines through chicken embryo technology and is widely used by many vaccine manufacturers. This duration may be limited by herbal vaccines that only require five to six weeks. Now is the time to explore the true potential of herbal vaccines, as they are a proven technology that has the poten- tial to play an important role in promoting global health. However, it is expected that you will receive a cost-effective vaccine with little or no side effects and at least more than 85% protective levels.
