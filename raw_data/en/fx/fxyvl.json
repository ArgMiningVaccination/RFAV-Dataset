Brain Therapy was a key factor in hockey star Sidney Crosby's recovery from concussion.

'Touching the Brain' also works on the second brain, your gut brain . It alleviates disfunction within the small and large intestines.

It uses a light energy touch to obtain harmony and re-balance-electrical flow in your body! Body Being & Heart (BBH) Somatic Alchemy is the opportunity to embody your spirit.
