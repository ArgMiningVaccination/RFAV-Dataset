Just like we spend time spring cleaning our spaces, it is important to do the same with our health. Below are some helpful points to consider when doing a spring cleaning check on your health: When was the last time you had an appointment with your provider or labs checked? If you haven't, now is a great time to get scheduled or message your provider for an order to get labs done. If you're a PIM patient, [here](https://pimfreeconsult.as.me/schedule.php)is our link to schedule. Check the expirations on your supplements and medications. It is important to keep up-to-date with your supplements and medications because using them past their expiration date may decrease their efficacy. This is also another good reason to check in with your provider to see if you should still be taking the same prescribed regimen. Are you having any new symptoms? Has a symptom gotten worse over time? It is easy to brush off a symptom in the day-to-day busyness of life, however, it may be a good time to discuss any new or worsening symptoms with your provider. Reflect on any changes or health goals you have made: is it time to adjust your goal to make it more attainable? Sometimes if we make too broad or lofty goals, it is easy to lose track of achieving them. Spring is a great time to zero in on any changes that can help bring you closer to your goals and set new ones. Practice gratitude for your current state: whether you are working through the recovery of a particular health issue or learning new healthy habits to prevent disease, be grateful for the attention you have devoted to your health.
