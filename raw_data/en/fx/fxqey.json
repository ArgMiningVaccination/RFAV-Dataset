Many things can cause a weak immune system (immunosuppressed). These include: - cancer treatment - some treatments for autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis (MS) and inflammatory bowel diseases - HIV - if you're not on effective treatment - having an organ transplant or a bone-marrow transplant - if you have a chronic kidney disease and are on dialysis or have an eGFR <30ml/min Non-urgent advice: Contact your GP or doctor urgently if you have a weak immune system and: - you have COVID-19 symptoms, or - you test positive for COVID-19 You may be recommended [medication to treat COVID-19](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/symptoms/treatments-for-covid-19/). Immunosuppressive treatments and steroids Being on immunosuppressive treatments is not known to increase your risk of getting COVID-19. Do not stop or change your medication unless your doctor advises you to. If you stop your medicine without your doctor's advice, you may be more likely to have a flare-up of your condition during this period. Examples of immunosuppressive medicines are: - steroids - biologic agents - methotrexate - azathioprine Steroids If you take steroid tablets every day, you should take extra care to avoid infection. Steroid tablets include prednisolone (Deltacortril). With steroids, it is always important to take the lowest dose needed to control your condition. Check with your doctor if you have questions about the dose you are taking. Keep taking your steroids unless your doctor tells you not to. Stopping steroids suddenly can make you very unwell. If you become unwell due to COVID-19 or another infection, continue to take your steroids. Never start taking steroids unless your doctor tells you to. Other steroids, such as inhalers, do not usually cause immunosuppression. Continue to take these medicines as you normally would. Immunosuppressive treatments (non-steroid) There is currently no evidence that most other immunosuppressive treatments put you at higher risk of severe disease with COVID-19. This includes biologic agents, methotrexate and azathioprine. If you have any questions about medicines you are taking, talk to your GP, pharmacist or neurology team. But, other infections can cause severe illness in people who are on immunosuppressive treatment.
