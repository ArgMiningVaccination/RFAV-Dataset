It is a pleasure to share with you today the work our residents and trainees have been carrying out in children's health research and scholarship. As we continue on our journey to creating a wo rld class children's hospital program, we are committed to providing hope to sick children and their families by carrying out the research that will improve existing treatments and make the discove ries that will lead to new approaches to pediatric diseases. To prepare the next generation of pediatrician s to take part in this mission, each of our trainees is required to carry ou t a mentored project during their training. Coming from diverse backgrounds they can select from a spectrum of projects to best su it their career goals and meet their educational needs. Today they will have the opportunity to present their work to their faculty, peers and other colleagues. Thank you for joining us and showing support to these young investigators. Special thanks also to Dr. Marian Evinger and this year's Organizing Committee (D rs. Fischel, Glaubach, Lane, M. Parker, R. Parker, and Woroniecki) for coordinating the day.

DETERMINANTS OF ANTIBIOTIC SELECTION: AN ANALYSIS OF SELF-REPORTED VERSUS ACTUAL PRESCRIBING HABITS AMONG PEDIATRIC AMBULATORY PROVIDERS Andrew Handel, MD1, Catherine Messina, PhD2, Saul Stony Brook Children's Hospital, 2Department of Family, Population & Preventive Medicine, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook NY Background: Studies have shown 30-50% of outpatient antibiotic prescribing is inappropriate: defined as overly broad, wrong duration, used to treat viral infections, or is not adherent to Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs). Yet, few studies have examined prescrib ing and CPG knowledge in detail. Objectives: To analyze self-reported antibiotic knowledge, attitudes, & practices (KAP) and actual prescribing for common pediatric infections. Data was an alyzed in order to 1) determine if KAP responses and actual prescribing were appropriate, 2) compare self-reported knowledge to actual prescribing, and 3) identify possible future opportunities for intervention. Methods: We conducted a two-part study: 1) a survey asse ssing antibiotic prescribing-related KAP for common pediatric conditions and 2) a retrospective review of outpatient antibiotic use in the Stony Brook Children's Hospital (SBCH) Electronic Health Record (EHR) from 10/2014-9/2015 for the same conditions. CPGs were used to define appropriate antibiotics for each cond ition. Participants incl uded private & academic-b ased pediatricians and academic pediatric physicians. Survey responses were analyzed descriptively. Results: Fifty-seven pediatricians responded to 255 surveys (22% response rate). Only 34% of responses achieved a knowledge score over 90%. Mean knowledge scores varied significantly (p<0.001) by infection type, with participants scoring 94% correct for otitis media, 71 % for strep pharyngitis, and 67% for pneumonia. Academic providers performed better than private practitioners (p<0.0 01). Appropriate self-repor ted antibiotic knowledge was correlated, via linear regr ession, with SBCH EHR data actual prescribing (p<0.001). Conclusion: Self-reported appropriate antibiotic prescribing knowledge varied by type of infection. Stony Brook's adherence to CPGs for both self-reported antibiotic knowledge and actual prescribing (~80%) was similar to published pediatric antibiotic data, suggesting survey studies may be useful in settings where objective prescribing data are unavailable. Future interventions should target those conditions where knowledge and prescribing were less adherent to CPGs.

KNOWLEDGE RETENTION OF PEDIATRIC EMER GENCY CARE APPLIED RESEARCH NETWORK (PECARN) HEAD TRAUMA RULE BY PEDIATRIC RESIDENTS Asma Khan DO, Devin Grossman, MD, Rahul Panesar, MD, and Ilana Harwayne-Gidansky MD Department of Pediatrics, Stony Brook Children's Hospital, Stony Brook, NY Background : Case-based discussion is an effective method to learn medicine. High-fidelity simulation is also a newer effective learning modality. However, limited studies are ava ilable on the effect of these interventions on long-term knowledge retention. Objective : This study assessed the short-term and long-term knowledge retention of two different educational interventions aimed at teaching resident s the PECARN Head Trauma tool. We predicted that, regardless of modality, residents would have preserved knowledge of the PECARN tool. Methods : This was a prospective, randomized-controlled study. PGY-1 pediatric residents at a single center were randomized into one of two educational strategies to learn the PECARN Head trauma tool . One group received a high- fidelity simulation with structured debrief (Group 1). Th e other group received a case discussion with structured debrief (Group 2). Baseline demographics and knowledge based on a standard clinical scenario were collected prior to the intervention. Standard scenarios were given immediately post-intervention and at 6 months post-intervention. Median tests were used to compare groups 1 and 2. Wilcoxon signed-ranks test were used to compare changes over time within groups. Results : Between 2015 and 2016, 33 residents were enrolled. 15/33 (45%) residents completed the study. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups at baseline, immediately post intervention or at 6 months (Table 1). Both groups had improved test scores immediately following intervention. Scores for both groups declined at 6 months post-intervention, although this was not statistically significant for group 2. Both groups had improved test scores at 6 months compared to baseline, although this was not statistically significant for group 1 (Table 2). Conclusion : Regardless of modality, a single targeted educational encounter can improve short- term knowledge retention of the PERCAN Head trauma tool. It is possible that targeted intervention may prolong knowledge retention at 6 months, although further studies are needed.

NEONATAL HEMATOLOGIC INDICES IN CULTURE NEGATIVE EARLY ONSET SEPSIS IN TERM AND NEAR TERM INFANTS. P. Thimmappa MD1, C. Messina, PhD2, S. Sridhar MD1,3 Department of Division Neonatology3 Stony Brook Children's Hospital, Stony Brook, NY Background: Sepsis in newborns occurs primarily in the setting of chorioamnionitis/placental/fetal membrane infection (funisitis). Complete blood coun t (CBC) screening is performed to detect early onset sepsis in at risk infants. However, even in the absence of chorioamnionitis or clinic al symptoms, some infants are treated with antibiotics due to abnormal CBC values. Objective: To examine the association between abnormal white blood cell count (WBC), I/T ratio = (immature forms) / (total neutrophils + immature forms), c-reactive protein ( CRP), presence of degenerative neutrophils and funisitis in well appearing near term or term (> 35 weeks gestational age) infants (NTTI) with negative blood cultures, and to examine the association with the use of antibiotics for presumptive sepsis. Methods: We analyzed data in the retrospective cohort of NTTI who underwent testing for presumed early onset sepsis between Jan 2015-Dec 2015. NTTI admitted for known maternal chorioamnionitis were excluded from the study. Results: Of the 99 NTTI, 69 had placental pathology available, and of those 16 (23.2%) had histological evidence of funisitis. I/T ratios 24hr CRP (mg/L) values are pr esented in Table 1. The negative predictive value for degenerative neutrophils and WBC >30x10^9/L were at 93% and 84% respectively. Of the infants that received antibiotics, 17% in the >48 hour group and 14% in the 48 hour group showed funisitis all had significant IT ratios and/or elevated CRP (Table 1). Conclusions: In our study population, elevated I/T ratio and/or elevated CRP correlated with fetal membrane infection/inflammation. Routine CBC appears to be less helpful in guiding management for infants with early onset sepsis. Since placental histopathology is no t always available at the time of initial sepsis evaluation, we plan to explore the utility of other biomarkers such as IT and CRP, along w ith the other clinical severity illness scores in future prospective studies.

MATERNAL ANTENATAL CORT ICOSTEROID THERAPY (ACT) BETWEEN 30 AND 34 WEEKS GESTATION AND NEONATAL MORBIDITY IN LATE PRETERM AND EARLY TERM INFANTS Joan Medicine, Stony Brook Children's Hospital: Stony Brook School of Medicine Stony Brook, NY Background: Prematurity is associated with numerous onatal morbidities. Late prematurity (34 - 36 6/7 wk) majority of preterm bi rths. (ACT ) are known to ameliorate numerous neonatal morbidities, however the extent of the benefit in late preterm infants is still being investigated. We hypothesize that ACT administered in pregnancies eventua lly resulting in late prematurity will be associated with improvement in respiratory and metabolic neonatal outcomes. Objective: To examine whether ACT received between 30 -34 weeks improves outcomes among late-preterm Design/Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of infants born between 34- 37 6/7 wk and admitted to Stony Brook Children's NICU during 2013-2014.Multiple logistic regression models were employed to examine whether ACT exposure improved neonatal outcomes in late preter m and early term neonates. Covariates include maternal comorbidities such as gestational hypertension, diabetes and chorioamnionitis and neonatal covariates such as gestational age and birthweight to account for possible confounders. Results: Of the 555 subjects, 13% of the infants were exposed to ACT. There were more babies diagnosed with RDS (P<0.04) and with feeding problems in the ACT group (P=0.01). SNAPPE II (Severity of Illness) scores and maternal comorbidities were similar in both groups. Outcomes ACT Exposure (n=65) No ACT (n=491) P value Odds Ratio 95% Confidence Interval Air Leak 3 (3.2%) 22 (82.8%) (67%) 2.4 (1.24-4.79) P<0.05 is Transient of the Newborn, RDS: Respirator y Distress Syndrome, CPAP: Continuous Positive Airway Pressure, IMV: Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation Conclusions: ACT exposure between 30- 34 weeks was not associated with lower rates of RDS and feeding problems in late preterm and early term infants, suggesting no clear benefit of ACT in this sample. Further research perhaps with a larger matched cohort may reveal benefits not appreciated in this study. 17 ABSTRACT 5. MICROBIOLOGY, ANTIBIOTIC CHOICE AND PREDICTIVE FACTORS: APPENDICITIS OUTCOMES AND ANTIBIOTIC Children's Hospital, Long Island, NY Background : Appendicitis is the most common visceral pediatric surgical emergency and it is the 2nd highest antibiotic-using condition. In the era of antibiotic stew ardship, the interaction between underlying microbiology, and both adverse outcomes and antibiotic choice has not been recently examined. Objective: To review patients with complicated appendicitis (CA) (d efined as perforation, abscess, or a gangrenous or necrotic appendix) to 1) determine local pathogen prevalence and susceptibilities 2) identify bacteriologic & non- bacteriologic factors for adverse outcomes & 3) assess adherence to local antibiotic guidelines. Design : Single center retrospective chart review of CA patien ts ages 1-18 years from 2013-2015, post-initiation of guidelines. demographics, BMI, clinical presentatio n, labs including intra-operative appendiceal cultures, imaging, postoperative findings, antibiotics received, and adve rse outcomes, were reviewed. Results: Seventy-nine CA subjects were analyzed. The most common pathogen isolated was E. coli (n=1 resistant to Zosyn). Pseudomonas was isolated in only 6.5 % of all positive cultures. Adverse outcomes developed in 24/79 (30%); abscess formation was most common (42%). Abnormal BMI, initial band count >10% or positive cultures, regardless of number or type of bacteria seen, were all statistically significantly associated with adverse outcomes. Demographics, symptom days, initial WBC or neutrophil co unt, imaging showing perforation or gross appendix, and specific culture results were not significantly associat ed with adverse outcomes. Co mpliance with pre-operative antibiotic guidelines was 63%, post-operative was 86%. Conclusions : In this review, pathogen type was not associated with appendicitis adverse outcome, though BMI and bandemia were, and may be useful for risk-stratification. Pseudomonas , historically thought of as an important organism in appendicitis, was not a high burden locally, nor were highly resistant pathogens isolated. Antibiotic coverage against these organisms, currently part of ma ny national guidelines, may not be needed. Additionally, guideline compliance was poor, reflectin g another area for education and antib iotic stewardship in the future. 18 ABSTRACT 6. DOES PRE-MEDICATED INHALE D ANESTHESIA IMPACT TH E TIMING OF ENDOSCOPY PROCEDURES IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS? Jenna Ali MD\u00b9, Michelle Tobin MD1,2 \u00b9 Department of Pediatrics, Stony Brook Children's Hospital, Stony Brook, NY 2 Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Stony Brook Children's Hospital, Stony Brook, NY Background: Endoscopic procedures are a key step in evaluating and treating gastrointestinal diseases in children. Resources remain limited while endoscopy demand grows. This unequal supply and demand is challenging endoscopy centers to improve their efficiency while maintaining the highest quality. The duration of procedure is not the rate- limiting step in efficiency; factors befo re and after the procedure are more cr itical. Intravenous line placement (IV) in the endoscopy room under anesthesia vs. placement prior to being taken to the endoscopy room has been identified as a limitation of efficiency. It requires skill, time and patience, particularly in children. Some patients are pre-medicated with inhaled anesthesia (PMIA) for IV placement to overcome their fear. Howeve r, this delays initiation of endoscopic procedures; a concept never form erly recorded or analyzed. Objective: To determine factors associated with use of PMIA for IV placement and if it leads to increased time to initiation of procedures in the endoscopy room. Design: Retrospective review of electronic medical records of children undergoing an endoscopy between 08/2016- 03/2017. Data on demographics, time of initiation of endoscopy in the endoscopy room with and without use of PMIA was collected and analyzed via two tailed t-test and chi squared testing. Results: 54 subject had PMIA prior to IV and 180 subjects had no PMIA. Children in PMIA group were younger than those without; 6.45 \u00b1 3.8 years vs. 13.82 \u00b1 4.1years, (p<0.05). There was no difference in gender between the groups. PMIA group took 1.25x longer to initiate their procedure compared to non-PMIA once in the endoscopy room (p<0.05). See Table 1. Conclusions: Younger children more often require PMIA prior to IV placement. PMIA delays start time of endoscopy procedures after arriving in the endoscopy room. Utiliza tion of cognitive behavioral techniques and pharmacological alternatives can be used to prevent need for PMIA.

IMPROVING RECOGNITION OF PEDIATRIC HYPERTENSION IN THE PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY AMBULATORY SETTING Michael Bykhovsky MD, Catherine Messina, PhD, James Ni elsen MD, Peter Morelli MD, Kathleen Walsh MD, Stuart Holzer MD, Marybeth Heyden DNP, Laurie Panesar MD Background : Pediatric hypertension (HTN) is a common modifiable risk factor for premature atherosclerotic heart disease in adulthood. End-organ damage has been demonstrated in children with HTN making early recognition and treatment essential. Despite published guidelines fo r screening, HTN continues to be under recognized. Objective : 1) To improve recognition and documentation of pre- hypertension (pre-HTN) and HTN in the Stony Brook pediatric cardiology clinic. 2) To evaluate congenital heart disease (CHD) and anthropomorphic measurements had association with recognition of pre-HTN/HTN. Methods : We examined records of 468 children aged 1 to 18 years seen at SBPC. Two PDSA (Plan, Do, Study, Act) cycles were completed; 1 st tested the effect of making 4th Report blood pressure (BP) tables available at triage, and 2nd cycle tested the use of an online BP pe rcentile calculator. Demographics, age, sex, weight, height, BMI, and BP were recorded. We recorded presence of CHD and physician recognition of elevated BP. Results : Documentation of elevated BP by nursing staff d ecreased significantly after implementation of the BP percentile calculator compared to pr e-intervention (p<0.05) and PDSA cycle I (p=0.02), but not after 4th report availability (p=0.63). Physician recogn ition of pre-HTN and HTN did not improve after either intervention (p=0.65). HTN was recognized more often than pre-HTN in both PDSA cycles (p=0.01). BMI > 95th percentile was associated with increased physician recognition of elevated BP (OR 3.2, 95% [CI], 1.2-8.7; p=0.02) as well as increasing patient age (OR 1.1, 95% [CI], 1.02-1.25; p=0.01). Patient sex, wei ght, height and CHD were not associated with hypertension recognition. Conclusions : The decreased documentation of elevated BP after implementation of the BP percentile calculator likely represents improved nursing recognition of pre-HTN and HTN, despite lack of improvement in physician recognition. Incorporation of a BP percentile calculator within the EMR may improve recognition of elevated BP in the outpatient setting.

STRONGYLOIDES INFESTATION IN RHEUMATIC DISEASES: A CASE REPORT WITH LITERATURE REVIEW Joseph Cafone MD, Swosty Tuladhar MD, and Qingping Yao MD Background: is caused by the parasitic organism, stro ngyloides and can present with asymptomatic eosinophilia to disseminated multisyste m hyper-infection syndrome in an imm unocompromised host. The infection rate in patients with rheumatic diseases is unknown in th e era of biologics, and there are no management guidelines available in the scenario of coexisting strongyloides infestation and rheumatic diseases. Objective: Herein, we report a case of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with strongyloides infestation, and in conjunction with literature review, we proposed management recommendatio ns prior to initiation of Anti-TNF medications. Methods: We performed a literature search of PubMed database usin g the keywords: strongyloides and arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis or rheumatic disease or lupus for the publications between 1997 an d 2017 in the English language. The search resulted in a total of 64 papers, of which 14 single case study articles were relevant, eligible, and obtainable for inclusion in our study. Case Presentation: A 53-year-old Honduran male with the diagnosis of seropositive RA had been treated with hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide, and adalimumab since 2011. Despite therapy, he complained of bila teral pain and stiffness without signs of synovitis. He had persistent eosinophilia since the initial presentation of RA. The patient denied any abdominal pain, diarrhea, or rash. Due to eosinophilia, serologic antibodies. In consultation with an infectious diseas e specialist, the patient was treated with Ivermectin 200 mcg/kg for two days. Results: Age Sex Ethnicity Disease Medication Presenting Symptoms Lab Results Diagnosis Treatment Avg: 50 F: 8 M: 7C/S 4 Serology: 3Ivermectin: 11 Albendazole: 3 Data obtained from case reports and literature review (N=15) Sixty per cent (9/15) of the reported cases were from Asia and Central / South America. These patients were on immunosuppressive agents, including 86% (13/15) of patients on chronic use of glucocorticoids and 33% (5/15) on TNFa inhibitors (adalimumab and etanercept). The infected patients most often presente d with gastrointestinal or pulmonary symptoms 82% (14/17). The laboratory findings were eosinophilia, elevated IgE, and / or anemia. The diagnostic methodologies used were stool cultures, bronchia l alveolar lavage cultures, gastric biopsy, and serologic testing. Seventy-three per cent (11/15) of patients discontinued the immunosuppressive medications prior to the initiation of treatment with ivermectin. Conclusion Strongyloides stercoralis infestation can occur in patients w ith RA and SLE. Patients with these diseases if they are from Asia and Central/South America may be screened for the parasitic infection; patients with a long-term use of both glucocorticoids and/or TNFa inhibitors may be at an increased risk for the infection. Therefore, these medications may be held or avoided during the infection. The presence of gastrointestinal and/or pulmonary symptoms, or eosinophilia of unclear etiology may alert physicians of the potential parasitic infestation. 21 ABSTRACT 9. HIGH INCIDENCE OF ATOPY IN YOUNG CH ILDREN WITH EOSINOPHILIC ESOPHAGITIS Stony of Stony Brook Children's Stony NY (EoE) has been strongly associated with atopy in children and adults. However, there is a paucity of data regarding young children with this disease. Objective: To examine the epidemiology and clinical presentatio n of EoE in children < 6 years of age in order to identify risk factors for diseas e development and progression. Methods: We retrospectively studied electro nic medical record of 28 children diagnosed with EoE < 6 years of age who met EoE diagnostic criteria and were identified via ICD-9 code (530.13). Results: The average age at diagnosis wa s 2.8 \u00b1 1.6 years. There were 21 males and 7 females: 43% had eczema, 39% had asthma, and 29% had allergic rhinitis. The most common presenting symptoms were vomiting (64%) and failure to thrive (43%). Milk allergy had been diagnosed in 39% of patients. Histopathology revealed a mean eosinophil count of 42 eosinophils/hpf in the mid esophagus and 63 eosinophils/hpf distally. Positive prick skin tests to at least one environmental antigen were seen in 39% of children and 64% had a positive prick skin test to at least one food allergen. The most common food allergens were egg white (75%) and soy (61%). Most common environmental allergens were tree pollen (32%), grass pollen (25%), and dust mite (25%). Conclusions: As reported in older children and adults, there is a high incidence of atopic disorders including eczema, asthma, food allergies, and allergic rhinitis in young childre n with EoE. The presence of atopy, along with vomiting or failure to thrive in young children, may be suggestive of EoE, and should prompt consideration for earlier diagnostic interventions. Additional studies of this population are needed to clarify the specific nature of the association between atopy and EoE. 22 ABSTRACT 10. RARE CASE OF AN ISOLATED ANOMALOUS SINGLE CORONARY ARTER FROM THE PULMONARY ARTERY IN A FIVE-WEEK OLD INFANT Sunny Chang, MD*, Mariel Turner, MD**, James MD***, Stuart Brook Children's Hospital **Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Columbia University Medical Center *** Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Stony Brook Children's Hospital Introduction: An anomalous single coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ASCAPA) is an extremely rare congenital anomaly with the majority of the reported cases being diagnosed po stmortem via autopsy [1]. We present a 5-week old infant who was diagnosed with isolated ASCAPA after presentin g to our hospital in respiratory distress secondary to bronchiolitis. Case Description : A 5-week-old female weighing 3kg presented with poor weight gain and acute respiratory distress, found to have parainfluenza bronchiolitis. Parents denied any symptoms of cyanosis, tachypnea, diaphoresis or breathing difficulties with feeds. Her chest x-ray showed marked car diomegaly. A 12-lead electrocardiogram did not show ST elevations or pathological q-waves (Figure 1). Her echocardiogram (ECHO) revealed a severely dilated left ventricle with severely decreased global systolic function (13% shortening fraction), moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate RV/PA hypertension and what appeared to be a single coronary artery arising from the left aortic sinus. There was prominent flow seen in the right coronary artery which coursed in tra-arterial between the aortic and pulmonary roots. The left coronary, also had prominent flow, bifurcated into a dilated (+3.3 z-scores) left anterior descending and a circumflex artery. There were no other structural abnormalities (Figure 2). Patient was then transferred and cardiac catheterization show ed elevation of the RV pres sure at about 80% of her systemic pressure and LVEDP was severely elevated at 20mmHg. Angiography demonstrated a single coronary artery arising from the posterior and ri ghtward side of the main pulmonary artery, near the junction of the proximal RPA (Figure 3). The patient underwent coronary artery re implantation after car diac catheterization. By nine months following her operation, her ECHO demonstrated globally normal systolic LV function with moderate mitral regurgitation, and all supportive medications were discontinued. Discussion: An isolated ASCAPA is an extremely rare congenital anom aly and chances of survival past the first few weeks of life are low. This infant's persistent elevated PVR ai ded in her survival. This case illustrates the challenges of diagnosing ASCAPA via echocardiogram alone, and one must have a high index of suspicion for this lesion in any patient with unexplained dilated cardiomyopathy in the setting of a single coronary artery . 23 ABSTRACT 11. DEFINITIONS AND PREVALENCE OF LEFT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY IN HYPERTENSION AND OBESITY; A SYSTEMATIC Stony Brook Children's Hospital, 2Biochemistry Major, Business Management & Chemistry Double Minor, Stony Brook University, 3Medical Library, Stony Brook University, 4Division of Pediatric Nephrology and Hypertension, Stony Brook, NY Background: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an important end point and therapeutic target in the management of hypertension (HTN), and/or obesity -associated cardiovascular disease. Howe ver, LVH prevalence in children is unclear partly due to multiple LVH definitions. Objective: To perform a systematic review of literature to report the prevalence of LVH determined by echocardiography (ECHO) in children with HTN and/or obesity. Methods: A PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane articles publis hed in English language on children 0-21 years of age in the past 15 years were considered. Subj ects with kidney transplantation or ch ronic kidney disease were excluded. We examined prevalence of LVH based on 4 definitions and left ventricular mass index (LVMI): Table. Results: Our search yielded 859 articles. 699 articles were rejected after title and abstract screening and 104 after full text screening. 56 studies met all inclusion/exclusion criteri a and were included in the final analysis. There were 9952 subjects, aged 13.1y\u00b12.6, with average systolic blood pressure 120.9\u00b111.2, and body mass index of 25.4\u00b14.5. 56.8% of subjects were males. 28.6% (16/56) and 32.1% studies reported Caucasian and (1517/2878 subjects) and 46.7% African-Americans (1223/2621 subjects). LVH criteria and/or prevalence were not reported in 36 studies even though LVMI was reported in all studies. LVH data is presented in Table. Conclusions: LVH remains frequent ECHO biomarker of cardiac damage in HTN children. However, multiple definitions result in highly variable estimation of LVH prevalence and thus present a challenge to diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in HTN management. More consistent normative left ventricular mass data from large populations of healthy and obese children are required for cardiovascular diagnostics and research in HTN.

A FAMILY WITH MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE NE OPLASIA SYNDROMES (MEN): THE ETHICAL FACTORS OF GENETIC TESTING FOR ADULT ONSET FAMILIAL GENETIC SYNDROMES Faheem Farooq, The Multiple Endocrine Neoplastic Syndromes (MEN s) are well recognized entities with localized genes and established inheritance pattern . We present a case of a father exhibiting manifestations of MEN2A syndrome and the subsequent genetic testing of his children. Case: A 34 year old man with a history of Hirschsprung's disease diagnosed at birth presented with a pheochromcytoma and medullary thyroid cancer at ag e 33 years. Tumor DNA studies revealed a mutation (p.Cys620Arg) in the RET gene. He arrived to the genetics clinic to have his three asymptomatic children, aged 3 years and dizygotic twins, aged 17 months to be evaluated and tested. Twin 2 was found to have a mutation (p.Cys620Arg) of the RET gene. The father was advised that his asymptomatic parents and siblings should be tested for the same RET gene mutation. Discussion: This family case portrays the variability of genetic expression for MEN 2A s yndrome. Furthermore, it demonstrates the various challenges and considerations of performing genetic testing in children. One must consider whether an early diagnosis will lead to a beneficial in tervention. For MEN2A, consideration for prophylactic intervention is recommended in the preschool age but other diseases do not offer a treat ment benefit in childhood. Other ethical considerations involve patient and parent autonomy along with the psychological burden of carrying a genetic diagnosis through childhood. Conclusion: Clinicians can best help family members by clear ly informing patients who test positive for Genetic conditions about the risks faced by their family members, di scussing the value of disclosure, and offering assistance with it. It is essential to have a comprehensive conversa tion with family members regarding the risks, benefits, and timing of genetic testing for any familial syndrome. 25 ABSTRACT 13. LONGITUDINAL AND HORIZONTAL COMPARISONS OF A PEDIATRIC-SPECIFIC ANTIBIOGRAM AT STONY BROOK CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL Matthew Fisher, MD; Saul R. Hymes, MD Background: In the era of increasing antibiotic resistance, clinicians must rely on antibiograms to make more informed decisions when starting empiric therapy. Pediat ric institutions have recognized that organisms affecting children may have different susceptibilities compared to a dults, and have developed pediatric-specific antibiograms to provide more accurate data. Objective: We constructed an antibiogram derived exclusivel y from bacterial cultures isolated from pediatric patients at Stony Brook Children's Hospital in order to: 1) Describe differences in the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles compared to the hospital-wide antibiogram and, 2) Identify changes in susceptibility patterns over time. Design: Bacterial culture and susceptibility data were obta ined from all positive cultures from January-December 2015 from the Pediatric ED, 11N (General Pediatrics), 11S (Hematology-Oncology), PICU, NICU, & outpatient lab. Organisms with 10 or more individual samples were included. Repeat cultures from the same patient encounter were excluded. The percentage of isolates susceptible to tested antibiotics was calculated. Susceptibility data were compared with the 2015 hospital-wide antibiogram as well as a 2011 pediatric-sp ecific antibiogram from this institution. Results: Susceptibility patterns of ten organisms are reported in Table 1. Comparing pediatric isolates to the hospital antibiogram, E. coli was more susceptible to ciprofloxacin (87% vs. 65%); S. aureus was more susceptible to clindamycin (72% vs. 63%); and Pseudomonas was vs. 68%) and (77% resistant to amikacin (84% vs. 94%). Comparing pediatric data from 2011 & 2015, E. coli resistance increased to 9 of 13 antibiotics by an average of 8.7% (median 7%); MRSA rates were similar (56% vs. 54%). Pseudomonas was more resistant to 2 of 6 antibiotics. Conclusion: Pediatric E. coli resistance increased over a 5-year period; data supporting increasing S. aureus and Pseudomonas resistance was limited. The pediatric antibiogram should be used to tailor antibiotic therapy to pediatric patients. Table 1.

ASTHMA-RELATED HOSPITALIZATIONS AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS IN HISPANIC LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY FAMILIES: LA NGUAGE, HEALTH LITERACY, OR BOTH? Nancy Joseph, DO1, Lisa Romard, NP 1, Teresa Carney, NP1, Catherine Messina, PhD2, Catherine Kier, MD1 1Department of Pediatrics, 2Department of Family, Population & Preventive Medicine, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY Background: Limited English Proficiency (LEP) patients may have decreased understanding of their diagnosis and treatments. The 2013 New York State Asthma Surveillance Su mmary reports the rate of Emergency Department (ED) visits and hospitalizations among Hispanics as double that of non-hispanics. Objective: This is an exploratory study to describe English pr oficiency (EP) and health literacy (HL) of Hispanic caregivers of asthmatic patients of Stony Brook Children's Hospital. We hypothesized that LEP families have greater asthma hospitalizations and ED visits than EP families. Methods: Subjects ages 0-17 years with asthma were recruited at inpatient and outpatient sites. Caregivers completed demographics including ED visits and hospitalizations in the past 2 years and validated EP and HL questionnaires; SAHL and STOHFLA (Table). Results: To date, only 14 subjects were enrolled out of 21 scr eened, 8 were LEP and 6 were EP. Due to a small sample size, statistical interpretation was very limited and are mainly descriptive thus far. In addition, only 6/8 answered ED visits and only 5/8 answered hospitalizations questions in the LEP subjects. LEP subjects had a median of 1.5 ED visits, and 1 hospitalization. EP subjects had a median of 3 ED visits, and 2 hospitalizations. Despite the aforementioned limitations, our preliminar y analysis interestingly showed that even in LEP subjects, a significant percentage have adequate health literacy. Adequate hea lth literacy (AHL) was found in 62.5% (SAHL) and 87.5% (STOFHLA) in LEP and 83.3% (STOFHLA) in EP subjects (Table). Conclusions: Preliminary findings show that LEP does not directly correlate to inadequate health literacy (IHL). It may be beneficial to focus efforts on continued health edu cation with easy to understand materials, especially in the preferred language. Our goal is to continue to recruit subj ects to reach our target sample size of 100 and re-evaluate our data.

CORRELATION BETWEEN DEPRESSI ON SCREENING AND LENGTH OF STAY IN ADOLESCENTS ADMITTED TO A HOSPITAL FOR AN ACUTE ASTHMA EXACERBATION Ada Lee DO, Rachel Boykan MD, Messina PhD, Catherine Kier MD Background : Adolescents with asthma show a higher prevalence of anxiety and depression compared to controls. Factors that increase this risk may include recent asthma diagnosis, poor asthma control or physical impairment from asthma. However, no studies to date have looked into the association between depression and length of hospital stay (LOS) in asthma exacerbation. Objective: To determine whether the presence of depressive symptoms in children admitted to the hospital with an acute asthma exacerbation correlates with the LOS. Methods: Children ages 10-17, admitted for asthma exacerbation to the general i npatient pediatric service, were given validated questionnaire, the Center s for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) within the first 24 hours of hospitalization. Questionnaire scores were compared with LOS and asthma severity. Pediatric ICU admission was an exclusion criterion, as administration of questionnaire within 24 hours may be difficult in the sicker population. The presence of concomitant viral illnes s through positive respiratory viral panel (RVP) screen was assessed as a covariate, as this may affect LOS. Results: Of 34 patients enrolled (mean age 13, SD 1.84), 7 (21%) had a positive depression screen. Average LOS in screen negative subjects was 2.07 days; in screen positive 2.14 days (p>0.05). No correlation between severity of depression and LOS was identified through linear regression modeling (R=0.0664, R2=0.004, p=0.71). However, increasing asthma severity showed increasing depression score (R=4.7, p=0.116). LOS was not affected by viral status (14/23 positive RVP, p>0.05). Conclusions: We found no correlation between depressive symptoms and LOS in children admitted to the hospital during an asthma exacerbation. However, results may be limited by small sample size and exclusion of PICU patients. Multiple factors including asthma control, severity, number of admissions, LOS and even including PICU patients to analyze this subgroup may be worthwhile to explore as we continue to increase our sample size.

AN EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION TO INCREASE BIRTH DOSE OF HEPATITIS B VACCINATION Ada Lee, DO\u00b9, Nancy Joseph, DO\u00b9; Lisa Clark, DNP CPNP-AC/PC\u00b9 \u00b9Stony Brook Children's, Department of Pediatrics. Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook, NY Background : The WHO (2012) r ecommends administration of birth dose hepatitis B vaccine (HepBV) to prevent hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission from mother-to-infant or household contact by an infected person. The likelihood of developing chronic liver disease is 90% if exposed to the HBV infection following birth. From 2012-2016, Stony Brook Children's (SBC) newborn nursery yearly HepBV rate was 63-71%. Health-care provider's knowledge and attitudes are an important factor toward matern al acceptance of HepBV birth dose. (WHO 2012) Objective: To improve the vaccination rate of birth dose of He pBV at SBC to meet the New York State recommended rate of >85% before discharge Design: A survey of knowledge, attitudes, and practices was di stributed September 2016 to SBC Mother Baby Unit Nurses (MBUN) to identify barriers. An initial education intervention was developed; a Power Point on HBV, HepBV, and post- test administered to MBUN October 2016. A 2nd educational intervention was given January 2017 to each MBUN (57/64 nurses) with individualized discussion on the importance of HepBV. The group was also given a sample script for obtaining maternal permission for HepBV. Intervention data was co llected and vaccination rates analyzed by SPSS 2013 Version 22.0. Results: Completed surveys (34/64) administered to MBUN id entified various barriers: staff education would be helpful to improve vaccination rates (82%); parent refusal is related to health care provider attitudes (68%). Post-test results identified 58% of MBUN answered incorrect on knowledge on the HepB V series. From onset of project, vaccination rates statistically increased (Chi square cross tabulation p=0.012, linear by linear association p=0.002), Table: Pre-intervention Intervention 1 Intervention 2 HepBV vaccination rate Jul 2016 Aug 2016 Sept 2016 Oct 2016 Nov 2016 Dec 2016 Jan 2017 perception and improve knowledge on why the HepBV birth dose is recommended. HepBV rates improved with interventions but continued evaluation of practices that improve birth dose coverage and parent education strategies are necessary. 29 ABSTRACT 17. ROLE OF AUTONOMY, CONSENT, AND ASSENT IN ADOLESCENT CANCER SYNDROMES Kevin Louie, of Stony Children's Hospital, Stony Brook, 3Division Medicine and Palliative Care, Stony Brook Children's Hospital, Stony Brook, NY Background: Lynch Syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a germline mutation of one DNA mismatch repair (MMR) gene or loss of expression of MSH2 . Individuals with Lynch Syndrome are at high risk of colorectal cancer, can develop malignancies of the endome trium, ovary, stomach, small bowel, hepatobiliary system and brain and will inevitably continue to develop malignancie s. The role of patient autonomy, consent and assent is complex and multifactorial, especially in chronically ill a dolescents. The patient's level of cognitive development and ability to understand the risks and benefits of a given decision should be considered. Objectives: Understand the role of patient autonomy, consent, and assent in adolescent cancer Discuss what happens if patient's decisions conflict with recommended treatment plans Recognize the challenges of shared decision making Understand the importance of early involvement with palliative care teams Case Description : SM is a 19 year old woman with biallelic Lynch Syndrome, diagnosed at 14. Since diagnosis, she has had glioblastoma multiforme, transitional cell carcino ma of the bladder, endometrial cancer, recurrent colon adenocarcinoma, and recurrent ovarian carcinoma. SM fully understands her diagnosis and knows she will develop new malignancies. Despite this knowledge, she has declined hysterectomy (due to desire to preserve the ability to carry a pregnancy) and colectomy and ileostomy although it would eliminate future recurrence of colon carcinoma. Palliative care has helped balance SM's goals with recommended tr eatments to optimize her quality of life (Figure 1). Conclusion: Treatment discussions are very difficult in patients with poor prognosis and high morbidity. The ethical and emotional ramifications are immense, and adolescent patients carry a high physical and emotional burden. Shared decision making can help balance developing adolescent autonomy with parental desire to protect their children. Palliative care assists with these difficult discussions to al ign patient, parent and clinician goals for best outcomes. Figure 1.

BIOMARKERS IN FEBRILE NEUTROPENIA Shirley Pediatrics, Stony Brook Children's Hospital, Stony Brook, NY 2 Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Brook Children's Hospital, Stony Brook, NY Background: Febrile neutropenia is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric cancer patients. Currently, there are no standardized approaches to risk stratifying these patients and many patients undergo lengthy hospitalizations and exposure to many broad-spectrum antibio tics. Stratifying this population based on clinical and laboratory values would allow for a more streamlined approach to management. Objective: C-reactive protein (CRP), Procalc itonin (PCT) and lactic acid (LA), in conjunction with clinical presentation, were evaluated to determine their usefulness as a biomarker panel to predict bacteremia in febrile neutropenic pediatric cancer patients Design: The study population included pediatric cancer patients on therapy who developed fever while neutropenic (ANC<500/cumm). Control groups febrile nonneutropenic patients. Clinical data such as diagnosis, treatme nt regimen, and culture results were also collected. Data was analyzed using SPSS, to determine how these biomarkers correlated with adverse outcomes. Results: Data was collected on 35 patients, with 114 febrile episodes and 18 positive blood cultures (prevalence 16%). Sample was 43% female and 57% male, with a mean age of 12 years. All thr ee markers demonstrated good sensitivity for 63.06-100), with a trend toward higher procalcitonin values (mean of 38.85 ng/mL and median of 11.57 ng/mL) in patients with Gram negative bacteremia, although th e sample was not large enough to de termine statistical significance. Combined, elevations in these 3 markers have a sensitivity of 87.5% (CI: 47.35-99.68), and negative predictive value of 96.67% (CI: 81.88-99.47). However, all of these values may be influenced by the relatively low prevalence of positive blood cultures in this population. Conclusions: Normal levels of CRP, procalcitonin, and lactic acid appear to be good negative predictors fro bacteremia, both individually and when combined. In particular, elevation in procalcitonin may help to determine likelihood of Gram negative bacteremia. In the future, when combined with clin ical features, these may enable us to risk stratify patients in this population. Our future goal is to use these markers and identified clinical features to develop streamlined treatment algorithms for the management of febrile neutropenia. 31 ABSTRACT 19. CASE REPORT: UNEXPECTED FINDINGS WHEN AN X-LINKED DISORDER IS ADDED TO NEWBORN SCREENING Jennifer Lutz DO, Jody Weiss-Burns MSGC, Patricia Galvin-Part on MD Department of Pediatrics, Stony Brook Children's, Stony Brook, NY Background : X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) affects primarily males and results in myelin degeneration and adrenal complications caused by ABCD1 gene mutations responsib le for degradation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). Klinefelte r Syndrome (KS) is the most common chromosome aneuploidy in males (47,XXY), and is rarely reported to occur with X-linked disorders. Case : A full-term Hispanic newborn male product of unev entful pregnancy was found to have an abnormal newborn screen positive for ALD, showi ng heterozygosity for a deletion and his 47,XXY ka ryotype was consistent with KS. Infant was breastfeeding without complications, and VLCFAs were only mildly elevated, similar to levels seen in females heterozygous for ABCD1 mutation rather than markedly elev ated levels in XY males. At 22 months, his neurologic and endocrine indices remain normal. Discussion : DNA sequence analysis and chromosome studies of our patient indicated two X chromosomes - normal and variant. His mother had the same two variant X chromosomes indicating a meiotic error of maternal origin. In female somatic cells and in KS individuals, one X chromosome is transcriptionally inactivated to equalize dosage of maternal and paternal X-encoded genes (lyonization). Mild elevations of VLCFAs may demonstrate preferred inactivation of the X chromosome carrying the ABCD1 mutation. An extra unaffected X chromosome in X-linked ALD seems to have protective effect against the cerebral and earlier-onset ALD forms seen in XY males. Conclusion : We describe the case of X-linked Adrenoleukody strophy in an infant with Klinefelter Syndrome. An unexpected second diagnosis may be un covered as X-linked disorders are added to newborn screens; when this occurs, karyotyping and genetic counseling will need to be incorporated into the protocol. In this case, the expected clinical outcome fo r ALD is expected to be similar to carrier females. 32 ABSTRACT 20. ASSESSING MATERNAL KNOWLED GE ABOUT SAFE SLEEP PRACTICES WITHIN 36 HOURS FOLLOWING DELIVERY Danielle Macina, DO\u00b9, Pediatrics, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook, NY \u00b2 Department of Preventive Medicine, Stony Brook University, NY Background: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) remains the 4t h leading cause of infant mortality (2014) in the U.S. despite the \"Back to Sleep Campai gn\". According to the CDC reports (2017) approximately 3,700 infant's deaths are sleep related. There is limited information about pren atal maternal education on the AAP recommendations on infant Safe Sleep Practices (SSP). Objective: To assess maternal learning, knowledge and planned compliance of SSP following delivery at Stony Brook Children's. Design: Cross sectional study regarding maternal knowledge about SSP was administered to new mothers within 36 hours of birth. Demographic data and knowledge of SSP we re collected: sleeping position; use; adoption; newborn illness; or congenital abnormalities. Data were analyzed us ing SPSS 2013 version 22.0 and evaluated at the level of p<0.05 (two -tailed). Results: A total of 57/158 mothers participated in the survey 88% (50/57) reported self-education about SSP. Level of maternal education did not correlate with having incr eased knowledge of SSP. Ther e was no significant difference between age groups or level of education on the protective eff ect of pacifiers to decrease SI DS (Table 1). Analysis of the survey identified significance with maternal age and knowledge of bundling/overheating (Age <25; p 0.002). Questions regarding SSP were answered correctly: infants sh ould sleep on their backs, alone, in a crib (100%); and with no bumpers or extra objects placed in the crib (91%). Conclusion/Discussion: The survey demonstrated high levels of knowledge regarding the ABC's Campaign (Alone, on the Back and in a Crib). Additional areas of SSP knowledge deficits identified were: pacifier use, bundling and potential for newborn overheating. Limitations of this study are the small sample size. Follow up studies are need to evaluate maternal SSP education and transl ation into best practices in the home. Table 1.

NEWBORN SCREENING QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT Danielle Macina, DO, Jennifer Lutz, DO, Pooja Rathi, DO, and Robyn Blair, MD Department of Pediatrics, Stony Brook Children's Hospital, Stony Brook, NY Background: The New York Newborn Screening (NBS) Program is designed to detect 58 different life-threatening or life-long conditions. Pediatricians are responsible fo r obtaining and reviewing the results of NBS, notifying families, and providing appropriate referrals. However, there is no national data of NBS documentation and our outpatient model did not have a process for checking NBS documentation. Objective: To examine and improve the review and documentation process of NBS at SBC over a 1 year intervention period, and therefore enhance patient care delivery. Design: We used quality improvement design of PDSA (Plan, Do, Study, Act) cycles from January 2016- January 2017. We 1st retrospectively reviewed 60 consecutive charts of infants 2 weeks to 4 months old seen for well check visit at SBC and assess baseline NBS documentation. Our 1st intervention (February 2016), included educating attending and resident physicians about NBS documentation within the Problems/Diagnosis section of the chart using two ICD-10 codes; 120 charts were reviewed 3 months later to assess improvement. The 2nd intervention (May 2016), consisted of a workflow system change in which nurses and ancillary staff entered NBS results (Figure 1), and 120 charts were reviewed 2 months later to assess improveme nt. Finally, to assess sustaina bility, in Decem ber 2016, 120 charts were reviewed. Results: Before 2016 at SBC only 30% (19/60) of NBS were documented. Our 1st intervention led to an increase in NBS documentation to 60% (72/120), followed by a further increase to 70% (83/120) after 2nd intervention. Six months post intervention, NBS documentation exceeded goal at 78% (93/120). Conclusion: After two PDSA cycles, a standardized process for documentation has increased NBS documentation rates at SBC. With further educational reinforcement we expect to optimize the documentation of NBS results and serve as a model process for other institutions.

Quiana Pollock1, MD, Robert Woroniecki1, MD, MS 1Department of Pediatrics, Stony Brook Children's Hospital, Stony Brook, NY Background : Residency Programs require pediatric residents (PR) to complete research projects (ResP) before their graduation. However, as compared to Pediatric Fellows ( PF), PR have limited research experience and protected time dedicated to do it. Mentors (MT) also have limited time/funding and various experience in mentoring. It is unclear what ResP are undertaken, and what outcomes are achieved. Objective : To describe pediatric research program experience and characterize type/quality of projects and examine the role of MT academic rank. Methods : We contacted all MT, searched internal abstract booklets and PubMed/Ovid databases and analyzed the data of pediatric research program at Stony Brook Children's from 04/2014-04/2017. Results : During the study period; 47 PR completed 48, and 18 PF completed 21 ResP. 36.2% (PR) and (PR) and 0% (PF) secondary analyses of large data sets, 19.2% (PR) and 27.8% (PF) quality improvement (QI), 21.3% (PR) and 0% (PF) survey design, and 8.5% (PR) 33.3% (PF) p=0.017. Of all ResP; 10% (PR) and 8.3% (PF) were presented at regional and 70% (PR) and 75% (PF) at national meetings, p=0.9. However, only 20.6% (PR) were submitted for publication and 11.7% were published, as compared to PF; 72.7% submitted, 36.4% published, p=0.005. MT faculty consisted of 20.3% Professors (Prof), 45.3% Associate Prof, and 32.8 % Assistant Prof. We found no associ ation between MT academic rank and project outcomes (Table 1). Conclusions : Scholarly work of PR primarily focused on clin ical research using observational/epidemiological research, and survey design. PF had sign ificant advantage for basic science rese arch, and project publication over PR. MT academic rank did not influence ResP presentation or publication outcome. We are now examining the existing barriers and attitudes so that we can enhance relationship of PR/MT and improve PR quality of research as measured by publication rates. Table 1.

USING QUALITY IMPROVEMEN T METHODS TO PREVENT CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE INFECTIONS IN PEDIATRIC HE MATOLOGY/ONCOL OGY PNP, Denise Martorana RN, Ba rbara Kranz CIC, Eric Spit zer MD, Ken Okorn RT, Grace Propper NP QMP, Rafael Acal Jimenez RN, Katherine Morales RN, NY Background: Clostridium difficile (C. difficile ) is spread via fecal oral route an d is the leading cause of hospital- associated diarrhea in U.S. Patient risk factors for C. difficile infection (CDI) include antimicrobial exposure, hospitalization, immunocompromised or chronic health conditions, immunosupp ressive and use of proton pump inhibitors. External risk factors include contact with health care workers, contaminated e nvironments or direct contact with a CDI patient; many of these are unavoidable in Pediatric Hematology/Oncology (PHO) patients. At Stony Brook Children's Hospital (SBCH), the rate for CDIs for PHO patients prior to this initiative was 48.6/10,000 patient days. Aim: To identify and remediate the causes of CDI in PHO patients at SBCH. Methods: For this quality improvement initiative (QI) a multid isciplinary team was assembled with representation from PHO, Infectious Diseases, Infection Control, Mi crobiology, Nurse Practitioners, House Staff, Respiratory Therapists, Hospital Custodial Staff (HCS) and QI. We meas ured baseline and post intervention CDI rates on the PHO unit. We used educational materials to inform staff about CDI and assessed pre and post intervention CDI knowledge. We also monitored appropriate test ordering and use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and handwashing. We observed cleaning practices of the hospital custodial staff using standardized check lists. We performed bioburden tests of patient areas. Results: Since implementation of initiative, rates of CDI have decreased by 61% in PHO patients (p-value 0.11) (Figure 1). The post-educational questionnaire data shows some improvement in knowledge scores. We saw significant bioburden on certain toys and high touch areas in patient rooms Conclusions: Our project led to a decrease in C. difficile rates among our patients though not statistically significant is clinically significant. We plan to continue educational efforts in order to further improve rates and we anticipate a Children's Hospital-wide initiative. Bioburden data will be helpful tool to evaluate cleaning practices.

ROLE OF CHILD LIFE SPECIALISTS IN PEDIATRIC PALLIATIVE CARE Pooja Rathi, DO, David Elkin, BS, Michael Attard, MA, CCLS, & Ratna Basak, MD Department of Pediatrics, Stony Brook Children's Hospital Background: Each year more than 500,000 children in USA cope with life threatening conditions. Many are hospitalized for long periods for curative treatment or for end of life care. Child life sp ecialists help children and their families navigate the emotionally and physically demanding process of coping with hospitalization. They use their knowledge to provide physical and psychological support during the palliative process. Play therapy, expression through art, magic and mu sic therapy promote effective reductio n in anxiety and provide emotional support in the last days of a child with terminal illness. Case: A 14 year old boy suffering from progressive ependymoma with hydrocephalus was admitted with worsening respiratory distress and bulbar dysfunction with multiorgan failure. He was depressed and had very poor coping skills. The Child life specialist introduced a magician who visited him daily. The primary aim of bringing magic was to improve his quality of life by relieving symptoms of pa in, agitation, increase relaxatio n, and offset depression. Perhaps magic allowed him to believe that impossible things can be achieved and subsequently provided him a subconscious feeling of hope for the fu ture. It became a source of comfort for the patient and family and helped him to preserve dignity and ameliorate suffering. After he died , the family expressed gratitude and summarized that this relationship helped them to accept the d eath. It also helped Child life to bu ild legacy and provide footprints for future work. Conclusion : Child life services provide opportunities to engage in normal play and recreational activities that promote growth, development, and feelings of success and fulfillment. They also promote the role of parents and other family members as full partners in the health care team. As our current health care system grows, we would need Child life specialists to be the core members of the Pediatric Palliative Care. 37 ABSTRACT 25. DISCHARGE BREASTMILK FEED ING RATES IN ASYMPTOMATIC TERM NEWBORNS ADMITTED TO THE NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT FOR MATERNAL CHORIOAMNIONITIS Miry Shim, DO, Sara Yang, MS-2 (Stony Brook Univer sity School of Medicine), Catherine Messina, PhD (Department of Family, Population an d Preventive Medicine, Stony Brook Un iversity Hospital), Jonathan P. Mintzer, MD (Department of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine, Stony Brook Children's Hospital) Background: NICU admission affects exclusive breastmilk (B M) feeding rates. Among asymptomatic term neonates admitted to the NICU for maternal chorioamnionitis, we hypothesized that prolonged (>48 h) antibiotic exposure is associated with reduced discharge exclusive BM feeding rates co mpared to 48 h antibiotic courses. Objective: To compare discharge BM feeding rates among asym ptomatic term newborns receiving 48 h vs. >48 h antibiotics in the NICU and a cohort of well-baby nursery (WBN) newborns. Design: This retrospective chart review included asymptomatic term neonates admitted to the NICU due to maternal chorioamnionitis between Jan, 2012 and Dec, 2015. A comparison group of term WBN neonates were additionally studied. Demographic, birth, feeding, and lactation consultant (LC) visit data were analyzed in univariate and multivariate models. Results: Among 272 NICU neonates, 237 recei ved 48 h antibiotics vs. 35 who recei ved > 48 h antibiotics; a cohort of 428 WBN neonates was studied for comparison. Among NICU newborns, 48 h vs. >48 h antibiotics was not associated with altered discharge exclusive BM feeding ( 14% vs. 14%; p = NS). Exclusive BM feeding at discharge was seen in 14% of NICU vs. 35% of WBN neonates (p < 0.01) (Figure 1). Among all babies, WBN admission (p < 0.001), vaginal delivery (p = 0.05), older maternal age (p < 0.001), lower parity (p = 0.001), higher birth gestational age (p = 0.02), and more LC visits (p = 0.001) were associated with increased discharge BM feeding. Conclusions: NICU admission for maternal chorioamnionitis was associated with reduced discharge BM feeding in asymptomatic term neonates, but prolonged antibiotic exposure was not. We speculate that demographic variables, such as maternal age and parity, may aid in focusing lactation consultant efforts to potentially improve exclusive BM feeding rates at discharge.

COMBINED SIMULTANEOUS ARGININE CLONIDINE STIMULATION TEST: TIMING OF PEAK GROWTH HORMONE (GH) CONCENTRATION AND CORRELATION WITH CLINICAL INDICES OF GH STATUS Nandini Bhat, MD1, Eric Dulmovits2, Andrew Lane, MD1, of Stony Brook University, 3Department of Preventive Medicine , Stony Brook University Hospital Background: Conventional testing for growth hormone defi ciency (GHD) utilizes two sequential stimulation tests each lasting 2.5 hours. Our institution uses a combined simultane ous stimulation test requiring 150 minutes. Objective: The primary aim of this study is to see if it is possible to truncate the test. A second aim is to assess the outcome of the test with clinic al correlates of GH status. Design: Charts of subjects who underwent a combined simultaneous arginine clonidine stimulation test between January 1, 2007, and August 31, 2016, were reviewed. Results: Charts of 211 subjects were reviewed. One hundred and thirty three of 205 children passed the growth hormone stimulation test defined as at least one GH level > 10ng/ml. Five of 6 adolescents who had the stimulation test after completion of growth horm one treatment passed the test defined as at least one GH level > 5ng/ml. Among children who passed the test, 88.4% reached peak GH by 90 minutes, and 2.2% of the subjects had a passing peak GH level only after 120 minutes. After controlling for age and ex cluding children > 15 years of age, at wh ich time growth has ceased in many, there was a weak but significant correlation between baseline grow th velocity and peak GH level (r=0.204; p=0.036). A weak but significant correlation was also found between se rum insulin like growth fact or-1 z-score and peak GH level (r=0.17; p=0.01). A trend towards an inverse correlation between peak GH level and change in growth velocity pre and post GH was seen in those treated with GH (n=38, r= -0.28; p=0.07). Conclusions: If the combined simultaneous arginine clonidine test is shortened to 120 minutes, only 2.2% of normal responders would be missed. Since the combined simultaneous stimulation test spares patients the inconvenience of sequential testing, misclassification of 2.2% of normal re sponders is acceptable. The combined arginine clonidine stimulation test correlates weakly with clinical indices of GH status. 39 ABSTRACT 27. HEPATIC PORTAL VENOUS GAS IN A PATIENT WITH HYPERTROPHIC PYLORIC STENOSIS Sherin Daniel MD gas is the presence of gas within the portal vein and its branches. It was initially described in 1955 as a radiographic sign associat ed with increased mortality in infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Its presence is associated with multiple diseases which may be benign or potentially devastating requiring immediate diagnosis and management. Case Presentation : 4-week-old male presented with one week history of multiple episodes of non-bloody, non- bilious projectile emesis occurring frequ ently. Physical exam was significant for olive shaped mass in the mid upper abdomen. Bloodwork showed evidence of hyponatremia, hypokalemia and hypochloremia. Initial imaging with AUS and AXR was significant for portal venous gas but did not meet radiographic criteria for pyloric stenosis. Given the AUS/AXR findings patient was admitted with conc ern of bowel ischemia. Emesis persisted with multiple subsequent imaging remaining inconclusive for pyloric stenosis. He underwent upper endoscopy which showed a narrowed, hypertrophic pylorus. Afterwards, he had a pyloromyotomy with resolution of his emesis. Discussion: Hepatic portal venous gas (HPVG) is a rare and usua lly incidental finding in the setting of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS). The presence of HPVG on imaging was previously thought to be ominous sign warranting urgent intervention however, with the improved sensitivity of imaging including ultrasound, it is being found in an increasing number of benign conditions. The exact pathop hysiology of HPVG remains unclear however, multiple theories have been proposed including that it occurs due to portal venous microbe derived gas production or the migration of intestinal luminal air to the portal system. In HPS, hepatic portal venous gas is usually a transient process and resolves within days of gastric decompression. 40 ABSTRACT 28. THE EFFECT OF PROTON PUMP INHIBITOR TH ERAPY ON THE INFANT FECAL MICROBIOME Denease Francis MD, Grace Gath ungu MD, Anupam a Chawla MD Background: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is defined as reflux producing bothersome symptoms. Patients with GERD who fail dietary measures are placed on anti-reflux therapy. There is increasing evidence that alterations in the gastric pH may affect overall health. In one study, premature infants treated with H-2 antagonists had a decrease in diversity of their fecal microbiota. Objective: To determine the effect of proton pump inhibitors on compositi on of fecal microbiota in infants. Design: A case controlled study was performed among patients between 0.5 to 6 months old. Subjects were on PPI therapy for at least 4 weeks prior to inclusion. However, controls as young as 2 weeks were included. Patients were excluded if they had anatomical gastroin testinal disorders, were on antimicrobial s within 30 days of enrollment, or if parents were unable to give informed consent. Stool wa s collected and DNA extracted using Zymo Research Fecal DNA Mini Prep kit. DNA was submitted for sequencing. Am plification of the V3-V4 regions of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes was performed. Sequences were sorted by sample barcodes and classified using a bacteria reference database. The 16 s rRNA sequences were grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) representing identified bacterial species. Results: The overall microbiome composition of infants with reflux on PPI therapy did not differ significantly from controls (p=0.98). Each taxon [genus] was analyzed fo r differences in relative abundance between cases and controls. Findings revealed that controls had increased abundance of proteobacteria enterobacter (p=0.04) and proteobacteria B38 (p=0.03). Conversely, the of firmicutes RS-D42 (p=0.05) and firmicutes granulicatella (p=0.04). no statistically significa nt difference in overall microbiome composition by mode of birth (p=0.22). There was however, a statistically significant difference by age in months (p=0.00075). Conclusions: Our data suggest that acid suppression may impact the diversity of the microbiome in infants however; our sample size needs to be expanded. 41 ABSTRACT 29. NASAL INTERMITTENT MANDATORY VENTILATION (NIMV) VERSUS NASAL CONTINUOUS POSITIVE AIRWAY PRES SURE (NCPAP0 IN STABLE PRETERM INFANTS: DOES NIMV PROVIDE CARDIORESPIRATORY STABILITY? Macomber-Estill MD, Joseph Decr istofaro MD, and Jennifer Pynn MD. Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology Background: NIMV is a frequently used mode of respiratory support in preterm neonates. No previous studies have determined optimal NIMV settings in the very low birth weight (VLBW) infant population. Objective: Determine the NIMV settings which will prov ide improved ventilation and cardiorespiratory stability using transcutaneous CO2 (TcCO2) monitoring. Design: To validate TcCO2 monitoring, we first performed a correlation study between serum PCO2 and TcCO2 (SenTec AG, Switzerland) in VLBW infants with an umbili cal arterial catheter. For th e remainder of the study, VLBW infants were included, if requiring NCPAP or NI MV, with FiO2 <35%, and on caffeine. Infants were excluded if FiO2 >35%, with signs of clinical sepsis, hemodynamic instability, or major congenital anomalies. Infants were exposed to NIMV with varying inspiratory pressures (PIP) above PEEP and inspiratory times (Ti), while holding all other ventilator parameters constant. Patients were then randomized to alternating one hour study periods using CPAP and NIMV. Our primary outcome was time-weighted (TW) TcCO2. Results: There was a positive correlation between TcCO2 an d PCO2 (R\u00b2 = 0.83, 70 paired measures, \u00b1 2.2 weeks, BW: 921 \u00b1 296g). Preliminary results from a Bland Altman indicate that TcCO2 readings are generally higher than PCO2 (mean difference of 2.68). Ninety-two percent of the differences are within 2 SDs of the mean. Thirty-two stable preterm infants were included to assess the effects of PIP and Ti on TcCO2 (GA: 1100 \u00b1 NIMV settings varied per patient and TW TcCO2 did not vary significantly with adjusted settings. There was no difference in TW TcC02, oxygenation, respiratory rates and heart rates during the study periods. Conclusion: TcCO2 can be useful in estimating PCO2 in the VLBW population. Although short-term us e of varying NIMV settings did not demons trate improvement in TcCO2 monitoring when compared to NCPAP, optimal settings with long-term use and the eff ects on ventilation and cardiorespiratory stability remain to be determined. 42 "}
