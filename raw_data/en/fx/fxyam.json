(Nasdaq: NVAX), a global company advancing protein-based vaccines with its novel Matrix-M adjuvant, has been granted full Marketing Authorization (MA) by the European Commission in the European Union (EU) for Nuvaxovid (NVX-CoV2373). This decision follows positive opinion for a full MA from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency. The vaccine is now fully authorized for use as a primary series in individuals aged 12 and older and as a booster dose in adults aged 18 and older for the prevention of COVID-19. Nuvaxovid was originally granted a conditional MA in the EU for these indications. \"This Marketing Authorization establishes the foundation for all future regulatory approvals for updated versions of our COVID vaccine, a necessity to ensure we can quickly get our vaccine to individuals in the EU,\" said John C. Jacobs, President and Chief Executive Officer, Novavax. \"In addition to the EU, we are preparing to file for full approval in the U.S. as well as other markets and are committed to ensuring protein-based options are available worldwide. Vaccine choice remains an integral part of public health measures.\" The Phase 3 PREVENT-19 trial demonstrated Nuvaxovid's reassuring safety profile as well as efficacy as a primary series in adults, the immunogenicity and safety as a booster dose in adults, and the efficacy and safety as a primary series in individuals aged 12 and older. Novavax's COVID vaccine is authorized for use in more than 40 markets around the world.

About Nuvaxovid (NVX-CoV2373) NVX-CoV2373 is a protein-based vaccine made by creating copies of the surface spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID. With Novavax's unique recombinant nanoparticle technology, the non-infectious spike protein serves as the antigen that primes the immune system to recognize the virus, while Novavax's Matrix-M adjuvant enhances and broadens the immune response. The vaccine is packaged as a ready-to-use liquid formulation and is stored at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C, enabling the use of existing vaccine supply and cold chain channels. About the PREVENT-19 Phase 3 Trial The PRE-fusion protein subunit Vaccine Efficacy Novavax Trial COVID-19 (PREVENT-19) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded Phase 3 trial conducted in the U.S. and Mexico to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NVX-CoV2373 as a primary series and as a booster in adults and adolescents to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. As a primary series, the primary endpoint was the first occurrence of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed symptomatic (mild, moderate, or severe) COVID-19 with onset at least seven days after the second dose in 29,960 adult participants aged 18 and older at baseline without protocol violations prior to illness. A secondary endpoint was the prevention of PCR-confirmed, symptomatic moderate or severe COVID-19. Full results of the trial were published in the [New England Journal of Medicine](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3913167-1&h=2654385332&u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D3625115-1%26h%3D371124133%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fc212.net%252Fc%252Flink%252F%253Ft%253D0%2526l%253Den%2526o%253D3440781-1%2526h%253D467849857%2526u%253Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.nejm.org%25252Fdoi%25252Ffull%25252F10.1056%25252FNEJMoa2116185%25253Fquery%25253Dfeatured_home%2526a%253DNew%252BEngland%252BJournal%252Bof%252BMedicine%26a%3DNew%2BEngland%2BJournal%2Bof%2BMedicine&a=New+England+Journal+of+Medicine).
