I was rifling through my medicine cabinet, applying all the jams, jellies, [and creams](https://www.allure.com/gallery/best-face-moisturizer) in my nightly skin-care routine before a little pre-sleep relaxation. I sat on my bed and began writing in my [wellness journal](https://www.allure.com/story/gratitude-journals-for-mental-health). I was creating a list of personal care and makeup items I wanted to try. But first, a little social media. As I scrolled through Instagram, I came across [Seerat Saini](https://www.instagram.com/seeratsaini/)'s account. I was looking for more South Asian bloggers to follow and instantly connected with her content. She posted beginner-friendly makeup tutorials that I could actually follow, like [this bronze and copper](https://www.instagram.com/p/B4RMsRtA9VL/) makeup look she posted to her feed. From the metallic brown eyeshadow to the Desi jewelry set she accessorized with, everything about this look was elegant. The headpiece complemented the makeup perfectly. The highlighter was another feature for me \u2014 a quick check confirmed it was the [Il Makiage Mineral Loose Highlighter](https://www.ilmakiage.com/face/face-highlighter-contour/loose-powder-842) in tan almond bronze. I added it to my list of products to try \u2014 it was perfect for the days I wanted to achieve a more radiant glow with a touch of shimmer. As I combed through Saini's grid, I realized she was offering more than just eye shadow looks that I could conceivably do at home. Her account is also a treasure trove of info on ancient ayurvedic techniques, which I began to incorporate into my own hair care routine. I was an instant fan. And I quickly realized that part of my admiration came from the refreshing feeling of seeing a Punjabi-American beauty influencer on my feed. Saini is known for her graphic eye looks, stunning '90s Bollywood-inspired outfits, and ayurvedic hair-care tutorials. She also writes detailed reviews of makeup and skin-care products. But no matter what she talks about on her account, one thing is clear: She is passionate about what she does. Like many influencers, Saini didn't start out in the fashion and beauty space. She actually didn't start taking her content creation seriously until 2018. Before that, she was working at Facebook \u2014 she believed the tech world would offer a more stable career. But after working in San Francisco for a few years, she felt that she was a missing creative outlet. It was through influencing that she was able to reconnect with what she loved doing most: experimenting with fashion, trying new beauty products, and creating humorous skits that reflect life as a Desi woman in the U.S. Once Saini decided to quit her job and pursue blogging full time, she went in with the intent of being that representation for South Asian women, particularly Punjabi-American women. The influencer space has grown so much since that time, and she believes there's still not enough representation to this day, but in 2018, there were even fewer South Asians in the space. \"I thought that maybe, through falling back in love with fashion and beauty, I could be that representation for the little version of me who also felt underrepresented,\" she tells Allure. Our beauty standards, in her opinion, need to be decolonized. For generations, Eurocentric ideals have had a negative impact on South Asian women. The culture's sense of beauty is both influenced by colonialism and outdated, home-grown notions of what is desirable. In South Asian culture, being \"beautiful\" often means having fair skin and a slim, hairless body. The pressure to lighten your complexion or use a lighter foundation than your natural hue can be overwhelming. [Colorism is so deeply embedded](https://www.allure.com/story/color-and-colorism-in-thailand) in South Asian cultures that [skin-lightening products](https://www.allure.com/story/fair-and-lovely-unilever-name-skin-lightening-cream) constitute a multibillion-dollar industry. Saini offers another take: South Asian women represent the epitome of beauty as they naturally are. \"Dark hair, dark skin, thick hair and eyebrows are all extraordinarily beautiful qualities,\" she says. \"We have been brainwashed for so long to think otherwise. I had to unlearn so many lies fed to us as young South Asian women - primarily that Eurocentric features are the beauty standard.\" Saini hopes to impact young girls to do the same and to be unapologetically themselves. Allure speaks to Saini about just that: celebrating Desi beauty aesthetics and rituals and how her content is allowing her to be the change she wants to see in the world. ALLURE: What do you hope to achieve with your platform? Seerat Saini: I really want to encourage South Asian women to step into their power. I want them to know that they are the definition of beauty. I want to remind them and all women who are minorities in America how effervescent and powerful they are. I think the world screams at us, trying to take our power away starting from such a young age. I want women to reclaim that power whether it's through beauty, fashion, or self-expression. I want them to know you don't become powerful, you are born that way. ALLURE: Who inspires you? SS: [Rowi Singh](https://www.instagram.com/rowisingh/?hl=en) for experimental beauty and [Maria Thattil](https://www.instagram.com/mariathattil/) for confidence and the way she carries herself. ALLURE: What are some of your favorite South Asian beauty brands? SS: There are so many wonderful South Asian businesses, but as of recently, I really like [Live Tinted](https://www.livetinted.com/collections/all), [Mango People](https://mangopeopleofficial.com/), and [Kulfi and My favorite hair-care brand is [Fable and Mane](https://fableandmane.com/). ALLURE: What are some of your favorite high-end and drugstore beauty products? SS: A drugstore product that I use all the time when I want to do a nude lip is the [Milani lip liner](https://shop-links.co/1764484444051783261) in Spice. It's brown-skin-friendly and the perfect nude color for my skin. My favorite high-end makeup product is the [Charlotte Tilbury Beauty Light Wand](https://shop-links.co/1764484486805874494) in Pinkgasm. It gives you a lot of product and lasts a long time. I think the wand is so popular among celebrities because it has great staying power and is a universally flattering shade. ALLURE: What are your holy grail skin-care SPF](https://shop-links.co/1764484524141169317). It's a sunscreen, moisturizer, and primer. I use four pumps every day, rain or shine. I also really like the [Sahjan Radiance Serum](https://shop-links.co/1764484587087188521). It has [triphala,](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/plants/ayurvedic-herbs/triphala/) which is a powerful antioxidant, [gotu kola](https://www.kamaayurveda.com/ingredient/gotukala), and hyaluronic acid. ALLURE: Do you follow any traditional South Asian beauty practices? SS: Yes \u2014 oil massaging has continued throughout my daily routine. It is a classic South Asian ritual and very therapeutic. Tel malish, or [oil massaging of the hair](https://www.allure.com/story/indian-hair-oiling-technique), is such a relaxing activity for both men and women. My mom would heat up the oil and mix amla or bhringraj (ayurvedic herbal oils believed to promote hair growth) together in order to massage my scalp. I love using the [Saha Scalp Amla Soothing Serum](https://fableandmane.com/products/sahascalp-amla-soothing-serum?gclid=Cj0KCQiAw9qOBhC-ARIsAG-rdn5NyyhmyY_zvsXGnUImhngBg-Oyd3nbikQHEn7ikIzTaMGG63s06tEaAnO5EALw_wcB) from Fable and Mane. It's a hair serum that smells like perfume, a more palatable smell for most people. I honestly enjoy the smell of proper pungent amla, but it's great for those who want a less potent smell. It's a finishing oil and has ayurvedic ingredients such as [bakuchi.](https://www.1mg.com/ayurveda/bakuchi-72-oil/) Another technique that has continued throughout my life is braiding my hair and sleeping in a braid. I take bhringraj powder every night and [ashwagandha supplements](https://cna.st/affiliate-link/czFVXSNQYKsaD65kaSGuUvfL6b9U3ftfSCMoorg1zbmCev6xs1dpWQNPXvNkVaR9tpPs55Di2XGrMdGkfecjUeWb11jTLgNznHRd8LEEhbVrMYmVkYtV1TN3ocQcvMYzJ5YJjWCcj1xSBgWKFEfnxzQPsk5iWQbeVyfnvFGrjbz3vnZJmmSntgNCKxTtqZRo8xPFKKeyH4R5MukWNzdvWwMTYHrg5DMFpvgKdUWyBK4LMNvYHAh5o7SirpM9Tae8PKELFKcxuzPir8VtF2Tp88M53JgkL37UgGs8GZxvrwq4fdJ99QC?cid=61f2cd1a105e53f1c9b1460c) for gut health and beauty. Back in grade school, I was teased for oiling my hair and always wearing a braid. But what makes your hair beautiful? Putting nourishing ingredients in it and wearing it in a protective style. So many things that people in America made fun of us for are the exact things that are now \"trending\" in the wellness and beauty spaces. For example, people are only now discovering the [benefits of turmeric](https://www.allure.com/story/turmeric-skin-benefits). But we have known what combinations work for so long and the rest of the world is catching up. There are many things we need to reclaim and one of those things is wellness: whether that's internal or external beauty. That's why many of the skin-care brands I use have ayurvedic ingredients in them and are South Asian-owned. Ayurveda is for absolutely everyone \u2014 but at least shop South Asian brands and know the history of the practice before participating. ALLURE: Why do you think your hair-care videos are so popular? SS: I think a lot of people do not know how to approach ayurveda as there's so much information and it can be overwhelming. You almost don't know where to start. I had major hair loss back in 2019, so I went back to the rituals that I grew up with. People found my methods to be an approachable way to ayurveda. [Hair fall](https://www.allure.com/story/the-complete-guide-to-hair-loss-the-science-of-beauty-podcast) is so personal and it can be very devastating, especially for women. For some of us, our identity is attached to our hair. Seeing your hair come out can be traumatic which is why I started posting videos showcasing my journey with hair loss. ALLURE: How do you manage your comedy skits versus your beauty content? SS: I had always loved Twitter culture and that's where I first started writing funny tweets and making memes. Instagram wasn't really the place for it but I think TikTok really changed the landscape of social media as a whole. Before, things were more static. Your meme content would stay on Twitter and your fashion posts would be for Instagram. But TikTok has melded those two things together. Suddenly, we don't want static content - we want short-form videos that are entertaining, helpful, or inspiring in some way. It's more acceptable now to just be a content creator without feeling pressured to fit into a specific category. I want to make the content I want to consume and so as a South Asian woman, I love to see relatable brown girl videos. I noticed people resonating with my sense of humor and realized that it can leave the Twitter meme format and translate into a 15-second reel without taking away from my fashion and beauty content. Rather, I think it's a way for people to relate to my experiences. ALLURE: You also happen to be a Sikh. Are there any challenges you've come across due to that identity? SS: As a South Asian consumer, I definitely did. While shopping for makeup, I brought in a picture of [Maria Thattil](https://www.instagram.com/mariathattil/), (a South-Asian Australian model and digital creator) as I wanted to recreate her nude lip. The makeup artist was trying different swatches on me, but he was making me uncomfortable - constantly shaking his head frowning. He then tried putting concealer on my lips to \"mute out the color.\" He took me to the mirror and when I saw my lips, I looked like a corpse. He continued to say, \"I think your lips just have too much natural pigment.\" I remember his exact words. I don't think I had the language for it yet. It was definitely a microaggression. I just replied, \"no worries,\" because we are taught to make ourselves small and agreeable. ALLURE: Do you think the beauty and fashion industry is becoming more inclusive? SS: I don't think we can change the structure of the spaces we aren't in and tables we aren't invited to. But we also don't need to beg to be in these spaces. I think these spaces need us. We are a huge percentage of the world's population, and we come in such a variety of skin tones and eye colors. For brands to ignore a diverse range of individuals is simply problematic. In fact, it's in their best interest to include us.
