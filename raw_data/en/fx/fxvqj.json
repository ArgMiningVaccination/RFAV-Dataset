It is an understandable concern. No one wants to undo the dental cleaning work but many people come into the office without eating for hours prior to the appointment. There are a few factors which may influence when you should eat after your appointment. Check and see which of these apply to your particular case. Carefully Eat Right After Dental Cleaning You don't have to wait for hours to eat after your dental cleaning. In fact, you don't have to wait at all! That's right, you can eat right after a dental cleaning. You just might not want to eat anything. Dental cleaning can cause your teeth and gums to be sensitive. Very cold or very hot foods may be too intense for freshly cleaned teeth. Fluoride Treatment Means You Should Wait Okay, in most cases you can eat right after a dental cleaning. Except if you receive a fluoride treatment with your dental cleaning. A fluoride treatment can help strengthen your teeth against decay, repairing the enamel on your teeth. To receive the most out of this treatment, you will need to wait 30 minutes after your dental cleaning to eat or drink. By waiting 30 minutes, the fluoride treatment has enough time to seal around your teeth. What To Eat After A Dental Cleaning While you can eat whatever you want after a dental cleaning, there may be some things you want to avoid. Some foods to avoid for a while after a cleaning are foods which are: - Sticky - Citruses - Spicy - Crunchy - Cold Now, that may seem like you now have no food options. But the sensitivity of your teeth will calm down in a few hours and you can feel free to eat whatever you would like. Directly post-dental cleaning, some of the foods you should eat are: - Soft foods (applesauce, mashed potatoes, yogurt, bananas, etc) - Soups - Hard-boiled eggs Also, be sure you stay hydrated. You should avoid sugary drinks, as it can be harsh on your newly cleaned teeth. Water is the best choice, as it will not stain your teeth and hydrates you the best out of any liquids you could be drinking.
