Due to the limited publication and weak coherence of the collected articles before the year 2003, and the publication search started on April 2023, the number of publications published in 2023 does not reflect the overall publication situation for the year, therefore only publications from 2003 to 2022 were analyzed. Importing the data into Excel for analysis yielded Table 1, which shows that although researchers published related articles in WOS in 1994, research related to the integration of ML and TCM only began to grow steadily and consistently since 2003, peaking in 2022 (N = 274). 3.2 Clustering analysis of literature countries (regions) and institutions By analyzing the countries (regions) and institutions to which 1,552 literatures belonged, a total of 51 countries (regions) and 360 institutions had published research articles on ML analysis of TCM. The results of country co-occurrence are shown in Table 1, Fig. 2 The number of publications can reflect the importance of this field in a certain country/region. The countries with more related research are China (N = 1474) including Taiwan (China) (N = 114), USA (N = 87), Australia (N = 44), UK (N = 30), Canada (N = 21), Korea (N = 21), Japan (N = 20), Singapore (N = 14), and India (N = 12). China is the country with the highest number of publications, 1,474, which far exceeds the second place USA (87), indicating the dominance of China in terms of publications. The countries (regions) with high intermediary centrality (centrality 0.1) are China, Taiwan (China), India, and the UK. The centrality indicates the strength of the number of connections between a node and other nodes in the whole network, and we can find that India has a relatively small number of publications, but its intermediary centrality is high in the top 3, which shows that India cooperates with other countries (regions) relatively frequently and closely and has a certain influence. The intermediary centrality of South Korea is 0, indicating that the country has less cooperation with other countries (regions). Table 1 Top ten countries/regions in terms of the number of articles issued | | Country/Region | | Count | | Centrality | | PEOPLES R CHINA | | 1359 | | 1.11 | | TAIWAN(CHINA) | | 114 | | 0.27 | | USA | | 87 | | 0.08 | | AUSTRALIA | | 44 | | 0.01 | | ENGLAND | | 30 | | 0.11 | | CANADA | | 21 | | 0.04 | | SOUTH KOREA | | 21 | | 0 | | JAPAN | | 20 | | 0.02 | | SINGAPORE | | 14 | | 0.09 | | INDIA | | 12 | | 0.22 The clustering of the institutions to which the articles belong is shown in Fig. 3, and we can see complicated cooperation relationships between different institutions. The top ten institutions in terms of the number of articles are all located in China, as shown in Table 2, namely, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (N = 108), Chinese Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (N = 100), Chinese Academy of Sciences (N = 98), Beijing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (N = 97), China Medical University, Taiwan (N = 63), Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (N = 60), Zhejiang University (N = 51), Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine ( N = 50), China Medical University Hospital-Taiwan (N = 48), and Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (N = 47). Among them, those with centrality 0.1 are the Beijing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which indicates that these institutions have frequent cooperation with other regions or institutions and their research results have more significant influence.

From the graph's clustering of lines and nodes, a more mature research team was formed in China; unlike the close connection between institutions, there needs to be more cooperation between groups. Figure 4 shows the nodes with names in the co-occurrence diagram representing the 17 authors with more than eight publications and more distributed among the established research teams, and Table 3 shows the authors publications numbers and institutions they represent. Chen, et al.[5],Li, et al.[6], Cai, et al.[7], Wang, et al.[8], Ni, et al[9], Tsai, et al.[10], Six teams with ML analysis of Chinese herbal medicine as their primary research direction; Cui, et al.[11] and Wen, et al.[12], two teams made ML analysis of tongue images as their main research direction; Chen, et al. primarily used ML for TCM evidence and disease association analysis research[13]; Wang, mainly focused on ML analysis of Chinese herbal medicine [14] and application of ML for diagnosis of evidence[15]; Wang, et al. applied ML to study pulse diagnosis in TCM[16] and research related to diagnosis of evidence in TCM[17]. The relevant research in this field is divided into two main general directions: the analysis of TCM, and the study of TCM evidence and TCM symptoms of diseases. However, the mediated centrality of authors is generally zero at present i.e Table 3, indicating that high-impact authors have not yet emerged in this field.

The number of articles published in the journals reflects the degree of attention of the journals in this research area. Among them, EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE ranked first with 109 papers, accounting for 7.02% of the total literature volume. This was followed by the JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOMEDICAL ANALYSIS (N = 74, 4.77%), JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY (N = 67, 4.32%), FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY (N = 40, 2.58%) and MOLECULES (N = 38, 2.45%). Among them, FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY has the highest impact factor among these ten journals, with an impact factor of 5.988 in 2021[1] . A dual map overlay of journals from TCM combined with ML research is shown in Fig. 5, with the citing journals on the left of the figure and the cited journals on the right, and the labels in both figures represent the disciplines covered by the journals. The colored lines between the two plots represent the relationship between the administered and cited literature, using the z-Scores function to highlight more robust and fluid relationship trajectories. Six critical paths are shown in Fig. 5, including four purple paths, one yellow path and one orange path, where the purple path means that publications in the PHYSICS/ MATERIALS/ CHEMISTRY domain are mainly influenced by that publications in VETERINARY/ ANIMAL/ SCIENCE are often influenced by publications in MOLECULAR/ BIOLOGY/ GENETICS/ HEALTH/ NURSING/ MEDICINE. The orange path means that publications in the field MOLECULAR/ BIOLOGY/ IMMUNOLOGY are influenced by publications in the field MOLECULAR/ BIOLOGY/ GENETICS; the orange path means that publications in the field VETERINARY/ ANIMAL/ SCIENCE are often influenced by publications in the field MOLECULAR/ BIOLOGY/ GENETICS.

The relational network of co-cited literature comprised 923 nodes and 1,766 links.. In order to make the critical nodes and links in the network more transparent, the mapping was Pruning, choosing Pathfinder and Pruning the merged network to remove the unimportant nodes and links. A in Fig. 6 is the co-occurrence graph of cited literature, and the nodes with purple outer rings in the graph represent literature with centrality > 0.1, which are key nodes of importance in this research field and are usually vital hubs connecting two different fields [18]. The most cited literature with the highest centrality is a review that discusses the status and main issues of research on ML techniques combined with different TCM diagnostic methods for patient classification [19]. Two studies on tongue image classification follow this, a study on disease classification by analyzing tongue color [20], and example learning using ML algorithms to explore the association between tongue image features and different characteristics (cold/heat) [21]. Looking at the studies ranked in the top 15 for mediated centrality (Table 5), we found that most of the studies about disease classification or diagnosis had a high centrality. In contrast, studies about Chinese herbal medicine had a relatively low centrality ranking. Figure 6(b) shows the clustering diagram of the cited literature, showing the ten most significant clusters, which are #0 convolutional neural network, #1 tongue classification, Based on the clustering colors, it can be inferred that the main research in this field in the last two years has been carried out based on convolutional neural network, tongue classification.

The high outbreak cited literature indicates the literature that has a rapid increase in the number of citations within a certain time frame. Taking 2019 as the dividing line, the topics of high outbreak literature before 2019 varied, including quality control of Chinese herbal medicine, knowledge discovery in TCM, evidence-based classification of TCM diseases, metabolomics, and deep learning. Furthermore, the high outbreak literature appearing in 2019 and after is mainly related to convolutional neural network[23-30]and tongue image analysis[22-25, 31, 32], followed by knowledge mapping[33], Chinese medicine prescription model[34], and the current topics that remain as high outbreak literature[22-25, 31, 32, 34] remain dominated by convolutional neural network and tongue image analysis. Hence, content related to convolutional networks and tongue image analysis in the past two years is the main research basis, which is consistent with the above-cited literature clustering chart showing the content. 3.6 Keyword co-occurrence analysis Through keyword co-occurrence analysis, we can intuitively understand the research hotspots in the field, and emergent keywords can foreshadow cutting-edge topics. Firstly, the keywords with the same meaning in the graph were combined, and the keyword co-occurrence and clustering of the literature performed by the LLR algorithm, among which the top 20 keywords in terms of frequency are shown in Table 6 and Fig. 8(a). Figure 8(b) shows the keyword clustering graph, which shows the maximum seven clusters, namely #0 machine learning, #1 metabonomics, #2 quality control, #3 alternative medicine, #4 network pharmacology, #5 It can be seen that the research objects in the last two decades are mainly focused on Chinese herbal medicine, mostly using ML combined with mass spectrometry, high-performance liquid chromatography, metabolomics or near-infrared spectroscopy to identify types, quality control and composition analysis of Chinese herbal medicine. This is followed by disease-oriented research using MLg to build diagnostic models and predict the risk probability of disease occurrence. The keyword timeline view (Fig. 9) is obtained by sorting Fig. 8 by time, which can help to visualize the phase hotspots and directions from the time dimension.
