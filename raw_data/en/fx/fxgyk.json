My purpose is to help people reconnect to their wisest + truest self, allowing a remembering of the eternal. We have the ability to regenerate and discover the hidden parts within us. By receiving information from diverse consciousnesses, I weave new stories with my patients from the Celestial Body to the Physical Body. The majority of our pain begins in our Subtle Bodies. Information in layers of our multidimensional bodies may be difficult to hear. If we can awaken our Qi + Blood, enliven our Inner Temples & listen to our beingness beyond the physical, we can shift deep wounds + blocks. Each patient I see is treated on an individual basis. No one treatment is ever the same. All information revealed in each session is completely confidential. By incorporating ALL of my senses and my understanding of Eastern and Western Medicine+ Alchemy + Metaphysics I utilize a variety of modalities to compose a treatment that is right for you. The Aquarian Age calls for each one of us to be in our fullest embodied empowerment. We truly start living when we awaken to our own dream.
