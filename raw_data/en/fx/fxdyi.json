In-depth questions cover not only your medical history and symptoms, but also other factors that impact your health, including stress, diet, sleep habits, emotions, coping skills, work and family life, and spiritual beliefs. The consultation will include the interview, a physical exam and possibly lab tests. Next, your practitioner will consult with integrative medicine colleagues and your primary or referring physician to gather treatment recommendations from a rich variety of healing traditions and experience. On your next follow-up visit, you and your integrative practitioner will develop a personalized treatment plan to enhance healing and restore balance and wholeness in all aspects of your life. Focused Integrative Health Consultation A focused integrative health consultation requires less time and fewer visits than a comprehensive consultation. You and your practitioner will focus on one or a few specific health issues with conventional and complementary treatment and diagnostic options. Each consultation takes about 60 minutes for an initial visit and 40 minutes for follow-up visits. You and your practitioner will then create a plan that may include routine and specialty lab tests; [diet and exercise](/services/holistic-integrative-medicine/integrative-nutrition) recommendations, nutritional supplements and medications, support groups and classes, or behavioral therapy utilizing a variety of [mind-body techniques](/services/holistic-integrative-medicine/integrative-psychotherapy-mind-body-medicine), such as meditation or guided imagery.
