These novel approaches succeed because we carefully select sponsors who can share in our mission and our programs. The American House Foundation, for instance, gives 70% of all the money it raises directly to the frail elderly in need, and 30% to the IOG for ongoing research on aging. An af - filiation between the IOG and Heartland Rehabiltitation Centers in southeastern Michigan supports scholarship and education for clients and their families. Our speakers' bureau and new portable continuing education seminars also generate income that we invest into additional pro - grams to reach more people. We make maximum use of our cost-effective website to educate visitors about all that we do. A budgetary review of our programs and publications has meant some trimming (you hold a smaller annual report in your hands this year), but never at the expense of Detroit's older population. In times of loss, we will not lose our focus. In times of cutbacks, we will never cut back on our commitment to help older adults. Peter Lichtenberg, Ph.D., ABPP Director, Insititute of Gerontology Professor of Psychology, Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, and Physical Medicine and RehabilitationPundits call it the Great Recession, the longest and deepest economic decline since 1929. No sector of so - ciety escaped this past year's downfall, but older adults may have been hit harder than anyone. Retirement sav - ings shrank. Home values (for those lucky enough to have a home) tumbled. Massive lay-offs often targeted older workers. Medical costs rose. Resources of the poor and needy were especially decimated as charitable dona - tions dwindled and social service organizations rationed their aid. Tough times test our character. We, at the Institute of Gerontology, are proud that in these times of uncertainty we remained certain of our mission to improve the lives of older adults and their families. As the economy with - ered, we worked harder to reach record numbers of se - niors at our events and forums. We organized hundreds of free health screenings and dozens of health education workshops. We made a successful push to get our SAGE mental health training DVDs into the hands and minds of larger groups of healthcare professionals so they could recognize the early signs of depression or dementia in patients and get them the help they need. Our Issues in Aging professional development conference broke its 22-year attendance record. Our research projects thrive through hard work, effi - cient use of scarce resources, and innovative approaches that transform research breakthroughs into real-life so - lutions. Our exceptionally talented faculty received new grants this year on a variety of aspects of aging and health, from the economics of medication adherence, to the experience of depression among White, Black and Mexican American older adults. Research excellence is visible in the quality of work from the students in our aging and urban health research training program, several of whom completed their doc - toral dissertations this year. Research requires volunteers to succeed. We streamlined our volunteer recruitment process and now have a record number of 1,072 older adults in our database, each one willing to participate in research projects that match their needs and profile.

This year he expanded his directorship to in - clude the Merrill Palmer Skillman Institute for Child & Fam - ily Development (MPSI). Both the IOG and MPSI will con - tinue as separate institutes, but Dr. Lichtenberg will use his leadership as an opportunity to pursue integrated research projects that span the life cycle. In the spring, a team of IOG and MPSI faculty received funding from Wayne State University for a planning and research study of children, parents and grandparents. The study is called the LIFHE Project, which stands for Lifespan Investigation of Family, Health and Environment. In August, Dr. Lichtenberg's role at the American Psy - chological Association also increased as he assumed the role of president of the APA's Division 20 (Adult Develop - ment and Aging), a nationally respected source of research on psychology and aging, and an advocate for older adults. He continues to be an active member of the Gerontologi - cal Society of America, both in the Behavioral and Social Sciences Section and by helping to form and lead a new network of Behavioral and Social Gerontology Program Directors. This group, formed two years ago, will hold its third annual meeting at the 2009 GSA. RESEARCH In addition to the newly funded LIFHE project, Dr. Lich - tenberg continues as principal investigator on five research projects, co-principal investigator on three others, and co- director of the five-year Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research to promote health among older minority populations. His research interests include iden - tifying depression, training home health professionals in assessing older patients, reducing the increased incidence of certain cancers in older African Americans, developing screening modules to assist in accessing competency, and improving cognitive abilities through systematic training. MENTORING Dr. Lichtenberg was a faculty advisor and mentor for two students who successfully defended their dissertations in the past 18 months. Paul Cernin is now in his third year of post-doctoral studies at UCLA. Brooke Schneider won an internship at the West Los Angeles VA Healthcare Center to work with older veterans suffering from an array of serious health issues. Both Paul and Brooke were part of the IOG's pre-doctoral training program in aging and health. PUBLICATIONS Dr. Lichtenberg was the guest editor of Generations: Update on Dementia , a special once-each-decade issue of the Journal of the American Society on Aging . He is co-author of \"Gambling in Older Adults: An Emerging Problem for Nurses,\" wrote a guest editorial in the Journal of Addictions Nursing , and has five additional publications in press. AWARDS Gov. Jennifer Granholm conferred a special state trib - ute and citation on Dr. Lichtenberg for his 10 years of exceptional service to the health and well-being of older adults; and to the Michigan Dementia Coalition, which he has chaired since 1999. Dr. Lichtenberg received this honor at the unveiling of the coalition's new three-year strategic plan which he co-chaired. \"Alzheimer's disease and other dementias affect approximately 240,000 Michi - gan residents,\" Dr. Lichtenberg said. \"We are fortunate that our state leaders understand the far-reaching impact of this problem.\" He also received the DeVito Memorial Award in May.PETER LICHTENBERG , Ph.D., ABPP Director Dr. Lichtenberg became president of the American Psychological Association's Division 20 on Adult Devel - opment and Aging. He is shown here with outgoing President Elizabeth Zelinski.Faculty ResearchDr. Luborsky is a professor of anthropology and ger - ontology at Wayne State University. He is a principal in - vestigator on two major research studies: the $1.1 million Health Disparities and Disability MARK L UBORSK y, Ph.D. Director of Aging & Health Disparities ResearchWith a special interest in vulnerable populations, Dr. Washington, PMHCNS-BC, NP, LPC, has spent much of her career working with older African Americans and older homeless women to improve their health and social stabil - ity. She is the co-director of the Community Liaison Core for the $3.3 million Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research project, a collaboration between the University of Michigan and the IOG. Dr. Washington organizes its annual Healthier Black Elders Center Health Reception, which hosted 1,100 seniors in June for a day of free health screenings, education and exercise. The 2009 event's 930 health screenings broke a seven-year record. Dr. Washington also is director of the Healthier Black Elders Center. She oversees a year-round educational pro - gram and development of the Participant Resource Pool that recruits older African American volunteers who may be interested in participating in research projects. The current database of 1,188 has more than tripled in the last few years. \"Our message is getting into the community,\" said Dr. Wash - ington, an associate professor of nursing and gerontology at the IOG and the College of Nursing. \"People understand that research is valuable to them, and we need their help to insure that it is both accurate and meaningful.\" Dr. Washington co-authored eight articles this past year, and has an additional four articles and three book chapters in press. She and her colleagues have created a website (to launch in late fall) that showcases their research help - ing older homeless women leave homelessness and remain domiciled. Homelessness is a problem of increasing magni - tude in Detroit and other urban areas as jobs and funding for social service organizations rapidly disappear.\"Hip Fracture: Cultural Loss and Long-Term Reintegration,\" and the $528,000 \"Downsizing Possessions for Residential Moves in Later Life.\" As director for aging and health dispar - ities research, he helps to oversee the $3.3 million Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research grant. Dr. Luborsky also shares his grant writing and management skills with researchers in Sweden and at the University of Pennsylvania as a consultant on new grant submissions and continuing projects. His other research interest is the HIV epidemic in Rwan - da. For three years, he has worked with the Rwandan gov - ernment to provide expertise and skills to help contain the spread of HIV. The regular visits by Dr. Luborsky and his team have shown good success. \"We learned, for instance, that the Rwandan ministry did not field-test its prevention programs before implementing them,\" he said. \"So we introduced cutting edge tools for survey, intervention re - search and field testing so the programs fit the people.\" His team followed up with extensive training for professional research interviewers. Dr. Luborsky published four articles this year and made 12 professional presentations. He continues as editor of Medical Anthropology Quarterly , the first international jour - nal published at Wayne State UniversityDr. Lysack OT(C) is a professor of gerontology and oc - cupational therapy whose research emphasizes the long- term social and physical effects of aging and disability. She is an investigator on the study \"Downsizing Possessions for Residential Moves in Later Life\" dually located in Detroit and Lawrence, Kansas. This study investigates how people who move to smaller quarters manage their possessions as an adaptation to the vulnerabilities of later life. Dr. Lysack co-directs the Pre-Doctoral Training Program in Aging and Urban Health and teaches research to occu - pational therapy students in the Department of Health Care Sciences. \"I am committed to insuring that research knowl - edge is reflected in the contemporary training of gradu - ate students,\" she said, \"and to helping health care pro - fessionals translate research findings into meaningful skills in practice.\" She was instrumental in developing the SAGE DVD training set, which strengthens the mental health as - sessment skills of occupational therapists. SAGE received na - tional recognition earlier this year when it was officially en - dorsed by the American Occupational Therapy Association. In September, Dr. Lysack traveled to China as an invited member of a national occupational therapy delegation cre - ated to foster the exchange of current rehabilitation knowl - edge and best practices. 3CATH y LySACK, P h.D. Deputy Director OLIVIA WASHINGTON , Ph.D. Director, Healthier Black Elders Center Dr. Washington addresses a capacity crowd at the 2009 HBEC Health Reception. After 30 years of service to Wayne State University, Dr. Washington will retire in December, but the good works of the HBEC will continue. Jointly appointed between the IOG and the depart - ment of anthropology, with a doctorate in mathemat - ics, Dr. Neufeld brings a unique array of knowledge to his work with older adults. An assistant professor of research, Dr. Neufeld's work is concentrated in two areas: how the perception of risk affects health behaviors, and how math - ematical applications can help people better understand financial performance. He has recently become interested in the relationship between savings rates, mutual fund fees, perceived risk and investment decisions. This year Dr. Neufeld made three national conference presentations, has one paper in press and four under re - view. Much of his writing and research relates directly to issues of risk and behavior, specifically in persons with spinal cord injury, or those having HIV. He served as the method - ology and statistical expert for several of the IOG's pre- and post-doctoral students, and also taught statistics to gradu - ate students in medical anthropology. Social & Behavioral Research on Aging As associate director for research at the IOG, Dr. Jankow- ski oversees the IOG's facilities, computers, security, web - sites, and other infrastructure and technological resources. He was awarded a $275,000 grant to fund Seniors Count! , a collaboration with Adult Well Being Services of Detroit to create a data warehouse on the social demographics and service needs of older adults in southeastern Michigan. An adjunct assistant professor in gerontology and polit - ical science, Dr. Jankowski published three articles this past year and was appointed to Wayne State University's gradu - ate student recruitment and scholarly communications committees. He has spoken about aging policy to dozens of local organizations, and he is active in Michigan's aging network. He chairs the advisory council of the Senior Alli - ance, Michigan Area Agency on Aging 1-C, and sits on its board of directors and executive committee. He serves on the board of the Michigan Society of Gerontology and the steering committee of the United Way of Southeast Michi - gan's Senior Collaborative initiative, among others. In recognition of his outstanding record of community service, Dr. Jankowski won the 2009 McNamara Award from the Senior Alliance for his pursuit of excellence in local aging services. He also continues to receive national rec - ognition for PhinisheD.org, his online support and discus - sion website for graduate students. PhinisheD was recom - THOMAS B.

WWJ reporter Pat Sweeting asks Dr. Jankowski about his new research project to accurately count seniors.Dr. Gonz\u00e1lez is an assistant professor of gerontology and family medicine and an expert on minority health and aging, especially within the Latino and Mexican American populations. He recently received a three-year, $1.2 million grant to fund an Epidemiology of Late-Life Depression and Ethnicity Research Study (ELLDERS) of the prevalence and distribution of major depression among older adults from various racial and ethnic backgrounds. \"Depression is a leading cause of disability in the U.S., but thus far we are seeing very low rates of treatments for ethnic minorities,\" he said. Results of his National Institute of Mental Health study should provide insights into how to prevent depression in an aging and diverse population. Over the past year, Dr. Gonz\u00e1lez published \"Diabetes Awareness and Knowledge among Latinos \" in The Journal of General Internal Medicine , and \"The Health of Older Mex - ican Americans in the Long Run\" in the American Journal of Public Health . He has had five other peer-reviewed articles accepted for publication. He was newly appointed to the editorial board of the Journal of Aging and Health and was elected to the Gerontological Society of America's Behav - ioral and Social Science executive committee.HECTOR Ph.D. Psychology and Epidemiology STEWART NEUFELD , Ph.D. Mathematics and Social Science 4mended in a recent Chronicle of Higher Education article and featured in several other news sources. 5Dr. Moffat was promoted with tenure to associate pro - fessor of gerontology and psychology at Wayne State Uni - versity. He is an exceptionally talented researcher, scholar and teacher concentrating on the impact of hormones on cognitive functioning as we age. He is the principal in - vestigator on a $1.46 million National Institutes of Health grant to study the effects of the stress hormone cortisol on older adults. His other work has looked at testosterone and cognitive aging, and at changes in our ability to navigate through our environment as we age. He published four articles this past year, has three other manuscripts under review, and presented at five national conferences. Dr. Moffat advises three doctoral students and has taught three different psychology classes over the past three years. He receives high ratings from his gradu - ate and undergraduate students. \"Our role as teacher is to Dr. Raz is the associate director for cognitive neurosci - ence at the IOG, and a professor of psychology and ger - ontology. He is also principal investigator on a five-year, $3 million MERIT Award studying how the brain ages. \"People get into a specific field of research for various rea - sons,\" he said. \"For me, the brain is an aesthetically pleas - ing object. Whether as a specimen on a lab table or an MRI image on a computer screen, it always fascinates.\" Dr. Raz's fascination with the brain's structure and function has motivated a prolific number of achieve - ments. Over the past year, he published 13 peer-reviewed articles, gave eight invited talks across the United States and Europe, and served as guest editor for a special issue of Neuropsychology Review . Teaching and mentoring are a high priority. Two of his graduate students completed their doctorates, and two others are near completion. \"My students have been successful in continuing produc - tive research . . . in prestigious programs around the coun - try,\" Dr. Raz said. \"We have a responsibility to pass on knowledge in a never-ending relay.\" Cognitive Neuroscience & Aging Nursing research and gerontology are a natural fit for Dr. Cresci, R.N.. As an assistant professor, she divides her time between the IOG and the College of Nursing as she conducts research into older adults' use of comput - ers and the internet. She received a Wayne State Univer - sity Award for her study, \"Understanding Urban Elders' Interest and Ability to Use Information Technology to Manage their Health,\" a natural outgrowth of computer classes she taught to Detroit's inner-city seniors. Two of her publications are currently in press. Dr. Cresci teaches graduate and undergraduate nurs - ing classes as WSU and continues to serve as an adjunct assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing, where she taught for many years. She particu - larly enjoys her time spent as faculty advisor to the IOG's Annual Art of Aging Successfully Conference. \"Enhancing the creative side of aging is fulfilling to me,\" Dr. Cresci said. \"The positive energy of Art of Aging is contagious.\" Prescription drug expenses are one of the fastest growing categories of healthcare expenditures in the U.S. Older adults on a fixed income must sometimes decide be - tween paying their electric bill and paying for prescribed medications. Dr. Jensen Summers is studying what hap - pens when older adults don't take their medicine. Her $370,000 grant, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, will be used to analyze the effects of non-adher - ence on the health and healthcare costs of older adults.SCOTT MOFFAT, P h.D.

This year's faculty fellow was lee Wurm, Ph.D. , an associate professor in the College of Lib - eral Arts & Sciences who specializes in cognitive, develop - mental and social psychology. \"I used the time to tool up for a very important pilot study requested by grant review - ers,\" Dr. Wurm said of the word recognition and memory study completed during his fellowship. \"We collected data from 55 older community residents and an equal number of younger controls.\" Dr. Wurm has begun the analysis of his data and expects it to lead to at least one major paper and possible additional funding. Though his year of faculty fellowship has ended, Dr. Wurm will remain as a training faculty member and re - turn for IOG colloquia as his teaching schedule allows. \"The small, collegial atmosphere at the IOG was warm and welcoming,\" Dr. Wurm said. His discussion of a grant pro - posal with two colleagues at the IOG led to useful advice on resubmission. \"Another colleague suggested a new way to pitch my work,\" Dr. Wurm added, \"which resulted in a brand new grant proposal.\" The 2009/10 faculty fellow is John Woodard, Ph.D. , who joined Wayne State in 2007. Dr. Woodard is an as - sociate professor in the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences in the area of clinical psychology. \"I'm looking forward to interacting with the IOG faculty,\" he said, \"and getting the concentrated time I need to work on grants and papers.\" Dr. Woodard's main research interests lie in the neu - ropsychology and neuroimaging of memory in aging, de - mentia and Alzheimer's Disease. He has analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of people's brains as they perform specific tasks, searching for biomarkers that could identify persons destined to get Alzheimer's Disease. One of the cognitive tasks they perform is recognizing age- \"From support staff to faculty members, I was overwhelmed by the level of helpfulness and competence I encountered.\" -- Dr. Wurm appropriate famous names to see how the brain remem - bers older memories versus newer information. \"This helps us understand how the hippocampus is working, which is one of the first areas of change in Alzheimer's,\" he said. Dr. Woodard also did extensive research with Phase III of the 21-year Georgia Centenarian Study of 244 subjects age 98 or older to determine why and how they achieve longer- than-average mortality.

Dr. Dillaway di - rectly credits the fellowship with helping her publish three journal articles, two book chapters, complete two interview projects, and initiate another interview project that secured an NIH Diversity Supplement for IOG pre-doctoral trainee Jean Burton. Dr. Dillaway was recently awarded a Wayne State University Career Development Chair Award to work on a new interview project on menopausal women and to secure a book contract in the near future.

The relationships that form across this bridge lead to collaborative research projects, educational forums and a general sharing of knowledge and practice be - tween disciplines. We appreciate the interest and efforts of each of our associates. WAyNE STATE UNIVERSIT y FACULT y ASSOCIATES 1011This year, nationally renowned expert Dr. Peter White - house opened the conference with his presentation on the myths of Alzheimer's, followed by many informative ses - sions on medical and behavioral care for dementia. The second day focused on applying this knowledge in care set - tings, and learning about recent findings in physical and mental health promotion. The IOG takes pride in its ability to deliver quality material to so many disciplines within one conference. \"Most of our attendees return year-after-year,\" said Donna MacDonald. \"This has become their top prior - ity, must-attend conference.\" Latest in Dementia Care Defines 22nd Annual Two-Day Continuing Education Conference ssues in AgingI Outreach How do Michigan's social workers, nursing home adminis - trators, doctors and nurses stay abreast of the latest treatment approaches for dementia and ag - ing? By attending the IOG's Issues in Aging Conference, a two-day continuing education event now entering its 23rd consecutive year and reaching capacity enrollment. Topics range from the myths of Alzheimer's, to how to tell a patient about dementia, to gambling ad - diction and preventing falls. \"The topics are always timely and the education is serious,\" said a registered nurse at the 2009 conference. \"Every day my patients look to me for help and understanding. The issues in aging never end.\" \"Our outreach efforts not only include seniors, but the healthcare professionals who manage their caregiving, medical and psychological needs. The Issues in Aging Conference provides relevant research findings these professionals can apply to everyday practice. We are expanding our continuing education lecture series in 2010 to include smaller group training on a variety of aging related topics.\" _ Donna MacDonald, Director of Outreach Left to lower right: Hustle dancing at Health Reception; sisters Garnet Willow, 88, and Charlotte Beardsley, 98, share an Art of Aging interview; T'ai Chi proves popular with our older guests; students, faculty and other professionals fill IOG educational colloquia.African Americans are at in - creased risk for high blood pres - sure, diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers as they age.

I applaud you for being here and for making the effort to stay healthy for yourself, your children and your grandchildren.\" _ David Bing, Detroit mayor and former NBA All-Star addressing 1,100 Detroit area seniors at the 2009 Health Reception tematic approach of awareness and education can help to reverse that risk. The Annual Health Reception, organized through the Healthier Black Elders Center (a joint pro - gram of the IOG and the University of Michigan), reached 1,100 African Americans in June. These older adults were inspired to take responsibility for their health, to eat nutri - tiously, to visit their doctor, and to exercise. Local hospitals and clinics were well-represented at the event and conducted 930 free health screenings for con - ditions such as high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Keynote speakers, including a panel of experts on pain control and disability, answered questions from the audi - ence. Hustle dancers and chair exercisers demonstrated aerobic work-outs. A hot and healthy lunch and a live jazz band wrapped up the event as guests danced and sang along. Detroit Mayor David Bing made a surprise visit to share an inspiring message with guests. Survey results taken from a majority of guests showed that: 78.7% of attendees learned something valuable about their health, 85.6% got a clearer understanding of research and its importance, 72.3% plan to improve their health habits as a result of this year's program, and 95% plan to attend next year. In addition to the dozens of forums and workshops hosted by the IOG for Detroit's urban seniors, the Institute SPREADING THE WORD BEyOND THE CITy Helping Older African Americans Stay Healthy has expanded its educational outreach into the near sub - urbs. The IOG's Windows on the World of Aging, as well as the Speakers' Bureau, have been popular options for older adults to conveniently meet experts in areas such as falls and balance, dementia, successful aging, finances, and housing. The IOG relies on its faculty, associates and partners to pro - vide information and materials at these free events. The forums take place in easily accessible senior centers, community halls and churches. Partnerships between the IOG, local businesses and service providers give us access to a broader audience for education, research participation and expanding our volunteer core. This past year alone, the IOG reached more than 2,500 seniors and professionals at 46 presentations. \"I trust the in - formation that the IOG gives us,\" said one of the attendees. \"I know they're looking out for me.\" 12 13Aging well is as much art as science. The annual Art of Aging Successfully con- ference, in its tenth year, celebrates the importance of an artful approach to life by showcasing amateur art in an array of creative forms. Presenters, from age 55 to 90, displayed nearly 100 items, including oil paintings, wood sculptures, quilting, mosaics, needlework, watercolors, photography, woven baskets, greeting cards, poems, memoirs and fiction. The day-long conference began with a humorous and inspiring speech by master storyteller Dr. Mildred Mat -lock. The 450 seniors in attendance then chose two of six break-out sessions that included T'ai Chi , geneology, emergency preparedness, and holistic healing. Director of Community Outreach Donna MacDon - ald said that the energy and enthusiasm of the older adults who attend the conference consistently impresses her. \"The creative process adds a spark to daily life,\" she said. \"It helps us age better in ways we don't even fully Revitalize Rejuvenate Refresh Art of Aging SuccessfullyThe Secret to Living Well and Feeling Wonderful understand.\" Dr. Kay Cresci, IOG faculty advisor to Art of Aging, added, \"Much of what makes aging successful is outlook and attitude.\" These sentiments are echoed by the participants. Dorothy Weems has displayed her photographs at the conference for several years, certain that her passion for photography stimulates her brain. \"Feeding my brain has kept me feeling young,\" she said. \"It peels away the years.\" \"Creativity helps us age better in ways we don't fully understand.\" _ Kay Cresci, Ph.D., Art of Aging faculty advisor Page 12 clockwise from upper left: Mayor Bing motivates the crowd; a finger prick reveals cholesterol levels; Dr. Lichtenberg receives compliments about the Health Reception, Dr. Washington emcees the educational presentations; Ernie Clark teaches chair exercises.

Their commitment to older adults in Detroit is unparalleled and we are privileged to work with them in furthering our common mission.\" Terri Bailey, Development Officer 14 Partnership A Common Mission Builds Bridges in the Community our programs. Through this affiliation, IOG information will be made available to over 30,000 people every year who pass through Heartland's doors. We also will pro - vide educational information and training to employees, residents and vendors helping Heartland to provide the best care possible. By integrating with Heartland Health Care, everyone wins. NEW BRANCHES OF OUTREACH & RESEARCH While the IOG has provided outreach to the com - munity of a mostly educational nature, through the partnership with the American House Foundation, we have been able to expand our outreach to include di - rect care for older adults in need. Now in its second full year of operation, AHF is providing goods and ser - vices to over 300 adults in need and growing every year. This includes (but certainly isn't limited to) assistance for items such as home repair, dentures, eyeglasses, and help with utilities and food supplementation. Because AHF also believes in looking for long-term solutions for older adults, their support of IOG research has allowed us to begin the Seniors Count! project. As a grassroots During this year of considerable challenge, the cor - porate and community partners of the IOG rolled up their shirt sleeves and went to work! With the same ingenuity and hard work that is at the heart of the De - troit community, we built upon our common mission to provide greater support for older adults than ever be - fore. The result has been a year of increased outreach, educational programming and research. The following stories illustrate just a few of the many new bridges our partners have helped us build. AFFILIATING WITH THE IOG By creating an Affiliation Partnership with the IOG, Heartland Health Care is able to let the public know what's in their heart: a commitment to the health and well-being of their patients and families and the desire to enrich the lives of older adults. Through a combined effort, Heartland and the IOG have created a package that every patient and family member will receive that will give them the opportunity to become a part of the IOG community, to receive current information, partici - pate in events and research, volunteer and to donate to organization, AHF understands the necessity for strong partners to build support for their great works. They collaborate with local non-profit agencies to identify and provide for older adults in need, and they've teamed up with the Kresge Foundation and Community Foun - dation of SE Michigan to support research at the IOG. The relationships forged by AHF and through American House Senior Living Residences are also partnerships for the Institute of Gerontology and have helped us to ex - pand our mission of education, outreach and research while helping those in need. HEALTH ALLIANCE PLAN As a long-term supporter of IOG research and out - reach, Health Alliance Plan is fully engaged in our shared mission. As partners working to promote successful ag - ing, we both provide announcements about and attend each other's health events. We write about advance - ments and new knowledge in each other's publications. We speak at each other's events. HAP recognizes that the more involvement they have with the IOG, the bet - ter it is for their population and their commitment to our programming continues to deepen.PREMIER MEDIA SPONSOR WWJ Newsradio 950 AM PLATINUM SPONSORS ($25,000+) American House Foundation Heartland Health CareGOLD SPONSORS ($10,000-$24,999) Blue Cross Blue Shield Foundation of Michigan your Aging Well Advisor SILVER SPONSORS ($5,000-$9,999) Detroit Receiving Hospital Geriatric Education Center of Michigan Health Alliance Plan Presbyterian Villages of Michigan Quality Home Health Care Senior and Caregiver Resource Network Visiting Nurse Association 15Nelson Mandela said, \"Education is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world.\" The mission of the IOG is to dispel the myths of aging - to change the way the world views older adults and the process of aging.
