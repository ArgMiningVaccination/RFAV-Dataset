Other Information](#_Section_VIII._Other) The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to advance understanding of how the healthcare delivery system affects HPV vaccine recommendations made by physicians and other vaccine providers, and how those recommendations affect vaccine uptake by children ages 11-12 in the United States (U.S.). This FOA utilizes the Exploratory/Developmental Grant (R21) mechanism, which supports investigation of novel scientific ideas or new model systems, tools, or technologies that have the potential for significant impact on biomedical or biobehavioral research. An R21 grant application need not have extensive background material or preliminary information. This FOA runs in parallel with two FOAs of identical scientific scope, [PAR-16-338](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-16-338.html), which utilizes the R01 mechanism, and [PAR-16-337](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-16-337.html), which utilizes the R03 mechanism. HPV causes many cancers in men and women HPV infection is associated with nearly 35,000 cancer cases diagnosed in the U.S. per year. Men and women are both affected: ~70% of oropharyngeal cancers, ~40% cancers, ~80% of anal cancers, and 100% of cervical cancers are attributable to HPV infection. A safe, effective vaccine is available to prevent many HPV-related cancers Currently, three HPV vaccines are available in the U.S. All three vaccines require the administration of 3 doses over a 6-month period, although research has suggested that one or two doses may be just as protective. Cervarix, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2009, provides protection against HPV types 16 and 18. Gardasil was approved by the FDA in 2006 and targets HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. In December of 2014, the FDA approved Gardasil 9, a vaccine that protects against HPV 6, 11, 16, 18 and five other types of high-risk HPV. Uptake of the HPV vaccine has been low For boys and girls: Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of the HPV vaccines, uptake among females and males has been low. As of 2014, ~60% of girls and ~40% of boys, ages 13-17, had received at least one dose of an HPV vaccine, but only ~40% of girls and ~20% of boys had completed the 3-dose series. Among young adults between the ages 19-26, ~35% of women and ~5% of men reported having received at least one HPV shot. Uptake is not on track to achieve the Healthy People 2020 goal of 80% uptake for boys and girls by 2020 nor, therefore, to achieve the reduction in HPV-related cancer burden that would be achieved through optimal uptake. Disparities are regional rather than based on income or race/ethnicity Although research on women ages 18 to 26 indicates lower vaccination uptake and completion among non-White women, research on girls ages 13 to 17 suggests the opposite. Hispanic girls ages 13-17 are more likely than White girls of the same age to have received 1, 2, or 3 HPV doses. Similarly, Black and Hispanic boys of this age are more likely than White boys to have received 1, 2, or 3 doses of the HPV vaccine. Youth living in poverty are more likely to have received 1, 2 or 3 doses of the HPV vaccine. Instead, disparities are seen by region of the U.S.; among females, coverage for =1 HPV dose ranged from >75% (Rhode Island) to <40% (Kansas) and for =3 HPV doses from >55% (DC) to ~20% (Tennessee). These unusual disparities point to a need for focused research on areas where uptake is low, rather than focus on characteristics known to drive other health disparities. Research to promote uptake Healthcare-related factors have been associated with HPV vaccine uptake: A number of studies have identified healthcare-related factors that influence HPV vaccination among adolescents. Health insurance, receiving other childhood vaccines, frequent use of healthcare, having a healthcare provider who was considered as a source of information, and receiving an HPV vaccine recommendation from a healthcare provider have all been associated with higher vaccine uptake among girls. Few interventions are ready for dissemination: Although several studies have identified means and messages to promote vaccine acceptability and intention, few interventions to increase HPV vaccination uptake and completion have been reported in the literature. Existing healthcare delivery interventions are promising but have usually been tested in academic settings, limiting the generalizability to many other settings, particularly those where vaccine uptake is low. The importance of the provider's recommendation The [2014 President's Cancer Panel Report](http://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/advisory/pcp/annualReports/HPV/#sthash.mX0jJCVk.txprHqhA.dpbs), \"Accelerating HPV Vaccine Uptake: Urgency for Action to Prevent Cancer\", includes a \"goal to reduce missed clinical opportunities to recommend and administer HPV vaccines.\" The strong link between a provider's recommendation and uptake of a behavior is well documented in the other areas of cancer prevention; patients are more likely to get screened for cancer or quit smoking if a doctor recommends it. This effect is evident even when the behavior, like quitting smoking, is widely known to be healthful. In recognition of this strong link, the Guide to Community Preventive Services reviewed and recommended interventions to increase providers' recommendations of breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screening in order to increase uptake of screening. In the context of the HPV vaccine, with national attention on the importance of the provider recommendation, research has begun examining the characteristics of the recommendation itself, but more research is needed to understand the influence of other aspects of healthcare delivery. Placing the provider recommendation in the clinical context To date, there has been very little research to understand how the healthcare system affects the recommendations providers make and how those recommendations actually produce uptake of the HPV vaccine. What characteristics of the provider, parent/patient, and clinical setting can enhance or inhibit the making of the recommendation and resulting vaccine uptake? As discussed above, the message given by the provider can affect uptake, as can other provider-level characteristics, such as her own conviction that the vaccine is safe. At parent level, existing doubts about vaccines in general, or simply the inability to leave work a second time for an additional vaccine dose, can affect uptake. Within the practice setting, secondary providers, such as nurses and office staff, can also influence vaccine uptake. Imagine that the nurse who delivers the vaccine mentions that it is okay to skip one of the three vaccines recommended at this age -- the HPV vaccine; the parent might change her mind and the presence of the nurse will not equate to vaccine uptake. Also in the practice setting, if the vaccine is not in stock, the provider recommendation will not equate to vaccine uptake. At each level - provider, patient/parent, and practice setting - intermediate outcomes are needed and characteristics of each level can influence the process. Research funded under this FOA will begin to fill this gap, providing new understanding of how the provider, patient/parent, and practice setting can enhance or inhibit the effectiveness of a provider's recommendation of the adolescent HPV vaccine. This initiative seeks to produce a better understanding of how characteristics of provider, patient/parent, and practice affect adolescent uptake, and series completion, of the HPV vaccine. The effectiveness of providers' HPV vaccine recommendations can be increased by: 1. identifying the provider, patient/parent, and practice-level characteristics that might enhance or inhibit vaccine uptake among children ages 11-12 in the U.S.; 2. identifying the mechanisms by which these characteristics operate to enhance or inhibit vaccine uptake; and 3. developing and testing interventions to increase vaccine uptake by targeting identified characteristics at two or more of these levels. Studies that may be appropriate to this FOA may build on existing evidence about how provider recommendations affect other behaviors; other studies may build on evidence about the quality of a provider's recommendation and take advantage of characteristics of the practice setting to improve the recommendation's effectiveness. Other projects may combine qualitative identification of practice-level characteristics with interventions to change provider and patient/parent behavior. Research studies that may be appropriate to this FOA are encouraged to: 1. Collect primary data in a clinical setting where HPV vaccine is recommended and administered to adolescents; 2. Focus on vaccination of both boys and girls, unless a compelling reason is provided for excluding one of these groups; 3. Focus on opportunities to close significant disparities in HPV vaccination, as demonstrated by HPV vaccine first dose uptake lower than the adolescent girls' national average of 60%; 4. Consider and measure characteristics of all three levels (provider, patient/parent, and practice). Projects that are suitable for this FOA are likely to improve understanding of the practice setting by assessing characteristics that are unlikely to be assessed in the course of routine patient care and billing. Projects that address only patient/provider communication are discouraged. In response to this FOA, any FDA approved vaccine can be used in accord with the current dosing schedule recommended by the [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/). All three HPV vaccines can be initiated at age 9. Routine vaccination is recommended for girls and boys ages 11 and 12, and this age group is the focus of this FOA. In recognition that dosing recommendations for the HPV vaccine for adolescents in the United States may be changed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices prior to submission for this FOA and/or in the course of conducting funded research, proposals are recommended to include separate assessment of vaccine initiation and each follow-up dose completed in order to allow analysis of series completion for any dosing recommendation.

Applicants are required to follow our [Post Submission Application Materials](//grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide/due-dates-and-submission-policies/submission-policies.htm#psam) policy. Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. As part of the [NIH mission](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11149), all applications submitted to the NIH in support of biomedical and behavioral research are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system. For this particular announcement, note the following: The R21 exploratory/developmental grant supports investigation of novel scientific ideas or new model systems, tools, or technologies that have the potential for significant impact on biomedical or biobehavioral research. An R21 grant application need not have extensive background material or preliminary information. Accordingly, reviewers will focus their evaluation on the conceptual framework, the level of innovation, and the potential to significantly advance our knowledge or understanding. Appropriate justification for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations, data from other sources, or, when available, from investigator-generated data. Preliminary data are not required for R21 applications; however, they may be included if available. Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field. Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? Is there a strong scientific premise for the project? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? Specific for this FOA: How well does this study consider and measure the influence on adolescent HPV vaccination of characteristics at three levels: provider, patient/parent, and practice setting? What will be the effect of this studies on concepts or methods important to understanding and promoting HPV vaccination in clinical settings? What implications will the project have for promoting HPV vaccination among adolescents with low rates of uptake? Are the PD(s)/PI(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? If Early Stage Investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? If the project is collaborative or multi-PD/PI, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project? Does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? Are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? Is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed? Specific for this FOA: How effectively will this study use qualitative and other primary data collection methods to improve our understanding and assessment of the influence of healthcare delivery systems on HPV vaccination? Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? Have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? Have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects? If the project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of children, justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed? Will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? Are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? Will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements? As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items. For research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials. For research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. For additional information on review of the Human Subjects section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Human Subjects](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11175). When the proposed project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of children to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. For additional information on review of the Inclusion section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Inclusion in Clinical Research](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11174). The committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1) description of proposed procedures involving animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and total number to be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals versus alternative models and for the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for euthanasia method if NOT consistent with the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals. Reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals. For additional information on review of the Vertebrate Animals section, please refer to the [Worksheet for Review of the Vertebrate Animal Section](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11150). Reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed. For Resubmissions, the committee will evaluate the application as now presented, taking into consideration the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group and changes made to the project. Not Applicable Not Applicable As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall impact score. Not Applicable Reviewers will assess the information provided in this section of the application, including 1) the Select Agent(s) to be used in the proposed research, 2) the registration status of all entities where Select Agent(s) will be used, 3) the procedures that will be used to monitor possession use and transfer of Select Agent(s), and 4) plans for appropriate biosafety, biocontainment, and security of the Select Agent(s). Reviewers will comment on whether the following Resource Sharing Plans, or the rationale for not sharing the following types of resources, are reasonable: (1) [Data Sharing Plan](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11151); (2) [Sharing Model Organisms](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11152); and (3) [ Genomic Data Sharing Plan (GDS)](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11153). For projects involving key biological and/or chemical resources, reviewers will comment on the brief plans proposed for identifying and ensuring the validity of those resources. Reviewers will consider whether the budget and the requested period of support are fully justified and reasonable in relation to the proposed research. Applications will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by (an) appropriate Scientific Review Group(s) convened by the Center for Scientific Review, in accordance with [NIH peer review policy and procedures](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11154), using the stated [review criteria](#_1._Criteria).

The following will be considered in making funding decisions: After the peer review of the application is completed, the PD/PI will be able to access his or her Summary Statement (written critique) via the [eRA Commons](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11123). Refer to Part 1 for dates for peer review, advisory council review, and earliest start date. Information regarding the disposition of applications is available in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11156). If the application is under consideration for funding, NIH will request \"just-in-time\" information from the applicant as described in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11157). A formal notification in the form of a Notice of Award (NoA) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. The NoA signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the grantee's business official. Awardees must comply with any funding restrictions described in [Section IV.5. Funding Restrictions](#_5._Funding_Restrictions). Selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. Any costs incurred before receipt of the NoA are at the recipient's risk. These costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs. Any application awarded in response to this FOA will be subject to terms and conditions found on the [Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11158) website. This includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website. All NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11120) as part of the NoA. For these terms of award, see the [NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11157) and [Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Grantees, and Activities](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11159). More information is provided at [Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11158). Recipients of federal financial assistance (FFA) from HHS must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights law. This means that recipients of HHS funds must ensure equal access to their programs without regard to a person's race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, sex and religion. This includes ensuring your programs are accessible to persons with limited English proficiency. HHS recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator's scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this FOA. HHS provides general guidance to recipients of FFA on meeting their legal obligation to take reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to their programs by persons with limited English proficiency. Please see http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/resources/laws/revisedlep.html. The HHS Office for Civil Rights also provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by HHS. Please see [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html); and [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/index.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/index.html). Recipients of FFA also have specific legal obligations for serving qualified individuals with disabilities. Please see [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/disability/index.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/disability/index.html). Please contact the HHS Office for Civil Rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/office/about/rgn-hqaddresses.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/office/about/rgn-hqaddresses.html) or call 1-800-368-1019 or TDD 1-800-537-7697. Also note it is an HHS Departmental goal to ensure access to quality, culturally competent care, including long-term services and supports, for vulnerable populations. For further guidance on providing culturally and linguistically appropriate services, recipients should review the National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care at [http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=2&lvlid=53](http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=2&lvlid=53). Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions of Award Not Applicable When multiple years are involved, awardees will be required to submit the [Research Performance Progress Report (RPPR)](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/rppr/index.htm) annually and financial statements as required in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement.](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11161) [A final progress report, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the Federal Financial Report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the ] [NIH Grants Policy Statement](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11161). The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Transparency Act), includes a requirement for awardees of Federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under Federal assistance awards issued in FY2011 or later. All awardees of applicable NIH grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the Federal Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) available at [www.fsrs.gov](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11170) on all subawards over $25,000. See the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11171) for additional information on this reporting requirement.
