Health coverage enrollment] The University requires all students eligible for Basic Student Health Services to have adequate hospital insurance coverage as well.

Students with no break in coverage who are enrolled during both the fall and spring terms are billed each term and are covered from August 1 through July 31. For students entering Yale for the first time, readmitted students, and students returning from a leave of absence who have not been covered during their leave, Hospitalization/Specialty Coverage begins on the day the dormitories officially open. A student who is enrolled for the fall term only is covered for services through January 31; a student enrolled for the spring term only is covered for services through July 31. - Waiving Yale Health Hospitalization/Specialty Coverage. Students are permitted to waive Hospitalization/Specialty Coverage by completing an [online waiver form](https://yhpstudentwaiver.yale.edu). It is the student's responsibility to report any changes in alternate insurance coverage to the Member Services Department within 30 days.

Students who are granted a leave of absence are eligible to purchase Student Affiliate Coverage for up to one year. If the leave occurs on or before the first day of classes, Hospitalization/Specialty Coverage will end retroactive to the start of the coverage period for the term. If the leave occurs any time after the first day of classes, Hospitalization/Specialty Coverage will end on the day the Registrar is notified of the leave. In either case, students may enroll in Student Affiliate Coverage. Students must enroll in Affiliate Coverage prior to the beginning of the term unless the Registrar is notified after the first day of classes, in which case, the coverage must be purchased within thirty days of the date the Registrar was notified.
