Payroll taxes -Employees and employers each pay 6.2% of covered earnings -The self- employed pay 12.4% of covered earnings -On earnings up to $137,700 in 2020 ($142,800 in 2021) Taxes on Social Security benefits -Higher -income beneficiaries pay federal income tax on their benefits Interest on trust fund reserves -Invested in interest -bearing securities of the US governmentWhere Does the Money Go (Cost)? Benefit payments -About 64 million people getting benefits as of December 2019: 48 million retired workers and dependents of retired workers 6 million survivors of deceased workers 10 million disabled workers and dependents of disabled workers Administrative expenses -Only about 0.6 percent of total program cost in 2019Income and Cost for Calendar Year 2019 Combined OASI & DI Trust FundsPayroll taxes $944 billion Benefits $1,048 expenses $6 billionTaxes billion Railroad exchange $5 billion2020 Trustees ReportWhat is the Legislative Mandate for the Annual Trustees Report? 1.Trust Fund operations of the past year and the next five years 2.Actuarial status of the trust funds -This means the ability to meet the cost of scheduled benefits with scheduled revenue and trust fund reserves -And the extent to which scheduled revenue would fall short under current law, indicating the size of legislative changes that will be neededPrimary Changes for the 2020 Trustees Report First, an important caveat! The projections in the 2020 Trustees Report (released April 22, 2020) do NOT reflect the potential implications of the COVID -19 pandemic, due to (1) the timing of the development of assumptions for the report and (2) the timing of the recognition of the pandemic. 1.DI reserve depletion extended another 13 years, from 2052 to 2065 a)Applications and benefit awards remained at historically low levels in 2019 b)Lower ultimate assumed disability incidence rate c)Gradual increase to ultimate incidence rate 2.OASI reserve depletion is 2034, the same as in the 2019 report 3.OASDI reserve depletion is 2035, the same as in the 2019 report 4.75-year actuarial deficit increased by 0.43 percent of payroll (versus expected increase of 0.05 percent from change in valuation period alone)SOLVENCY: Annual Cost and Non-Interest Income as Percent of Taxable Payroll Persistent negative annual cash- flow balance starting in 2010. 79 percent of scheduled benefits still payable at trust fund reserve depletion.

Will there be persistent and even cumulative effects on mortality (and morbidity) in the longer term? -Direct virus -related immediate deaths, whether diagnosed or not -Indirect deaths due to avoidance of medical treatment -Increased deaths of despair/violence \u2014suicide, homicide, overdose? -Decreased life expectancy from compromise for COVID survivors; how much? Other economic and demographic effects? Fertility, immigration? So much depends on government and individual responses, along with the timing and efficacy of a vaccineCOVID Effects: GDP , Earnings, and Payroll Tax Revenue Social Security payroll tax revenue will certainly be lower than we projected for 2020 due to lower earnings \u2014by between 5 and 10 percent -Technicality: due to the way tax revenues are transferred from Treasury to the Social Security trust funds, the trust funds won't be affected until 2021 Neither the employ erpayroll tax deferral in COVID legislation nor the employ eepayroll tax deferral in the presidential memorandum affect revenue to the trust funds What will effects be beyond 2020? There has been a substantial economic recovery since the second quarter of 2020 COVID Effects: Timing of Benefit Applications There has been speculation in the press and elsewhere that the COVID -induced recession will cause workers to apply for retirement benefits earlier than they would have otherwise We aren't seeing this in the data \u2014yet Similarly, we aren't yet seeing evidence of increased DI or SSI applications Speculation is that folks have been relying on extended unemployment benefits, but might start applying earlier if the recession persistsDisabled worker data through September 2020 (numbers in thousands ) Source: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/dibGraphs.htmlBottom Line: Effects of COVID on Trust Funds In April, we speculated a potential 15 percent reduction in earnings and payroll tax for one or two years, and then full recovery: Trust Fund reserve depletion advanced from early 2035 to mid -or early 2034 -We now think this speculation was probably too pessimistic Now, consider an alternative scenario: assume total earnings in 2020 are reduced 5 to 10 percent below the 2020 TR intermediate projection, with recovery in 2021 and 2022 -This could happen if there is no substantial wave in the fall with resulting closure of the economy -The trust fund reserve depletion date for the combined OASI and DI Trust Funds would likely be sometime in 2034, all else equal -In September, CBO estimated that COVID would hasten trust fund depletion by one yearBottom Line: Effects of COVID on Trust Funds If, instead, a fall/winter return to closure due to the pandemic extends through 2021, and possibly beyond, then negative effects on the actuarial status could be substantially larger Trust Fund reserve depletion could be earlier than 2034, and the percent of scheduled benefits payable after depletion could be reduced The Bipartisan Policy Center recently released several possible scenarios, with the most pessimistic leading to OASDI combined trust fund reserve depletion 7 years earlier (2028)Bottom Line: Effects of COVID on Trust Funds The 2021 Trustees Report, scheduled to be released in April 2021, will reflect our best estimates of the impacts of COVID -19 We have had, and will continue to have, many discussions about assumptions with the trustees and their staffs... And we will continue to monitor emerging experience and knowledge about the virus and vaccines/therapiesLegislative ChangesWhy Do These Actuarial Projections Matter? Long -term projections provide information to assess solvency and changes needed to eliminate shortfalls If trust fund reserves were to become depleted: Full benefits could not be paid timely NO pressure on the budget or federal debt So Congress must act, as it always has Straightforward solutions: Add revenue and/or lower cost for OASDI Comprehensive changes implemented by 2035How to Eliminate the Long -Term Actuarial Deficit Make choices addressing OASDI deficits 2035 -2094: Raise scheduled revenue after 2034 by about one -third Reduce scheduled benefits after 2034 by about one -fourth Or some combination of the twoWays to Lower Cost Lower benefits for retirees \u2014not disabled? Increase normal retirement age (lowers OASI cost, but increases DI cost) Can exempt long -career low earners Lower benefits mainly for high earners? Reduce PIA above some level Often combined with increasing PIA below some level, subject to work year requirements Lower benefits mainly for the oldest old? Reduce the COLA But, some say increase it with the CPI -E (based on purchase of consumers over age 62)Ways to Increase Revenue Raise the 12.4 percent OASDI payroll tax rate? Raise tax on highest earners? Increase taxable maximum amount ($142,800 in 2021) Some tax on all earnings above the maximum Tax employer group health insurance premiums? Affects only middle class if taxable maximum remains Tax investment income? Or potentially a wealth tax?For More Information, Go To https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/ There you will find: The 2020 and all prior OASDI Trustees Reports Detailed single -year tables for recent reports Our estimates for comprehensive proposals and individual provisions Actuarial notes; including replacement rates Actuarial studies Extensive databases about the trust funds and program beneficiaries Congressional testimonies Presentations by OCACT employees "}
