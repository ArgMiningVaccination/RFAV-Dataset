The provisions of this handbook are not and may not be regarded as contractual between or among the College, Department, its students or its employees or agents. 4 History The School of Continuing and Professional Studies has a long and rich history. The school's 138 - year history can be described metaphorically as three streams (East Falls, Center City, and Online) that flow into the river that comprises the school today. The school's East Falls roots trace back to the Evening College, which formed at the same time as the day college when Philadelphia Textile School began in 1884. In 1941, Philadelphia Textile School became Philadelphia Textile Institute, which became Phila delphia College of Textiles and Science in 1961 . That same year th e Evening College launched professions -focused B.S. degree programs, and in 1963 , associate's degree programs were added. The Evening College became the Division of Evening and Continuing Ed ucation in 1981 and in 1999 Philadelphia College of Textiles and Science was granted university status and became Philadelphia University. In 2005, the department's name changed to Continuing and Professional Studies and moved to accelerated terms and hybr id courses. In 2014, the department became the School of Continuing and Professional Studies (SCPS). The school launched its first doctoral program \u2014a Doctor of Management in Strategic Leadership in 2016 \u2014and its first master's degree \u2014an M.S. in Organizational Leadership \u2014in 2021. On the Center City side of the house, the school's roots trace to 1968, with the Department of General Studies establishment within Jefferson's College of Allied Health Sciences. The department provided students in allied health pro grams and university employees the opportunity to begin or continue working toward an associate's or bachelor's degree in health professions - focused programs . In addition, the department offered several humanities and science courses for non-degree student s seeking to meet the prerequisites for the nursing program. The College of Allied Health Sciences' name changed to the College of Health Professions in 1996. In 2012, the department's name changed to the Department of Professional and Continuing Studies. The school's online education roots can be traced to 2012 when Philadelphia University Online (PhilaU Online) launched. PhilaU Online offered most of the bachelor's programs that SCPS offered in East Falls in a 100% online delivery format, thus removing l ocation barriers to accessing a quality Philadelphia University education. One year after the 2017 merger between Philadelphia University and Thomas Jefferson University, the School of Continuing and Professional Studies (East Falls) and the Department o f Professional and Continuing Studies in the College of Health Professions (Center City) joined and was called the School of Continuing and Professional Studies. In 2019, Jefferson Online (formerly PhilaU Online) also became part of the school. Today, the School of Continuing and Professional Studies continues to flourish. The school offers a variety of programs: graduate, bachelor s, associate, and certificate. The school also offers specialized training, such as midwifery, partners with local organization s to meet workforce - training needs, and provides courses for non -degree students for completion of prerequisites or for personal or professional enrichment. Throughout its rich history and continuing to this day, the school has made it a point to take non-traditional students where they are and to help them realize their goals. As a result, many SCPS students have achieved things they never imagined were possible. Change is a certainty if the future is like the past, but one thing will remain constant \u2014an unwavering focus on student success. To all students, staff, faculty, and internal and external partners past, present, and future, thank you for being part of the SCPS story. 5 Mission School of Continuing & Professional Studies Mission, Vision, & Values SCPS is committed to improving lives by providing a career -focused and supportive environment delivered by industry experts who encourage lifelong learning and critical thinking.

Grading Scale and Descriptions The University uses a plus/minus grading system. The passing grades for the University are \"CR,\" \"A,\" \"B,\" \"C\" and \"D.\" A grade of \"F\" signifies that the course has been failed. 12 Grade Scale Grade Quality Points Grade Quality Points A 4.0 C 2.0 A- 3.7 C- 1.7 B+ 3.3 D+ 1.3 B 3.0 D 1.0 B- 2.7 F 0.0 C+ 2.3 WF 0.0 Grade Descriptions A = Excellent Awarded to students who demonstrate an excellent understanding of the subject matter and who have achieved outstanding results in fulfilling the course objectives. Note: Grade of A+ signifies extraordinary performance but carries no additional quality points above 4.0 B = Above Average Awarded to students who demonstrate above -average understanding of the subject matter and who show consistent achievement beyond the usual requirements of the course. C = Average Awarded to students who perform at the satisfactory level and demonstrate acceptable levels of understanding of the subject matter commensurate with continued study in the next successive course. D = Below Average Awarded to students as evidence of less-than-average understanding of the subject matter and who demonstrate weak performance. It indicates insufficient preparation for students to enroll in any course reliant upon an acceptable level of understanding of the particular subject matter. Note 1: A grade of \"D-\" (.70) represents a minimum grade necessary to receive credit for a course Note 2: Some courses require and identify a higher grade requirement for course and/or higher prerequisite as noted on course syllabus and course description. F = Failure Awarded to students showing poor understanding of the basic elements of the course. Note: To graduate, a student must have a cumulative grade point average of 2.00 or higher. 13 I = Incomplete The \"I\" grade indicates that a student has missed some portion of required coursework because of illness or another emergency beyond his/her control. It indicates that the student, with the approval of the professor, has agreed in writing to complete the missing course requirements within an extended period of time and not to exceed the end of the 4th week counting from the last day of the end of the semester in which the course was taken. (See current Academic Calendar for the exact date.) The professor has sole authority to grant or deny such a request. Failure of the s tudent to complete the agreed -upon work in the prescribed time frame will result in a grade of \"F\" for the course. To obtain an \"I\" grade the student must submit an Incomplete Form to the professor for approval before the due date for final grades to be submitted to the Registrar. Copies of the form are available online on the University's Registrar's website, www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/registrar/. W = Withdraw The W grade indicates that a student withdrew from a course during the scheduled withdraw period for a term. A W is not included in GPA calculations, but is included when calculating the credit completion rate. As a result, a W grade may affect a student's academic standing for the cumulative credit completion rate. WF = Withdraw Failure The WF grade indicates that a student withdrew from a course after the last day to withdraw with a W grade. A WF is included in GPA calculations and carries the same quality points as an F grade. It is included when calculating the credit completion rate. As a result, a WF grade may affect a student's academic standing for the cumulative credit completion rate or the minimum GPA requirement. CR = Credit The CR grade indicates that a student has successfully completed a course which is graded on a Credit/No Credit basis. To obtain a CR grade, students must earn a \"C\" or better in the course. A CR grade is not included in GPA calculations, but is included when calculating the credit completion rate. NC = No Credit The NC grade indicates that a student has not successfully completed a course which is graded on a Credit/No Credit basis. This means that the student earned less than a \"C\" in the course. An NC grade is not included in GPA calculations, but is included when calculating the credit completion rate. As a result, a W grade may affect a student's academic standing for the cumulative credit completion rate. 14 AU = Audit The AU grade indicates that a student has audited a course. The AU grade is assigned by the faculty member at the end of the semester in which the student is registered for the audited course. An AU grade is not included in GPA or credit completion rate calculations, and has no effect on a student's academic standing. This is the only eligible grade for an audited course, and will not replace a previously earned grade for a repeated course. Since it is automatic, this grade does not necessarily imply the completion of specific coursework by the student. Dean's List Undergraduate students enrolled in at least 12 semester credits, nine of which are graded, and who earn a semester grade point average of 3.50 or better are eligible for the Dean's List for that semester. The Registrar calculates student's eligibility for the Dean's List after the 4th week of the following semester, when all incomplete ('I') grades have been resolved. Subsequent grade changes will not be on the downloaded Dean's List. Residency Requirement To be eligible for graduation with a Bachelor of Science degree from the School of Continuing and Professional Studies at Thomas Jefferson University, a student must earn a minimum of 33 credits in residence. SCPS Credit for Prior Learning Policy PURPOSE This policy sets forth the protocol for awarding college credit for learning that occurs outside the traditional college classroom setting. DEFINITIONS Credit by Examination: Thomas Jefferson University awards college credits to students who take nationally standardized exams such as Advanced Placement (AP) exams, College Level Examination Program (CLEP) exams , and DANTES Subject Standardized Tests (DSST) exams, and who achieve minimum score s based on American Council o n Education (ACE) credit recommendations. Only exam s that apply to a student's program of study will be awarded credit. Credit for Prior Learning: The opportunity to earn academic credit for learning acquired via collegiate and non- collegiate sources such as work, life, and community 15 experiences. Duplicate Credit: Earning credit for the same course more than once. Matriculation: Enrolled in an undergraduate degree or certificate program. Residency Credits: Credits earned at Thomas Jefferson University v ia coursework or prior learning portfolio.

Prior Learning Portfolio: A prior learning portfolio is a compilation of artifacts and documentation showing prior college -level learning outside the classroom. Transfer Credit: Thomas Jefferson University accepts Transfer Credit (with the exception of students enrolling in the combined B.S./OTD Occupational Therapy program*) for college level courses pr eviously taken and awarded grades of C or higher from other institutions of higher learning with accreditation recognized by Jefferson, in all modes of delivery. POLICY The School of Continuing and Professional Studies (SCPS) awards academic credit for learning acquired via collegiate and non- collegiate sources such as work, life, and community experiences. SCPS awards credit for learning achieved during non-collegiate experiences , not for participating in those experiences, and that learning must be asse ssed. Scope This policy applies to a ll undergraduate students in SCPS. Components Sources of Credit: Transfer credit Prior Learning Portfolio Credit by Examination o Advanced Placement (AP) o College Level Examination Program (CLEP) o DANTES Subject Standardized Tests (DSST) o International Baccalaureate (IB) Previously -Evaluated Licenses, Certifications, and Training o American Council on Education- evaluated workplace training o American Council on Education- evaluated military courses and jobs 16 o National Col lege Credit Recommendation Service (University of the State of New York) o Thomas Edison State University -evaluated licenses and certifications Parameters: SCPS bachelor's degree -seeking students must earn at credits in residence at TJU. SCPS asso ciate's degree- seeking students must earn at least 21 credits in residence at TJU. Credits earned via Prior Learning Portfolio count toward residency credits. Credits earned via all other forms of Credit for Prior Learning do not count toward the residenc y requirement. The maximum number of credits a bachelor's degree -seeking student can earn via Prior Learning Portfolio is 30 credits. The maximum number of credits a student can earn from a combination of all Credit for Prior Learning sources is: o Certificate programs: 6 o Associate's programs: 39 -42 o Bachelor's programs: 87 Students may submit one Prior Learning Portfolio per course. Students must complete CSSE 101 or CSSX 101 and one writing course (preferably composition) prior to pursuing Credit fo r Prior Learning. Certificate and bachelor's degree -seeking SCPS students may participate in SCPS's Credit for Prior Learning Program. Students who have earned a grade of \"F\" in a course may not pursue Credit for Prior Learning to earn credit for the same course. Students may not participate in the Prior Learning Portfolio option in their first or final term. Students must complete CSSE 101/CSSX 101 (or the equivalent as determined by the school) prior to pursuing the Prior Learning Portfolio option. SCPS s tudents may take a CLEP or DSST exam at any point in their matriculation subject to prior written approval from their advisor. Credit for a course currently in progress or duplicate credit for a course already awarded through other methods will not be perm itted. In general, Credit for Prior Learning may be used to satisfy SCPS General Education Requirements, Foundation Requirements, Creativity & Leadership Core, Major Requirements, and electives as long as residency requirements are met. See Prior Learning Portfolio Handbook for a list of courses that are not eligible for Prior Learning Portfolio. Credits earned via Credit for Prior Learning are transcripted as \"CR\" (Credit); no grades are transcripted. Joint Services Transcripts, ACE transcripts, and offici al score reports for exams should be sent to the School of Continuing and Professional Studies. Taking Courses at Another Institution Following is the SCPS policy for students who seek permission to take a course at another institution after matriculation in an undergraduate program: 1. Completion of Request for Permission: The SCPS \"Permission to Take Courses at Another Institution Form\" must be completed before taking a course at another 17 institution. The form is housed in the SCPS Student Resource Site. 2. Timing: Students must submit the completed permission form to the School of Continuing & Professional Studies (SCPS) for approval at least six weeks before courses are scheduled to begin at the transfer institution. 3. Academic Standing: Students must be in good academic standing, i.e. minimum 2.00 cumulative GPA. 4. Two-year versus Four-year Institutions: Permission to take courses equivalent to Jefferson's junior and senior level courses (300- and 400-level) will be granted only if the other institution is a four -year college or university. 5. Maximum Number of Courses: Current students (including students on a Leave of Absence or Medical Leave of Absence) may take a maximum of two (2) courses at another institution after matriculating in a degree program in SCPS. Separate lecture and lab count as one course. 6. Residency: Students must fulfill residency requirements at Jefferson in order to graduate. SCPS students must earn a minimum of 33 semester credit hours in residence at Jefferson. Students must be in residenc e during the semester immediately preceding the awarding of the degree. 7. Credits & Grades: If a student earns a grade of \"C\" or better, Jefferson will accept transfer credit for an approved course. Grades earned at another institution are NOT included in the student's GPA at Jefferson. Jefferson will only accept credit for a course taken on a \"Credit/No Credit\" or \"Pass/Fail\" basis if there is evidence that the \"Credit\" or \"Pass\" grade is equivalent to \"C\" or higher. Transfer credits from an institution that operates on a quarter system will be converted to the equivalent number of semester credits. 8. Notification of Decision: If the request is approved, a notification letter will be sent to the transfer institution. Copies will be sent to the Registrar, student, and academic advisor. Note: If the request is not approved, the student will be informed in writing. 9. Transcripts: Students must arrange for an official transcript from the transfer institution to be forwarded directly to the Registrar's Office at tju_ef_registrar@jefferson.edu upon completion of the approved course(s). Students may follow up with their advisor in the School of Continuing & Professional Studies to confirm the transcript has been received. 10. Issues concerning the other institution: Other institutions may have policies which prevent a student from another institution [such as Jefferson] taking a given course. Students are responsible for reading the catalog and contacting the other institution to determine any applicable policies. Students should also be aware that other institutions may cancel advertised courses in any given term according to that institution's policies. Scheduling of Courses With the exception of medical coding courses offered via the Center City campus, all SCPS undergraduate courses are offered in accelerated, 8 -week terms. All courses are offered either online or in a hybrid format wherein courses meet on campus and online in alternating weeks. All core and major courses are offered regularly and in the case of courses required by multiple majors are offered every semester.
