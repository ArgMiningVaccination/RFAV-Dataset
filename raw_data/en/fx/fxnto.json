Similarly, given that the mean severity score at Day 28 was 32 with a standard deviation of 32.3, the number of completed cold episodes provided 80% power to detect a 50% difference in severity at the 95% level of confidence. | | Our study found no significant differences in severity or duration of cold symptoms between groups who took low-dose (placebo) and high-dose vitamin C as treatment for the common cold. The lack of benefit from high-dose therapeutic vitamin C is consistent with the findings of four other randomised controlled trials| The Cochrane and other reviews of the published evidence on high-dose vitamin C and the common cold have drawn attention to the relatively consistent trend for those taking prophylactic doses in excess of 1 g daily to experience some reduction in duration or severity of colds. The main weakness of our study is that it necessarily relied on study participants to decide when the criteria for commencing medication were met and to provide all outcome data. In such a study, double-blindness must be rigorously preserved, and allocation to intervention arms must avoid selection bias. We are confident that our study met these requirements and that the few participants who correctly guessed their medication dose did so by chance. The focus on the university community meant a potential bias in socioeconomic and educational status of participants. The observed spectrum of cold experience may not have been representative of the cold experience of the rest of the Canberra community. Many potential volunteers in our study were ruled ineligible because of their regular use of vitamin C and other, non-traditional approaches for cold therapy and prophylaxis. A recent US study found that 67% of patients seeking medical care for cold episodes believed that vitamin C reduces cold symptoms. Our target of 75 colds in each treatment group was not reached, despite extension of the study and repeated reminder letters to participants. Fewer than half those enrolled returned a completed respiratory event card. As we expected most to suffer at least one cold during the 18 months of the study, based on their previous history, we assume that many did not use the medication as instructed. Although those who completed a respiratory event card were older than those who did not, both groups had similar previous cold experience. The double-blind nature of the study makes it unlikely that greater compliance would have changed the result. Our study had medication groups of comparable size, and for each medication group colds were found to have occurred across the entire study period. The Bio-C group was slightly older than the other groups and, probably in consequence, experienced fewer colds in the previous year, as the incidence of colds tends to decrease with age. However, these differences were not associated with significant differences in outcomes. The average time between symptom onset and medication use was 13 hours, although we encouraged participants to begin medication as soon as four hours after they were certain that a cold was developing. However, the time to beginning medication did not differ significantly between groups. The power of our study to detect a possible significant difference in symptom severity and duration after high-dose vitamin C treatment was limited by the smaller than expected participation rate. However, the non-significant trend that was observed was the reverse: symptoms tended to be less severe and of shorter duration in the placebo group. The lack of observed benefit in this trial is fully consistent with the observations from the four previous randomised controlled trials that have sought to evaluate this issue. It is time to question again the wisdom and utility of the wide practice of well nourished adults taking mega-doses of vitamin C to treat the common cold, a practice which has become prevalent worldwide since the advocacy of Linus Pauling in the early Chalker EB, Treacy B.
