As a naturopathic doctor, Dr. Adelena acknowledges the wisdom of the human body and the natural world and utilizes natural therapeutic methods to encourage optimal health in the individual, family, and community including: Chiropractic Care Traditional Chinese Medicine (herbs and acupuncture) Botanical Medicine Homeopathy Nutritional Counseling Functional Medicine The ultimate goal of naturopathic medicine is the preservation of health through preventative measures. There are circumstances which may warrant conventional medical treatment and therapies. In these cases, Dr. Adelena has the knowledge to work alongside pharmaceuticals in conjunction with natural therapies and can make referrals to other healthcare professionals. Dr. Adelena Izold ND Board Certified Naturopathic Doctor Dr. Adelena graduated with honors from Buffalo State University, majoring in Health and Wellness with a Pre-Medicine discipline. She later completed her Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine at Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine in Tempe, Arizona. Dr. Adelena hopes to carry forward Dr. Mary's vision of educating her patients and utilizing state-of-the-art diagnostic testing - \"Test, Don't Guess.\" As someone who has struggled with the traditional medical system, she strives to provide exceptional care while helping patients take control of their wellness. Dr. Adelena is a remote physician out of Atlanta, Georgia who currently uses: Initial Consultation Free Our Natural Treatment Options At the Full Circle Integrated Health clinic, we view symptoms as the body's signal for help. Our practitioners can help identify the best and most natural solutions for your body to achieve balance. + BioCleanse BioCleanse is an ionic foot spa that uses charged aqua ions for bioenergy detoxification and cleansing of the body and the chi meridians. A BioCleanse foot bath helps to detoxify every organ, tissue and cell in our body, directly and indirectly by re-energizing the natural waste elimination and detoxification function of the immune system and its supporting organs. Ionic BioCleanse detox foot bath helps restore body vitality against environmental toxins by reducing or eliminating the chemicals you take in from drugs, environmental pollution and foods. BioCleanse Helps With: - Removing Toxins And Body Waste Products That Can Cause Health Problems - Clearing Skin Problems - Inactivating Viruses, Bacteria, Yeast, And Fungus - Headache Relief - Rejuvenates And Energizes Your Whole Body - Enhancing Nutrient Absorption - Faster Recovery Time For Disease And Injury - Increased Oxygen In Your Body - Relieving Pain And Tension - Sleep Issues - Inflammation And Unwanted Fluid Retention - Balancing The Immune System - Body Flexibility Improvement - Fibromyalgia - Cystitis - Chronic Fatigue Syndrome - Frozen Shoulder - Tennis Elbow - Eczema - Psoriasis - Knee Or Back Pain + Laser Therapy The Weber Multilaser has a twofold effect, a pain-free stimulation of deep tissue with the biological effects of laser light. The so-called laser needles are used for pain-free acupuncture and placed on the skin or used together in special applicators for the treatment of larger surfaces. Areas of application: Pain Management Transcranial laser therapy, treatment of: - Stroke - Parkinson's - Migraines - Vertigo - Tinnitus - Degenerative brain disease (cerebral sclerosis, Alzheimer's) Acupuncture - Spine syndrome - Arthritis of all kinds - Rheumatic disorders - Tendinitis - Migraine/headache syndromes - Trigeminal Eczema - Atopic dermatitis - Psoriasis - Chronic cell carcinoma Cosmetic Laser Therapy - Vitalization of the skin and wrinkles + VIBE One way to efficiently and safely raise cell voltages is with a device called a VIBE machine. The VIBE machine is used to strengthen the healthy cells of the body to resist physical imbalances. Activated by a low power laser, the VIBE machine produces all the frequencies needed to resonate a higher pitch within your body. This electromagnetic field is unique; it raises the vibrational levels of your body to the most increased oscillations, where they were initially functioning. + Power Plate The Power Plate uses a high-speed vibration to send energy through the body. It forces the muscles to contract and relax at a quick pace. Generally, your muscles contract once or twice per second; however, your muscles will contract thirty to fifty times a second when using the Power Plate. Benefits Include: - Improved Muscle Strength And Power - Improved Flexibility And Range Of Motion - Reduced Pain And Soreness With Faster Recovery - Reduced Appearance Of Cellulite - Increased Bone Mineral Density And Prevention Of Bone Mineral Density Loss Related To Aging - Improved Circulation, Cardiovascular And Cardiorespiratory Functions - Improved Balance, Mobility And Strength Among The Elderly And Inactive Population - Reduced Visceral Adipose Tissue Among Overweight And Obese Patients - Decreased Body Fat And Increased Lean Muscle Tissue In Postmenopausal Women - Improved Walking Function In Those With Spinal Cord Injury - Reduced Pain And Fatigue In People With Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (M.E.), Chronic Fatigue Syndrome And Fibromyalgia + RJL/Phase Angle Though Phase Angle has been linked to overall nutritional status for some time, the true importance of this measurement is only recently coming into its own. It is possible you have never even heard of Phase Angle, but it is a measurement that is becoming more and more recognized as a global health indicator in total body health assessment. Best yet, Phase Angle is not a guesstimate, is not derived from subjective questions asked by your nutritional consultant, nor is it even a derived calculation. It is a direct measurement of your cell membrane. But why would your cell membrane be able to tell us so much about your nutritional status, let alone your overall physical health? To understand how Phase Angle is a health indicator, you have to first realize that your cells are capacitors. Each cell membrane is made up of a phospholipid bilayer consisting of a hydrophilic (water-loving) head and hydrophobic (water-hating) tail. The membrane's conducting ball is positioned on either side of a hydrophobic insulator. In engineering, two conducting materials surrounded by an insulator is a capacitor, which is a device that stores electrons (electric current). In short, your cell membrane acts like a battery. Phase Angle is simply a measurement of the cell's functionality as a capacitor. In other words, Phase Angle tells us when your cell membrane is losing the ability to store electrons efficiently, which is often an indicator of malnutrition or disease. A leaky cell membrane loses its ability to hold voltage, which lowers your Phase Angle. Therefore, a high Phase Angle is an excellent and accurate indicator of good health and a low Phase Angle shows we have some work to do on your health and wellness. + Parasite Cleansing Many people have no idea that parasites reside in their bodies. These microscopic life forms live off of the resources in our tissues, organs, and digestive systems. They cause a host of symptoms, including cramps, headaches, and fatigue. A Parasite Cleanse includes dietary supplements that work to detoxify the human body of parasitic infections. These cleansing programs cure harmful parasitic infestations without the need for prescription medications. Cleaning Your Insides Some pathogens can impair your digestion and immune function. Use plant-based ingredients to help \"scrub out\" these unwanted critters and common intestinal buildup. Supporting Your Mitochondria Promote healthy energy levels by supporting your mitochondria\u2014your body's cellular energy powerhouses. Balancing Your Gut Bacteria Your gut plays a significant role in overall wellness. Gently nurture the gut's natural, healthy balance of bacteria and other microbes. + Microcurrent Frequency Specific Microcurrent therapy is an energy healing therapy using the application of minute amounts of electrical current to specific parts of the body to stimulate self-healing energy and speed the healing process. When the body is injured, the cells are more resistant to electrical input. This is called reduced capacitance. Microcurrent therapy improves cell capacitance allowing the following to occur: - Increased cellular oxygen - Increased hydration - Increased nutrient uptake - Increased removal of waste and toxins Healing time is much more rapid with FSM's application because of the anti-inflammatory effects of the treatment. With the diminishing of inflammatory chemicals in the affected tissues, the healing process is both rapid and complete. Benefits Include: - Treatment of acute and chronic pain - Improve immune system function - Increase protein synthesis - Increase cellular ATP levels - Accelerate healing - Reduce inflammatory cytokines - Increase beta endorphin levels + Metabolic Injections The Metabolic Shot is designed to boost your metabolism, breakdown fat and increase the energy-burning process. Benefits of Metabolic Shot: - Boost Metabolism - Burn Stored Fat - Naturally, Raise Energy Levels - Reduce Bloating - Improve Skin Complexion Book Your Appointment Today Our staff can help determine the best treatment plan for you.
