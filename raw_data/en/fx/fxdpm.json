During the early years of operation of the Fernhill Wetlands Natural Treatment System (NTS) and its 20-acre lake, monitoring of algae in the wetlands, its discharges, and the downstream river is helping to better understand the effects of wetland operations and how wetland processes, throughput, residence time, wetland plant species, and other factors and treatments affect the quality and algal species composition in wetland discharges. The objectives of this study are to: - Identify and document the composition and size of the algal community in the Fernhill Wetlands NTS over a range of summertime conditions, as well as any changes to the downstream algal community that result from NTS discharges, and - Assist District staff in understanding dissolved-oxygen budgets in the NTS, identifying threats to water quality and the algal community in the NTS and downstream in the Tualatin River, and provide technical expertise to help District staff find solutions and adapt NTS operations to avoid such threats and optimize the production of beneficial algal populations in NTS discharges.

[Tualatin River Basin Water Quality Assessment](/centers/oregon-water-science-center/science/tualatin-river-basin-water-quality-assessment)In 1990, the USGS began assessing water-quality in the Tualatin River. Almost 30 years later, we are still monitoring conditions in the basin. [City Beavers: Tualatin River Basin Beaver Study](/centers/oregon-water-science-center/science/city-beavers-tualatin-river-basin-beaver-study)Beavers and their dams are common sights along creeks in the Tualatin River basin. Beaver help create diverse habitats for many other animals, including birds, fish, and amphibians. The USGS studying the affect beaver activity has on the amount and quality of water in local streams, so that agencies in the basin can make strategic management and habitat restoration decisions based on "}
