From the ongoing pandemic to the continuing injustices of racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and other forms of systemic oppression, it can be hard to get through the day without something in the news cycle feeling really difficult. And of course, what some people read about in the news, other people experience in real life. We know that around half of all people in the U.S. will meet the criteria for a diagnosable mental health condition at some point in their lives. We also know that communities who are targeted by racism, homophobia, transphobia, sexism, and other forms of systemic oppression and violence can face an even heavier mental health burden because of these harms. For this year's Mental Health Month, which we proudly started in 1949, Mental Health America is taking our annual toolkit back to basics. Because no matter how heavy and hard the world feels - and maybe especially because the world feels quite challenging right now - focusing on our mental health must remain a priority. So we kept it simple. Our toolkit provides free, practical resources to introduce mental health topics like recognizing warning signs, knowing the factors that can lead to mental health conditions, maintaining mental wellness, and seeking help for mental health. Creating a world where everyone can get the mental health care they need and where everyone can thrive is imperative - and within our reach. We have already seen once-unthinkable leaps and bounds in how our society addresses mental health, and this toolkit empowers us to push the conversation - and the real, tangible resources for people who need them - forward. The other part of this work is you - the readers of this toolkit, the supporters of MHA, and our mission to make mental health supports and services available and accessible to everyone who needs them. Thank you for all you're doing, day in and day out, to make it so everyone has the care and resources they need, no matter who they are or where they are from. It is making a real difference, and I cannot wait to see what this next year brings. Thank you for being a part of this work. All of us at MHA are honored to be on this road with you. Schroeder Stribling President and CEO With mental health entering more and more of our daily conversations, it's critical that everyone has a solid foundation of knowledge about mental health. That's why for Mental Health Month this year, Mental Health America is going Back to Basics. Mental Health America's 2022 Mental Health Month toolkit provides free, practical resources to introduce mental health topics like recognizing warning signs, knowing the factors that can lead to mental health conditions, maintaining mental wellness, seeking help for mental health. This year's toolkit includes: QUESTIONS?

MHA would like to enlist your help with a coordinated effort to reach out to buildings and landmarks across the country with a request to light up green for Mental Health Month. Our goal is to light up as many buildings as possible on the evening of May 1, 2022 (since May 1 is a Sunday your local area building may want to light up on a different date or if they already traditionally light up on a different date - that's fine too). If they are willing to light up green for longer than a day, the first week or May or even the entire month would be awesome! Email Jackie Zimmermann at jzimmermann@mhanational.org to let her know your city/state, which building you've requested be green-lit, and if your request was approved. With mental health entering more and more of our daily conversations, it's critical that everyone has a solid foundation of knowledge about mental health. That's why for Mental Health Month this year, Mental Health America is getting back to basics. Mental Health America's 2022 Mental Health Month toolkit provides free, practical resources to introduce mental health topics like recognizing warning signs, knowing the factors that can lead to mental health conditions, maintaining mental wellness, seeking help for mental health. Addressing mental health symptoms early is critically important for overall health. From social determinants of health to genetics, many factors are in play when it comes to mental health conditions, but there are protective measures that can prevent mental health conditions from developing or keep symptoms from becoming severe. While 1 in 5 people will experience a mental illness during their lifetime, everyone faces challenges in life that can impact their mental health. About half of Americans will meet the criteria for a diagnosable mental health condition sometime in their life, with symptoms starting by age 24 for the majority of people. The average delay between symptom onset and treatment is 11 years, meaning a lot of people spend months or years facing mental health challenges before getting a diagnosis. It is never too early to seek treatment for your mental health. Intervening effectively during early stages can save lives and is critically important for people living with mental health conditions. Social, cultural, and historical factors often impact the mental health of communities that have traditionally been marginalized. These communities experience overt racism and bigotry far too often, which leads to a mental health burden that is deeper than what others may face. Life can be challenging, but every day shouldn't feel hard or out of your control. If it does, one of the quickest and easiest ways to determine whether you are experiencing symptoms of a mental health condition is to take a mental health screening at mhascreening.org. The delays in treatment for mental health conditions are longer than for many other health conditions. Getting screened increases the chances of getting treatment. Mental Health America has free, anonymous, and scientifically validated mental health screens at mhascreening.org. Your screening results can be used to start a conversation with your primary care provider or a trusted friend or family member, and you can begin to plan a course of action for addressing your mental health. When facing a mental health concern or living with a mental health condition, it's common to feel like no one understands what you're going through. You aren't alone - help is available, and recovery is possible. Starting July 16, 2022, call 988 for matters of mental health crisis. Calling 988 will connect you directly to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which is staffed by trained crisis counselors 24/7, 365 days a year. Feel free to supplement these key messages with the assorted statistics and tips included on the fact sheets.Back To Basics: Practical Mental Health Information Since the start of the pandemic, more and more people are talking about mental health. An increasing number of folks are starting to see it for what it is: one important component of your overall health and well-being, just like your physical health. But mental health conditions, resources, and conversations can still feel complicated and out of reach. Are there common warning signs for mental health conditions or crises? Specific factors that can lead to mental health conditions or even crises? What resources are out there - and how do I know if they're right for me? Many people are learning about mental health topics for the first time. Having a widespread understanding of the topic can help you be more informed if you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health condition or crisis. Around half of people in the U.S. will meet the criteria for a diagnosable mental health condition at some point in their life, so everyone should know what to look out for. Everyone should have the support needed to thrive. Communities that have been historically and presently oppressed face a deeper mental health burden because of the added impact of trauma, oppression, and harm. There's often no one single cause for a mental health condition. Instead, there are many possible risk factors that can influence how likely a person is to experience a mental health condition or how serious the symptoms may be. Some risk factors for mental health conditions include: trauma, which can be a one-time event or ongoing; your environment and how it impacts your health and quality of life (also known as social determinants of health like financial stability and health care access); genetics; brain chemistry; and your habits and lifestyle such as a lack of sleep. Of course, understanding the risk factors for a mental health condition can be more difficult when it's your own mental health. Take time to ask yourself about your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to see if this is part of a pattern that may be caused by a mental health condition. Here are some questions to get you started: Have things that used to feel easy started feeling difficult? Does the idea of doing daily tasks like making your bed now feel really, really hard? Have you lost interest in activities and hobbies you used to enjoy? Do you feel irritated, possibly to the point of lashing out at people you care about? Our society focuses much more on physical health than mental health, but both are equally important. If you are concerned about your mental health, there are several options available. You are not alone - help is out there, and recovery is possible. It may be hard to talk about your concerns, but simply acknowledging to yourself that you're struggling is a really big step. Taking a screen at mhascreening.org can help you to better understand what you are experiencing and get helpful resources. After that, consider talking to someone you trust about your results, and seek out a professional to find the support you need. While you may not need this information today, knowing the basics about mental health will mean you're prepared if you ever need it. Go to mhanational.org/may to learn more. 988 Coming Soon: New Number to Call for People Facing Mental Health Crises Everyone deserves access to the support they need, when they need it - and that includes mental health support. That's why this year, starting on July 16, 2022, anyone facing a mental health crisis can call 988 and get connected to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (also called the Lifeline). The line will be staffed with trained crisis counselors who know what callers are going through and know what local resources might make a difference. The phone line is staffed 24/7, and is free and confidential. When someone is facing a mental health concern or living with a mental health condition, it's really common to feel like no one understands what you're going through. It may be difficult to imagine that someone who picks up the phone could totally understand what you're feeling, and even harder to imagine that recovery is possible. The current way of doing things isn't working. Calling 911, the de facto response in our country, is not serving people in a mental health crisis well. A police response can inflict additional trauma on someone in crisis, or worse, attempt to criminalize the person. Unlike 911, counselors will be at the other end of the Lifeline when you dial 988. They are trained to understand exactly how you're feeling and to pair you with resources that are specifically tailored to helping you meet the moment you're in. Having concerns about your mental health is a common experience. It's time to make this kind of support just as common. This is why 988 is an easy, three-digit phone number to remember. This resource was created for everyone, including you: if you're ever feeling like you need help with a mental health or substance use crisis, but not sure if you should call, starting in July, you can just dial 988. It is a direct connection to compassionate, accessible support. It's never too early - or too late - to seek help. In the U.S., the average amount of time between the onset of symptoms of a mental health condition or challenge and a diagnosis is 11 years. It's never too early to get support: If you're facing a mental health crisis for the first time, reaching out can help. Mental health challenges and crises are widespread. This is why resources and support for people facing mental health and substance use crises must be just as widespread. Starting July 16, 2022, it will become even easier for people living with these challenges to get the help they need. If you or someone you know needs to be connected to someone who will understand what you're going through and how to help, they can soon call 988 to be directly connected with a trained crisis counselor at the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Note: 988 will not be available to everyone until July 16, 2022. In the meantime, if you or someone you know is in crisis, please continue to contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or the Crisis Text Line by texting MHA to 741741.Encourage your local public officials to go on the record in support of mental health.

It plays a role in connecting with others, making decisions, handling stress, and many other aspects of daily life. Everyone has mental health, and it deserves your attention just as much as your physical health does. WHAT IS A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION? A mental health condition, or mental illness, refers to a set of symptoms that have been identified by the mental health community. Mental health conditions are described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V), the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), or by people with lived experience. People with mental health conditions deal with changes in emotions, thinking, and/or behavior. For some, this means extreme and unexpected changes in mood - like feeling much more sad or worried than usual. For others, it means not thinking clearly, pulling away from friends and activities you used to enjoy, or hearing voices that others do not. No matter what kind of mental health condition someone is facing, it's always possible to recover.TERMS TO KNOW SYMPTOMS: physical or mental features that indicate the potential existence of a concern, condition, or diagnosis LIVED EXPERIENCE: first-hand, personal experience dealing with a mental health or substance use challenge STRESS: a feeling of emotional or physical tension in response to being overwhelmed or unable to cope with mental or emotional pressure TRAUMA: an emotional response to a disturbing, scary, or shocking experience that overwhelms an individual's ability to cope COPING SKILLS: a strategy to help you deal with difficult situations and lessen unpleasant emotions, thoughts, or behaviors MENTAL HEALTH SCREEN: an evaluation of your mental health and wellbeing through scientifically validated assessment tools You can have times of poor mental health without having a diagnosable condition - just like you can be generally physically unhealthy without having a particular illness.IS POOR MENTAL HEALTH THE SAME THING AS HAVING A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION? No. We all have tough days and weeks and struggling with your mental health doesn't automatically mean you have a mental health condition. To be diagnosed, the changes in your thinking and emotions must be seriously hurting your ability to do the things you want to do; and sticking around longer than they should - weeks or months, depending on the condition. 21%OF ALL U.S. ADULTS LIVE WITH A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION.\u00b9 WHO NEEDS TO LOOK AFTER THEIR MENTAL HEALTH? Everyone! Mental health is important for all of us. Taking care of yourself is critical to prevent your mental health from worsening - factors like nutrition and gut health, stress, sleep, relationships, trauma, and more can contribute to poor mental health. If your mental health is in a good spot, it is a great time to practice coping skills - ways to help you deal with hard feelings - so that you're better able to handle tough times when they happen. THE PREVALENCE OF MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS IS HIGHEST AMONG ADULTS REPORTING TWO OR MORE RACES (35.8%).\u00b2FAST FACTS 46%OF AMERICANS WILL MEET THE CRITERIA FOR A DIAGNOSABLE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION AT SOMETIME IN THEIR LIFE.\u00b3 IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR MENTAL HEALTH OR JUST WANT TO CHECK IN WITH YOURSELF, TAKE A SCREEN AT MHASCREENING.ORG.

WHAT PLAYS A ROLE IN DEVELOPING MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS? Most mental health conditions don't have a single cause - they have many possible causes, called risk factors. The more risk factors you have, the more likely you are to develop a mental health condition in your lifetime. Mental health conditions can develop slowly, or symptoms can start to appear more suddenly after you've experienced a stressful event or big change. RISK FACTORS Risk factors don't just affect who will and won't develop a mental health condition. They also impact the seriousness of symptoms and when those symptoms will show up. There are several risk factors, including: Social determinants of health (SDOH) SDOH are the conditions in which people live, learn, work, and play that impact their health and quality of life. There are five main categories - financial stability, education access and quality, health care access and quality, neighborhood and living environment, and social and community life. One example of how SDOH affect mental health is poverty. High poverty neighborhoods can cause stress, weaken healthy social connections, and harm the overall mental health of the people who live there, even when controlling for individual poverty.\u00b9 Trauma Any experience that was highly stressful, shocking, or dangerous to you can be traumatic. Trauma is different for everyone - what feels normal to someone else might be traumatic to you, and vice versa. A traumatic event can threaten your physical safety (like being in a car accident), or it can be more emotional (like the sudden death of a loved one). Traumatic experiences can be one-time events (like getting in a fight) or ongoing (like bullying or childhood neglect). Situations like loneliness, seeing an accident, natural disasters, poverty, and racism can all cause a trauma response. Genetics Your genes are passed down from your parents and ancestors. They act as the blueprint for how your body and brain develop and function. There's no one gene that decides if you'll have a mental health condition. Instead, many genes affect the way your TERMS TO KNOW RISK FACTOR: something that increases the chances of developing a condition NEUROTRANSMITTERS: chemicals that carry messages throughout your brain PROTECTIVE FACTOR: something that decreases the chances of developing a condition and/or balances out an existing risk factor brain develops, making you more or less likely to develop a mental health condition later. Biology and brain chemistry Some brains are wired differently, have too high or too low levels of certain neurotransmitters, or are damaged after a head injury. Abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex, frontal cortex, and other parts of the brain can also increase your chances of developing a mental health condition. Habits and lifestyle It's important to take care of your body and mind. Things like not getting enough high-quality sleep, regularly unhealthy food choices, lack of exercise, and poor stress management can all play a role in developing a mental health condition. For instance, the occasional night of tossing and turning won't hurt you long-term, but chronic exhaustion can. Sleep problems like insomnia, consistently poor sleep quality, and frequent nightmares are related to mental health concerns and conditions, including a higher risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors.\u00b2Substance use Using drugs or alcohol can trigger a mental health condition by affecting mood, sleep, relationships, and physical health. It can also lead to changes in some of the same brain areas involved in other mental health conditions like depression and schizophrenia.\u00b3 It's common for individuals already struggling with their mental health to turn to substances as a coping mechanism. This substance use can impact the effectiveness of medications and make it harder to recover from a mental health condition. When someone has a mental health condition that overlaps with a substance use disorder, it is either referred to as dual diagnosis or co-occurring disorders. AM I DESTINED TO HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION? It is important to know that experiencing any of these factors doesn't mean that you'll definitely develop a mental health condition. You can take steps to reduce your risk factors or increase your protective factors - like building supportive relationships, taking care of your body, and practicing gratitude. Just like any health condition, knowing the risk factors can help you identify and address symptoms early on and plan a course of action to overall health.FAST FACTS IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR MENTAL HEALTH OR JUST WANT TO CHECK IN WITH YOURSELF, TAKE A SCREEN AT MHASCREENING.ORG.

INDIVIDUALS WHO FREQUENTLY DRINK ALCOHOL ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE DEPRESSED THAN THOSE WHO MODERATE THEIR USE. DRINKING IN MODERATION IS DEFINED AS ONE DRINK OR LESS IN A DAY FOR WOMEN AND TWO DRINKS OR LESS IN A DAY FOR MEN. MAINTAINING GOOD MENTAL HEALTH Whether you realize it or not, mental health plays a big role in your overall well-being. When you're mentally healthy, you are able to enjoy your life and the people in it, feel good about yourself, keep up good relationships, and deal with stress. It's normal for your mental health to shift over time - we all face difficult situations in our lives. Creating positive habits is a great way to support your mental health when you're doing well and helps you build skills to use if you do face symptoms of a mental health condition. FOOD CHOICES AND NUTRITION The quality of food you eat can impact your overall physical and mental health. Your gut is often called \"the second brain\" and communicates with your actual brain - physically through the vagus nerve and chemically through hormones and neurotransmitters (chemical messengers that carry signals between cells). The bacteria, viruses, and fungi that live in the gut are called the \"gut microbiome\" - eating nutritious foods is the number one thing you can do to keep your gut microbiome healthy and protect your brain. Learn more at mhanational.org/food and mhanational.org/gut-brain. EXERCISE Staying active benefits many aspects of health and can prevent physical and mental health symptoms from worsening. Making time for exercise and movement each day improves self-esteem, brain function, and sleep and has been found to lessen social withdrawal and stress. Getting exercise doesn't have to be intimidating! You don't have to work out for hours on end - just 15 minutes of intense exercise at a time, ten times a week, will get you the recommended amount of physical activity. Just one hour of exercise per week can help prevent symptoms of depression.\u00b2 Choose activities that are easy to work into your life - walk the dog for an extra 20 minutes or do some floor exercises while you're watching a movie or your favorite show. Learn more at mhanational.org/exercise. SLEEP Your health heavily depends on how rested you are. Sleep plays a role in your moods, ability to learn and make memories, organ health, immune system, and other bodily functions like appetite, metabolism, and hormone release.\u00b3 It also helps the body re-energize its cells and clear out toxins. Quality of sleep matters, not just how many hours you get. Learn more at mhanational.org/sleep. Important nutrients for mental health: \u00b9 OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS: essential to brain health and reduce inflammation and risk of heart disease B-GROUP VITAMINS: help to regulate brain chemicals, immune function, and amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) VITAMIN D: important for brain function, including mood and critical thinking Good quality sleep means: BEING ASLEEP FOR 85% OF THE TIME YOU'RE IN BED OR MORE. FALLING ASLEEP IN UNDER 30 MINUTES. WAKING UP NO MORE THAN ONCE PER NIGHT FOR NO LONGER THAN 20 MINUTES . STRESS MANAGEMENT Dealing with stress is a normal part of life - we all experience it during times of too much responsibility, too little sleep, or external worries like money or relationships. In most cases, stress comes and goes fairly quickly, and the body can return to its typical state. However, consistently high stress - because you are unable to relieve your stress or are constantly facing stressful situations (chronic stress) - can negatively impact attention, memory, and how you deal with emotions in the long term. Learn more at mhanational.org/stress. IDENTIFY COPING SKILLS Coping skills are activities or strategies you can use to reduce or tolerate tough feelings. No one thing works for everyone, so it might take a few tries to figure out what helps you. Test out a range of techniques so that you're prepared for those times when your well-being starts to slip. You may want to keep a running list (on your phone or on paper) of what works for you, like calling a friend or doing an at-home workout. This makes it easier to get started when you're in a tough mental state. If you're starting from scratch, MHA has resources for \"Building Your Coping Toolbox.\" Learn more at mhanational.org/coping-toolbox and mhanational.org/manage-emotions.

What is sleep quality. https://www.thensf.org/what-is-sleep-quality/ BUILD A SUPPORT SYSTEM Having people in your life who you relate to and can lean on goes a long way in improving your mood and general well-being. Humans are social beings, and our brains are wired to seek connection. Having people to support you during times of hardship protects your long-term mental health. Not only can a strong social support system often prevent mental health concerns or symptoms from developing into a diagnosable mental health condition - a strong social support system has also been shown to improve overall outcomes in recovering from a mental health condition. Find your people: Connect with people over shared hobbies and interests - it's less intimidating to make new friends when you already have something in common. Consider community service or volunteering. Giving back is a great way to feel less alone - you'll meet new people and likely learn about local events and resources. Focus on quality relationships - having one person you really trust will serve you better than many surface-level connections. Learn more at mhanational.org/social-connections.RECOGNIZING WHEN YOU NEED HELP WITH YOUR MENTAL HEALTH Think about your physical health. We all have days where we feel a bit sore, have a headache, or are extra tired. That doesn't necessarily mean you're sick. You're sick when something suddenly and signicantly changes for the worse or prevents you from functioning properly. Mental health is similar - the occasional bad day is to be expected, but when things that used to be easy become a lot more difficult, something's going on. Instead of focusing on physical symptoms, you'll want to look at your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. WHAT IS A MENTAL HEALTH CONCERN? A mental health concern is anything that causes a person to believe their mental health may be suffering. You don't need to be diagnosed with a mental health condition to be dealing with a mental health concern. Many people struggle with not feeling \"sick enough\" to seek help early on in their mental health journey. The average delay between symptom onset and treatment is 11 years,\u00b9 meaning a lot of people spend months or years facing mental health challenges before getting a diagnosis. It is never too early to seek treatment - if you want help for your mental health, you deserve to get it. LEARN ABOUT YOURSELF It's hard to know when your mental health is slipping if you aren't in touch with yourself or paying attention to your usual thoughts, feelings, and behaviors: Take some time to think about your daily life. How is your typical mood? Energy level? Appetite? Sleep routine? Social life? Physical health? When one or more of these things changes significantly, it could be a sign of an underlying mental health concern. Consider tracking your mood and energy to see if you can find any patterns. For instance, if you don't have a regular sleep schedule, track the hours you spend asleep each night - you might find that waking up earlier makes for happier days than sleeping in. Think about other factors that might relate to your mental health. These could be factors like the weather or spending time with certain people. Maybe you'll realize that rainy days often mean your mood will be a bit lower than usual or that conversations with a certain friend have been draining you lately. Sometimes there's nothing you can do to change your circumstances - but being aware of your triggers can help you manage your expectations and get ahead of taking care of yourself. Common signs of mental health concerns: ISOLATION: You used to be really outgoing and positive, but lately, you want to spend most of your time home alone. LOSING INTEREST: You aren't as interested in things you used to like - food, music, hobbies, friends, work/school. TROUBLE FOCUSING: You can't concentrate enough to follow conversations with friends. SHORT TEMPER: You're easily irritated and keep lashing out at people you care about.IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR MENTAL HEALTH OR JUST WANT TO CHECK IN WITH YOURSELF, TAKE A SCREEN AT MHASCREENING.ORG. SOURCES 1 Wang, P.S., Berglund, P.A., Olfson, M., Kessler, R.C. (2004). Delays in initial treatment contact after first onset of a mental disorder. Health Services Research, 39(2). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361014/ LEARN ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS You've taken a great first step by learning how to proactively take care of your mental health. But sometimes, mental health conditions sneak up on you. Some people have mental health conditions and don't realize it - if it's something you've always dealt with, it's easy to assume that's just how it is for everyone. Life can be challenging, but every day shouldn't feel hard or out of your control. If it does, learn more about the symptoms of different mental health conditions to see if something aligns with your experiences. WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU NEED HELP When living with a mental health condition or facing a mental health concern, it's common to feel like no one understands what you're going through. But many people overcome the mental health challenges they face. You aren't alone - help is out there, and recovery is possible. MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS CAN BE HARD AND CONFUSING. It's becoming more and more common to talk about mental health in the open, but there's still a lot of stigma, or judgment, that people have about mental health conditions. If you've seen or heard negativity about the same challenges you deal with, you might internalize those attitudes and feel shame about your experiences. This shame, or self-stigma, makes it difficult to talk about your concerns. ADMIT TO YOURSELF THAT YOU'RE STRUGGLING. Accepting that you might have a mental health condition can be scary - it suddenly feels so real. But it can also put you on a path to getting the help you deserve. Take a mental health screen at mhascreening.org to get an idea of how severe your symptoms are. Having some language to describe what you're dealing with is helpful in doing more research and connecting with peers. TALK TO SOMEONE YOU TRUST. It can be hard to know what to say, but just naming what you're experiencing is a good start. Friends and family can be key supporters as you start your recovery journey - healing is hard to manage alone, and your loved ones can only support you if they know what's going on. Talking in person can feel overwhelming - try writing down what you want to say to gather your thoughts or put everything into a letter to give them and talk about it later. If you're worried that the people closest to you won't be supportive, try reaching out to other people who seem kind: coworkers, teachers, friends' parents, or that person you haven't talked to in a few years but who posts about their mental health on social media. Can't think of anyone in your life who you are comfortable opening up to? Consider calling a warmline - they are staffed by trained peers who have gone through their own mental health struggles and know what it's like to need help. You can find a list of available warmlines at mhanational.org/warmlines. TERMS TO KNOW RECOVERY: a process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live self-directed lives, and strive to reach their full potential STIGMA: negative, judgmental, and/or discriminatory attitudes toward mental health challenges and those who live with them SELF-STIGMA: negative attitudes and shame regarding an individual's own mental health, resulting from internalizing public stigma PEER: someone who shares the experience of living with a mental health condition and/or substance use disorder MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL: a licensed or certified mental health treatment provider THERAPIST: a mental health professional trained to help individuals understand and cope with their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors; may assess and/or diagnose mental health conditions PSYCHIATRIST: a licensed medical doctor who has completed additional psychiatric training; can diagnose mental health conditions, prescribe and manage medication, and provide therapy HEALTH INSURANCE: a signed contract with a health insurance company that requires the company to pay for some of your health care costs SLIDING SCALE PAYMENT: a payment model providers can use to make treatment financially accessible for those who would not otherwise be able to afford it due to income or lack of health insurance coverage OUTPATIENT: treatment that takes place in an office, hospital, or other clinical setting but does not involve overnight stays TALK TO A PROFESSIONAL. Finding help can be intimidating. For some people, just the thought of talking to a doctor about your mental health is scary. There might be long wait times or words you don't understand, and how do you even know where to begin? No matter what, you are deserving of help. Start by reaching out to your primary care doctor. It might feel weird to talk to them about emotional issues, but they can help in many ways. They can ask questions to help you better understand what you're going through, let you know what kinds of support are out there, and recommend lifestyle changes or medication. They can also help connect you to specialized mental health professionals, like a therapist and psychiatrist. Therapy, medication, and other mental health treatments can be amazing experiences, but for some, the cost just isn't realistic. If you don't have insurance, or if your insurance doesn't cover mental health services, you may not know what to do next. IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR MENTAL HEALTH OR JUST WANT TO CHECK IN WITH YOURSELF, TAKE A SCREEN AT MHASCREENING.ORG. THE TRADITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM DOESN'T MEET EVERYONE'S NEEDS. Most of the western health care industry has taken on the medical model of understanding and treating health conditions - focusing on the diagnosis and management of symptoms. Often, the social, cultural, and historical factors that impact the mental health of communities that have traditionally been marginalized are ignored. Other types of treatment include community care, culturally-based practices, and self-directed care. Learn more about these at mhanational.org/july. You might also want to consider support groups or peer support. These are all valid forms of mental health support - if it works for you, then it works! Options for people without insurance: Ask therapists about their sliding-scale payment options. Get started by visiting mhanational.org/finding-therapy. Look into local colleges or universities for an outpatient psychology program. Do a Google search for \"outpatient psychology program\" followed by the name of a nearby school, or search for \"university hospitals\" followed by your town or state if you don't know of specific colleges. Group therapy generally costs about a third of the price of an individual session - a local community center should be able to guide you to a group that fits your needs. Check out your state's Department of Behavioral Health website or this directory of peer-run services at cdsdirectory.org. Reach out to local nonprofits or resource centers - locate the MHA affiliate near you at mhanational.org/find-affiliate.
