There is a stillness you find when connecting with Sound and the Stars. There is an activation and awakening in your cells that brings you home with each rising and falling tide. There is an intuitive desire to be in ritual with the Divine, connect our hearts, and place gifts of honor and gratitude upon the altar. The moon illuminates Your True Self... helping you heal, manifest, and light the path ahead as you co-create with the Universe. The moon shines a light honoring all experiences that have brought you to this moment. May we all return to Love under the same Moon. Sound is a powerful medicine that moves through the deepest parts of your mental, emotional, and physical bodies awakening your inner world. The vibrations and frequencies of sound travel deep into your cellular system and through your energetic field to cleanse, reorganize and create space connecting you to your Higher Consciousness. Receiving sound medicine can open your pathways of remembering and move into completion of the patterns and cycles no longer serving you. When you enter this deep state of relaxation so much magic unfolds for you. Sound Medicine Ceremonies support your body's natural healing processes to return to Divine homeostasis. Benefits of Sound Healing: Release stress & anxiety, more restful sleep, release muscle tension, feel more confident and relaxed, overall improved wellbeing, sense of clarity, focus, and peacefulness, feel more present, calm, and centered, lighter, happier, and free.
