The tetanus [toxin](https://www.rxlist.com/toxin/definition.htm), prepared from Clostridium tetani grown in a semi-synthetic medium, is detoxified with [formaldehyde](https://www.rxlist.com/formaldehyde/definition.htm) and purified. The capsular polysaccharide is covalently bound to the tetanus toxoid. After purification, the conjugate is lyophilized in the presence of lactose as a stabilizer. The diluent for HIBERIX is a sterile saline solution prefilled reconstituted with the accompanying saline diluent, each dose is formulated to contain 10 mcg of purified capsular polysaccharide conjugated to approximately 25 mcg of tetanus toxoid, 12.6 mg of lactose, and 0.5 mcg of [residual](https://www.rxlist.com/residual/definition.htm) formaldehyde. HIBERIX does not contain preservatives. The tip caps of the prefilled syringes may contain natural rubber latex. The rubber plungers of the prefilled syringes and the vial stoppers do not contain latex. [See [HOW SUPPLIED](/hiberix-drug.htm#HS)/Storage and Handling] INDICATIONS HIBERIX\u00ae is indicated for active [immunization](https://www.rxlist.com/immunization/definition.htm) as a booster dose for the prevention of invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b. HIBERIX is approved for use in children 15 months through 4 years of age (prior to fifth birthday). HIBERIX is to be used as a booster dose in children who have received a primary series with a Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine that is licensed for primary immunization. HIBERIX is not approved for primary immunization. The evaluation of effectiveness of HIBERIX as a booster dose was based on immune responses in children using serological endpoints that predict protection from invasive disease due to H. influenzae type b [see [CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY](/hiberix-drug.htm#CP) and [Clinical Studies](/hiberix-drug.htm#CS)]. These protective antibody levels have not been evaluated in clinical trials in which a booster dose of HIBERIX is compared to a booster dose of a US-licensed Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine in children who previously received a primary series with a US-licensed Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine [see [Clinical Studies](/hiberix-drug.htm#CS)]. Reconstitution Instructions HIBERIX is to be reconstituted only with the accompanying saline diluent. The reconstituted vaccine should be a clear and colorless solution. [Parenteral](https://www.rxlist.com/parenteral/definition.htm) drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If either of these conditions exists, the vaccine should not be administered. Figure 1. Cleanse vial stopper. Attach appropriate needle to accompanying prefilled syringe of saline diluent and insert into vial. Figure 2. Transfer entire contents of prefilled syringe into vial. With needle still inserted, vigorously shake the vial. Figure 3. After reconstitution, withdraw entire contents of vial (approximately 0.5 mL) and administer by intramuscular injection. After reconstitution, HIBERIX should be administered promptly or stored refrigerated between 2\u00b0 and 8\u00b0C and administered within 24 hours. If the vaccine is not administered promptly, shake the solution vigorously again before injection. Dose And Administration HIBERIX is administered as a single dose (approximately 0.5 mL) by intramuscular injection into the anterolateral aspect of the thigh or deltoid. Do not administer this product intravenously, intradermally, or subcutaneously. HIBERIX is to be used as a booster dose in children who have received a primary series with a Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine that is licensed for primary immunization [see INDICATIONS AND USAGE]. HOW SUPPLIED Dosage Forms And Strengths HIBERIX is a solution for injection supplied as single-dose vials of lyophilized vaccine to be saline diluent in prefilled TIP-LOK\u00ae syringes.

There is the possibility that broad use of HIBERIX could reveal adverse reactions not observed in clinical trials. In 7 clinical studies, 1,008 children received HIBERIX as a booster dose following primary [vaccination](https://www.rxlist.com/vaccination/definition.htm) with either HIBERIX (not approved for primary series in US, N = 530), Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur SA (N = 235), Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. (N = 26), or Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine manufactured by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc. (no longer licensed in the US, N = 217). None of the studies included a comparator group that received a booster dose with a US-licensed Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine. Studies were conducted in Europe, Canada, and Latin America. Across these studies, the mean age of subjects at the time of booster vaccination with HIBERIX ranged from 16 to 19 months. At the time of vaccination, 172 (17.1%) subjects were 11 to 14 months of age, 642 (63.7%) subjects were 15 to 18 months of age, and 194 (19.2%) subjects were 19 to 25 months of age. Approximately half of the subjects were male. Among subjects for whom information on race/ethnicity was available, nearly all subjects were white. In these 7 studies, HIBERIX was administered concomitantly with non-US formulations (containing 2.5 mg 2-phenoxyethanol per dose as preservative) of one of the following US- licensed [vaccines](https://www.rxlist.com/vaccines/definition.htm): INFANRIX\u00ae were administered in dosing regimens not approved in the US. Some subjects received DTaP-HBV (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, not licensed in US) concomitantly with HIBERIX. Solicited Adverse Events In an open-label, multicenter study conducted in Germany, 371 children received a booster dose of HIBERIX administered concomitantly with DTaP-HBV- IPV. The mean age at the time of vaccination was 16 months. Subjects in this study had previously received a primary series with either HIBERIX (not approved for primary series in US, N = 92), Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur SA (N = 96), or Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine manufactured by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc. (no longer licensed in the US) (N = 183). All subjects previously received 3 doses of DTaP-HBV-IPV. Information on adverse events was collected by parents/guardians using standardized forms for 4 consecutive days following vaccination with HIBERIX (i.e., day of vaccination and the next 3 days). The reported frequencies of solicited local and general adverse events are presented in Table 1. Table 1: Percentage of Children With Solicited Local And General Adverse Events Within 4 Days of Vaccinationa With HIBERIXb Coadministered With DTaP-HBV-IPVc, Intent to all subjects for whom safety data were available. | a Within 4 days of vaccination defined as day of vaccination and the next 3 days. b In this study, 92 subjects previously received 3 doses of HIBERIX (not approved for primary immunization in the US), 96 subjects previously received 3 doses of a US-licensed Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur SA), and 183 subjects previously received 3 doses of a Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine that is no longer licensed in the US. c In this study, DTaP-HBV-IPV was given to subjects who previously received 3 doses of DTaP-HBV-IPV. In the US, PEDIARIX is approved for use as a 3-dose primary series; use as a fourth consecutive dose is not approved in the US. d Local reactions at the injection site for HIBERIX. e Grade 3 redness or swelling defined as > 20 mm. f Grade 3 pain defined as causing crying when limb moved. g Fever defined as 100.4\u00b0F ( 103.1\u00b0F ( rectally oral or tympanic. h Grade 3 fussiness defined as persistent crying and could not be comforted. i Grade 3 for these symptoms defined as preventing normal daily activity. Serious Adverse Events Two of 1,008 subjects reported a serious adverse event that occurred in the 31-day period following booster immunization with HIBERIX. One subject developed bilateral pneumonia 9 days post-vaccination and one subject experienced asthenia following accidental drug ingestion 18 days post-vaccination. Postmarketing Experience In addition to reports in clinical trials, worldwide voluntary reports of adverse events received for HIBERIX since market introduction (1996) of this vaccine are listed below. This list includes serious events and/or events which have a plausible causal connection to HIBERIX. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccination. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Extensive swelling of the vaccinated limb, injection site induration. Immune System Disorders: Allergic reactions (including anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions), angioedema. Nervous System Disorders: Convulsions (with without fever), hypotonic- hyporesponsive episode, somnolence, syncope or Apnea. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Rash, urticaria. INTERACTIONS Interference With Laboratory Tests Haemophilus b capsular polysaccharide derived from Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccines has been detected in the urine of some vaccinees.1 Urine antigen detection may not have a diagnostic value in suspected disease due to H. influenzae type b within 1 to 2 weeks after receipt of a H. influenzae type b-containing vaccine, including HIBERIX [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/hiberix-drug.htm#P)]. Concomitant Vaccine Administration In clinical studies, a booster dose of HIBERIX was administered concomitantly with 1 of the following vaccines: DTaP, DTaP-IPV, DTaP-HBV-IPV, or DTaP-HBV (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, The formulations of DTaP, DTaP-IPV, and DTaP-HBV-IPV were non-US formulations (containing 2.5 mg 2-phenoxyethanol per dose as preservative) of the following US-licensed vaccines: INFANRIX, KINRIX, and PEDIARIX, respectively. In and DTaP-HBV-IPV were administered in dosing regimens that are not approved in the US. [See ADVERSE REACTIONS and [Clinical Studies](/hiberix-drug.htm#CS)] Sufficient data are not available to confirm lack of interference in immune responses to other vaccines administered concomitantly with HIBERIX. If HIBERIX is administered concomitantly with other injectable vaccines, they should be given with separate syringes and at different injection sites. HIBERIX should not be mixed with any other vaccine in the same syringe or vial. Immunosuppressive Therapies Immunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic drugs, and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses), may reduce the immune response to HIBERIX. WARNINGS Included as part of the PRECAUTIONS section. PRECAUTIONS Guillain-Barre Syndrome If Guillain-Barre syndrome has occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior vaccine containing tetanus toxoid, the decision to give any tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine, including HIBERIX, should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and possible risks. The tip caps of the prefilled syringes may contain natural rubber latex which may cause allergic reactions in latex sensitive individuals [see [HOW SUPPLIED](/hiberix-drug.htm#HS)/Storage and Handling]. Syncope Syncope (fainting) can occur association with administration of injectable vaccines, including HIBERIX. Syncope can be accompanied by transient neurological signs such as visual disturbance, paresthesia, and tonic-clonic limb movements. Procedures should be in place to avoid falling injury and to restore cerebral perfusion following syncope. Preventing And Managing Allergic Vaccine Reactions Prior to administration, the healthcare provider should review the patient's immunization history for possible vaccine hypersensitivity. Epinephrine and other appropriate agents used for the control of immediate allergic reactions must be immediately available should an acute anaphylactic reaction occur. Altered Immunocompetence Safety and effectiveness of HIBERIX in immunosuppressed children have not been evaluated. If HIBERIX is administered to immunosuppressed children, including children receiving immunosuppressive therapy, the expected immune response may not be obtained. Interference With Laboratory Tests Urine antigen detection may not have a diagnostic value in suspected disease due to influenzae type b within 1 to 2 weeks after receipt of a H. influenzae type b-containing vaccine, including HIBERIX [see [DRUG INTERACTIONS](/hiberix-drug.htm#DI)]. Tetanus Immunization Immunization with HIBERIX does not substitute for routine tetanus immunization. Nonclinical Toxicology Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility HIBERIX has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or for impairment of fertility. Use In Specific Populations Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with HIBERIX. It is also not known whether HIBERIX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of HIBERIX were established in the age group 15 through 18 months on the basis of clinical studies [see [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/hiberix-drug.htm#AR) and [Clinical Studies](/hiberix-drug.htm#CS)]. Safety and effectiveness of HIBERIX in the age group 19 months through 4 years are supported by evidence in children 15 through 18 months of age. Safety and effectiveness of HIBERIX in children younger than 15 months of age and in children 5 to 16 years of age have not been established. REFERENCES 1.

CONTRAINDICATIONS Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any H. influenzae type b- or tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine or any component of the vaccine is a contraindication to administration of HIBERIX [see [DESCRIPTION](/hiberix-drug.htm#D)]. CLINICAL Action Haemophilus a gram-negative coccobacillus. Most strains of H. influenzae that cause invasive disease are type b. H. influenzae type b can cause invasive disease such as sepsis and meningitis. Specific levels of antibodies to polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate (anti-PRP) have been shown to correlate with protection against invasive disease due to H. influenzae type b. Based on data from passive antibody studies2 and a clinical efficacy study with unconjugated Haemophilus bpolysaccharide vaccine3, an anti-PRP concentration of 0.15 mcg/mL has been accepted as a minimal protective level. Data from an efficacy study with unconjugated Haemophilus b polysaccharide vaccine indicate that an anti-PRP concentration of 1.0 mcg/mL predicts protection through at least a 1-year period.4,5 These antibody levels have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccines, including HIBERIX. Clinical Studies Immunological Evaluation In 6 clinical studies, the immune response to HIBERIX administered as a booster dose was evaluated in a total of 415 children 12 to 23 months of age. At the time of vaccination, 30 children were 12 to 14 months of age, 316 children were 15 to 18 months of age, and 69 children were 19 to 23 months of age. Among subjects, 43% to 60% were male. Among subjects for whom information on race/ethnicity was available, nearly all subjects were white. None of the studies included a comparator group that received a booster dose with a US-licensed Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine. Characteristics of 3 of these studies are presented in Table 2.
