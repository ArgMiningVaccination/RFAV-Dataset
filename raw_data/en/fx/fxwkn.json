Having any symptom is NOT NORMAL. Understanding what the symptom means and supporting balance within the body is prudent for health. Seizures are a very difficult and serious disorder. Medicine DOES NOT KNOW THE CAUSE. And yet, Dr. Huntoon has helped people with chronic seizures to reduce or come off their medication and lead a normal life. Come learn how to remedy this Once and For All! Dr. Huntoon is ready to help you heal when you are. To Request an Action Plan to Seizures - Seizure Disorders [Click Here](requestactionplan.asp) What Are Seizures? What Causes Them? Summary Seizures are symptoms of a brain problem. They happen because of sudden, abnormal electrical activity in the brain. When people think of seizures, they often think of convulsions in which a person's body shakes rapidly and uncontrollably. Not all seizures cause convulsions. There are many types of seizures and some have mild symptoms. Seizures fall into two main groups. Focal seizures, also called partial seizures, happen in just one part of the brain. Generalized seizures are a result of abnormal activity on both sides of the brain. Most seizures last from 30 seconds to 2 minutes and do not cause lasting harm. However, it is a medical emergency if seizures last longer than 5 minutes or if a person has many seizures and does not wake up between them. Seizures can have many causes, including medicines, high fevers, head injuries and certain diseases. People who have recurring seizures due to a brain disorder have epilepsy. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke What Causes Seizures? Often, it's unknown from the Medical Perspective. Read Dr. Huntoon's Alternative Medicine Perspective below. A seizure happens because of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. It may go nearly unnoticed. Or, in some severe cases, it may cause unconsciousness and convulsions, when your body shakes uncontrollably. Seizures usually come on suddenly. How long and severe they are can vary. A seizure can happen to you just once, or over and over. If they keep coming back, that's epilepsy, or a seizure disorder. Less than one in 10 people who have a seizure get epilepsy. Experts put seizures into two general categories: Generalized Seizures These involve your entire brain from the start. Common subtypes include: Partial (Focal) Seizures This type begins in a specific area of the brain. They may spread to the entire brain. There are two types: What Causes Seizures? Often, it's unknown. Many things can bring them on, including: Absence Seizures Absence seizures involve brief, sudden lapses of consciousness. They're more common in children than adults. Someone having an absence seizure may look like he or she is staring into space for a few seconds. This type of seizure usually doesn't lead to physical injury. Absence seizures usually can be controlled with anti-seizure medications. Some children who have them also develop other seizures. Many children outgrow absence seizures in their teens. An indication of simple absence seizure is a vacant stare, which may be mistaken for a lapse in attention that lasts 10 to 15 seconds, without any subsequent confusion, headache or drowsiness. Signs and symptoms of absence seizures include: Absence seizures generally last 10 to 15 seconds, followed immediately by full recovery. Afterward, there's no memory of the incident. Some people have dozens of episodes daily, which interfere with school or daily activities. A child may have absence seizures for some time before an adult notices the seizures, because they're so brief. A decline in a child's learning ability may be the first sign of this disorder. Teachers may comment about a child's inability to pay attention. When To See a Doctor Contact your doctor: Seek immediate medical attention: Often, no underlying cause can be found for absence seizures. Many children appear to have a genetic predisposition to them. Rapid breathing (hyperventilation) can trigger an absence seizure. In general, seizures are caused by abnormal electrical impulses from nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. The brain's nerve cells normally send electrical and chemical signals across the synapses that connect them. In people who have seizures, the brain's usual electrical activity is altered. During an absence seizure, these electrical signals repeat themselves over and over in a three-second pattern. People who have seizures may also have altered levels of the chemical messengers that help the nerve cells communicate with one another (neurotransmitters). Absence seizures are more prevalent in children. Many children gradually outgrow them over months to years. Some children with absence seizures may also experience full seizures (tonic-clonic seizures). Certain factors are common to children who have absence seizures, including: While most children outgrow absence seizures, some: Other complications can include: You're likely to start by seeing your family doctor or a general practitioner. However, you'll probably be referred to a doctor who specializes in nervous system disorders (neurologist). Here's some information to help you get ready for the appointment. What You Can Do Preparing a list of questions will help you make the most of your time with your doctor. For absence seizure, some basic questions to ask your doctor include: Don't hesitate to ask any other questions you have. What To Expect From Your Doctor Your doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions, such as: Your doctor will ask for a detailed description of the seizures and conduct a physical exam. Tests may include: Your child may be asked to breathe rapidly or look at flickering lights, an attempt to provoke a seizure. During a seizure, the pattern on the EEG differs from the normal pattern. Your doctor likely will start at the lowest dose of anti-seizure medication possible and increase the dosage as needed to control the seizures. Most children can taper off anti-seizure medications, under a doctor's supervision, after they've been seizure-free for two years. Drugs prescribed for absence seizure include: A person with absence seizures may elect to wear a medical bracelet for identification for emergency medical reasons. The bracelet should state whom to contact in an emergency and what medications you use. It's also a good idea to let teachers, coaches and child care workers know about the seizures. Even after they've been controlled with medication, seizures may affect areas of your child's life, such as attention span and learning. He or she will have to be seizure-free for reasonable lengths of time (intervals vary from state to state) before being able to drive. You may find it helpful to talk with other people who are in the same situation as you. Besides offering support, they may have advice or tips for coping that you haven't considered. The Epilepsy Foundation has a network of support groups, as well as online forums for teens and adults who have seizures and parents of children who have seizures. You can call the Epilepsy Foundation at 800-332-1000 or visit its website. Also, your doctor may know of support groups in your area. [Medicines Two Choices](MedicinesTwoChoices.asp) for You References Frontal Lobe Seizures Overview [Medicines Two Choices](MedicinesTwoChoices.asp) for You Grand Mal Seizure A grand mal seizure \u2014 also known as a generalized tonic-clonic seizure \u2014 features a loss of consciousness and violent muscle contractions. It's the type of seizure most people picture when they think about seizures in general. Grand mal seizure is caused by abnormal electrical activity throughout the brain. Most of the time grand mal seizure is caused by epilepsy. In some cases, however, this type of seizure is triggered by other health problems, such as extremely low blood sugar, high fever or a stroke. Many people who have a grand mal seizure will never have another one. However, some people need daily anti-seizure medications to control and prevent future grand mal seizure. Grand mal seizures have two stages: The following signs and symptoms occur in some but not all people with grand mal seizures: When To See a Doctor If you see someone having a seizure: A grand mal seizure lasting more than five minutes, or immediately followed by a second seizure, should be considered a medical emergency in most people. This is also a medical emergency if the person is pregnant, injured or diabetic. Seek emergency care as quickly as possible. Additionally, seek medical advice for you or your child: Grand mal seizures occur when the electrical activity over the whole surface of the brain becomes abnormally synchronized. The brain's nerve cells normally communicate with each other by sending electrical and chemical signals across the synapses that connect the cells. In people who have seizures, the brain's usual electrical activity is altered. Exactly what causes the changes to occur remains unknown in about half the cases. However, grand mal seizures are sometimes caused by underlying health problems, such as: Injury or Infection Congenital or Developmental Abnormalities Metabolic Disturbances Withdrawal Syndromes Risk Factors For Grand Mal Seizures Include: Certain activities could be dangerous if you have a seizure while doing them. Activities include: The force of a seizure or falling as a result of a seizure can cause injury. In extreme cases, seizures can be fatal, particularly if medication is not taken consistently or properly. Types of injuries that can occur with seizures include: Repeated Seizures Whether repeated seizures can cause brain damage has been studied extensively, but there's no simple answer. The longer a seizure lasts, the more likely it is to lead to changes in brain function and structure. Repeated brief seizures also can lead to brain changes, sometimes causing a normal brain to become epileptic, a process known as kindling. The seriousness of repeated seizures underscores the need for control with medication. You're likely to start by seeing your family doctor or a general practitioner. However, you'll probably be referred to a doctor who specializes in nervous system disorders (neurologist). It's good to be prepared for your appointment. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment, and to know what to expect from your doctor. What You Can Do Also, since memory loss can happen during seizures, many times an observer is able to better describe the seizure than is the person who's had the seizure. Preparing a list of questions will help you make the most of your time with your doctor. For grand mal seizure, some basic questions to ask your doctor include: Don't hesitate to ask any other questions that occur to you. What To Expect From Your Doctor Your doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions, such as: Medical History Your doctor will ask for a detailed description of the seizure, which is crucial for diagnosis. Because people who have grand mal seizures lose consciousness and don't remember their seizures, the description needs to come from people who have witnessed the seizures. Your doctor may try to determine whether a particular trigger, such as intense exercise, loud music, flashing lights (such as those caused by video games or television) or lack of sleep, preceded your seizure. However, most people have no identifiable or consistent trigger. Neurological Exam If you've had a seizure, your doctor usually will perform a neurological exam that tests: Muscle Condition Motor Symptoms He or she may also ask questions to assess your thinking, judgment and memory. Blood Tests and Scans Blood tests may be ordered as appropriate to check for problems that could be causing or triggering the seizures. Your doctor may also suggest scans or tests designed to detect abnormalities within the brain. In some cases, your doctor may recommend video-EEG monitoring, which may require a hospital stay. This allows your doctor to compare \u2014 second by second \u2014 the behaviors observed during a seizure with your EEG pattern from exactly that same time. This comparison can help your doctor pinpoint the type of seizure disorder you have, which helps identify the most appropriate treatment options, and it can help make sure that the diagnosis of seizures is correct. During a CT scan or an MRI, you will lie on a padded table that slides into a machine. Your head will be immobilized in a brace, to improve precision while images of your brain are taken. Not everyone who has one seizure will have another one, and because a seizure can be an isolated incident, your doctor may decide to not start treatment until you've had more than one. Treatment usually involves the use of anti-seizure medications. Medications Many medications are used in the treatment of epilepsy and seizures, such as: Finding the right medication and dosage can be challenging. Your doctor likely will first prescribe a single drug at a relatively low dosage, and then increase the dosage gradually until your seizures are well-controlled. Many people with epilepsy are able to prevent seizures by taking only one drug, but others require more than one. If you've tried two or more single-drug regimens without success, your doctor may recommend trying a combination of two drugs. To achieve the best seizure control possible, take medications exactly as prescribed. Always call your doctor before adding other prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs or herbal remedies. And never stop taking your medication without talking to your doctor. Mild side effects of anti-seizure medications can include: More-troubling side effects that need to be brought to your doctor's attention immediately include: In addition, the drug Lamictal has been linked to an increased risk of aseptic meningitis, an inflammation of the protective membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord that's similar to bacterial meningitis. Pregnancy and Seizures Women who've had previous seizures usually are able to have healthy pregnancies. Birth defects related to certain medications can sometimes occur. In particular, valproic acid has been associated with cognitive deficits and neural tube defects, such as spina bifida. The American Academy of Neurology recommends that women avoid using valproic acid during pregnancy because of risks to the baby. Discuss these risks with your doctor. Because of the risk of birth defects, and because pregnancy can alter medication levels, preconception planning is particularly important for women who've had seizures. In some cases, it may be appropriate to change the dose of seizure medication before or during pregnancy. Medications may be switched in rare cases. Contraception and Anti-seizure Medications It's also important to know that some anti-seizure medications can alter the effectiveness of oral contraceptive (birth control) medication. If contraception is a high priority, check with your doctor to evaluate whether your medication interacts with your oral contraceptive, and if other forms of contraception need to be considered. If you have a seizure disorder, wear a medical bracelet to help emergency medical personnel. The bracelet should state whom to contact in an emergency, what medications you use and what drugs you're allergic to. Even after they're under control, seizures can affect your life. Grand mal seizures can be frightening to those around you. Children may get teased or be embarrassed by their condition, and both children and adults may be frustrated by living with the constant threat of another seizure. Poor self-esteem, depression and suicide are increased in people who have repeated seizures. Most states restrict those who've had seizures from driving until they've gone a long time without a seizure. Even recreational activities can be affected, because you can't do certain activities, such as swimming, alone. You may find it helpful to talk with other people who are in the same situation you are. Besides offering support, they may also have advice or tips for coping that you'd never considered. The Epilepsy Foundation has a network of support groups, as well as online forums, for teens and adults who have seizures and for parents of children who have seizures. You can reach the Epilepsy Foundation at 800-332-1000 or through its website. You can also ask your doctor if he or she knows of any support groups in your area. [Medicines Two Choices](MedicinesTwoChoices.asp) for You References Temporal Lobe Seizures Temporal lobe seizures originate in the temporal lobes of your brain, which process emotions and are important for short-term memory. Some symptoms of a temporal lobe seizure may be related to these functions, including having odd feelings \u2014 such as euphoria, deja vu or fear. During a temporal lobe seizure, you may remain aware of what's happening. During more-intense seizures, you might look awake but be unresponsive. Your lips and hands may make purposeless, repetitive movements. Temporal lobe seizures may stem from an anatomical defect or scar in your temporal lobe, but the cause is often unknown. Temporal lobe seizures are treated with medication. For some people who don't respond to medication, surgery may be an option. An unusual sensation (aura) may precede a temporal lobe seizure, acting as a warning. Not everyone who has temporal lobe seizures has auras, and not everyone who has auras remembers them. The aura is actually a simple partial or focal seizure \u2014 one that doesn't impair consciousness. Examples of auras include: Sometimes temporal lobe seizures impair your ability to respond to others (partial complex or focal dyscognitive seizures). This type of temporal lobe seizure usually lasts 30 seconds to two minutes. Characteristic signs and symptoms include: After a temporal lobe seizure, you may have: In extreme cases, what starts as a temporal lobe seizure evolves into a generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure \u2014 featuring convulsions and loss of consciousness. When To See a Doctor Seek medical advice in these circumstances: Seek emergency medical care if: Often, the cause of temporal lobe seizures remains unknown. However, they can be a result of a number of factors, including: During normal waking and sleeping, your brain cells produce varying electrical activity. If the electrical activity in many brain cells becomes abnormally synchronized, a convulsion or seizure may occur. If this happens in just one area of the brain, the result is a focal seizure. A temporal lobe seizure is a partial seizure that originates in one of the temporal lobes. Over time, repeated temporal lobe seizures can cause the part of the brain that's responsible for learning and memory (hippocampus) to shrink. Brain cell loss in this area may cause memory problems. You'll likely start by seeing your family doctor or a general practitioner, then you'll likely be referred to a doctor who specializes in nervous system disorders (neurologist). Here's some information to help you prepare for your appointment. What You Can Do Preparing a list of questions for your doctor will help you make the most of your time together. For temporal lobe seizure, some questions to ask include: Don't hesitate to ask any other questions. What to Expect From Your Doctor Your doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions, such as: Medical History Your doctor will need a detailed description of the seizures, preferably from a witness, because most people who have temporal lobe seizures don't remember the episodes. Neurological exam If you or your child has had a seizure, your doctor likely will perform a neurological exam that tests: He or she may also ask questions to assess your thinking, judgment and memory. Blood Tests and Scans Blood tests may be ordered to check for problems that could be causing or triggering the seizures. Your doctor may also suggest scans or tests designed to detect abnormalities within the brain. In some cases, your doctor may recommend video-EEG monitoring in the hospital. This allows your doctor to compare \u2014 second by second \u2014 the behaviors observed during a seizure with your EEG pattern. This can help your doctor pinpoint the type of seizure disorder you have, which helps to identify appropriate treatments, and can help ensure that the seizure diagnosis is correct. During the test, you will lie on a padded table that slides into the MRI machine. Your head will be immobilized in a brace, to improve precision. The test is painless, but some people experience claustrophobia inside the MRI machine's close quarters. If you think you may have this reaction, tell your doctor before the study. The scans are then compared to find the area of the brain with the greatest activity during the seizure. The resulting image is then superimposed onto the MRI. This is used with EEG information to help guide the surgeons. Medications Numerous medications are available to treat temporal lobe seizures. However, many people don't achieve seizure control with medications alone, and side effects, including fatigue, weight gain and dizziness, are common. Discuss possible side effects with your doctor when deciding about treatment options. Also ask what effect your seizure medications and other medications you take, such as oral contraceptives, may have on each other. Surgery If you have temporal lobe seizures that don't respond to medication, you may be evaluated for surgery. For some people, surgery eliminates or greatly reduces the number of seizures. However, as with any surgery, surgery for seizures carries risks. It may not be successful, and it can result in neurological problems. Discuss the possible risks with your neurologist and surgeon. Surgery is generally not an option if: Preparing for surgery Talk to your surgeon about his or her experience, success rates and complication rates with the procedure you're considering. You may also want to request a second opinion before having surgery. Before surgery, you'll need: After Surgery Most people need to continue taking medication to help ensure that seizures don't recur. However, if surgery appears successful, medications can sometimes be reduced and occasionally discontinued. Vagus Nerve Stimulation A device called a vagus nerve stimulator may be an option if medications are ineffective or cause serious side effects. The stimulator is implanted into your chest under the collarbone. Wires from the stimulator are attached to the vagus nerve in your neck. The device turns on and off according to an adjustable program and can be activated with a magnet. The device doesn't detect seizures. It's usually well-tolerated, but it's not a replacement for medication. Responsive Neurostimulation The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a device for treating seizures that don't respond to medication. The device detects seizure activity and delivers an electrical stimulation to the detected area. The device is implanted on the surface of the brain or within the brain tissue, and attached to a battery-powered generator, which is implanted in the skull, close to the brain. Deep Brain Stimulation Deep brain stimulation involves implanting electrodes into a part of the brain called the thalamus. This treatment is not currently FDA-approved for treatment of seizures. In highly selected cases, it may be beneficial in treating seizures that don't respond to medication. More study is needed. Pregnancy and Seizures The most important thing to remember is to plan pregnancy. Women who are on medications for seizures usually are able to have healthy pregnancies. However, certain medications, such as valproic acid (Depakene), taken during pregnancy are known to increase the risk of birth defects. Seizures pose a risk to a developing baby, so it's generally not recommended to stop medications during pregnancy. Discuss these risks with your doctor. Because pregnancy can alter medication levels, preconception planning is particularly important for women with seizures. If you take medication for seizures and might become pregnant, taking prescription folic acid daily before you become pregnant can help prevent birth defects related to seizure medication. The risk of birth defects is considered to be higher in women taking more than one drug. If your seizures can't be well-controlled with other medication, discuss the potential risks with your doctor. Contraception and Anti-seizure Medications Some anti-seizure medications can alter the effectiveness of oral contraceptive (birth control) medication. If contraception is a high priority, check with your doctor to evaluate whether your medication interacts with your oral contraceptive, and if you should consider other forms of contraception. Certain activities can be dangerous if you have a seizure while doing them. Activities include: Consider wearing a medical alert bracelet to help emergency medical personnel. The bracelet should state whom to contact in an emergency, what medications you use and your medication allergies. Even after they're under control, seizures can affect your life. Temporal lobe seizures may present even more of a coping challenge because people may not recognize the unusual behavior as a seizure. Children may get teased or be embarrassed by their condition, and living with the constant threat of another seizure may frustrate children and adults. You may find it helpful to talk with others in similar situations. Besides offering support, they may have advice or tips for coping you haven't thought of. The Epilepsy Foundation has a network of support groups, as well as online forums for teens and adults who have seizures and for parents of children who have seizures. You can reach the foundation at 800-332-1000 or visit the foundation website. You can also ask your doctor if he or she knows of any support groups in your area. [Medicines Two Choices](MedicinesTwoChoices.asp) for You References Seizures, from an Alternative Medicine Perspective are looked at completely different. Information that Dr. Huntoon learned early on in his career from one of his mentors demonstrated that seizures and seizure disorders were due to a brain imbalance resulting from poor communication and nutritional reserves within the Cerebellum and the Cerebrum. He was taught that the Cerebellum was the battery of the brain and that it holds electricity for the body in reserve so it is available on demand. When a person has seizures, it is due to the cerebellum being low in stored energy. As a result, the electricity of the brain shorts out and the person will have seizures of any type. Some of the specific nutrition that has demonstrated a huge reduction and even elimination of seizures is a supplement called RNA-Ribonucleic Acid. Given at a large dosage, this supplement acts as a computer chip to the brain and helps to regulate the electrical capacity of the brain. It helps to retain memory and it is also an electrolyte that helps the brain hold its charge. Appreciate that if your car was running out of gas, before the car would stop altogether, the engine would \"sputter\" and \"hesitate\" causing the car to \"buck\" until the fuel was completely empty. The brain, when it is running out of fuel will do the same thing. The result is a seizure. We also want to add a second supplement, either Min-Tran or MinChex, depending on the specifics of the person. Min-Tran is a supplement that supplies minerals to the brain and helps to create a general calming effect on the functioning of the brain. Working with a [Holistic Chiropractor](holistic-chiropractor.asp) who understands this and has experience helping people lead a normal life without seizures is important. Dr. Huntoon has helped practice members in the past go from having 14 seizures a day while on their medication to having one seizure every 2 - 3 weeks using nutrition alone.
