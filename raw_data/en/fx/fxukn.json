Presentation Title 18Case presentation Last time she had her bowel looked at was an ileoscopy in 2011 with very mild inflammation Hospital: Fecal calprotectin (stool inflammation test) recommended 405 (normal < 150) Due to hesitancy to undergo procedure, and partner's medical issues, ileoscopy was done 11 months later -Inflammation with ulcers in the ileum, consistent with active Crohn's disease of the ileum Presentation Title 19Demographics, Diagnosis, & PrognosisImage from Ha, et al. CGH 2010 20Demographics Elderly defined as > age 60 1/160 elderly people have IBD (new diagnoses, and aging IBD population) Bimodal distribution of IBD diagnoses ~15% of new IBD diagnoses are made in the elderly Elderly patients comprise very small portion of clinical trials subjects or pharmcovigilance dataImage from Ananthakrishnan, AGA Clinical Practice Update on Management of IBD in Elderly Patients, Gastroenterology , 2021. 21Diagnosis of IBD in elderly Elderly less likely to have IBD: -Colorectal cancer -Ischemic colitis (lack of blood flow) -Diverticulitis -Ibuprofen changes -Radiation colitis (from prior cancer therapy) -Microscopic colitis 22Diagnosis of IBD in elderly Procedures and anesthesia carry more risk in elderly Diagnostic tests: blood count, stool test for infection, fecal calprotectin to confirm inflammation CT scan to rule out other diagnosis Colonoscopy only if other tests make IBD likely, or the diagnosis is not made by the other tests Image from Ananthakrishnan, AGA Clinical Practice Update on Management of IBD in Elderly Patients, Gastroenterology , 2021.Ananthakrishnan et al, JCC 2016 23Expected course of disease Elderly (> 50) with new onset IBD are more likely to have... Only the colon involved in Crohn's Disease (44%) -Elderly less likely to have perianal Crohn's, abscess, fistula Left sided ulcerative colitis (rather than whole colon) (40%) Less severe Better outcomes suggested by some studies, but not all -Fewer older onset IBD given biologic drugs -Similar need for surgery for CD, more UC pts had surgery Manosa et al, AP&T 2018 24Expected course of disease Elderly (> 60) with new onset IBD are... More likely to have stricture pattern for Crohn's (24 vs 13%) Less likely to use steroids, advanced drugs like anti -TNF More hospitalization (66 vs 49%) More cancers (14 vs 0.5%) More surgery for UC (8.3 vs 5.1%) -?due to less medication use More important to consider individual disease rather than trends when determining management strategies Presentation Title 25Management26Management of IBD in elderly General principles Image from Ananthakrishnan, AGA Clinical Practice Update on Management of IBD in Elderly Patients, Gastroenterology , 2021.Kochar , et al. 2020 27Management of IBD in elderly General principles Multidisciplinary - involve all providers At risk for polypharmacy -complication from large number of medications More medical illnesses Depression and mental health Physical and cognitive function -Treatment- related complications -May need help making and getting to appointments and taking medications -Nutrition and physical therapy interventions -Pre-treatment physical decline (frailty) associated with risk of infections with anti - TNF medications, surgery 19% frail vs 9% fit developed infection Clinical Response Clinical Remission Deep remissionGoal Clinical Parameters Improved symptoms No symptoms Normal labs Mucosal healingOutcomes Improved QoL Modified from Panaccione R. Presented at: European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) Fifth Annual Congress. Prague, Czech Republic; February 2010Goals of Therapy for IBD: Sustained Deep RemissionPresentation Title 29Management of IBD in elderly General principles Similar principle to choosing medication as in younger patients -Age does not change how well drugs work Exception: -More safety concerns -Higher risk of other medical problems that can increase side effects Very little safety data -May have a harder time giving injections to self Therapy should not be delayed or steroid therapy prolonged out of concerns for treatment -associated risksUngaro, RC. DDW May 2020, Abstract Su1966 et al. DDW May 2020, Abstract Su1961 AGA Guidelines on Moderate to severe UC in adult outpatients. Gastroenterology , 2020. 30General Principles More recent data suggest improved outcomes with early, aggressive treatment with achievement of remission Early biologic users and those with mild disease had less hospitalizations and ER visits Biologic use associated with declining resection rates (UC OR 0.8 and CD OR 0.7) 2020 AGA UC Guidelines suggest using biologic agents early rather than gradual step upYoung (Age < 40) Pan-colitis Deep ulcers H/o hospitalization Steroid dependent High CRP C. diff or CMV infectionPresentation Title 31Management of elderly Medication summary Anti-TNF (IFX, ADA, GOL, CZA) IV and SQ options Fastest onset Most data High immunogenicity Good for systemic involvement Infection, lymphoma risk, skin CAJAK-inhibitor -tofacitinib Oral drug, not a biologic Rapid onset -as early as 3 days Newest novel FDA approved therapy Joint involvement Safety concerns: Shingles, NMSC, VTE Black Box warning for VTE Contraindicated in pregnancy Anti-integrin -vedolizumab IV (SQ coming) Slowest onset (up to 6 months) Low immunogenicity Gut selective, good safety profile Not good for systemic involvementAnti-IL 12/23 -ustekinumab IV x 1, then SQ Q8 wks A little slower onset than anti -TNF Better for anti -TNF failure Low immunogenicity Good safety profile Good for skin involvement S1P1 -Ozanimod -Oral -No immunogenicity -Approved for UC, Multiple Sclerosis -Requires safety monitoring -Works best for moderate severityPresentation Title 32Management of IBD in elderly Pharmacologic considerations Presentation Title 33Management of IBD in elderly Pharmacologic considerations 34Safety Title 35SurgeryPresentation Title 36Surgical considerations Complications after surgery also higher (34.5% vs 21.3%) -Risk of death -Infection, blood clot, bleeding, heart, kidney, neurologic -Emergency surgery associated with higher risk of death -Hospital stays > 30 days more likely (5% vs 1.8%) Presentation Title 37Surgical considerations No difference in complications for pouch surgery in elderly and frail UC patients except longer hospital stay -2493 UC patients -Complications: 79.5% (age < 50) vs 79.1% (age > 60) -0.8 days longer hospital stay for those > age 60 -Frailty diagnosis did not change outcomes Presentation Title 38Surgical considerations May have worse functional outcomes with pouch surgery -Age is associated with increased chance to get end ileostomy -But end ileostomy chances are decreasing in 61- 70 age group Consider conditions associated with poor pouch function: -Obesity, pelvic radiation, anal sphincter damage or dysfunction Nutrition evaluation prior to surgery May need blood clot prevention around surgery time Stoma management -may have harder time managing, but studies show elderly adjust better to the stoma than younger Presentation Title 39Healthcare maintenancePresentation Title 40Healthcare maintenance Higher risk for vaccine preventable diseases -Shingles, Flu, pneumonia -Low rate of appropriate vaccines IBD pt'soften don't have a primary doctor, even elderly IBD patients Ensure age-appropriate cancer screening, with special attention to skin cancer IBD in the colon > 8 years leads to 2x risk of colorectal cancer Presentation Title 41Colorectal cancer screening Elderly onset IBD not associated with increased risk Patients diagnosed at older age may be diagnosed with colon cancer sooner after IBD diagnosis than younger patients Risk of missed colon cancer among older IBD 3x > non-IBD Patients age > 65, and > 80 have increasing risk of adverse events from colonoscopy Screening program using colonoscopy should only be used in those who will get benefits based on life expectancy, and are healthy enough to undergo colon surgery if pre-cancer or cancer is foundPresentation Title 42Summary Treating elderly with IBD involves careful risk and benefit assessments Involving all doctors in decision making is of utmost importance Elderly pts more likely to have alternate diagnosis than IBD Colonoscopy is riskier in elderly patients Management guided by same principles, but must consider increased risk of side effects from drugs Must review healthcare maintenance topics, particularly vaccine preventable illnesses, cancer screenings/surveillancePresentation Title 43Thanks!ECCO Guidelines on IBD and Elderly, JCC 2017 44Drug withdrawal No studies on withdrawal of medications specifically in the elderly More recent studies of med withdrawal in a mixed population: Age did not predict recurrence of inflammation Age not associated with need for surgery after drug withdrawal In patients taking both infliximab and azathioprine, age did not predict failure of infliximab if azathioprine stoppedPresentation Title 45Management of elderly IBD report of with first Entyvio, then stelara, then reduced EF, -Review general principles, highlighting comprehensive review of goals and risk factors for treatment; collaborative approach with patient and PCPPresentation Title 47-Highlight that many of the factors associated with risk in younger patients are the same -Budesonide, vs early biologic therapy; prefer not systemic steroid -Lower risk biologics, balance with likelihood of remissioon . Increased risk of VTE, fracture, infection, malignancy cardiac, zoster. Highlight any studies with risk factor profiles -Balance 6MP IMM with risk oofmalignancy, slow onset -Greater comorbidity burden, need to optimize -Surgery consideration; highlight any studies on surgery and elderly; particularly J pouch abnormalitiesPresentation Title 48HCM -Vaccine schedule -Colorectal cancer surveillance -when to stop "}
