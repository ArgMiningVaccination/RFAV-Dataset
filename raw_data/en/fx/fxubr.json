A group of yogis om-ing their way through sun salutations? Or you, during your first (and last) attempt, trying to resist the urge to open your eyes? No doubt, how to meditate can feel a lot more complicated than shutting your eyes and focusing on your breath. Benefits of meditation and why you should get involved Ultimately, none of the above scenarios are wrong. Because, when it comes to how to meditate, there's no one way that fits all. So, if you've found yourself struggling your way through meditation in the past, it could simply be that you hadn't landed on the right method for you. There are many wellness arguments for why you should find out how to meditate, once and for all: - According to research published in the [Journal of Health Psychology](http://thesportjournal.org/article/how-mindfulness-training-may-mediate-stress-performance-and-burnout/), athletes who meditate are not only more motivated to exercise on a regular basis; they're more satisfied with their fitness gains, too. - Research by the [American Academy of Sleep Medicine](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090609072719.htm)found that meditation can be an effective treatment for those of you regularly wondering [how to get to sleep](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/health/sleep/8020/how-to-get-to-sleep/)and suffering from insomnia. - The [American Heart Association](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/11/121113161504.htm)found that twice-daily meditation can reduce your risk of heart attack, stroke and even death. - Meditation improves brain function and energy levels, says researchers from the [University of Waterloo](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170906103416.htm). The research goes on. And with an ever-increasing number you asking yourself, ' [am I depressed](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/health/symptom-checker/899/am-i-depressed/)?' and meditation being associated with reduced symptoms of depression, when it comes to your mental health gains, finding time to be mindful gets a big tick, too. But how to meditate if you're a complete beginner or haven't got on well with it before? We asked meditation teacher [Emma Mill](http://www.emmamillslondon.com/)s to show how easy it is for anyone and everyone to incorporate mindfulness into their day. Get ready to be transformed. What is meditation? Let's just say it takes many forms: yoga, mantra meditation - even enjoying some quiet time in the bath; these are all valid options for those of you wondering how to meditate. 'The essence of meditation is connecting,' says Mills. 'Connecting with yourself and your own sense of awareness. The different types of meditation are all avenues back to this same place. 'So, if one method doesn't work for you, there will likely be another one that will. Many people struggle to get a sense of being in touch with themselves because their mind is preoccupied by the thoughts and sensations vying for their attention. But learning to overcome that and taking the time to get to know yourself, is a fun and important thing.' And, of course, meditation is free. You don't need any expensive kit - that's right, a meditation cushion, chakra spray and scented candles are not a must - and you can do it pretty much anywhere you want. 'You might want to sit down formally for 5-10 minutes, or incorporate shorter periods into your whole day,' says Mills. 'As with Pilates, where you learn to regularly check in with your body and adjust your posture; so, with meditation, over time, it will become second nature to spot when your mind is behaving in a certain way and bring it back to the present again.' Which means? Over time - Mills says you should notice positive results after the first couple of weeks of starting to meditate - you'll feel calmer, feel that you have more time in your day, and those feelings of stress that are often exacerbated by the thinking process, will be have lightened. Ready to get started? How to meditate for beginners: your 5 step guide 1/ Choose your spot This could be sitting on a yoga mat or a cushion or in a chair, standing in line at the Post Office... you get the picture; it can pretty much be anywhere. According to Mills, you want to be straight - so sitting or standing upright - to maximise on your deep breathing and to prevent physical strain. 'You want to be relaxed and alert, at the same time,' she says. And then? 'Start taking easy, natural breaths, gradually working up to an inhale of seven and an exhale of 11. Notice as the activity in your mind starts to settle.' 2/ Don't expect immediate results You know the saying: all good things come to those who wait. Well, the same is true in terms of how to meditate. Don't be disheartened if you don't feel results after your first session, or if you can't get the hang of letting all your worries drift away. Instead, says Mills, approach it with an eagerness to learn. 'It sounds simple to say 'close your eyes and clear your mind',' says Mills. 'But in reality, the act of meditation can take a while. There won't be sparkly lights and you might wonder if you're doing it right. 'Stay curious and focus on learning new things about yourself. For example, one day you might notice your breathing feel slightly different, or your thoughts might linger for longer. Meditation is about learning who you are and everything you experience is part of that process.' 3/ Find shapes in the clouds Distractions really getting in the way of your practice? Mills suggests picturing yourself watching clouds. 'Imagine you are sitting looking up at a big blue sky,' she says. 'All of your thoughts, plus any of those sounds, smells, or belly gurglings that randomly pop up are clouds. Watch them as they gently drift by. Don't try to get rid of them - or you will get embroiled in them. Just let them come and go in and out of your awareness. This idea of detached watching is where your meditation practice starts.' 4/ Notice your mind's habits Once you've got your detached watching down to a fine art, it's time to take your meditation to the next level. 'You might start to notice patterns with your thoughts,' says Mills. 'Perhaps they come again and again in a loop and, when you tend to them, another concern takes its place. Now, because you have this insight, the next time your mind begins to follow that loop, you can start to reduce the amount of time that you're taken along with it. Insight into your mental process can be very helpful.' 5/ Follow your own thread Meditation is a very personal process, which is why it's important to explore what works best for you. You can find guided meditation podcasts, apps such as Headspace are popular, classes, books such as Mills' own [Inhale. Exhale. Repeat](https://emma-mills-london.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/inhale-exhale-repeat), and, one-to-one tuition. 'The key is to remember that meditation shouldn't feel like a chore,' says Mills. 'If, one day, you don't feel like doing it, don't. Meditation is better done out of interest and enthusiasm than force.' How to meditate when you don't have time Got all that but still have your doubts? We hear you. You've barely got time to meet work deadlines, manage your home-life and squeeze in an [at-home 15-minute youtube workout](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/fitness/find-a-workout/6243/best-15-minute-at-home-youtube-workouts/), let alone to sit down for some solo zen. But, when it comes to enjoying the benefits of meditation, even if you've only got snatched minutes to spare, those moments can, surprisingly, be enough. Basically, what we're saying is yes, you could do your meditation while making yourself a cup of tea. How to meditate in the morning This is probably one of the safest times of day to meditate. Why? Because once it's done; it's done. No excuses of being too tired or having surprise meetings get in the way. Set your alarm five minutes or so earlier than usual, roll out of bed and you're good to go. 'Sit down on the floor or in a chair, with a straight back (to improve your posture and breathing) and close your eyes,' says Mills. 'Take ten deep breaths - breathing in for a count of seven, and out for a count of 11. Check in with how you feel and watch as your mind begins to settle. 'If you have to get to work, set an alarm for a fixed time - five minutes is a good place to start - so you can meditate until then without worry. But only practise for as long as is enjoyable or interesting for you; if you finish before your alarm goes off, that's fine.' How to meditate on your commute Take some time away from your Instagram feed or the [best health podcasts](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/health/symptom-checker/7989/best-health-podcasts/) on your journey into work and instead focus on how to meditate. 'When you take the same route every day, your mind switches off, meaning it could drift to other things such as stresses over work,' says Mills. 'Instead, make a conscious decision to explore being present with your surroundings - you might discover something new and inspiring. 'If you are worried, distract your mind by actively engaging it in a task such as seeking out a particular colour or smell on your commute. It is also good, though, to sometimes to free it from being busy and to leave it entirely open to discover what life has to offer.' How to meditate, at your desk 'Feel your breathing happening and be aware of the process in front of you unfolding - the kettle beginning to bubble and boil, for example,' says Mills. 'Be in the moment of that current specific experience, rather than frantically trying to multi-task many other things.' How to meditate before bed This is great for those of you who are [constantly tired](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/health/sleep/8032/constantly-tired/) to struggle with [how to get to sleep](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/health/sleep/8020/how-to-get-to-sleep/). Why? It can be done lying bed and, according to Mills, it's what helps her drift off every night. 'Picture yourself getting up that morning and follow this vision of yourself going through the everything you did during the day - from waking to getting dressed to eating breakfast to going to work and so on,' says Mills. 'In this activity, you are giving your mind a job so it can't focus on other things such as stresses or worries. 'I don't often get to the end of the sequence because I fall asleep. It's a lovely way to end the day - while also improving memory.' On board with the idea? Then you'll want to know about "}
