Most of them are alarmist, with headlines like \"Dangerous Dietary Supplements Return to Store Shelves\" and \"Danger Lurking in Some Supplements. \" The majority of reports usually involve a small group of unscrupulous manufacturers that have been caught selling adulterated products (often weight loss, bodybuilding, or sexual enhancement blends sold online or in convenience stores), and ignore the millions of safe dietary supplements taken by more than 150 million people each year without incident. Too many of these news stories are wrongly stating that there is no regulatory oversight in the dietary supplement industry. This is simply not true. From the FDA 's own website: \"FDA regulates both finished dietary supplement products and dietary ingredients. \" The large majority of supplement manufacturers are companies with integrity who are producing safe products that have become an integral part of self-care for millions of people. There are bad players in every industry, but overall, supplements have an overwhelmingly safe track record. And yes, they are regulated.The War on Supplements In 1994, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, or DSHEA, gave the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory oversight over the dietary supplement industry. DSHEA has a clear set of regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of dietary supplements, including vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and herbs and other botanicals. The act defines permitted label claims (no supplement may claim to treat, prevent, mitigate, or cure any disease) and grants the FDA the authority to regulate those claims. The FDA is responsible for taking action against any adulterated or misbranded dietary supplement product after it reaches the market. Additionally, DSHEA holds supplement manufacturers to \"good manufacturing practices, \" which are industry standards for maintaining product quality and safety. Further, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) maintains authority over supplement advertising: Manufacturers must report truthfully what their products contain and must have proof backing up any claims they make.

This is good news for the 30 million American men who suffer from erectile dysfunction, or ED. And because 70 percent of ED cases are physiological in nature (it's not just in your head) and often a sign of some other serious health issue, it is wise to address and correct the underlying physical imbalances that are hindering performance in the first place, ensuring both short-term happiness and long-term health. By far the most common cause of ED is vascular dysfunction. When the arteries that supply the penis with blood to achieve and maintain an erection are blocked or hardened, or the lining of these arteries are damaged, blood flow is reduced. Vascular dysfunction BeYonD Natural Solutions for Men's Sexual Healthnot only affects the small arteries of the penis, but the larger coronary arteries of the heart too. Astute doctors now recognize that ED may actually be an early warning sign of impending cardiovascular disease, showing up several to years before a cardiovascular event like a heart attack or stroke. To maintain healthy vascular function, and in turn, normal erectile function, consider these supplements: L-arginine is an amino acid that is necessary for the lining of the blood vessels to produce nitric oxide. Nitric oxide allows the blood vessels to relax, thus improving blood flow throughout the body, including to the penis. Studies on L-arginine and erectile dysfunction have used between 2,000- 5,000 mg a day in divided doses. Supplemental arginine is best taken on an empty stomach. L-citrulline is an amino acid that the body can convert to arginine and then to nitric oxide to improve blood flow. It may be more readily usable by the body than arginine and in one small study, men with ED saw improvements after taking 1,500 mg a day for one month. Pycnogenol\u00ae is a potent antioxidant that stimulates the enzyme needed to convert arginine to nitric oxide.It also helps to protect the arteries from oxidative damage that can lead to ED. In Stop Prediabetes Now, Jack Challem recommends 100 mg two times daily to support healthy erectile function. Vitamin C and bioflavonoids both help to protect the arteries from damage and vitamin C enhances the bioactivity of arginine. Look for vitamin C with a measurable amount of bioflavonoids listed on the label. Try 500 to 1,000 mg a day. Another potential cause of ED is prediabetes and diabetes\u201435-50 percent of men with diabetes also have ED. Chronically elevated blood sugar damages the arteries (there's the vascular connection again) and nerves, including those that stimulate the penis. Prediabetes and diabetes are also generally accompanied by excess weight, especially around the mid-section. These excess fat cells convert testosterone into estrogen, negatively altering the testosterone to estrogen ratio. This excess estrogen, independent of prediabetes and diabetes, interferes with the hormonal cascade necessary to produce and maintain an erection. Although many men may reach for a testosterone booster, a more effective means is to improve the body's metabolism and elimination of estrogen and to lose excess weight around the middle. To support healthy blood sugar balance and estrogen metabolism try: Pycnogenol\u00ae supports healthy blood sugar levels by inhibiting the activity of the enzyme that breaks down sugar and carbohydrates during digestion. It also protects nerves from oxidative damage caused by high blood sugar. Alpha-lipoic acid is an antioxidant that supports healthy blood sugar levels and insulin function. It is also well- recognized for its ability to improve neuropathy (nerve damage) associated with diabetes. The suggested dose of alpha-lipoic acid is 100 mg three times daily, before meals. Lignans and flavonoids such as those found in flax seeds, sesame seeds, veggies, fruits, and green tea may help to block the conversion of testosterone to estrogen thus improving overall testosterone availability. Aim to get a variety of these foods regularly in the diet. Diindolylmethane (DIM), or its precursor Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), helps to metabolize estrogen in the male body, ridding the body of excess estrogen and restoring healthy testosterone levels. The typical dose for men is 200 to 400 mg per day, taken with food. Another common cause of ED for many men is stress. When the body is under stress\u2014either mental or physical\u2014the sympathetic nervous system kicks in, releasing a cascade of stress hormones. Chronic stress leads to elevated levels of these hormones, which can lead to weight gain around the middle, and remember, those excess fat cells convert testosterone to estrogen. Stress also reduces sexual drive and leaves very little physical energy for sex. If chronic stress is a problem, try these supplements: B-vitamin complex helps to support normal energy production and is also essential for supporting the normal functioning of the body during times of stress. Stress quickly depletes the body's reserves of the B vitamins. Look for a B-complex containing 20-50 mg of vitamins B1, B2, and B3. The other B vitamins should be included in their relative proportions. Adaptogenic herbs such as ginseng, holy basil, and rhodiola help bring balance to the body during times of stress. As an added bonus, ginseng, especially Panax ginseng, is traditionally used to improve sexual desire and function. Follow manufacturer's directions for individual adaptogens. While ED may seem like a monumental problem on its own, it is usually a sign of a bigger health issue. It is important to isolate and address underlying issues and support overall health by cleaning up your diet, maintaining healthy blood sugar balance, quitting smoking, regularly moving your body, and managing stress appropriately. Along with these healthy lifestyle changes, a carefully chosen natural supplement routine can offer additional support so you can regain your vitality and get on with enjoying your life.

They are created in the body when excess blood glucose (sugar) binds to proteins, damaging bodily tissues and cells via inflammation and oxidation. They play a major role in the development or worsening of diseases normally associated with aging such as type- 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and cardiovascular disease. ALA has been shown to significantly improve insulin function, reducing blood glucose levels by 10 to 30 percent, effectively reducing AGEs. The mitochondrial theory of aging is widely accepted among researchers to be another significant factor in the aging process. The mitochondria are the energy powerhouses of every cell in the body, and as we age, so do our mitochondria. Accumulated oxidative damage to the mitochondria leads to decreased cellular energy production and eventual cell death. ALA is known as a \"mitochondrial nutrient\" because it has been shown to protect mitochondria from oxidative damage and improve mitochondrial structure and function, including optimizing energy production. As a bonus, ALA protects other antioxidants such as vitamins C and E from oxidative damage and increases cellular levels of glutathione, the body's \"master\" antioxidant. For general use as an antioxidant, 40-100 mg a day is recommended; studies have used 300 mg daily to improve insulin sensitivity. Aging is an inevitable part of life, but to some extent how well you age is in your control. ALA can be an effective nutrient to help you age with health and grace. References available upon request. Alpha Lipoic AcidAnTioxidAn T forThe AGeS10 By Liz Mueller W e all know the phrase \"age is just a number, \" and while this may be true, the fact is that our bodies do age, and how that age expresses in each of us can vary greatly. The storied fountain of youth may not exist, but if there was ever a supplement that came close, it may just be alpha-lipoic acid (ALA). Also known as the \"universal antioxidant, \" ALA is a powerful nutrient that can slow down the inevitable aging process at the cellular level, helping to protect and revitalize your body, no matter what your \"number\" happens to be. So what makes ALA such a valuable antioxidant? Most antioxidants are either water-soluble or fat-soluble, acting exclusively on either the fatty cell membrane or the aqueous interior of the cell; ALA has the distinction of being both water- and fat-soluble so it can provide complete protection from oxidative damage (thus, the nickname \"universal antioxidant\"). And oxidative damage is one of the major biological factors that age us.Bluebonnet\u00aeEye Antioxidant Ubiquinol 50 mgNatural Grocers\u00ae Vega\u00ae *These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.

In fact, when you buy your produce from Natural Grocers, you will never have to worry about GMOs or chemical pesticide residues on your produce because we only sell USDA certified organic produce. Never genetically modified, never conventional. Conventional produce can carry a number of pesticide residues, and while the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets safety limits for individual pesticides, they don't consider the cumulative effects of combined pesticides on human health. The most recent data available from the USDA's Pesticide Data Program found 17 different pesticide residues on nectarines; 19 residues on celery; and 25 residues on peaches. Broccoli, green beans, and nectarines had residues that exceeded EPA safe limits. Choosing to only sell organic produce was one of our earliest business decisions, one that we like to think has supported the growth of organic growing methods and organic farmers over the years, and has given our customers the freedom to shop for the best and healthiest produce without worry.

Resveratrol has attracted considerable attention because it increases the activity of the SIRT1 gene, which is associated with greater longevity. In the latest study, Ali Movahed, MD, of the University of Medical Sciences, Bushehr, Iran, and Canadian colleagues gave 66 people with type-2 diabetes either 500 mg of resveratrol twice daily or placebos for 45 days. All of the subjects were also taking drugs to lower blood sugar levels.The results were nothing short of dramatic. Fasting blood sugar levels decreased from an average of 175 mg/dl to 140 mg/dl, and fasting insulin levels declined by about half. Furthermore, HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) decreased from 8.6% to 7.6%. In addition, people taking resveratrol had their insulin resistance lessen, and their high- density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased. In contrast, people taking placebos had a slight increase in their fasting blood sugar and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. In a similar study, Moola Joghee PhD, of JSS University's College of Pharmacy, Tamil Nadu, India, asked 57 people to take one-fourth the dose of resveratrol\u2014just 250 mg\u2014daily for six months. All of these patients were also taking medications to lower blood sugar levels. Patients taking resveratrol had significant reductions in body weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Blood sugar and HbA1c levels decreased slightly. In a separate study, Ahmad Esmaillzadeh, PhD, of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Iran, and his colleagues used vitamin D or placebos to treat 54 women with gestational diabetes. Women in the vitamin D group received 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 at the beginning of the study and again at day 21. Blood samples were taken and analyzed at the beginning of the study and at six weeks. Women who received vitamin D had their fasting blood sugar levels decrease by an average of 17 mg/dL (compared with 0.9 in the placebo group), and their fasting insulin level declined by 3 IU/mL (compared with 1.3 in the placebo group). In addition, the vitamin D supplements led to about an 11 percent decrease in total and LDL cholesterol levels. References: Movahed A. Nabipour I, Louis XL, et al.

Turmeric compounds may help in cancer Numerous studies have focused on the anti-cancer effects of curcuminoids, a group of compounds found in turmeric root. The dried and ground up root is a common spice in Southeast Asia. In a recent review article, researchers from the MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, discussed the bioactive effects of other compounds found in turmeric root. These other compounds, called curcumin-free turmeric have anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and anti- diabetic properties. One of them, elemene, is being used in China as an adjunct treatment of cancer. Some of the other compounds include turmerin, turmerone, and furanodiene. Aggarwal BB.

The effects of lowering homocysteine have been mixed in cardiovascular studies, but the benefits in stroke reduction have been more consistent. In the latest study, Yuming Xu, MD, of the Medical College of Zheng Zhou University, China, and his colleagues analyzed data from 14 controlled clinical trials that included a total of 54,913 people. All of the studies had compared B-vitamin supplements with either placebos or very low dose B-vitamin supplements. Xu's analysis found that, after three years of follow up, the use of B-vitamin supplements reduced the risk of stroke by 7 percent. Reference: Ji Y , Tan S, Xu Y , et al.

Multivitamins Might Help Some Women Survive Breast Cancer Women who have been diagnosed with, and treated for, invasive breast cancer have better odds of surviving if they happen to take multivitamin/multi-mineral supplements. Sylvia Wassertheil-Smoller, PhD, of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, along with colleagues at 10 other medical centers studied 7,728 post menopausal women from across the United States. All of the women had previously been treated for invasive breast cancer. Thirty-eight percent of the women were taking multivitamin/multi-mineral supplements, and the vast majority of them were taking the supplements before their diagnosis. After an average of seven years follow up, women taking the supplements were 30 percent less likely to die from breast cancer. Reference: Wassertheil-Smoller S, McGinn AP, Budrys N, et al.

Omega-3 Supplements Might Slow Cellular Aging in Seniors Telomeres are the protective tips of chromosomes (which contain our genetic data), and their excessive shortening can lead to genetic instability, accelerated aging, and cognitive decline. But supplemental omega-3 fish oils might slow the age-related deterioration of telomeres. Nathan O'Callaghan, PhD, of Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), and colleagues from other institutions studied 33 men and women 65 years of age and older. All had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, a prelude to Alzheimer's disease. The subjects were given one of three different supplements each day for six months: (1) 1,670 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 160 mg of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), (2) 1,550 mg of DHA and 400 mg of EPA, or (3) 2,200 mg of linoleic acid, an omega-6 fat found in corn and soybean oils. The researchers reported a trend toward telomere shortening in all three groups. However, telomere shortening was greatest in the linoleic acid group. Furthermore, high blood levels of DHA were associated with the least telomere shortening in the group taking large amounts of that omega-3. Reference: O'Callaghan N, Parletta N, Milte CM, et al. Telomere shortening in elderly people with mild cognitive impairment may be attenuated with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation: A randomised controlled pilot study.

Now a team of Australian researchers has found that vitamin D can reduce The independent newsletter that reports vitamin, mineral, and food therapies by Jack Challem14 the need for antibiotics, an indirect sign of the vitamin's infection-fighting potential. Rachel E. Neale, PhD, of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Australia, and her colleagues gave 644 people, ages 60 to 84 years, monthly supplements containing one of the following: (1) 30,000 IU of vitamin D3, (2) 60,000 IU of vitamin D3, or (3) placebos. No one took the supplements for more than a year. The dosages were equivalent to taking 1,000 IU or 2,000 IU daily. The findings did not focus specifically on colds and flus, but on infections in general. And while the results of the study did not reach statistical significance, there were unmistakable positive trends. Overall, people taking vitamin D were 28 percent less likely to have antibiotics prescribed for them. Among people 70 years of age and older, vitamin D was associated with a 47 percent lower likelihood of getting antibiotic prescriptions. Reference: Tran B, Armstrong BK, Ebeling PR, et al.

Vitamin K Benefits Hip Fracture Patients Taking Warfarin People taking the anticoagulant drug warfarin (Coumadin) are cautioned to minimize their intake of vitamin K, which can promote blood clotting. However, a new study has found that supplemental vitamin K\u2014given under a physician's supervision\u2014can benefit people who are taking the drug and are scheduled for hip surgery. Guy Rubin, MD, of the Haemek Medical Center, Israel, and his colleagues administered 10 mg (10,000 mcg) of vitamin K orally or intravenously to 11 of 21 hip-fracture patients who were being treated with warfarin at the time of their hospital admission. They compared both groups of patients with each other and with 35 hip-fracture patients who were not taking either the vitamin or the drug. The vitamin K was administered to determine whether it would help improve the patients' \"international normalized ratio,\" or INR, a measure of blood-clotting speed. Patients receiving vitamin K had normalized INR in less than two days, compared with more than four days in the placebo group. They needed less preoperative time in the hospital, and they were discharged about four days earlier as well. Rubin also reported that there \"was no difference in the amount of blood found in the wound drains or the number of blood units administered.\" Editor's note: Vitamin K regulates the deposition of calcium in the body and is also needed for bone strength. Warfarin increases the risk of osteoporosis. Do not take vitamin K without a physician's supervision if you take warfarin. Reference: Tal A, Rubin G, Rozen N. Treatment with vitamin K in hip fracture patients receiving warfarin. Israel Medical Association Journal, 2013;15:348-51. Multivitamins and B-Complex Supplements Improve Moods Simply taking a multivitamin/multi-mineral supplement, or a high-potency B-complex supplement, can lead to significant improvements in a wide range of mood issues in otherwise healthy people. David Benton, DSc, of the University of Swansea, Wales, analyzed eight previously published studies that included 1,292 subjects. People in these placebo-controlled studies took either (1) a multivitamin/multi-mineral supplement containing nutrients with no more than twice the recommended daily allowance or (2) a high-potency multivitamin that contained larger amounts of vitamins, but no more than three minerals. People took the vitamin supplements for between 28 and 90 days. The effects of the supplements on mood ranged from small to mild. The subjects noted a variety of \"perceived\" mood improvements, including less stress, subclinical anxiety, confusion, mild psychiatric symptoms, fatigue, and hostility. The high-dose vitamin supplements had a more pronounced effect compared with the lower dose multivitamin/multi-mineral supplements. Benton noted that the criteria used to assess nutritional adequacy do not include psychological measures, but mood is likely to be more sensitive to deficiencies. Reference: Long SJ, Benton D.

Women's Feelings of Depression Related to Omega-3 Levels Feelings of depression in women, but not men, were related to low intake of omega-3s, according to a new study conducted at the U.S. National Institutes of Health, based in Baltimore, Maryland. May A. Beydoun, PhD, and her colleagues studied 1,746 men and women who ranged from age 30 to 65 years. They underwent a standard test for assessing elevated depressive symptoms and also completed two 24-hour dietary recall questionnaires. Women who consumed the largest amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were 49 percent less likely to suffer from depression. Reference: Beydoun MA, Fanelli Kuczmarski MT, Beydoun HA, et al. Omega-3 fatty acid intakes are inversely related to elevated depressive symptoms among United States women.

Blueberries good for blood vessels Blueberries are rich in polyphenolic antioxidants. In two studies, researchers at the University of Reading, United Kingdom, asked 21 healthy men to consume either beverages containing blueberry polyphenols or beverages without them. The researchers noted significant improvements in the blood- vessel tone of the subjects one to two hours after consuming the blueberry polyphenols, as well as six hours after consuming them.

Antibiotics damage normal cells Antibiotics have saved millions of lives, but a new study suggests it's best to use them only when absolutely necessary. Researchers at Boston University tested the effects of antibiotics on mice and human cells. The antibiotics increased levels of free radicals and damaged mitochondria, the energy centers of cells. However, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an over-the-counter antioxidant, protected the mice and human cells from damage. Kalghatgi S. Science Translational Medicine, 2013;5:192ra85. Resveratrol may benefit cancer patients Some research suggests that the antioxidant resveratrol, found in red wine, might have anti-cancer effects. One limitation is that the body quickly metabolizes resveratrol. In a study conducted at the University of Leicester, United Kingdom, researchers found that the metabolite resveratrol sulfate is still assimilated by cells. Furthermore, cells can convert resveratrol sulfate back to resveratrol, potentially leading to higher cellular concentrations of the compound. Patel KR.

Researchers at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, analyzed 26 studies, including 94,910 people, to determine whether insulin levels increased the risk of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and stroke. Elevated insulin levels were associated with a 63 percent higher risk of hypertension and a 50 percent greater risk of coronary heart disease. Insulin levels were not related to stroke risk. Xun P.

Scientists have found that for some people, sugar leads to the same neurochemical changes in the brain that occur with addictive drugs, creating behaviors similar to those experienced by drug addicts and alcoholics, including bingeing, withdrawals, and cravings. And even if you aren't addicted to the stuff, if you regularly consume sugar in any of its many forms (including health foods sweetened with the seemingly innocuous fruit juice concentrate) then you are likely damaging your health in the long run. Some experts even argue that excessive sugar consumption is just as bad for our health as smoking or heavy drinking. One of these experts is Robert Lustig, MD, an endocrinologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who has studied childhood obesity for more than a decade. According to Lustig, the body can safely metabolize about six teaspoons (24 g) of added sugar each day (one 12-oz can of soda has around 35 grams of sugar). But the average American consumes closer to 20 teaspoons (80 g) a day. A study published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that most adults (71%) get at least 10 percent of their daily calories from added sugar and 10 percent consumed 25 percent or more of their daily calories from added sugars (the study also discovered that those who consumed the most sugar had nearly triple the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease compared to those who consumed the least). All of that sugar is throwing our bodies for a loop. Because the human body is made to metabolize only very small amounts, chronically consuming excessive sugar strains the body's metabolic mechanisms that normally regulate healthy blood sugar. When the cells cannot absorb anymore and the liver has been continuously flooded, this is how the body responds: body fat accumulates, especially around the waist; triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and blood pressure increase Sugar is addictive... but the question remains, how do you break the habit?20 A s I write this, I am indulging my sweet tooth in a mocha latte. It has an estimated 35 grams of sugar, easily exceeding the American Heart Association's daily recommended intake of no more than 25 grams for women (men are allowed a bit more, at 38 grams). I know it's bad for me, but like so many others, I find it extremely hard to fight the urge for a sweet fix. It's a topic that comes up frequently in conversation with friends and family\u2014we all know that sugar is bad for us, but we can't stop eating it, and even craving it. We are not alone\u2014the average American consumes nearly 76 pounds of added sugar each year. Seventy-six pounds! We are a nation of sugar junkies\u2014and we know it's bad for our health, but how do we break the sugar habit? It's everywhere, and far more dangerous than you may think Sugar used to be considered a delicacy, a treat that was only enjoyed occasionally. But with the advent of the processed foods industry, sugar made its way into every nook and cranny of our food supply, and now it's so ubiquitous that we're often not even aware we are eating it. While a novelty coffee drink or slice of cake is an obvious sugar trap, many foods are not: Added sugar in bread? Check. Pasta sauce? Check. Canned soup? Check. Bacon?! Check. Baby formula?!! Yep. And the list goes on. In fact, about 75 percent of packaged food sold in the United States contains added sugar. It is added to processed foods to make them more palatable and to extend their shelf life, and it comes with at least 61 different names, from cane sugar to maltodextrin. So even if you tend to avoid dessert, you may still be overdosed. Sugar has gone from a sort of a condiment to contender for the number one food additive in our food supply, and along the way, it has created some unwitting addicts and a lot of metabolic chaos. As recently as the 1980s, sugar's only negative health effect, according to the National Academy of Sciences, was that it caused cavities. Modern research has painted a much different (and sinister) picture of the sweet the Sugar Habit(collectively known as metabolic syndrome); cells age faster; gut bacteria is negatively altered; inflammation and oxidation increase; fat accumulates in the liver; and essential nutrients are lost. Each of these is intricately linked to the development of serious diseases like obesity, type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, Alzheimer's disease, and even cancer. Breaking the habit So let's cut to the chase: we know sugar is really damaging to our health, but how do we cut back on the stuff, especially when it's so ubiquitous? Probably the most dramatic way to reduce sugar intake is to eliminate sweetened beverages, especially those sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). Fructose disrupts the hormonal signal that normally tells your brain your belly is full so you will stop eating. When you consume fructose in soft drinks or other sweet beverages, your brain never receives the \"I'm full\" signal. Sugary drinks have absolutely no nutritional value and deliver mega doses of pure sugar. Instead try flavored sparkling water, fruit-infused waters, kombucha, or unsweetened iced tea. If you frequently eat processed foods, always check the nutrition labels for sugar content. Ditch those foods that have a lot of added sugar and opt for versions with less sugar. Many items, such as salad dressing and marinara sauce, are easy to make at home and allow you to completely eschew the added sugar. Remember that highly- processed, sugar-laden foods displace nutrient-dense foods that supply our bodies with essential vitamins and minerals. Eat more fiber! Fiber is crucial in slowing down the absorption of sugars into the bloodstream, helping to avoid extreme peaks in blood sugar, but most processed foods are devoid of this important element. Solve this by increasing your intake of nutrient-dense, natural, unprocessed foods. A diet centered on fiber-rich vegetables and healthy fats and proteins will keep blood sugar balanced and can help reduce sugar cravings. Stop stocking your cabinets with sweet treats. If they aren't in the house, then you're less likely to eat them. If you crave dessert, choose quality over quantity and make it a special treat\u2014not a daily habit. Try a few select supplements. Alpha lipoic acid (300 mg, daily), chromium (500-1,000 mcg daily), and L-glutamine (500-1,500 mg twice daily) help to normalize blood sugar levels and may help with cravings. The omega-3 fish oils (1,000-4,000 mg daily) have been shown to ameliorate some of sugar's deleterious effects, especially on cognitive function. Additionally, sugar strips the body's reserves of important vitamins and minerals, including the B-vitamins (try a daily B-complex) and magnesium (200-600 mg daily). Eliminating or even reducing your sugar intake is no easy feat. As Dr. Lustig says, \"Sugar withdrawal symptoms are like withdrawal symptoms to any other drug of abuse\u2014the jitteriness and irritability are worst around 3-5 days, then start to subside, and are usually gone in three weeks.\" Take it day by day, and if you slip up just keep moving forward. Small changes add up, and before you know it, you will be well on your way to breaking the sugar habit! (By the way, I opted for green tea the next time I visited the coffee shop.)

And while they both taste sweet to the tongue, each is metabolized in very different ways by the body. Glucose, also referred to as blood sugar, is either used as energy by the cells or is stored as glycogen for future use. Insulin is secreted by the pancreas in response to elevated blood glucose, helping glucose enter the cells, thus lowering blood sugar levels. When you consume too many simple carbs and starches (white bread, white rice) and foods containing sugar, blood sugar becomes chronically elevated, which leads to insulin resistance. In insulin resistance, the cells no longer respond to insulin, leading to ever higher levels of blood glucose in addition to high blood levels of insulin; if left unchecked, type-2 diabetes develops. Further, chronically elevated levels of insulin and glucose can lead to brain fog, lethargy, weight gain, increased triglycerides, increased blood pressure, increased inflammation and oxidation, hormonal dysfunction, and is implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease. While glucose can be metabolized by almost every cell in the body and is used as fuel, fructose is metabolized exclusively by the liver and is not used as a source of energy. It doesn't produce an insulin response, which has led some people to erroneously consider it a \"healthy\" sugar, but it creates a heavy toxic burden on the liver, where it produces free radicals that can damage healthy cells and more dangerously, generate fats that find their way into the bloodstream (triglycerides) or are deposited in the liver (fatty liver disease). In fact, doctors are seeing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in children as young as two! Excessive fructose consumption has been implicated in increased triglycerides, increased blood pressure, obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and fatty liver disease. Bottom line? Each type of sugar comes with its own negative health issues. Your best bet is to work toward reducing your intake of both.More recipes at NaturalGrocers.com/recipesRecipesHealthy & Delicious22 Place all ingredients in a small jar with a tight-fitting lid.

When the immune system functions normally, it distinguishes external foes from friends\u2014mounting a powerful response to infections while allowing nourishing nutrients to enter our bloodstream. But as counter-intuitive as it might seem, the immune system sometimes turns against its host, sort of like a dog biting the hand that feeds it. When the immune system attacks the very body it's meant to protect, it causes what doctors call autoimmune diseases. Some autoimmune diseases are common, others less so, and they can affect almost any part of the body. Rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, lupus, type-1 diabetes, Sj\u00f6gren's (pronounced show- grins) syndrome, scleroderma, pernicious anemia (involving a severe vitamin B12 deficiency), and thyroiditis are among the most common autoimmune diseases. All of these autoimmune diseases have a strong inflammatory component, the result of the immune system revved up to respond to what it considers a threat. The problem is that a person's own body is not a threat. But what might cause the immune system to act in such a misguided fashion? Leaky Gut Syndrome There's intriguing evidence that autoimmune disorders may be related, at least in part, to a digestive system damaged by medications and unhealthy foods. This damage can also cascade into highly individualized symptoms that stump many physicians and may be a contributing factor to a great many diseases. The underlying cause may be what some physicians and researchers call \"leaky gut syndrome,\" also known as intestinal permeability. To explain, your digestive tract is home to the vast majority of your body's immune cells. After all, most \"foreign\" and potentially threatening microorganisms enter the body through the mouth. Our resident gut bacteria support the immune system by countering any disease-causing germs that piggyback on the food we eat. Ideally, the gut wall functions as a gateway that allows only digested food molecules and nutrients to pass through and into the bloodstream. But this intestinal barrier can be compromised in a variety of ways. Antibiotics are among the worst offenders because they indiscriminately destroy many of the beneficial bacteria that inhabit our digestive tract. Alcohol, caffeine, and many types of processed foods can damage the gut lining as well. In fact, an article in the February 26, 2015 issue of the journal Nature reported that two emulsifying agents (cellulose gum and polysorbate-80), which are commonly used in processed foods, disrupted the normally protective interactions between intestinal bacteria and the gut wall. The result set the stage for inflammatory bowel disease and potentially obesity and metabolic syndrome. And as it turns out, gluten is especially well documented for its role in causing leaky gut syndrome. The Gut Wall The wall of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is lined with highly specialized protein complexes called \"tight junctions\" (TJs), which serve as a gateway that either enables or blocks the passage of nutrients into the bloodstream. TJs also influence the body's immune tolerance and response to bacteria, viruses, and foods. For example, a substance called zonulin regulates the permeability of TJs, and some people over-produce zonulin when they consume the protein gliadin, the main culprit in gluten. The over- production of zonulin ends up punching holes in the normally tight barrier created by TJs. Autoimmune Disease LeakyGut Connection Inflammation and the By Jack ChallemAs a consequence, gut-wall permeability increases, allowing large, incompletely digested food molecules to enter the bloodstream. Those incompletely digested food molecules trigger an abnormal immune response, an increase in inflammation, and sometimes a rise in immunoglobulin G (IgG). Not surprisingly, IgG levels are often elevated in patients with celiac disease and non- celiac gluten sensitivity. In fact, autoimmune diseases related to leaky gut syndrome may be only part of the problem. For example, the line between immune and autoimmune disorders gets blurred in inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g., Crohn's disease), allergies, and asthma. All may be related to leaky gut syndrome, because the body's immune system is misreading cues and reacting abnormally. Compelling research has also linked depression and autistic symptoms to gluten consumption and gut health\u2014 and possibly to leaky gut syndrome. Dietary and Supplement Recommendations Healing the gut typically requires dietary improvements and the use of certain supplements. It's essential to adopt a diet that eliminates gluten (found in wheat, rye, and barley), as well as alcohol, coffee, and processed foods. Loren Cordain, Ph.D., a professor at Colorado State University, Fort Collins, and the leading expert on the Paleo diet, developed the Paleo Autoimmune Protocol (AIP), a stricter version of the diet that eliminates foods that can irritate and damage the intestine. (For more information, google the AIP term.) The diet emphasizes quality proteins, such as fish, chicken, and grass-fed beef, along with ample amounts of high-fiber vegetables. The following supplements can help modulate the immune response and also fine tune healing of the gut wall. Vitamin D. This vitamin, which is actually a hormone precursor, is an important regulator of immune system activities. Instead of just enhancing the immune system's response to disease-causing microorganisms, vitamin D actually helps the immune system function \"smarter.\" In a recent study, Kassandra L. Munger, Sc.D., of Harvard University, and an international team of researchers found that vitamin D influenced the activity of a large number of genes involved in multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease that affects 400,000 Americans. Munger's finding is significant because growing evidence indicates that low vitamin D appears to be related to the risk of developing MS, as well as to its long-term progression. Try: 5,000 IU daily. Probiotics. A healthy population of gut bacteria is essential for maintaining a normal intestinal barrier. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria species are the most popular types of probiotic supplements, and they appear to be \"keystone species\" that help maintain a supportive environment for other types of healthy gut bacteria. They also appear to have remarkable anti-inflammatory effects. L. rhamnosus may be of particular help in healing the gut barrier, and a particular type of probiotic yeast, Saccharomyces boulardi, also has been found useful in reducing gut inflammation and acute diarrhea. A French study found that a multi-species probiotic significantly reduced symptoms of IBS in women. Try: A probiotic formula containing at least several species of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria can support general gut health. For documented gut inflammation (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease), S. boulardi supplements may be of particular benefit.Digestive enzymes. Our digestive tract and liver secrete a variety of digestive enzymes to break down different types of food molecules, such as proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. Some specific digestive enzyme formulas have anti-inflammatory benefits, possibly because of how they promote gut healing. Highly specialized enzymes, such as dipeptidyl peptidase IV , enhance the breakdown of gluten. Although they won't protect against the gluten in a slice of pizza, these enzymes might offer protection against occasional exposure to trace amounts of gluten. Try: For general use, consider a product with several digestive enzymes. Products vary greatly, so follow label directions. Colostrum. Found in the fluid before breast milk comes in, colostrum contains a variety of immune factors and is involved in normal cell growth and repair, all of which benefits newborns. Lactoferrin, which helps fight bacterial and viral infections, is one of the constituents of colostrum. A study of athletes found that colostrum reduced post-exercise gut permeability by more than 80 percent. Supplements are derived from cow's milk. Try: 500 mg daily. L-glutamine. This amino acid was first used to heal stomach ulcers back in 1957. It's now widely used by nutritionally oriented physicians to heal gut injury, including leaky gut syndrome. L-glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the body, and its extra nitrogen atom helps the body assemble other amino acids.

Try: A soluble fiber supplement, following label directions for use. Herbal remedies. Several herbal extracts have a long history of use in easing gut problems, and they may be of use in healing leaky gut syndrome. Licorice root is a folk remedy for heartburn, and it may provide benefits throughout the digestive tract. The most common supplemental form is called deglycyrrhizinated (DGL) licorice root. DGL licorice has had its glycyrrhizin removed because, in some people, it can increase blood pressure. Another herb, slippery elm, is derived from the inner bark of Ulmus rubra. The extract contains mucilage, which is believed to coat part of the digestive tract. Finally, herbal bitters, taken by the teaspoon, typically contain gentian but they may contain as many as 40 different plants. As the name suggests, bitters are anything but sweet, but do promote better digestion. Try: Any of these herbs, but follow label directions. Omega-3s. Few natural substances have the broad anti-inflammatory benefits of the omega-3s. The omega-3s are part of the body's natural pathways for making a variety of powerful anti-inflammatory substances, including prostaglandin E3, resolvins, and protectins. Studies have found the omega-3s helpful in autoimmune diseases, such as MS, as well as in such GI disorders as Crohn's disease. Try: 1 to 5 grams daily.It's not always easy to sift through one's symptoms, eating habits, and overall lifestyle to establish definitive links between autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, MS, or lupus) or other inflammatory diseases and leaky gut syndrome. Often, an open-minded physician can be helpful. Whether you're suffering from an autoimmune disorder or other inflammatory disease\u2014or just want to maintain excellent health\u2014it only makes sense to give your digestive tract a lot of TLC. An integrated approach should focus on three areas: (1) dietary changes, such as avoiding gluten-containing foods or adopting an elimination diet to identify specific food sensitivities; (2) helpful supplements to support gut health; and (3) lifestyle changes, such as good sleep habits and stress reduction, to reduce the damaging effects of cortisol (the key stress hormone) on the digestive tract.
