In stock 1 Product Details Allergena Zone 2 is specific commonly occurring allergens in the Southeastern US. Allergena helps with up to 34 allergens including weed, tree, and grass allergens from oak trees, pine trees, sycamore, ragweed, goldenrod, pigweed, johnsongrass, bermudagrass and fescue. Zone 2 includes: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia How does Allergena work? The immune system defends us against disease. When harmful substances are detected, such as pollens, the immune system creates antibodies, which destroy or neutralize allergens (i.e. pollens, dust and/or mold) that cause us to have allergic reactions. However, sometimes even our immune system is not strong enough to defend against these allergens. Allergena is a Homeopathic Sublingual Immunotherapy that reduces the body's negative reaction to allergens. Our homeopathic allergy drops build immunity by exposing your body in micro doses to whatever it is that you are allergic to. This way, the body becomes safely conditioned to tolerate the allergens that previously brought on allergic reactions, and ultimately reduce allergic symptoms. Below are a few definitions to give you a better idea of how Allergena works: - Sublingual: Underneath the tongue. - Immunotherapy: Treatment to stimulate or restore the ability of the immune (defense) system to fight infection and disease. Allergy shots are another form of Immunotherapy. How is Allergena administered? Deliver 1/4 dropper full under the tongue three times per day. No food or water 15 minutes before or 15 minutes afterward. If your four-legged companion experiences seasonal allergies every year, consider trying Allergena before symptoms emerge in order to prevent discomfort. Allergena can also be administered after you first notice signs of allergic reactions. Save this product for later Display prices in: USD "}
