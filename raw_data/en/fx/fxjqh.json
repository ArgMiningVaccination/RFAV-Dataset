While in custody, you must follow all CCDOC rules, act in an orderly manner, respect others, and follow the directions given by CCDOC members. This will make your time at the CCDOC safer and easier. Failure to follow the rules, regulations, and procedures will result in disciplinary action against you and possibly lengthen your incarceration. Most problems or concerns you have can be addressed by requesting help from correctional officers and supervisors. In addition, there are Correctional Rehabilitation Workers (CRWs) and employees of Cermak Health Services of Cook County (Cermak) available to assist you. Look at the Table of Contents to learn what subjects are described in the Handbook. It is your responsibility to learn its contents. An audio overview of the handbook, in both English and Spanish, is regularly broadcasted on your living unit. This written handbook is available in English and Spanish. Inmates with disabilities, inmates with limited ability to understand English, or inmates who cannot read will be provided assistance. Ask an officer, supervisor, CRW or any other member of the CCDOC if you need help understanding this handbook and the rules of the CCDOC. Also, if you know of someone who has trouble understanding this handbook, notify a staff member. Inmates under L8 years old: If you are under the age of l8 years, or if you know of someone in the custody of the CCDOC who is under the age of 18 years, promptly notify CCDOC staff.CHAPTER 1 CCDOC INTAKE PROCESS Medical and Mental Health Screening By the time you receive this handbook you will have gone through the intake process and received medical and mental health screenings. Medical and mental health screenings help identify medical or mental health problems you may have and allow CCDOC staff and Cermak medical staff to properly address those problems. Be sure to inform CCDOC staff, CRWs, or Cermak medical staff about any matters related to medical problems, psychological problems, drug addictions, and prescription drugs you have taken. If you do not feel comfortable informing staff, you may submit a Cermak Health Service Request Form (see the Health Care Request Process section below). Classification and Housing Assignment By the end of the intake process, CCDOC Classification personnel will determine your housing location and security classification level. You will be a minimum, medium or maximum security inmate. Under limited circumstances, CCDOC may determine that you require protective custody, or High-Risk Movement (HRM). Maximum security is for inmates who present the greatest risk to security in the CCDOC and the safety of others. The higher the classification, the more restrictions placed on an inmate. If you believe you have been classified incorrectly, promptly notify a staff member and file an inmate written request (see the Inmate Request Process). Making Phone Calls Upon the completion of the intake process, you are permitted l5 minutes of free local and long- distance telephone calls. You may complete as many calls as the 15 minutes permit. All telephone calls are recorded, unless prior arrangements are made by your private attomey. Inmates Subject to DNA Collection Any person who is charged with or convicted of certain offenses or otherwise ordered by a court will have his/her DNA collected by designated staffat a scheduled time.CHAPTER 2 PRISON RAPE ELIMINATION ACT Sexual Abuse, Assault, Harassment, Intimidation and Retaliation The CCDOC has a zero-tolerance policy for sexual abuse, sexual assault, sexual harassment, sexual intimidation of inmates, or retaliation for those who report this conduct. Simply put, this behavior will not be tolerated. The following acts by inmates, CCDOC staff, vendors, and/or contract employees, even where no objections are raised, are ALWAYS PROHIBITED and should be reported immediately. 1. All sexual activity; 2. Exposure or masturbation; 3. Making sexual advances or sexual comments; 4. Engaging in any sexual act; 5. Touching another person's genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks with the intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, arouse or gratify; 6. Failing to respect the limited privacy rights of an inmate in order to sexually harass or sexually intimidate the inmate (e.g., gawking at someone in the shower or when undressing); 7. Threatening an inmate's safety, custody, privacy, housing, privileges, work detail, or program status in exchange for sexual favors; 8. Influencing or coercing another inmate to engage in sexual acts; or 9. Retaliating in any way against an inmate who reports or causes to be reported any of the acts listed above. Inmates should report any ofthese acts or other acts ofsexual abuse, sexual assault and sexual harassment. By speaking up you, are protecting yourself and other inmates, and you are making your stay at the CCDOC safer. All allegations related to this conduct will be investigated. The offender may be referred for charges to the State's Attorney's Office. Protect Yourself from Sexual Harassment, Intimidation and Sexual Assault Be aware of your surroundings, particularly when you are out of the sight of a staff member. Do not accept commissary or favors from another inmate. He/she may expect you to pay them back by engaging in sexual conduct. Don't engage in voluntary sexual activity. Voluntarily engaging in sexual activity with another inmate may attract the attention of a predator and make you a target. Don't give mixed messages. If someone approaches you and makes suggestive comments, be firm in telling them you are not interested. Trust your instincts. If someone is making you feel unsafe, tell a staff member right away. Contraband such as drugs and alcohol may make you vulnerable to sexual abuse. Alert staff if drugs or alcohol are around or if you think other inmates are using them.What to do if you are sexually harassed, sexually abused or threatened? 1. If you feel threatened or have been sexually harassed or abused, you can do one or more of the following: a. Tell a staff member or medical staff immediately; b. If the abuser is an inmate or person providing services, who is not CCDOC staff, and you are uncomfortable telling a staff member or medical staff, you may call Strategic Operations Center by dialing 111 from the telephone on the living unit; c. Complete an Inmate Grievance Form and give it to a supervisor or a CRW as soon as possible. 2. A person outside of the CCDOC, such as a family member, friend, or attorney, may report for you by sending an email to CCSO.PREA@cookcountyil.gov. You may also make a report using this email address after your release. Keep in mind, however, that evidence is lost by delaying the report. 3. Evidence of sexual abuse may be destroyed by washing, showering, brushing your teeth, using the toilet, drinking, eating or changing your clothes, depending on the acts involved. This evidence can be collected by a healthcare professional at Cermak, using a Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit. You may have the evidence collected without making a decision about prosecuting the person who abused you. What happens after I report a sexual assault? 1. You will be offered protection from the assailant and referred for a medical examination and clinical assessment. You will be housed so that you are protected from further harm or retaliation. An investigation will be conducted. Confidentiality of Inmates Reporting Sexual Assault All information you report regarding a sexual assault or other sexual misconduct will only be used to make decisions for protecting you or other inmates and for investigative purposes. Confidential information includes the name(s) of the reporting inmate, the name(s) of the victim(s) (if different than the reporting inmate), the name(s) of the perpetrator(s), and all other relevant facts. You will be advised of the outcome at the conclusion of the investigation. Resources If you would like to discuss your situation before or after making a report, you may contact the Chicago Rape Crisis Hotline by telephone at (888) 293-2080.

Failure to keep a clean cell can attract bugs and rodents and create an unsanitary environment that could expose you and others to diseases. Inmate workers and sanitation officers will provide cleaning supplies and will collect trash. If your cell needs disinfectant or other cleaning supplies in between scheduled cleaning times, inform the living unit officer or complete an Inmate Request Form. Items Allowed in Your Cell In addition to your legal papers and approved commissary items, the list below contains the only items that can be kept in your cell or living area (you may not be able to possess some items in some divisions based upon security restrictions).

You are forbidden from starting any type of fire. To promote fire safety, you shall not keep food and other items in your cells other than those permitted above. You shall not have cluttered cells, jam locks or cover lights or vents. Doing any of these can put you and others at serious risk of injury from fire or smoke and may result in criminal charges and restitution proceedings. 2tYou Must Fully Cooperate with the Following Security Procedures: Inmate Counts At various times throughout the day, the CCDOC will conduct counts to ensure that all inmates are where they are supposed to be. You must cooperate with all counts. You may not disrupt, delay or interfere with counts in any form or fashion. Cell/Room Searches and Sanitation Checks CCDOC staff has the right to conduct random andlor unannounced cell/room searches at any time. You do not have to be present for your cell/room to be searched. You are responsible for keeping your cell/room clean as well as the items found within your cell/room.

In the event of a strip search, all necessary steps will be taken to ensure your privacy. Pat/Frisk Searches You are subject to pat down frisk searches at any time. Female inmates will only be frisked by female officers, unless exigent circumstances exist. You are expected to comply with a staff member's directions and not resist the search in any way. Zero Tolerance for Gang Activity The CCDOC enforces gang-free living and has a zero-tolerance policy for gang activity. All gang activity is strictly forbidden within CCDOC.

Violating this rule will result in disciplinary actions against you. Requesting an Assessment for Protective Custody Under limited circumstances, certain inmates may qualify for Protective Custody. A review of an inmate's disciplinary record, a review of the inmate's statements for why Protective Custody is appropriate, and a background check will be conducted to determine if an inmate qualifies for Protective Custody. Protective Custody is only for inmates that follow all rules and regulations and do not harass or pose a threat to the safety of others in Protective Custody. Qualifying inmates must sign a Protective Custody contract and must follow all rules and regulations while in Protective Custody. Failure to sign the contract or follow all rules and regulations will result in being removed from Protective Custody. If you believe you may qualify for Protective Custody, you may tell a correctional officer or correctional supervisor or call the Strategic Operations Center at x1 I l. If you are not comfortable taking either of these steps, you may submit an lnmate Request form, but this will take longer to process. 22CHAPTER 5 INMATE DISCIPLINE Maintaining discipline among inmates is critical to your safety and security, as well as that of staff, other inmates and the CCDOC. There are different levels of rule violations that are based on the seriousness of the threat posed by the conduct. The sanctions you get, the amount of good time you lose or the amount of time you spend in Special Management Unit (SMU) housing, if found guilty, are based on the rule violation committed. The Inmate Disciplinary Process What happens if you break the rules? l. If a staff member has reasonable belief that you have committed a violation of CCDOC rules, the staff member will create a disciplinary report. 2. You will receive a copy of the disciplinary report and receive a disciplinary hearing to determine your guilt or innocence. 3. The disciplinary report will tell you what rule you broke and how you broke it. For violating certain rules, you may be sent to special management housing until your hearing. 4. If you are placed in special management housing and your hearing has not been conducted within 72hours, your housing status should be reviewed. The disciplinary report does not expire after 72 hours. You will generally receive a hearing within eight days unless you are unable or unavailable for any reason to participate in a scheduled disciplinary proceeding. 5. If you remain on your living unit until your hearing, you will generally receive a disciplinary hearing within eight days unless you are unable or unavailable for any reason to participate in a scheduled disciplinary proceeding. 6. At the hearing, you will have the right to tell your side of the story, present evidence, and possibly call witnesses who have first-hand knowledge of the event. 7 . The hearing officer will decide if you are guilty or not guilty of any charge. 8. Appropriate disciplinary action will be taken against you if you are found guilty of the charges. This could include sanctions, time in SMU housing, restitution for damaged property, loss of good time, changes in your classification and even criminal charges, which may lengthen your incarceration. 9. As of November 1,2017, the CCDOC does not have an inmate disciplinary appeal process. The Illinois Jail Standards does not require an appeal process. 23Disciplinary Actions and Consequences 1. Loss of good time credit - May occur as a result of certain infractions, including but not limited to; battery to staff, assault with bodily fluids, engaging in inappropriate sexual behavior or possession of a weapon. If you are found guilty of one or more of these rule violations, it means you may not receive any sentencing credit for the days spent in the CCDOC awaiting trial or disposition of your case, which means you will be incarcerated longer. 2. Aggravation of sentence - Your institutional disciplinary record may be included at the sentencing phase of your criminal case if you are found guilty of any criminal charge. 3. Sanctions include, but are not limited to the following: a. Loss of work assignment; b. Uniform and movement restrictions; c. Loss of good time; d. Loss of commissary privileges; e. Restricted or temporary loss of visitation privileges (except attorney and clergy visits);f. Restricted phone privileges; g. Loss of special event programs (excluding religious services); h. Placement in altemative housing; i. Financialrestitution. 4. SPECIAL MANAGEMENT UNIT - If you are found guilty of the charges against you, you may be assigned to SMU.

Disciplinary Unit - You may be housed here when found in violation of a rule or regulation at a 300-level or above offense or multiple lower level offenses as recommended by the Disciplinary Hearing Board. ii. Sanction Unit - You may be housed here when found guilty of a rule or regulation. 5. Restitution - If you are found guilty of damaging property, you may have to pay for any property damage you cause.

If you are found guilty of sexual misconduct, you will be subject to administrative sanctions which may include special housing, increased handcuffing and restrictive movement, and mandatory restrictive jumpsuits. Help with the disciplinary process and hearing - If you need help at any stage of the disciplinary process, a CRW can assist you if you fill out an Inmate Request Form and indicate what kind of help you need. If you are disabled, deaf, having trouble understanding English (written or spoken) and/or illiterate, assistance will be made available for you at no cost. 24CHAPTER 6 HEALTH CARE SERVICES Medical, Vision, Dental and Mental Health Care While at the CCDOC, you are allowed to receive medical, mental health, nursing, pharmacy, dental and vision care.

If your family has your eye prescription at home they can have glasses made for you in the community at your eyewear retailer of choice, and then they can bring them in to you via assistance from your CRW. Again, glasses must be entirely plastic, including lenses and frames - no metal or glass. 3. If you had an eye appointment with Cermak and you don't wish to wait for the glasses that will be made via Cermak (which take on average greater than 12 weeks), then you can take direct receipt of your prescription and it can be sent to your family via postal mail or your CRW can assist with getting them the prescription, or Cermak can directly communicate your prescription to the eyewear retailer of your choice in the community, the glasses (with no metal and no glass - ALL PLASTIC) can be manufactured there for you, and your family can pick them up and deliver them to you here at the CCDOC via assistance from your CRW. 4. \"Readers\" or magnifying non-prescription glasses can be purchased on Commissary. 5. If you qualify for indigent status - you may be eligible to receive readers or magnifying non-prescription glasses at no cost to you, via Inmate Welfare. You can put a request into Inmate Welfare for this need through your CRW. Note on the request form that you believe you should be eligible for free readers or glasses and your account activity will be . examined to determine your eligibility. 6. Should you require an appointment with an optometrist, PLEASE complete the Cermak Health Request Form. 7. Cermak does not support contact lens care or maintenance. Dental Care The purpose of the oral health program is to provide quality clinical dental services in a professional and efficient manner. The Oral Health Department serves as an integral part of the Cermak Health Services providing services in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of oral disease. This treatment may include emergency care, preventive services (cleanings), oral surgery (extractions) or restorative procedures (fillings). Services will be based on established priorities and on available appointments. Elective care and cosmetic care is not provided. Dental cleanings are only provided once a year. Toothbrushes and toothpaste must be purchased through commissary after your first visit. Floss is not provided.

Routine Health Services and the Health Service Request Process Routine Health Services You were seen by a registered nurse or correctional medical technician at intake for a screening to review your physical health and mental health needs. During the screening you were asked about your health history, mental health history and substance use history. You were also asked about your current health needs or concerns. If indicated, you were seen by a physician or physician assistant for physical health and a psychiatrist or mental health specialist for mental health needs or concerns. If you were on medication in the community, you may have already received that medication or a therapeutic equivalent if appropriate. Labs and/or diagnostics along with further follow up for physician and/or specialty services will have already been scheduled for you based on your responses and evaluation (some people start on medications after these additional steps). You will continue to be seen throughout your stay at intervals determined by your physical and mental health needs and the level of control of your disease. Health Service Request Process Non-emergency requests for healthcare should be submitted through the health service request process which notifies Cermak you request health care services. The Health Service Request (HSR) process should be used for any non-emergency medical, mental health, dental or vision care request for service. Some requests may be managed through the form itself, for example a refill request for keep on person medication. Other requests may require you to see the nurse. A nurse reviews each of these requests within 24 hours of receiving them to triage your complaints. If it is determined that you need to be seen, you should expect to be called to the nurse for additional evaluation. To access care through the HSR process follow these steps: 1. Fill out a Health Service Request Form. Blank forms in English and Spanish are available from CCDOC and Cermak staff. The forms are also available on your living unit. 2. Put the form in a Health Service Request drop box after it is filled out. A drop box is located on each living unit. After your request has been reviewed by Cermak staff, you will be scheduled for an appointment based upon the nature of your request. Emergency/Urgent Medical Care You must immediately tell CCDOC or Cermak staff in person if you are having a medical or mental health emergency. You may also have another inmate tell CCDOC or Cermak staff if you cannot do it yourself. Cermak provides emergency medical care every day and night. There is medical staff on-site in an urgent care setting at Cermak and in designated division dispensaries. You will be evaluated by Cermak staff and given proper medical treatment to resolve any medical issues. 26Medication Medicine is to be taken under the care of a medical professional. If not used correctly, medication can be dangerous. All medicine provided to you by Cermak is given to you, as directed, by healthcare staff. Be sure to tell the Cermak staff about ALL medication you have been taking. This includes prescribed medication and street drugs. A Cermak medical professional will prescribe your medicine as needed. The medicine may look different or have a different name than what you may have taken before you were in the CCDOC. Do not share or give your medication to any inmate. Take your medicine as ordered. If you have questions about medicine, talk to Cermak staff. Some inmates will receive every dose of medicine from a nurse. Some inmates will receive medicine in a packet. If you get your medicine in a packet, you will be responsible for taking the medicine as you would at home and as prescribed. This medicine must be kept in the identified packet with your name on it. Medicine without your name on it will be confiscated. You must request a refill for some types of medicine, such as an asthma inhaler ortubes of certain ointments. Tell the medical professional when you have two days or less of medicine left. You will have to fill out a request form. The nurse will confirm the order, determine your current amount of medication and send the form to the pharmacy for your refill. Inmates in possession of more than two weeks' worth of prescribed medication or three days of (dose-by-dose) medication will be referred back to the medical unit to be reevaluated for medication and placement as determined by medical staff. Hoarding of medication, pretending to take prescribed medication, possession or use of medication belonging to another or providing another with medication is prohibited and inmates will be subject to discipline according to current disciplinary codes for misuse of medication. Medical Appointment It is very important that you do your best to keep all scheduled medical appointments. Your cooperation is needed. This means avoiding any incidents that could lead to delays or cancellations and telling staff if you think an appointment is being or will be missed because of scheduling conflicts. Refusal of Medical Treatment If you refuse medical care or medicine, you will be asked to sign a medical treatment refusal form. If you refuse to sign the form, a CCDOC staff member and a medical professional will sign the form as a witness. You may not refuse care or treatment in cases of some infectious diseases. This is to protect you, staff and the inmate population. Other types of care cannot be refused or is court-ordered. This may include but is not limited to:l. Screening for Tuberculosis (TB); 2. Medical isolation ordered by a doctor for infection control; and 3. Medical housing to properly monitor your condition. 27Suicide Prevention/Mental Health Emergencies If you have a mental health emergency, notify any correctional officer or medical professional right away. Non-emergency mental health care is obtained by the use of the Health Service Request Form. You may feel some emotional stress, including thoughts of hurting yourself or suicide while in the CCDOC. These feelings may not have been present before coming to CCDOC, but you might feel them now because ofjob loss, family concerns, problems related to your case or charges, or financial or housing issues. You may not be extremely depressed or have any thoughts of suicide yourself, but you may notice them among one of the people on your living unit. Please inform a staff member of your concerns.

If you have submitted a Cermak Health Request Form or CCDOC Inmate Grievance Form, it will be reviewed by Cermak and you will be provided a response pertaining to your health care. Please be advised that if you submitted an inmate grievance requesting medical care and you have NOT submitted a Cermak Health Service Request Form for the medical care you seek, the grievance will advise you that you first need to fill out a Cermak Health Service Request Form. 29CHAPTER 7 INMATE REQUEST AND GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES At different times while in the CCDOC, you may need to make a request for assistance or make a complaint. There are two basic methods for communicating those needs or complaints to the CCDOC staff: l. The Inmate Request Form; or 2. The Inmate Grievance. An Inmate Request is a request for assistance, services or basic supplies. If a correctional officer, supervisor or CRW cannot address your request after you verbally ask them, then you should fill out an Inmate Request Form. The Inmate Request Form should be used to request: 1. A write-out, which is a pre-stamped envelope containing paper andlor pen. Eligibility is based upon your trust fund balance. 2. Your trust fund balance. 3. Basic supplies such as soap, toothpaste or shampoo. 4. Accommodations because you have a disability. 5. Law or general library services. 6. Help in filling out a grievance form. 7. Permission to attend religious services. 8. Attend an educational program. 9.

CCDOC does not offer lifestyle diets (e.g., vegan). 14. Assistance with commissary, phone cards or the mailroom. 15. A telecommunication device (TTY) for the hearing impaired. 16. Shoes, linens, uniforms, etc., based upon eligibility. An Inmate Grievance is a complaint form you may use to seek review of a problem related to your conditions of confinement. You may file a grievance if you believe that: 1. Your constitutional or other legal rights have been violated; 2. A CCDOC employee broke the law or a CCDOC rule that adversely affects you; 3. Your safety or well-being is at risk; 4. Your living area is unsafe or unclean; 5. Your money or your personal property was mishandled; 6. You are not getting programs that you have the legal right to attend or been court-ordered to attend; 7. You are not receiving medical, dental or mental health help that you need; 8. You are not receiving social services; or 9. You are not receiving auxiliary aids and services or mobility aides that you need. 30An Inmate Grievance will be processed as a Non-Compliant Grievance under the following circumstances: 1. More than one grievance issue (e.g., it contains a complaint about the food and also a staff misconduct issue) The rule is: ONE GRIEVANCE, ONE ISSUE.; 2. An issue that you have already grieved and administratively exhausted your remedies through the appeal process; 3. When you already grieved an issue and the practice or conditions giving rise to the grievance have not substantively changed AND you have already successfully exhausted your administrative remedies on the incident. 4. When you already grieved an issue and the practice, or conditions giving rise to the grievance have not substantively changed AND you failed to exhaust your administrative remedies on the incident. 5. An issue that you have already grieved and chose NOT to appeal within the required 15 calendar days ofreceiving the response; 6. An incident that you have already grieved (repeated submission) within the last 15 calendar days; however, an exception may apply that you need to speak to the CRW about; 7. Vulgar or profane language used in an insulting, provoking or inappropriate manner; 8. Complaints about other agencies or organizations; 9. Department rules or policies; 10. Classification or designation of an inmate as a security risk or protective custody inmate; or 1 l. Decisions of inmate discipline by a hearing officer. If your grievance is processed as non-compliant because of one of the reasons above, an explanation will be provided, and if applicable, you may be asked to resubmit. You must file your Inmate Grievance within 15 calendar days of an incident unless the incident is sexual in nature, or another reasonable exception applies (e.g., transfer to an outside agency, incapacitated inmate). If you fail to file within 15 calendar days, you must explain the reason for the delay on the Inmate Grievance Form, and the reason must be reasonable and truthful. If it is not, the grievance may not be processed as a grievance and therefore it cannot be appealed, which means you will not be able to exhaust administrative remedies. Please note however, that the grievance form will be forwarded as appropriate. 31The Inmate Grievance Process 1. To file a grievance, fill out an Inmate Grievance Form within 15 days of the incident, problem or event that you are grieving. If you are transferred as a CCDOC inmate to an outlying hospital, county or another facility outside of the CCDOC within l5 calendar days of the incident, problem or event that you are grieving, you must submit your grievance within 15 calendar days of your return to the CCDOC. There is no time limit however for grievances involving sexual misconduct. The forms are available on your living unit or from your CRW during their visitations. If grievance forms are unavailable, the use of any paper is acceptable. To assist with providing you a meaningful response, you are required to provide the specific date, location and time of the incident, problem or event that you are grieving. If you have trouble filling out a grievance for any reason, ask your CRW, Inmate Services supervisor or a correctional supervisor for help. You are NOT to complete any information above your name and identification number. 2. After you finish writing your grievance, hand your grievance form to the CRW, an Inmate Services supervisor or a correctional supervisor when he/she makes hislher rounds. Please be aware that CRWs will not be available on weekends and holidays. You will receive a copy of your grievance for your records. Disabled inmates who file a grievance have the option to share the grievance (and any response or outcomes) with the ADA Compliance Officer. If the disabled inmate agrees to share the grievance (or any responses or outcomes) with the ADA Compliance Officer, Inmate Services will forward a copy of that grievance (or any responses or outcomes) to the ADA Compliance Officer for review. 3. The CCDOC or other responding party (e.g., Cermak, food service provider) generally has 15 calendar days upon receipt ofyour grievance, ifno exceptions apply, to provide a written response. 4. You will receive a written response to your grievance. You will be required to sign the form saying that you received the response to your grievance - not that you necessarily agree with the response. You will receive a copy of the response for your records. It is your responsibility to retain a copy of your submitted grievance. 5. If you have an emergency that involves you or another inmate being at substantial risk of immediate harm, notify a sworn member immediately. However, if you believe the emergency can be handled through the grievance process, or that a grievance is the best and most efficient way to handle the emergency, then you must indicate on the Inmate Grievance Form that you are experiencing an emergency and why you believe this to be an emergency. If it is determined that you have an emergency, the division superintendent or designee will be alerted right away and an inquiry into the concern will begin. 6. If you are dissatisfied with the grievance response, you have l5 calendar days from receipt of the decision to appeal. A grievance appeal must be filed in all circumstances in order to exhaust administrative remedies under the CCDOC grievance procedure. To exhaust administrative remedies, you must appeal your grievance within this timeline unless you have a legitimate and truthful justification. Use the same grievance response form to file your appeal. Ask a CRW if you have questions. 32After you have exhausted the CCDOC administrative remedies and you feel your issue remains unresolved, you may submit a letter stating how or why you feel your grievance is unresolved and a copy of the appealed grievance to the Illinois Department of Corrections, Jail and Detention Standards Unit 1301 Concordia Court Po Box 19277 Springfield,IL 62794. This process is not required to exhaust your CCDOC administrative remedies; exhaustion of remedies has occurred once you have appealed your grievance document in a timely manner within the CCDOC grievance procedures. The Illinois Department of Corrections, Jail and Detention Standards Unit cannot offer assistance with pursuing litigious action or seeking compensatory damages against the CCDOC. To file/submit a grievance after your CCDOC incarceration, you are required to utilize the following mailing address and your envelope must be post-marked within l5 calendar days of the occurence of the incident, problem or event that you are grieving. CCDOC Inmate Services Department 2700 S. Califomia Ave. Chicago, IL 60608 You will not be retaliated against for filing a grievance or appealing a grievance response. Appropriate Use of the Grievance System Be considerate to other inmates, CRWs and other staff and do not file false, frivolous or unnecessarily repetitive grievances. The more time staff, CRWs and others spend processing and responding to false, frivolous and/or unnecessarily duplicative grievances, the less time they have to address the legitimate concerns that you or other inmates may have. Do not make threats or use vulgar language in your grievances or else your grievance may not be processed and you may receive a disciplinary report. You may also receive a disciplinary report if you purposely file false grievances. Inmates who abuse the grievance system may have their access to it appropriately limited.7. 8. 9. 33CHAPTER B OUTSIDE COMMUNICATION How do I stay in touch with people outside of the CCDOC?
