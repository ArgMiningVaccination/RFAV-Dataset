These products are good for the environment, skin, and overall health. Educating kids on the value of using clean skin care products and cleaning supplies is essential. Let's explore the benefits of using clean beauty products, with special attention given to Aveya (Lauren Bilon's Daughter, Founder of Plume), who is already at the forefront of the clean beauty industry. Cosmetics, skincare products, and other items linked to beauty are referred to as \"clean beauty\" if they are devoid of toxins and chemicals. Compared to synthetic alternatives, they frequently contain natural substances like oils and plant extracts that are beneficial for your skin. Other benefits are being vegan-friendly and cruelty-free. These products weren't made at the expense of animals. Why Using Clean Beauty and Non-Toxic Cleaning Products From an Early Age Is Essential. Using eco-friendly cleaning and beauty products from a young age can have various long-term advantages for the environment and your health. These products can help you protect your health by reducing exposure to toxic substances and dangerous chemicals. When exposed to harsh chemicals and poisons, children are more susceptible to skin irritation and other health problems. You can help protect your child's skin from these damaging substances by using non-toxic products. At Plume, we're dedicated to creating cosmetics that are both safe and effective for everyone, from young adults and teens to moms and children alike. Our products are a perfect choice for young children who are just starting to explore makeup because we prioritize the safety and well-being of our customers. We've carefully crafted our formulas to be free from harmful substances, so you can feel confident that you're using products that are both secure and efficient. The founder's daughter, Aveya, loves using our products. She finds the brow gel easy to use and believes it keeps her brows in shape the whole day. She has been using our products for a while, and she has noticed a significant improvement in the length and volume of her lashes. The lash serum has helped her lashes grow longer and thicker. She even uses our [mascara](https://www.plumescience.com/products/nourish-amplify-mascara), which has no parabens and is micro-plastic free to further enhance and improve the appearance of her natural lashes. Because they are effective and safe, Aveya enjoys using them as she isn't exposing herself to toxic chemicals. A richly pigmented brow gel that defines and densifies for naturally full, fluffy arches that never budge or smudge. Infused with plant-based actives from our patented Lash & Brow Enhancing Serum for thicker, fuller brows over time. I can't say enough good things about this brow gel!! I'm in love. My brows actually stay put all day, and sweat doesn't budge them at all. Love that the lash and brow serum is in it too, so I know I'm actually getting nicer brows just from wearing it. Huge fan! The [Lash Serum](https://www.plumescience.com/products/eyelash-and-eyebrow-enhancing-serum) aims to stimulate strong lash development. Watercress & Indian Cress, one of this serum's natural constituents, improves the lashes' strengthening and thickening. Moreover, it contains Castor Oil and Coleus Forskohlii Root Oil, which moisturize and nourish the lashes and give them a fuller, longer effect. The lash serum is simple to use and suitable for young adults. For young adults who want to thicken and add length to their lashes, the Plume Science Nourish & Amplify [Mascara](https://www.plumescience.com/products/nourish-amplify-mascara) is a must-have. Berry wax, one of the natural chemicals used to make this mascara, helps keep the lashes in shape. The mascara is simple to use and doesn't include any toxic ingredients that can irritate the eyes. For young adults who desire to groom and shape their brows, the Plume Science Clean Beauty Brow Gel is perfect. Panax Ginseng Root Extract and Glycerin, two natural ingredients, are used in this product's production, which helps hydrate and nurture the eyebrows. Moreover, Coleus Forskohlii is present, promoting brow strength and hair development. The brow gel is simple to use and maintains the brows in shape the whole day. The following are some advantages of using non-toxic beauty products and cleaning supplies: Protects Your Skin The ingredients in many conventional beauty products might irritate your skin and trigger allergic responses. Clean non-toxic beauty products are made without these harmful chemicals, making them safer and gentler on your skin. This means you can use them without worrying about damaging your skin in the long run. Clean beauty products provide protection against environmental stressors in addition to being better for your skin. These products' natural and organic ingredients include antioxidants and other nutrients that support the nourishing and strengthening of your skin. Also, a variety of soothing and moisturizing elements included in clean beauty products frequently help to treat skin conditions like dryness, irritation, and redness. Regular use of these products can lessen the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles while helping in maintaining a healthy, radiant complexion. Reduces Toxin Exposure Using clean non-toxic beauty and cleaning products reduces exposure to harmful toxins and chemicals. These chemicals can accumulate in your body over time, causing long-term health problems. Using clean products reduces your exposure to these toxins, which can help improve your overall health and wellbeing. Helps the Environment Clean non-toxic beauty and cleaning products are also better for the environment. Many conventional products contain ingredients that can harm the environment, such as microbeads that pollute waterways. Clean products are made with sustainable ingredients that are better for the planet. Supports Ethical Companies Companies that value ethical and sustainable processes frequently produce clean non-toxic beauty and cleaning products. You are supporting businesses that are dedicated to having a positive influence on the world by buying these products. Many traditional beauty products contain ingredients that can harm our health and the environment. For example, many makeup products contain chemicals such as parabens, phthalates, and formaldehyde, which have been linked to health issues such as cancer, hormone disruption, and skin irritation. Clean beauty products are also often cruelty-free and vegan, meaning they are not tested on animals and do not contain animal products. By using these products, you are helping to support a more ethical and sustainable beauty industry. Just like beauty products, traditional cleaning products can also contain harmful chemicals and toxins. Many cleaning products contain ingredients such as ammonia, bleach, and chlorine, which can harm our health and the environment. Natural ingredients like vinegar, baking soda, and essential oils are frequently used to create safe cleaning products. These ingredients are environmentally friendly since they decompose naturally and are non-toxic and biodegradable. Clean beauty doesn't just benefit adults; it's perfect for kids, young adults and teens too! With its natural ingredients and long-term benefits, there's no excuse not to try out some of our clean beauty faves, as Aveya does with her brow gel, lash serum, and mascara daily. Not only do these products contain safe ingredients, but they can also help nourish their skin while keeping it healthy in the long run. So what are you waiting for?
