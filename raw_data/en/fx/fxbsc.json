In this study, the roles of a putative type II TA system composed by a Zinc-dependent metalloproteinase (ZnMP) and a transcriptional regulator HTH-Xre were evaluated. The deletion of the open reading frame (ORF) BAB1_0270, coding for ZnMP, used to produce a mutant strain, allowed us to evaluate the survival and gene expression of B. abortus 2308 under oxidative conditions. Our results showed that the B. abortus mutant strain exhibited a significantly reduced capacity to survive under hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress. Furthermore, this mutant strain showed a decreased expression of genes coding for catalase (katE), alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (ahpC) and transcriptional regulators (oxyR and oxyR-like), as well as genes involved in the general stress response, phyR and rpoE1, when compared to the wild-type strain. These findings suggest that this type II ZnMP/HTH-Xre TA system is required by B. abortus to resist oxidative stress. Additionally, previous evidence has demonstrated that this ZnMP also participates in the acidic stress resistance and virulence of B. abortus 2308. Therefore, we propose a hypothetical regulatory function for this ZnMP/HTH-Xre TA system, providing insight into the stress response and its potential roles in the pathogenesis of B. abortus.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-08-31", "cleaned_text": "Unraveling the Role of the Zinc-Dependent Metalloproteinase/HTH-Xre Toxin/Antitoxin (TA) System of Brucella abortus in the Oxidative Stress Response: Insights into the Stress Response and Virulence [https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins15090536](https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins15090536) [Bacterial Toxin-Antitoxin Systems: These TA systems are composed of a toxin (usually a protein, with the exception of type VIII toxin), which inhibits an essential cellular process and an antitoxin (can be either a protein or a RNA), which neutralizes the catalytic function of the toxin [ [2](#B2-toxins-15-00536), [3](#B3-toxins-15-00536)]. Based on the mechanisms by which the antitoxin inactivates the toxin, these TA systems have been classified into eight types (I-VIII) [ [2](#B2-toxins-15-00536), [3](#B3-toxins-15-00536)]. Their functions in bacterial physiology are diverse and include the stabilization of mobile genetic systems, the inhibition of phages, inducing programed cell death (PCD), promoting biofilm formation and providing resistance to antibiotics and stress conditions [ [3](#B3-toxins-15-00536), [4](#B4-toxins-15-00536)]. These functions are associated with the release of the toxin, which occurs when the antitoxin is degraded during stressful conditions, allowing it to act on several targets, such as transcription, protein translation, cell wall synthesis, and/or inducing metabolic stress [ [3](#B3-toxins-15-00536), [5](#B5-toxins-15-00536), [6](#B6-toxins-15-00536)]. These phenomena arrest bacterial growth and can generate a bacterial dormancy or persister state, which are phenotypes less susceptible to stressors, such as antibiotics, acidic conditions or oxidative compounds [ [5](#B5-toxins-15-00536)]. These phenotypes allow bacteria to persist inside the host cell for long periods of time despite antibiotic treatments or other stressors [ [5](#B5-toxins-15-00536)]. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that TA systems are involved in bacterial virulence, being required for colonization, intracellular survival, and infection processes of diverse type II TA system was described in B. abortus by Heaton et al. [ [17](#B17-toxins-15-00536)], which is constituted by a ribonuclease toxin with a RelE-like fold and an antitoxin BrnA. This BrnT/BrnA complex is induced by different environmental stressors, such as oxidative and acidic pH stress, where the BrnT released causes the arrest of bacterial growth. The activity of BrnT can be neutralized by the expression of the antitoxin BrnA [ [17](#B17-toxins-15-00536)]. Furthermore, a recent report showed a high expression of several TA systems in clinical B. abortus and Brucella melitensis strains isolated from animals and RelE/RHH-like, Fic/Phd, Brnt/BrnA and cogT/cogAT [ [18](#B18-toxins-15-00536), [19](#B19-toxins-15-00536)]. The expression of all these TA systems was increased by the presence of gentamicin; and all, with the exception of cogT/cogAT, were also increased under acidic conditions [ [19](#B19-toxins-15-00536)]. Interestingly, B. abortus is exposed to these oxidative and acidic conditions during its intracellular trafficking through endosomes and lysosomes in macrophages and neutrophils. These phagocytic cells use several mechanisms to eliminate microorganisms, such as reactive oxygen or nitrogen species (O2, H2O2 and NO) and acidic pH are produced by the respiratory burst and the activity of vacuolar proton ATPases, respectively [ [16](#B16-toxins-15-00536), [20](#B20-toxins-15-00536), [21](#B21-toxins-15-00536)]. However, B. abortus has evolved diverse mechanisms of immune evasion and the capacity to survive intracellularly in these cells, including a Brucella-containing vacuole (BCV) trafficking for early endosomes (EE), (lys) [21](#B21-toxins-15-00536)]. formuary. Although intracellular highly microbicidal for multiple microorganisms, oxidative and acidic conditions induce in B. abortus the expression (SodC), catalase (KatE) and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC), enzymes that protect the bacterium from these oxidant compounds [ [22](#B22-toxins-15-00536)]. Moreover, the acidification of the BCV induces the expression of the virB operon, a group of genes coding for the type IV secretion system (T4SS) VirB, in B. abortus [ allows B. abortus to translocate multiple effector proteins, such as Btp1/BtpA, RicA or BspB into the cytoplasm of infected cells to inhibit intracellular signaling pathways and vesicular transport in host cells [ [24](#B24-toxins-15-00536), [25](#B25-toxins-15-00536)]. These translocated effectors enable B. abortus to escape endosome-phagolysosome compartments to vesicles derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it stress, the General Stress Response (GSR) is activated through factors PhyR and sigma RpoE1 () [ [30](#B30-toxins-15-00536)]. This response is required by B. abortus to survive under stress conditions, and to induce a chronic infection in mammalian hosts [ [30](#B30-toxins-15-00536)]. This evidence demonstrates that several regulatory factors participate in the adaptation of B. abortus during its intracellular lifecycle in professional and non-professional phagocytic cells. Interestingly, our group described the roles of a zinc-dependent metalloproteinase (ZnMP), which forms an operon with an HTH-Xre regulator, constituting a putative type II TA system in B. abortus [ [31](#B31-toxins-15-00536)]. Results showed that deletion of ORF BAB1_0270 (ZnMP) significantly affected the capacity of this pathogen to survive under acidic conditions, to escape from phagolysosomes to reach its replicative niche in ER-derived vesicles, to survive within phagocytic cells and to colonize mice tissues [ [31](#B31-toxins-15-00536), [32](#B32-toxins-15-00536)]. Notably, the deletion of BAB1_0270 (ZnMP) significantly reduced the expression of various genes coding for transcriptional regulators (e.g., vceA and vceC) [ [31](#B31-toxins-15-00536)]. Therefore, considering that these TA systems have been scarcely studied in B. abortus, this work aimed to evaluate the roles of the type II ZnMP/HTH-Xre TA system in the survival of B. abortus 2308 subjected to oxidative conditions. Based on previous results, and those obtained in this study, we are proposing a regulatory mechanism for this TA system during the stress response and the virulence of B. abortus. 2. Results 2.1. Characterization of Type II TA System in B. abortus Strains [33](#B33-toxins-15-00536)] allowed us to identify at least four potential type II TA systems present in the chromosome I of B. abortus biovar 1 strain 9-941 ( [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_006932.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_006932.1), accessed on 29 August 2023) and B. abortus strain 2308 ( [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_007618](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_007618), accessed on 29 August 2023) ( [Table 1](#toxins-15-00536-t001)). One of these TA systems is composed of the ZnMP (toxin) coded in the ORF BAB1_0270 (WP_002965518.1) present in a genomic island called \"genomic island 3\", which is shared by some Brucella species, such as B. abortus 2308 and 9-941 strains [ [31](#B31-toxins-15-00536), [32](#B32-toxins-15-00536), [34](#B34-toxins-15-00536)]. This protein is homologous to the ImmA/IrrE metalloproteinases family, which is characterized by conserved domains COG2856 and motif HEXXH (pfam06114). Furthermore, an operon with a transcriptional-Helix-Turn-Helix (HTH)-Xre (Xenobiotic response element) regulator, which is constituted by a nucleotide sequence of 357 bp (WP_002967122.1) that translates a 118 amino acids (aa) protein (pfam13443) ( [Supplementary Data](#app1-toxins-15-00536)). Thus, both genes form an operon located in the region 270,612-271,513 of chromosome I in B. abortus 2308 (NC_007618.1) [ [31](#B31-toxins-15-00536)], similar to the operon coded the ORFs BruAb1_0264 and BruAb1_0263 of B. abortus biovar 1 strain 9-941, which has been described by TADB2.0 as a type II TA system. Therefore, all evidence supports idea that ZnMP and HTH-Xre transcriptional regulator constitute a type II TA system, where ZnMP is the toxin and HTH-Xre is the antitoxin ( [Table 1](#toxins-15-00536-t001)). 2.2. ZnMP Is Required in B. abortus against Oxidative Conditions [Figure 1](#toxins-15-00536-f001)). Moreover, H2O2 concentrations from 1.0 to 1.2 mM severely reduced the viability of B. abortus 270 strain when compared to the wild-type and complemented strains ( [Figure 1](#toxins-15-00536-f001)). These results indicate that type II TA system based on ZnMP/HTH-Xre is required for B. abortus to resist or tolerate oxidative conditions. 2.3. ZnMP (COG2856) in the Expression of Genes Coding for Antioxidant Components in B. abortus 2308 [Figure 2](#toxins-15-00536-f002)A,B. The expression of katE (ORF BAB2_0849), ahpC (ORF and the potential regulators oxyR (BAB2_0849) and oxyR-like (BAB2_0530) genes was measured by RT-qPCR. Results showed that B. abortus 2308 cultured under oxidative conditions upregulates the expression of katE (p < 0.05) and ahpC (p < 0.05) when compared to B. abortus 270 ( [Figure 2](#toxins-15-00536-f002)C,D). Furthermore, the expression of oxyR and oxyR-like lysR regulators was also significantly increased in B. abortus 2308 when compared to B. abortus 270 ( [Figure 2](#toxins-15-00536-f002)E,F) when these strains were subjected to oxidative conditions (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). Nevertheless, although the expression of katE and ahpC genes in B. abortus 270 was significantly reduced when compared to wild-type strain, their expression was slightly less or similar, respectively, when it was compared to control group ( [Figure 2](#toxins-15-00536-f002)C,D). Similarly, the expression of the transcriptional regulators oxyR and OxyR-like lysR in B. abortus 270 was slightly less than the control group ( [Figure 2](#toxins-15-00536-f002)E,F). Complemented strain B. abortus 270C showed expression for katE, ahpC, oxyR and oxyR-like lysR regulators when compared to B. abortus 270 ( [Supplementary Data](#app1-toxins-15-00536)). These results demonstrate that the deletion of ZnMP negatively affects the expression of several genes involved in the survival of B. abortus under oxidative stress conditions. 2.4. ZnMP in the Expression of phyR and rpoE1 of B. abortus [Figure 3](#toxins-15-00536-f003)A. The effects, by deleting in the expression of phyR (BAB1_1671) and rpoE1 (BAB1_1672) genes in B. abortus strains exposed under oxidative conditions was evaluated by RT-qPCR. The results showed that phyR and rpoE1 were significantly upregulated in B. abortus 2308 exposed to oxidative conditions (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) compared to B. abortus 270 ( [Figure 3](#toxins-15-00536-f003)B,C). However, in B. abortus 270, the expression of phyR was slightly lower than control group, while the expression of rpoE1 was similar to the control group. Complemented strain B. abortus 270C showed higher levels of expression for phyR and rpoE1 when compared to B. abortus 270 ( [Supplementary Data](#app1-toxins-15-00536)). These genes coding for PhyR, a repressor of NepR, and for a RNA polymerase sigma factor (), respectively, are involved in the GSR of B. abortus. Therefore, these results suggest that type II ZnMP/HTH-Xre TA system contributes in the oxidative stress response of B. abortus. 3. Discussion [1](#B1-toxins-15-00536), [2](#B2-toxins-15-00536), [3](#B3-toxins-15-00536)]. These genetic module physically form a toxin-antitoxin complex, where the antitoxin inhibits the toxin's activity on its cellular targets [ [1](#B1-toxins-15-00536), [2](#B2-toxins-15-00536), [3](#B3-toxins-15-00536)]. Toxins released can affect diverse bacterial functions, such as plasmid post-segregational killing, programmed cell death, defense against phages, biofilm formation, as well as antibiotic-induced persistence, or resistance to stress conditions [ [1](#B1-toxins-15-00536), [6](#B6-toxins-15-00536)]. These roles are associated with the inhibition of bacterial growth and/or induction of dormant or persister states, which are phenotypes less susceptible to stressors, such as antibiotics, acidic or oxidative compounds [ [5](#B5-toxins-15-00536)]. Recently, we demonstrated that ZnMP (BAB1_0270) of B. abortus strain 2308 forms an operon with a HTH-Xre transcriptional regulator, which may be a type II TA system [ [31](#B31-toxins-15-00536)]. By RT-PCR assays, it was confirmed that the messenger RNA (mRNA) of this B. abortus 2308 operon amplifies a PCR product of 906 pb containing the ORF BAB1_0270 of 549 bp (sequence for ZnMP) and the HTH-Xre transcriptional regulator of 357 bp [ [31](#B31-toxins-15-00536)]. In addition, this operon has a promoter in the regions -35 and -10 before HTH-Xre/ZnMP sequence, which is recognized by RpoD sigma factors of the RNA polymerase [ [31](#B31-toxins-15-00536)]. The deletion of ZnMP significantly reduced the growth of B. abortus lacking this protein under acidic conditions, the expression of several genes involved in the virulence and, consequently, reduced its ability to survive in macrophages and to colonize tissues in BALB/c mice [ [31](#B31-toxins-15-00536), [32](#B32-toxins-15-00536)]. Moreover, the deletion of ZnMP significantly reduced the ability of B. abortus to adapt intracellularly and to grow under acidic pH [ [31](#B31-toxins-15-00536)]. Interestingly, this deletion did not affect the growth of the mutant strain when compared to wild-type strain under physiological conditions (pH 7.2-7.4) [ [32](#B32-toxins-15-00536)]. Therefore, in this work, we studied the roles of this type II ZnMP/HTH-Xre TA system in the survival and gene expression of B. abortus 2308 cultured under oxidative conditions with the aim to understand whether this TA system exerts regulatory functions during the stress response of B. abortus 2308. [Table 1](#toxins-15-00536-t001)). The ZnMP/HTH-Xre is an operon that Imma/IrrE family metallopeptidase (ZnMP) and a HTH-Xre transcriptional regulator [ [31](#B31-toxins-15-00536)]. It is a pair gene (Xre-COG2856) similar to those described in the related B. abortus biovar 1 strain 9-041 ( pneumoniae strains and Geobacillus [35](#B35-toxins-15-00536), [36](#B36-toxins-15-00536), [37](#B37-toxins-15-00536)]. These genes coding for COG2856/Xre are often found in mobile genetic elements, such as bacteriophages or transposons. Furthermore, COG2856 (ZnMP) proteins contain a conserved HEXXH motif, which is commonly associated with proteins that contain the HTH domain of the Xre family. In Bacillus subtilis, these proteins are involved in the genetic control of bacterial cell death, specifically in the induction of late genes of prophage PBSX, which largely depend on the xre gene [ [38](#B38-toxins-15-00536)]. This Xre protein regulates not only its own expression, but also the expression of other genes, including a downstream regulatory complex cascade [ [38](#B38-toxins-15-00536)]. On the other hand, ZnMP (COG2856) shares homology with proteins of the ImmA and IrrE families, which are present in B. subtilis and Deinococcus and ImmR and Ddro, respectively. Thus, ImmA cleaves ImmR, favoring the expression of genes involved in the transfer of mobile genetic elements, such as ICEBs1, and IrrE cleaves Ddro, favoring the transcription of several genes required for bacterial survival under conditions of ionizing radiation or ultraviolet radiation [ [39](#B39-toxins-15-00536), [40](#B40-toxins-15-00536), [41](#B41-toxins-15-00536), [42](#B42-toxins-15-00536), [43](#B43-toxins-15-00536)]. Moreover, IrrE is recA gene [ [39](#B39-toxins-15-00536), [42](#B42-toxins-15-00536), [43](#B43-toxins-15-00536), [44](#B44-toxins-15-00536)], a protein strongly induced during irradiation, which orchestrates the cellular response to DNA damage via its multiple roles in the SOS response [ [45](#B45-toxins-15-00536), [46](#B46-toxins-15-00536), [47](#B47-toxins-15-00536)]. It is possible that the role played by IrrE in other bacteria may be performed by ZnMP in B. abortus, suggesting that this protein might exert pleiotropic effects that control large sets of genes encoding different metabolic and signaling pathways [ [42](#B42-toxins-15-00536)]. Additionally, some authors indicate that these COG2856/Xre proteins could be analogues of the well-characterized SOS response regulator LexA, a repressor of complex regulons [ [48](#B48-toxins-15-00536), [49](#B49-toxins-15-00536), [50](#B50-toxins-15-00536)]. These regulatory functions of IrrE have been demonstrated by transforming Escherichia coli and other bacteria with recombinant plasmids encoding the IrrE protein. This transformation has improved the tolerance of these bacteria to various abiotic stresses, such as irradiation, osmotic changes, heat, salt, and oxidative stress [ [51](#B51-toxins-15-00536), [52](#B52-toxins-15-00536), [53](#B53-toxins-15-00536), [54](#B54-toxins-15-00536)]. [Figure 1](#toxins-15-00536-f001)). This effect was associated with a lower expression of genes coding for catalase (BAB2_0848) and AhpC (BAB2_0531), key enzymes in the survival of intracellular pathogens, such as Brucella species, Mycobacterium enzymes detoxify peroxides, organic peroxides, and peroxynitrites into less toxic lower expression levels of antioxidant enzymes were directly associated with a lesser expression of oxyR (BAB1_0849) and oxyR-like (BAB2_0530), which are genes adjacent to katE (BAB2_0848) and ahpC (BAB2_0531), respectively, and that could be transcriptional regulators of these enzymes during bacterial exposition to H2O2 ( [Figure 2](#toxins-15-00536-f002)A,B) [ [60](#B60-toxins-15-00536)]. Recently, it was demonstrated that OxyR-like (BAB2_0530) is involved in the resistance of B. abortus to nitrosative stress, detergents, and also virulence, regulating diverse pathways, including nitrogen metabolism, siderophore biosynthesis and oligopeptide transport [ [61](#B61-toxins-15-00536)]. On the other hand, the expression of phyR and rpoE1 also was significantly reduced in B. abortus 270 when compared to the wild-type strain. These elements are involved in the GSR of B. abortus, which is a system consisting of a phospho-LovhK (LovhK~P) that transfers its phosphoryl group to PhyR (~P), which increases its affinity RpoE1 factor ( The to NepR allows to release the -factor (RpoE1), which can associate the RNA polymerase (RNAP) to a specific genomic region regulating the transcription of genes required by the bacterium to survive under acute stress conditions [ [30](#B30-toxins-15-00536), [62](#B62-toxins-15-00536), [63](#B63-toxins-15-00536)]. Although the relationship between RpoE1, catalase, AhpC, OxyR and OxyR-like regulators is still unknown, it has been demonstrated in Azospirillum brasilense that RpoE1 can regulate the gene expression of OxyR and catalase [ [64](#B64-toxins-15-00536), [65](#B65-toxins-15-00536)]. These findings reporting the changes in gene expression could explain why a low expression of antioxidant response was observed in B. abortus 270 mutant strain. [5](#B5-toxins-15-00536)]. Nevertheless, considering the homology between ZnMP and IrrE protein, we hypothesize that ZnMP exerts a similar function in B. abortus, regulating pleiotropically diverse mechanisms involved in the stress response and virulence [ [31](#B31-toxins-15-00536)]. Thus, we propose a model to explain the complex roles that this type II ZnMP/HTH-Xre TA system could play in the physiology of B. abortus ( [Figure 4](#toxins-15-00536-f004)A,B). In this model, during the stress response, the type II toxin ZnMP is released from the antitoxin HTH-Xre by the activity of intracellular proteases, cleaving repressor proteins (e.g., HTH-Xre proteins) that inhibit the expression of genes involved in the stress response and virulence of B. abortus. These regulatory functions could represent a new pathway for type II TA systems, in which the released toxin does not induce toxic effects, such as cellular death, but rather controls the transcriptional expression of several genes involved in the stress response and/or virulence. Therefore, this hypothetical function challenges the historical conception about the functions of these TA systems, where they could accomplish more complex regulatory circuits than those currently described for type II TA systems. Additional experimental analyses are required to validate that the TA system here studied in silico accomplishes the specific regulatory functions to understand its contribution to the fitness of B. abortus during the infection. This understanding may help us to develop new strategies for the treatment of brucellosis. 4. Conclusions 5. Materials and Methods 5.1.

Furthermore, comparative analysis for ImmA/IrrE family metallo-endopeptidase (WP_002965518.1) and HTH-Xre transcriptional regulator (WP_002967122.1) elements of type II Tas, were analyzed using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST, [https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), accessed on 29 August 2023) from the GenBank database ( [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_007618](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_007618), accessed on 29 August 2023). 5.2. Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions [32](#B32-toxins-15-00536)]. All strains were cultured in Brucella broth (BD Difco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 48-72 h. Additionally, B. abortus 270 and B. abortus 270C were cultured in Brucella broth with 50 g/mL kanamycin and 30 g/mL ampicillin, respectively, according to Ortiz-Rom\u00e1n et al. [ [32](#B32-toxins-15-00536)]. All assays and experiments were performed following the procedure stablished by the Biosafety Committee of the University of Concepcion (Concepcion, Chile). 5.3. Viability of B. abortus under Oxidative Conditions 5.4. Gene Expression of B. abortus Strains under Oxidative Conditions [Table 2](#toxins-15-00536-t002)). The expression of each gene was quantified by the 2CT method using the Takyon q-PCR kit for SYBR assays by means of the AriaMx Real Time PCR system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The 16s housekeeping gene was used as reference gene for all assays. Additionally, total RNA from B. abortus 2308 wild-type strain cultured under normal conditions was used as a control group for gene expression (value 1).
