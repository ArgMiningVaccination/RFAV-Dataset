For IC/BPS patients, the lingering effects of the opioid epidemic continues to impact their ability to receive pain medication. Three patients share their thoughts. 2ICA News 6AUA Releases Revised IC/BPS Guideline The new clinical guideline emphasizes individualized treatment and a concurrent, multi-modal approach to care.ICA UPDATE Summer 20222ICA News Three Appointed to ICA Board The Interstitial Cystitis Association is delighted to welcome three new additions to our board of directors. They are all patients living with IC/BPS, and they bring a wealth of unique perspectives from their personal journeys. They possess expertise from diverse professional backgrounds. But most importantly, they embody an empathetic energy and caring spirit. Each has generously stepped into a position of leadership within our organization. Tacha Kasper Kasper was a successful VP of marketing and business strategy before her life was turned upside down with an IC/BPS diagnosis. A tumultuous and emotional two-year journey with various treatments, along with career and income loss resulting in low self-worth, was met with a new calling\u2014to embark on a career in psychotherapy, specifically focusing on mental health for people with chronic illness. As she wrapped up the last two months of her schooling, she was faced with another bout of devastating news\u2014a diagnosis of breast cancer. While her story is one of strength, gratitude, and overcoming the odds, there is a recurring theme to her experience. \"While at medical appointments, I was sitting with and seeing all these women in waiting rooms, having conversations\u2014especially with the younger patients\u2014and no one was talking to us about our mental health and the distress we were feeling,\" she says. \"Here is this life-changing diagnosis, and no one says this is going to affect your mental health.\" \"Now, I am even more passionate about mental health, which is why I want to be on the ICA board to affect change and to help normalize what we go through,\" Kasper adds. Always active with the ICA through advocacy work, hosting mental health webinars, and leading online support groups, she felt like she could do more. \"I can bring something dif - ferent to the board because of the mental health component that I am uniquely qualified for and that I feel is so desper - ately missing but needed in our community,\" she says. Continued on page 4ICA Responds to Proposed 2022 CDC Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing Opioids The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced the opening of a docket to obtain comment on the proposed clini - cal practice guideline, CDC Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing Opioids\u2014United States, 2022. ICA submitted comments on the proposed guidelines in April, stat - ing that it \"fully supports educating providers with the full spectrum of pain management regarding effective treatment for all patients.\" \"We understand the current epidemic with prescription misuse, abuse, and overdoses; however, we represent patients who rely on responsible use to live a normal life,\" the ICA statement says, noting that the guide - lines focus on data that may overlook chronic pain patients who benefit from \"appropriately used pain management therapies.\" \"More research needs to be done for effective non-opioid treat - ment options before further limiting an already very limited pain management protocol,\" the ICA statement says. The proposed guideline, if approved, will take the place of the 2016 version. It \"is not intended to be applied as inflexible standards of care across patient populations by healthcare professionals, health systems, third-party payers, organizations, or governmental jurisdic - tions,\" the CDC's summary of the proposed guideline states. \"The guideline is intended to achieve the following: Improved communi - cation between clinicians and patients about the risks and benefits of pain treatment, including opioid therapy for pain; improved safety and effectiveness for pain treatment, resulting in improved function and quality of life for patients experiencing pain; and a reduction in the risks associated with long-term opioid therapy, including opioid use disorder, overdose, and death.\" Read the summary of the proposed guideline at cutt.ly/IFd0YjX .

Take Charge of IC With Fundraising ICA UPDATE Summer 20224ICA News Amber Carter For Carter, IC/BPS came on suddenly. Having earned her bachelor's degree in pre-law, her plan was to go to law school. She was ready to take the LSAT, finishing her last summer course to prepare and study, when she realized she could not continue due to the pain. It took her about a year and a half to get an IC/BPS diagnosis, after seeing numerous med - ical professionals, trying various treatments, and traveling out of state for care. During this challenging time, she had a serious boyfriend while embarking on a new career as a paralegal. Unfortunately, she was incredibly sick, had man y doctor appointments, and was calling out regularly because she could not work due to the pain. She ended up losing her job, which meant no income. And because she did not know how to deal with it, she lost her boyfriend, too. In addition, her 20 years as a dancer came to a halt with her diagnosis. She was beginning to feel like a failure. Carter decided it was time for her to stop and focus on something else. This is what led her to the ICA. By tapping into her own personal journey, she was able to take action by leading patient support groups in her community. By sharing her own experience with IC/BPS, she was helping others cope. \"Many IC/BPS patients unfortunately do not know how they are going to feel from day to day, or from moment to moment,\" Carter says. \"Worries about being stuck in traffic and not near a restroom when urgency strikes make it dif - ficult to meet in person, along with concerns driving long distances between cities. Many patients want to attend, but physically cannot drive, so I make a lot of one-on-one calls. Support over the phone, especially during the pandemic, was extremely helpful.\" \"The ICA does a lot of really good work,\" Carter adds. \"I decided to take on a leadership role on the board of direc - tors in hopes that we can see it expand even more.\" Theda Khrestin Theda Khrestin was 30 years old and on a work trip in India when she first started notic - ing symptoms of IC/BPS. Assuming it was from travel-related sickness, she did not think much about the frequency and urgency at first but knew something was not right when she returned. Theda stumbled across the ICA website during a web search looking for help. As a busy 30-year-old professional, she was not finding many resources elsewhere. While her diagnosis did not take years like most, it did take time for her to find doctors with IC/BPS expertise. She visited several specialists, attended numerous appointments, participated in painful pelvic procedures, and tried a variety of medications and supple - ments. \"I was searching the ICA website and found a list of recommended doctors with national recognition in this specialty,\" Khrestin says. \"I felt really thankful. The ICA has been the sole resource I have known to look to, especially when I was first diagnosed. Until I interviewed for the board, I had never met another human with IC/BPS.\" A decade later, with her IC/BPS mostly under control, Khrestin feels like she is ready to use her personal journey with IC/BPS to bring awareness to the cause, while sharing her professional expertise working in advocacy to give back to the ICA. \"With so little public awareness of IC/BPS, the ICA offered me both resources and a sense of community,\" she says. While the ICA is revitalized with new energy and optimism, we still need your support more than ever to help us continue to fulfill our critical work of providing awareness, education, advocacy, research and resources to the IC/BPS community.

Continued from page 2ICA UPDATE Summer 20225ICA News ICA Signs Letter to Members of Congress Calling the COVID-19 pandemic \"the earthquake that has triggered a tsunami of chronic disease,\" ICA signed on to a letter to the Healthy Future Task Force's Security Subcom mittee, one of seven issue-specific task forces designed to identify and develop policy solutions to issues facing the American people announced by U.S. House of Representatives Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). Among the points raised in the letter, which was co-signed by nearly three dozen patient advocacy organizations rep - resenting different medical conditions: The United States has failed to adequately and consistently prioritize funding for the prevention of chronic diseases and conditions and the promotion of health and well-being. This failure has made our nation more vulnerable to severe illness and death from infectious disease. The exorbitant and increasing cost of the nation's \"sick care\" system is not sustainable for individuals, families, communities, employers, and policymakers. This challenge is surmountable and reversible with sufficient investment in upstream strategies that help make the healthy choice the easy choice. To read the letter, visit bit.ly/ICA-letter22 . Bachelorette Star Diagnosed with IC Angie Kent, former star of the Bachelorette TV series, revealed that she has been diagnosed with IC/BPS. The 34-year-old, who starred in the Australian version of the show, said on her Instagram account that \"I have a new diagnosis, interstitial cystitis which I'll be finding out more about and the treatment in my follow up appointment with my specialist.... This is a marathon, not a sprint.\" Other IC patients responded, offering support and words of advice. Read Kent's Instagram post at bit.ly/IC-Kent .

AUA Releases Revised IC/BPS Guideline The new clinical guideline emphasizes individualized treatment and a concurrent, multi-modal approach to care. The American Urological Association (AUA) has revised its clinical guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cys - titis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) for the first time since 2014. Released in May 2022, the new guideline emphasizes that treatment must be \"individualized and based on the unique characteristics of each patient\" and based on \"shared decision-mak - ing\" between healthcare providers and patients, the AUA said in a statement. To that end, the updated guideline no longer ranks treatments from first-line through sixth-line tiers \"in order to emphasize that shared decision-making, individual patient factors, and clinical judgment are the most important factors in treatment choice.\" Instead, the guideline urges \"concurrent, multi-modal\" treatments across multiple categories, taking care to stress that the options listed under each category are not in any recommended order.\"This guideline is meant to provide direction to clinicians and patients on how to recognize, diagnose, and treat interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. An important component of that clinical framework is discussion of treatments that should and should not be offered. As the relevant science evolves and improves, this guideline will continue to require amendment to remain consistent with the highest standards of clinical care.\" \u2014 J. Quentin Clemens, MD, chair of the AUA guideline amendment panel and director of female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery fellowship at the University of Michigan Behavioral/non-pharmacologic treatments Dietary changes Pelvic floor muscle relation and physical therapy, which has a \"limited but high quality\" evidence base in providing symptom relief Bladder training Stress management Pain management\u2014including opioid and non-opioid medications\u2014can also be considered when patients are educated \"on the risks and benefits.\" However, pain medication \"alone typically does not constitute sufficient treatment for IC/ BPS,\" states an article about the new guideline in the Journal of Urology . ICA UPDATE Summer 2022Managing Chronic Care In its revised description of diagnosis, the guideline emphasizes that patients and healthcare providers must commit to treatment for the long term. \"Patients should be made aware that IC/BPS is typically a chronic disorder requiring continual and dynamic management,\" the article states. \"Adequate symptom control is achievable but may require trials of multiple therapeutic options to identify the regimen that is effective for that patient. Patients should be informed that, given the chronic nature of IC/BPS, the typical course involves symptom exacerbations and remissions.\" The revised guideline also calls on healthcare providers to remain open to new options. \"IC/BPS treatment alternatives are char - acterized by the fact that most treatments may benefit a subset of patients but that no treatment reliably benefits most or all patients,\" the article states. \"As part of shared decision-making, clinicians should counsel patients on all applicable options, with their risks and benefits. It is not uncommon for a particular patient to experience lack of benefit from a particular treatment; therefore, if a clinically meaningful trial of a therapy has been conducted without efficacy, then the therapy should be discontin - ued, and other therapeutic alternatives should then be considered.\" Read the Journal of Urology article on the new guidelines at bit.ly/IC-Journal22 , and access the full revised guidelines Medicines Amitriptyline Cimetidine Hydroxyzine Pentosan polysulfate (Elmiron). The revised guideline includes new language recommending that patients are advised of \"the potential risk for macular damage and vision-related injuries\" with Elmiron, which remains the only FDA-approved oral medication for IC/BPS. Oral cyclosporine A is included as an option for patients with Hunner's lesions. Bladder Instillations DMSO Heparine (intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxin A) injections\u2014\"if other treatments have not provided adequate improvement in symptoms and quality of life,\" the article states. Neuromodulation for patients with frequency/ urgency symptoms; the journal article states that it is \"much less effective and potentially ineffective\" for pain symptoms. Patients with Hunner lesions may also benefit from fulguration and/or triamcinolone injections, the guideline states.Major Surgery Substitution cystoplasty (bladder enlargement/augmentation) Urinary diversion, with or without cystectomy (bladder removal) The revised guideline emphasizes that major surgery is an option only \"for patients who have exhausted all other feasible options and whose symptoms are caused by the bladder\" and with a clinician's \"dedication to long-term care for the patient,\" the article states. Treatments to Avoid The revised guideline also lists treatments that should not be offered, including: Long-term antibiotic use Intravesical instillation of bacillus Calmette-Guerin outside of research settings High-pressure, long-duration hydrodistension Systemic (oral) long-term glucocorticoid usage, although it can be used to manage symptom flares in the short term. ICA UPDATE Summer 20227PERSPECTIVE SHIFT New thinking on chronic pain could revolutionize the IC journey. By Mark T onerICA UPDATE Summer 20229 Chronic pain is an inescapable part of so-called \"invisible diseases\" like intersti - tial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). But it's a lot more visible these days. Articles in The Washington Post , The New York Times , and elsewhere have focused on new thinking\u2014and treatments\u2014for chronic pain. Smartphone apps like Curable which focus on neuroscience-backed approache s treating persistent pain are available at our fingertips. The reality is that chronic pain has become almost impossible to ignore. In 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that 50 million adults in the U.S. are impacted by chronic pain. Many, like IC/BPS patients, suffer from overlapping chronic pain conditions with com - plex and overlapping symptoms that are difficult to differentiate and manage, including irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, and vulvodynia, among other chronic comorbidities. The good news is that over the past decade, new research about how the brain functions is leading to a sea change in how chronic pain is understoo d\u2014and may open the door for additional treatments. \"I don't use the term lightly, but I think we're in the middle of a para - digm shift of understanding what pain is,\" says Tony Buffington, DVM, Ph.D., a clinical professor at the University of California Davis. At the same time, the growing awareness can be a double-edged sword. With chronic pain increasingly recognized as a condition in its own right, the danger is that the underlying factors of less-understood conditions like IC/BPS could be dismissed as merely matters of the mind. \"What I tell my clients all the time is that yes, pain goes through the brain, but our brain is attached to our body,\" says Tacha Kasper, MA, LMFT. \"Does diet affect IC/BPS? Does mental health affect it? Yes. But we can also 'do all the right things,' and guess what\u2014you can still get a flare. Because it's a disease we don't know enough about.\" PAIN AND THE BRAIN The past decade has shifted the conversation about what pain is, how it's perceived, and the ways in which it can be treated. The research literature is complex and con - tinues to evolve, but it centers around a premise that healthcare professionals have always recognized but are now understanding in more detail: that the only organ capable of generating pain is the brain. Instead of pain coming from different parts of the body, the body\u2014and the nerves that connect it to the brain\u2014are sending the brain information about potential dangers. The brain, in turn, rapidly evaluates these electrical signals\u201450 times or more each second\u2014and determines how to respond. As a result, pain can represent dangers of all kind, not just physical damage. The brain uses pain as a signal \"to get us away from the danger, or to get the danger away from us,\" Buffington says, sometimes in unpredictable ways. For example, in extreme situations, people with serious injuries may not feel pain at all, while others may feel phantom pain in limbs or organs that have been removed. All of this does not mean that pain is \"all in your head,\" as has been said for decades to dismiss chronic pain and its impact on people with difficult-to-diagnose condi - tions like IC/BPS. Instead, what new research has determined is that pain is far more complex, interrelated, and difficult to pin down than once imagined.ICA UPDATE Summer 202210FOUR (OR MORE) TYPES OF PAIN Pain was once defined in two ways: as nociceptive \u2014meaning it is caused by tissue damage or inflammation somewhere in the body\u2014or neuropathic , meaning it is caused by an injury to the nervous system, such as a pinched nerve. Generally speaking, the type of pain was once an either/or determination, with pain researchers tending to assume pain was caused by physical damage or injury\u2014and if it wasn't, that something was wrong with the somatosensory system, the neu - ral network in the brain and body which manages the conscious perception of touch, pressure, pain, and other sensations. In either case, chronic pain was generally considered the result of an unaddressed injury\u2014for nociceptive pain, a physical injury that never fully healed, and for neuropathic pain, a nerve that was permanently damaged. However, there was an obvious problem with this model: large numbers of patients had a combination of physical and nervous system injuries\u2014and just as many had no obvious signs of either tissue or nervous system damage. And research - ers have long recognized that when pain persists, the brain's reaction to it changes in ways that intensifies the sensation or continues it even after the initial injury heals, a process often known as central sensitization. In 2017, the international community of pain researchers known as the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) formally adopted the term nociplastic for a third cate - gory of pain\u2014pain involving changes in how the central ner - vous system processes pain. Conditions like fibromyalgia, nonspecific chronic low-back pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and other \"functional\" visceral pain disorders such as IC/BPS may fall in this category. As an article by researchers published in the medical jour - nal The Lancet in 2021 states: \"The mechanisms that underlie this type of pain are not entirely understood, but it is thought that augmented central nervous system pain and sensory pro - cessing and altered pain modulation play prominent roles. The symptoms observed in nociplastic pain include multifocal pain that is more widespread or intense, or both, than would be expected given the amount of identifiable tissue or nerve dam - age, as well as other CNS-derived symptoms, such as fatigue, sleep, memory, and mood problems. This type of pain can occur in isolation, as often occurs in conditions such as fibro - myalgia or tension-type headache, or as part of a mixed-pain state in combination with ongoing nociceptive or neuropathic pain, as might occur in chronic low back pain. It is important to recognize this type of pain, since it will respond to different therapies than nociceptive pain, with a decreased responsive - ness to peripherally directed therapies such as anti-inflamma - tory drugs and opioids, surgery, or injections.\" Complicating matters further, the IASP also said that pain of psychological origin\u2014what Buffington calls spiritual or exis - tential pain, or \"the dark night of the soul\"\u2014should also be legitimately considered pain by clinicians, meaning there are four different kinds of pain to consider. Research is also increasingly focused on the impact of stress and trauma, includ - ing adverse childhood experiences, on chronic pain symptoms. There's also \"mixed pain,\" a term that has not been as formally defined but recognizes how easily the lines can blur across these definitions. In 2019, the IASP created a new definition of \"chronic pri - mary pain,\" stating that CPP is \"when pain has persisted for more than three months and is associated with significant emo - tional distress and/or functional disability, and the pain is not better accounted for by another condition.... with biological, psychological, and social factors contributing.\" It differentiates between CPP and \"chronic secondary pain,\" where pain was conceived as a symptom as part of an underlying disease. What new research has determined is that pain is far more complex, interrelated, and difficult to pin down than once imagined. WHERE IC/BPS FITS The challenge with IC/BPS is that it can be difficult to find a purely nociceptive source for pain\u2014in other words, obvious signs of tissue damage. When the bladder of an IC/BPS patient is examined with an endoscope, only a small percentage\u2014 maybe 5 to 10 percent\u2014have Hunner's ulcers, visible lesions associated with the condition. Many appear to have healthy bladders. Others have small bruises called glomerulations, which can also be found in the bladders of people without IC/ BPS or any other bladder pain, according to Buffington. They've also been found in cats and rodents who were subjected to environmental threats and resolve when the threat is removed, he adds. All this means that IC/BPS is generally considered a mixed, chronic, or nociplastic condition. \"You can make a pretty good argument that all chronic pain is mixed,\" Buffington says. And for good reason\u2014intense pain from chronic conditions causes real stressors\u2014\"are they going to live? Are they going to lose their job? Their family?\" Buffington asks. \"For IC/BPS patients, it's just amplified. There's a difference in degree, and not in kind.\" However, a lack of physical evidence of tissue damage may make some practitioners identify IC/BPS as only neuropathic or nociplastic\u2014which in a worst-case scenario can \"get inter preted as 'all in your head',\" Kasper cautions. \"People have to know whatever you're experiencing is true,\" she says. \"You can't do an MRI and definitely say 'you have depression and anxiety.' But we want to do that wit h IC/BPS. There are just way too many things out there that can't be seen on a scan or a blood test.\"The Interstitial Cystitis Association (ICA) makes no claims, promises, or guarantees about the accuracy of paid advertisements or the efficacy of the products represented. The ICA doe s not endorse any products.ICA UPDATE Summer 202212That's why it's so important to take a multimodal approach to treating IC/BPS, focusing on medical treatments to address symptoms as well as lifestyle changes, including diet, behavior change, and stress management. This approach was just reaf - firmed by the American Urological Association in its revised guidelines for treatment (see p. 6), which notes that no one treatment benefits a majority of patients. \"It's a combination,\" Kasper says. \"If my IC/BPS is managed but I get really upset, my stress goes up, which upregulates my system, which increases the likelihood that I will flare and expe - rience pain. That's the nociplastic, or nervous system, part where we have influence. But that doesn't mean all my pain can be managed this way.\" TRAINING THE BRAIN ON PAIN Now for the good news: The growing science around how the brain processes pain has also led to improvements in the inte - gration and types of therapy that can help the brain \"unlearn\" the signals that lead to persistent or upregulated pain. One such example is pain reprocessing therapy (PRT), which essentially involves managing emotions that may make pain feel worse or exacerbate symptoms. Along with therapy provided by mental health professionals, smartphone apps like Curable borrow from the principles of PRT. Kasper characterizes PRT as a combination of cognitive-be - havioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness, and acceptance and com - mitment therapy (ACT), all commonly used in psychotherapy. She says these approaches can help address catastrophic think - ing, ruminating, and other mental habits which can make phys - ical pain worse. For IC/BPS patients, the worst flares put you in \"survival mode,\" Kasper says, and the goal of integrative therapy is to avoid getting to that point as often, creating a better quality of life that can, over time, help reduce overall levels of pain. Despite promising results, PRT isn't a cure-all for all con - ditions. A 2021 clinical study of more than 150 patients found that two-thirds of patients reported being pain-free or nearly pain-free after four weeks of PRT\u2014far more than those who received placebo injections or other treatments. However, the patients in the study had mild to moderate chronic back pain, not IC/BPS or other chronic conditions. Kasper points to the distinction between chronic pain and chronic illness. \"If you have low back pain induced by a com - bination of stress, posture, and ergonomics, then a six- or eight- week program will likely make an impact,\" she says. However, some \"want to paint the entire [spectrum] of chronic illness this way\u2014that this is going to work for everybody,\" she adds. Kasper recommends a fully integrative therapeutic approach to training the brain and improving mental health. For people with complex and overlapping conditions, while PRT can be helpful, it's not enough. Most often, chronic illness and pain patients need brain training along with treatment to help with related depression, anxiety, grief, and trauma.WHAT'S NEXT Despite the dramatic changes in how pain is understood, much remains to be discovered. For IC/BPS patients, the uncertainty doesn't take away from the potential benefit of PRT and other strategies that may help alleviate\u2014if not resolve\u2014the symp - toms of chronic pain. That's particularly true because each patient is different, according to Buffington. \"We don't know whether nociplastic pain is making up 10 percent or 90 percent of what you're experiencing,\" he says. \"There's not a lot of good options for the nociceptive or neu - ropathic part of it\u2014so how about we work on the nociplastic part of it and see how much that helps?\" As the new AUA guideline suggests, it's also important to take a multifaceted approach to addressing chronic pain. In the pages that follow, we look at three different approaches to living and thriving with chronic pain conditions like IC/BPS. One involves managing our involuntary responses to stress (see p. 13). Another describes the THRIVE model, as illustrated by the real-world experiences of participants in a qualitative study of IC/BPS patients who reported good quality of life (see p. 18). The third details 10 steps that Buffington suggests can help manage the condition (see p. 16). Above all, it's most important to find safety and support, both in personal relationships and with healthcare providers who acknowledge IC/BPS and work with patients to treat its symptoms. Kasper says it's critical to move away from those who \"dismiss and demean\"\u2014whether it's a medical provider who doesn't recognize IC/BPS or a friend or family member who continues to say the pain is all in your head. \"We're not floating bodies without heads, and we're not floating heads without bodies,\" she says. \"You know your body better than anyone else. T rust your intuition and stick with what you know to be true for you, while also empowering yourself to get proper help.\" But it's also important to recognize the potential of what we're learning about how the brain processes pain. \"This par - adigm shift in chronic pain looks hopeful for IC/BPS because patients with IC/BPS and other diseases have been stuck in the wilderness for a long time. We don't know how much it's going to help, and who it's going to help the most,\" Buffing - ton says. \"But the hope for healing, the drive to live, is at least as strong in IC/BPS patients as it is in anybody else. There are so many places in science and medicine that got stuck until something resulted in a paradigm shift. That's where we are now. This is a very hopeful time for chronic pain because we have broken out of thinking it has to be this way.\" Mark Toner is editor of ICA Update. By Tacha Kasper, MA, LMFT Life with Interstitial Cystitis/ Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC / BPS) can become complicated and stressful. That's no sur - prise to any of us with this condition. What might be a surprise is how the mental and emotional impact of day- to-day life with IC/BPS can affect how you heal and how you experience your symptoms, often making them bet - ter or worse. We can stay in \"chronic survival mode,\" as it was called in a Harvard study and also referred to as chronic stress or an upregulated nervous system. Contrary to how helpful that sounds, studies show it's not helpful for your body or healing. Survival is just that\u2014going through the motions of keeping your head above water\u2014but it's exhausting, and our systems weren't made for chronic sur - vival. Conversely, learning how to thrive with IC/BPS can ease the mental and emotional toll and improve your quality of life. There's a big difference between surviving and thriving. As a licensed psychotherapist and self-proclaimed \"pain and neuroscience nerd,\" I've studied the biological, psychologi - cal, neurological, and social aspects of life with chronic pain and illness, and how to use them together to ease symptoms and improve the overall journey. In working with clients who have a variety of chronic health conditions, plus my own 17-year journey with IC/BPS as well as rare triple neg - ative breast cancer, I've had plenty of opportunity to put these strategies into practice and witness the improvement in the lives of others. Thriving involves healing, empowerment, and resilience. However, there's some societal notion that these things are either somehow gifted to us or not\u2014you've either got it or you do not. But that's not the truth! For the majority of people, they need to be learned. It is very normal to need help to learn how to cope\u2014it's not something we come automatically equipped with, and our body and brain need to be taught how to thrive. It can make a big difference in how you experience your illness and pain, as well as most aspects of your life. How Stress Affects Our System Let's start with the basics of how your nervous system responds to stress and how it affects everything else. Liv - ing with chronic pain and illness is a traumatic experi - ence because our mind and body is responding to what it understands to be a constant threat. When this happens, your brain responds to the chronic stress cycle and begins to hijack your nervous system, causing it to become upreg - ulated. That's just the mammal part of you\u2014and when we add on the psychological components of anxiety, rumi - nating on negative thoughts, hopelessness, over-thinking, future-tripping, etc.\u2014our system can get stuck in chronic survival mode. And then everything becomes a threat and feels very out of control. We have to learn how to stop this cycle. With IC/BPS, there is usually a clear medical and phys - ical component that needs to be addressed with your pri - mary medical doctors\u2014what I call your \"healing team.\" Historically, this hasn't included mental health. How - ever, we now know that we must include a more holistic, bio-psycho-social approach to healing and can no longer ignore addressing the components that drive our thoughts, feelings, behaviors, stress, narrative, relationships, and cul - tural aspects. The sad reality is that most IC/BPS patients have not received this kind of health management support, but this is changing\u2014starting now. As a matter of fact, the revised American Urological Association (AUA) guideline recognizes stress and states that treatment for IC/BPS includes: a) multiple therapeutic options, b) self-care practices and behavior modifications, and c) stress management practices to improve coping tech - niques and manage stress-induced symptom exacerbations (see p. 6). What the AUA is saying here is to get mental and emotional support from the beginning. These things include addressing psychoeducation and skill building for your mental health, neuroplasticity (your brain's ability to change), and emotional and stress management. Five Stress Responses That Affect Your System Let's discuss some basics of stress management\u2014how your brain and the neuroscience of your nervous system work. I promise not to bore you with the names of the areas of the brain! I liken our brain to an untrained puppy. Left on its own, it will cause havoc. But the puppy\u2014your brain\u2014can be trained with both good and not-so-good habits. When it comes to chronic illness and pain, we want to train our brain with the best habits. Our brain and our body are forever connected and communicating, and our body is always listening. Thriving or Surviving? How our stress response affects IC/BPS. ICA UPDATE Summer 202213I refer to the core \"reptilian\" part of our brain as the CEO. Your CEO is in charge of everything that comes in and goes out, monitoring all access at all times. Its only job is to keep you alive, so it's constantly scanning for infor - mation and threats. There are five main stress responses to identified threats, five things the CEO will do to keep you alive and well. Your CEO is excellent at its job, but sometimes it can become a micro-manager\u2014becoming hypervigilant and interpreting too many messages as active threats. Most of you have heard of the first two responses\u2014fight or flight. But there are three more. Just to give some con - text for all five, imagine a cave person, millions of years ago, walking along a path... when suddenly a lion jumps in front of them. (For us, the \"lion\" may be chronic ill - ness.) Your CEO is going to assess the threat and reallocate internal resources (energy, access to brain areas, blood sup - ply, etc.), which are managed by various hormones, namely adrenalin and cortisol. Your CEO is excellent at making millisecond decisions before you're even aware of it. This is the \"I don't know what to do\" stage. This can feel like we are stuck, can't move, numb, and are overwhelmed. 4. Flop: None of the above have worked, so we \"play dead\" in hopes of the lion losing interest and going away. This is the \"I can't, I just can't anymore\" stage. Flop is when we can feel hopeless, apathetic, and disengaged. Now what? \"I couldn't run or kill the lion. It hasn't left when I froze or played dead. What's left to do?\" 5. Fawn, or appease. This is where we try to become the lion's friend and be overly nice. \"Here kitty kitty...if I'm nice to you, then maybe you won't kill me.\" This is the root of people pleasing, trying to be perfect so the lion doesn't get upset, pleading, difficulty saying no, not holding boundaries, and not taking care of your own needs. Here's one key thing that happens when your system goes into a stress/threat response. Your CEO must reallo - cate resources\u2014remember earlier I mentioned \"access to parts of the brain?\" Well, our brain takes up most of our internal physical energy. In order to give you the energy for one of the five stress responses, your CEO will turn off, or drastically reduce, most access to your brain\u2014the important parts like memory, logic, and thinking. It does this because those parts require a lot of energy, and if you're dead (you didn't win against the lion), then it won't matter if you think or remember stuff. This is why when we are highly stressed or in chronic survival mode, we often become forgetful, can't think straight, have brain fog, can't remember what we said, etc. We see this in many cases within our lives\u2014examples such as not remembering something a doctor said in an appoint - ment after giving us some bad news, feeling constantly overwhelmed, having trouble keeping track of things, etc. The CEO wants, at all costs, to keep you safe. But \"safe\" is a relevant term. The CEO understands safe as \"alive\" and therefore keeps you in chronic survival mode. This is not beneficial for your overall health and system, especially when you have a chronic health condition. When you are in chronic survival mode, your body does not have\u2014or want to use\u2014any of the resources necessary to do the heal - ing work that you would like it to do. It literally doesn't heal because it doesn't have the energy resources. Thriving, Not Surviving Learning to thrive takes time and includes many aspects\u2014 but the foundation is rooted in managing our nervous sys - tem and getting out of chronic survival mode. There are things with IC/BPS that can't be controlled, but there is a lot that can be controlled, or at the very least influenced in a positive manner. Incorporating new stress management Here are the five main stress/threat responses that your CEO will choose to do to reestablish safety: 1. Fight: I will do whatever it takes to kill the lion. We tense our jaw and tighten our muscles to prepare to overtake the threat. We will say or do anything to win. This may look like irritability, talking back, anger, blaming, and attacking. 2. Flight , or run: I will do whatever it takes to run away from the lion. In this response, we can be highly anxious, panic, chronic worry, and avoidant. So what happens when neither of those work? 3. Freeze: When we can't kill the lion or run away from it, our system will resort to freezing, in hopes that the lion won't detect us and go away. ICA UPDATE Summer 202214skills to get your system out of a stress response and into a better managed (downregulated) state is an important step. We know that incorporating a mind-body approach to mental health allows clients to begin to truly listen and respond to their system and gives them better tools for self-management. Teaching people how to create a multi - faceted and personalized chronic pain and illness protocol helps them communicate and manage their unique symp - toms and is a critical part to learning how to thrive. The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) study is one of the largest investigations of the link between childhood trauma and health and well-being later in life. It argues that much of how we respond to stress and threats is based in our childhood experiences. It shows that this trauma, both abuse and neglect, encodes in our nervous system (known as epigenetics)\u2014and can often be intergeneration - ally passed on through epigenetic mechanisms. It states that toxic stress from ACEs can change brain development and affect how the body responds to stress. ACEs are linked to chronic health problems, mental illness, and substance misuse in adulthood\u2014making the person more suscep - tible to have chronic illness and pain, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and a shorter lifespan. This is why it's crit - ical when we address the stress management and mental health component of chronic pain and illness that we do so in a trauma-informed manner in order to help with more complete healing. Once we address and learn these things, we can set our system up for success by allowing it to have the energy to do the healing work we want it to do, as well as a better capacity to deal with and manage the mental and emo - tional distress in a healthy manner. Learning the differ - ence between surviving and thriving is so important to your overall quality of life. Being in chronic survival mode will not help you on your healing journey. It's so important to understand what your personal stress response tendency is\u2014and how to manage it. It's necessary to get help to learn these things\u2014it's not automatic. Don't let stigma stop you. Don't believe that there's something wrong with you for needing and want - ing help to live with a chronic health condition. There would be so much less suffering if we can normalize that we all need help to learn skills to thrive from the very start of our journey. We can each learn how to \"cultivate joy\" through our lives even in the day to day, mundane and difficult parts of life. We don't get a second go at this life. There's more in our control than we ever thought possible. Please know that your mental health and your emotional health is criti - cal and worth the effort to learn new skills to help heal and manage your IC/BPS. Stress management is just one part of things you can do to empower your healing. There are so many more coping mechanisms to learn. It does take effort and time, but the most important \"work\" you will ever do in your life is that of taking charge of your mind, body, and \"living fiercely,\" by creating the best ver - sion of your life.

ICA UPDATE Summer 202215Ten Steps Towards Healing Living with chronic pain is akin to a journey. Here are 10 ways to choose your own adventure. The growing research base on chronic pain has shown there is no one path to healing with a condition like IC/BPS. Tony Buffington, DVM, Ph.D., highlighted 10 in a recent ICA webinar focused on the journey of living with IC. Buffington pointed to Susanna Liller's \"Heroine's Journey,\" which casts the transition into a new phase of life\u2014a call to action\u2014as following a narrative similar to the hero's quests popularized by author Joseph Campbell. \"A call is uncomfortable. If you follow it, it takes you out of what you're used to and asks you to play in an arena that's new\u2014that you know little about,\" Liller writes on her website. \"A call is often accompanied by naysayers\u2014in your head and for real\u2014 that say things like, who do you think you are? But if your call is strong (and you're brave) then regardless of the naysayers ... you keep going. You can't not respond!\" Even so, Buffington's 10 points are more akin to the \"choose your own adventure\" books many of us read as children: \"This is way too much to take on at one time,\" said Buffington, a clinical professor at the University of California Davis. \"Pick one to start with. Depending on where you are in your journey and what your environment is like, one or more of these might be more relevant in your road to recovery.\" 1. SAFETY \"Pain is really a warning about danger somewhere\u2014either about tissue damage or something in our environment,\" Buffington said. \"For example, when people don't believe you or a doctor says they can't find something wrong, that results in social pain.\" Buffington also points to the \"dark night of the soul\" of existential (spiritual) pain. The solution? Look to your surroundings. \"Try to notice how you feel when you're in different places with different people,\" Buffington said. \"If you notice you're feeling worse, that may cue you that there's something about that situation your brain is warning you about. You might even think of it as your superpower early warning system!\" 2. SELF-COMPASSION Simply put, self-compassion is about treating yourself the same way you would treat someone else with chronic pain. \"Chronic pain is real pain, and you deserve help on your jour - ney, not blame and shame from anyone who doesn't understand,\" Buffington said.3. COACHING A coach can serve as a companion on your journey. Professional health and wellness coaches are trained to provide support and guidance for those facing chronic pain or trying to achieve health goals (see the Winter 2022 issue of ICA Update for more). But even less formal relationships can help guide you. \"Anyone who believes in you will help you,\" Buffington said. 4. PATIENCE Recovery is as complex as pain itself. \"It takes time,\" Buffington said. \"It can also be frustrating. Sometimes IC can take over your whole life and require you to think about becoming a new person in a new world, like coming out of a cocoon. It can be a real struggle.\" 5. HEALTHCARE The most important thing about your healthcare providers is finding ones who \"believe you and trust you,\" Buffington said. While too many practitioners aren't aware of IC/BPS, those who trust their patients may be willing to learn. And it's important to stay connected to healthcare providers who can monitor other changes, as IC/BPS patients often have or develop overlapping chronic pain syndromes\u2014or unrelated urinary issues, according to Buffington. ICA UPDATE Summer 2022166. YOUR HISTORY Knowledge is power. Research suggests there are genetic and familial predisposi - tions to IC/BPS, according to Buffington. \"If you don't know about people in your family, ask about IC/BPS and other chronic pain conditions,\" he said. But there may be broader factors that impact chronic pain. Adverse experiences that impact someone in childhood\u2014 or even their mother when pregnant\u2014can \"sensitize you to your environment,\" Buffington said, pointing to research in cats with IC/BPS showing that cats with these kinds of expe - riences can improve when their environments become safer and more predictable. 7. YOUR SOCIAL\u2014AND PHYSICAL\u2014WORLD Humans are social by nature, and conflicts among friends, family, or at work can affect our physical and mental health. But so can our physical environment, and things like noise and crowded or dangerous environments \"are being moni - tored by our body and brain to let us know if we're safe or in danger,\" Buffington said. 8. WHAT LIFE MEANS TO YOU Living with IC/BPS is one thing; living life with meaning in the face of IC/BPS is another. There are many ways to find meaning: your relationships and social world if it is positive\u2014\"when you have family and friends and healthcare providers who support you,\" Buffington said. Spirituality, whether religious or not, and even being in the presence of nature can provide strength and peace. 9. EMPOWERING YOURSELF Taking control of a condition like IC/BPS by \"making choices you believe in\" is important, according to Buffington. However, doing so \"requires safety,\" he said. \"It helps to have trusted and trusting care, and feeling heard and validated for who you are as a person. You are not IC/BPS. You're a person in your own right.\"10. CONTINUING ON YOUR JOURNEY One of the challenges of IC/BPS is that it \"isn't one ill, one pill, one bill medicine.\" Living successfully with a chronic pain condition is more like bathing or brushing your teeth, according to Buffington. \"It takes effort every day\u2014just like life,\" he said. \"It's the work of a lifetime.\" To watch the webinar, visit bit.ly/ic-10steps . ICA UPDATE Summer 2022A Model for Living With IC/BPS The IC Hope research study highlights coping strategies proven across multiple chronic illnesses. A picture is worth a thousand words. One of the participants in a research sur - vey focused on living with IC/BPS included a photo of a box in her written reflections. \"It's like this closed off, sealed off box,\" she wrote. \"And that's how I feel sometimes with IC because so many people don't really understand it or have a misconception... and people can't get in because they don't understand, or maybe part of it is even that I don't want to let them in.\" But that's not the only picture of life with IC/BPS. Other study participants shared photos of warmed blankets and soothing natural surroundings, loved family members and pets, water flasks and smartphone apps showing the number of steps they walked in a day\u2014even snapshots taken with a friend before skydiving and a tattoo that reminds its owner of the healing power of music. Conducted by ICA Vice Chair Dr. Laura Santurri, PhD, MPH, CPH, and colleagues at the University of Indianap - olis with the assistance of ICA, the IC Hope study focused on identifying IC/BPS patients who report average to above average physical and mental health\u2014\"people living with this condition who are doing fairly well.... to learn about how they cope with the condition,\" Santurri said during a webinar held by ICA earlier this year. In 2019, ICA solicited responses to an online survey for the study; more than 540 IC/BPS patients responded. As a group, respondents had lower self-reported physical and mental health scores than the general population\u2014as one might expect when living with a chronic pain condition. But researchers ultimately narrowed responses to a smaller group of participants with physical and mental health scores comparable to the general population. Nine were ultimately selected for a qualitative study, which included interviews, journals, and photography. While the group was small and homog - enous\u2014mostly female, middle aged, and all white\u2014all also have lived with IC/BPS for between one and thirty years. ICA UPDATE Summer 202218What Santurri and researchers learned from this group lined up with a broader model of coping with chronic pain called THRIVE. First published in the peer-reviewed journal Health Psychology Open in 2018, the model is based on a literature review suggesting that patients found common biological, psychological, and social coping strategies across a wide range of chronic illnesses. Among them: Therapeutic Interventions Medical treatments and other healthcare-provided interventions can be a challenging area for IC/BPS patients, given the difficulties of being diagnosed and the complexity of overlapping conditions. Multiple participants discussed the feeling of relief from getting diagnosed, followed by the sense of grief and loss from knowing there's no known cure for IC/BPS. Said one, \"I have to live with it, and it's not going to go away.\" Patients spoke about treatments that did work for them, including Interstim, antihistamines, and pelvic floor physical therapy. Their experiences with providers also suggest how they can help in the face of a lack of medical treatments that work equally well for every patient, which remains the reality with IC/BPS. Said one, \"I think it's important for [health - care providers] to understand that a doctor that is willing to put in the time and effort to learn and do research on their own... means so much. Because we want people to support us, and we want to feel like even if our doctors don't know all the answers, they're willing to go look for them vs. just writing us off.\" Habits and Routines Regular habits and routines are not just important in managing a condition like IC/BPS\u2014they actively involve patients in their care. \"Right now, nobody is managing my IC but me,\" one participant said. \"Everybody's going to give you their opinion, but you have to try different things and see what works best for you.\" Participants talked about supplements such as aloe vera and acid reducers, as well as taking hot baths, using heating pads, staying hydrated, exercising, wearing less restrictive clothing, controlling their diets, and being in nature as ways they managed symptoms. Overall, \"most of these strategies came with a sense of personal power and control,\" Santurri said. \"Once people fig - ured out what worked for them, they had a variety of tools in their toolkit they could go to.\"T H R I V EHabits and routinesTherapeutic interventions Relational and social factors Individual differences Values and beliefs Emotional factors ICA UPDATE Summer 202219Relational and Social Factors For IC/BPS patients, relationships can be challenging and rewarding in equal parts. For example, some participants pointed to a lack of understanding among those around them with unflinching honesty: \"Those are the people you want to punch.\" Physical intimacy was singled out as a challenge. But others focused on the support they received from friends and family: \"With diet, I try really hard. I find I cheat if it's around. So my family pretty much fol - lows the IC diet, too.\" In similar fashion, participants saw online communities and social media as both good and bad, depending largely on whether those groups focus on the negative or the pos - itive. \"I try to associate myself with the more positive and uplifting people in those groups,\" one said. \"It might give me something to add to my toolbox,\" another added. \"I just feel like, okay, if they made it through the day, then I can make it through the day too.\" Individual Differences A common thread among this group of IC/BPS patients: an emphasis on hope, resilience, perseverance, courage, and confidence. \"I feel hopeful.... we will conquer IC during my lifetime,\" one said. \"What gives me hope is that I've been able to deal with this so far, and I think deal with it in a positive way and find options and just ways to cope,\" another said. \"So that makes me feel hopeful that I can continue on like this.\" Participants' responses suggest that mindset can make a difference. \"I definitely know that I'm in a place, emotion - ally, spiritually, where I can live a good life with IC, and IC doesn't control me anymore,\" one said. Values and Beliefs Study participants emphasized the importance of spirituality\u2014 either with or without a religious element\u2014as providing a sense of control, comfort, and joy. A second, equally important ele - ment involves acceptance. \"I've certainly gone on a journey, and this journey will continue,\" one said. \"It's not going to go away, you know, [so I] enjoy the time that I have when it isn't so bad.\" Emotional FactorsWays to THRIVE Participants' responses suggest that IC/BPS isn't an outlier in terms of how people can successfully manage chronic pain conditions. Their experiences suggest that \"there are internal and external factors that influence how we cope, and thus likely influence our outcomes with our condi - tion,\" Santurri said. The authors of the THRIVE model agree, stating that \"focusing on relevant internal factors (such as personal habits, individual differences and preferences, values and beliefs, and emotional factors), as well as seeking out rele - vant external resources (such as therapeutic interventions and social support) is a fruitful strategy to think about cop - ing as a complex and multifaceted task. We note that inter - nal and external factors are not mutually exclusive of each other and often work together in a synergistic fashion.\" Where to start? T wo potential areas include: Focusing on habits and routines that support self-management\u2014although with IC/BPS, what those look like vary from person to person. Paying close attention to relationships with oth - ers, including focusing on positive elements of online communities and social media, and the family and friends who help them live their lives. Doing so can lead to a dramatic shift in perspective. Going back to the image of the box we began with, the participant who described how isolating IC/BPS felt offered a silver lining. \"It does have latches and a combination... there is a way to open the box and open myself up to the challenges of feeling closed off.\" To watch a webinar about the IC Hope study by Laura Santurri, visit bit.ly/ICHopeStudy . To read more about the THRIVE frame - work, visit bit.ly/IC-THRIVE .The final letter in THRIVE involves a range of emotions, both positive and negative. Among them is loss and grief for a normal life: \"It feels like part of your identity was taken away,\" one said. Embarrassment in social settings and frustration about receiving medication and the lack of sleep and other symptoms associated with IC/BPS rounded out the negative emotions. However, \"a lot of gratitude and hope was expressed,\" Santurri said. \"I am not my illness,\" one respondent said. \"I believe that the universe supports me, is teaching me, and helping me to lead a healthy life,\" another added.\"Everybody's going to give you their opinion, but you have to try different things and see what works best for you.\" ICA UPDATE Summer 202220Pain, Medication, and Access to Care For IC/BPS patients, the lingering effects of the opioid epidemic continues to impact their ability to receive pain medication. Three patients share their thoughts. The nation's opioid epidemic has cast a long shadow over the use of pain medications of all kinds and created additional challenges for chronic pain patients, who often find it much more difficult to obtain\u2014or even maintain\u2014access to pain management. That's been particularly challenging for a condition like IC/BPS, which is little understood and doesn't always have visible physical symptoms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is currently revising its 2016 opioid pain guidelines, which included specific limits on dosage and lengths of prescriptions that had a ripple effect across insurance companies and pharmacies. Those rigid limits have been removed from the current draft guidelines, and ICA and other patient advocacy groups are providing feedback calling for greater access to medication for chronic pain patients as part of a public review process (see p. 2). Even so, concerns about ensuring that physicians can provide individualized patient care persist. \"It's not just about IC/BPS, but pain medication in general for any patient,\" says ICA Board member Theda Khrestin. ICA Update spoke with Khrestin and two other members of the ICA Board of Directors, Amber Carter and Tacha Kasper, MA, LMFT. Each described their own personal struggles, the challenges involved in access to pain medication, and advice for others. AMBER CARTER TACHA KASPER THEDA KHRESTIN ICA UPDATE Summer 202221Forum What has your own experience with pain medication been like? Carter: I was diagnosed with IC back in 2007. I was very young\u201424. I live in Orlando, but my urologist is in Texas, and I've been going there since 2009. He can only prescribe for a limited time out of state, and locally, my primary doctor moved and it's hard to have another doctor sign on to pain management. She had heard of IC/BPS, but didn't understand what it was. I explained it to her, and she asked what my pain felt like. Then came the question\u2014have you tried ibuprofen or Tylenol? In the end, in order for her to prescribe [medications] for me, I had to bring her the surgical report and the photos of my bladder from the urologist. That's fine\u2014I've got nothing to hide\u2014but that's lots of extra steps. Khrestin: My original urologist was very old school and not up to date on IC/BPS, but he was part of a generation of doctors who accepts that if you have pain, you should have relief. So he gave me a prescription for T ramadol for when nothing was working to help with the major flares. Since I first had IC/ BPS in 2013, I have used it consistently but very sparingly\u2014 maybe once a month. If I'm in a massive flare and I feel like I can't walk, I'll take it. They never gave me much trouble about refilling it. Then I broke my ankle in three places and had major sur - gery\u2014I have 12 pieces of hardware in my ankle. The surgeon said to take Tylenol. My regular doctor said the ankle did create a really bad flare, [but asked] if I had ever talked to a psychiatrist. They thought I was using T ramadol as a coping mechanism. I understand there's an overcorrection because of the opioi d epidemic, but if you have a diagnosed pain condition, you should have the ability to get access to medication.Kasper: I have this unique parallel\u2014my IC/BPS experience with pain management before and after cancer. I had IC/BPS for a solid 11 years, and then I got cancer. How they treat me in the pain world as a cancer survivor is totally different\u2014there are almost no questions asked. If you're a doctor and deny pain management medications to a cancer patient, you would be seen as the scourge of the earth. Yet when an IC/BPS patient is denied the same medications, there's no negative impact on the provider. What do you see as the biggest issues that make it difficult for IC/BPS patients to have access to pain medication? Carter: The main one is the lack of understanding. Obviously, the majority of us look fine on the outside, vs. those where they can see they broke their leg. \"I understand there's an overcorrection because of the opioid epidemic, but if you have a diagnosed pain condition, you should have the ability to get access to medication.\" We almost feel bad asking for medication\u2014it's like there's a stigma attached to that. I feel awkward any time I'm asking for it, because I don't want to come across as any kind of addic t. We shouldn't feel this way. Kasper: The biggest challenge is that providers don't work to understand the complexity of a patient's situation but rather respond through the lens of stigma. They assume, dismiss, and demean instead of reading charts and connecting with patients to learn their unique situation and pain management needs. The responsibility falls to the patient. I had a client whose doc - tor left a practice, and the new doctor said they weren't going to give them the medications anymore without even a conver - sation with the client. Talk about dismissing and demeaning. Carter: Because IC/BPS has so many different kinds of pain, you get so many types of medication. Yes, maybe you have a narcotic, but on top of that, I have muscle relaxers, valium, all these other things that work to control the spasming besides the general pain. I've been questioned on this because they're all considered downers. Even though they're all being used to treat the pain of IC/BPS, together they get questioned. ICA UPDATE Summer 202222Forum \"Be patient, be diligent, and continue advocating for yourself.\" ICA UPDATE Summer 202223Khrestin: Because symptoms vary so widely in the IC commu - nity, finding non-narcotic relief can be difficult and take time. It is important that patients are able to access pain medication while also exploring the right medication and/or techniques to improve their quality of life without it. Kasper: T rue chronic pain people in my experience are not the addicts. They may get to the point of a certain amount of dependence, but they're not the people who are taking extra medications and smashing them and snorting them. Their behavior is the opposite of what an addict would do\u2014skipping doses and saving medications so they don't run out (just in case). Drug testing is often a condition of receiving pain medication. What does that look like for IC/BPS patients? Carter: They do drug tests randomly. I never had an issue, but after my primary doctor left, my new doctor said it was time to do the test, and it came back negative for narcotics\u2014becau se it's an as-needed medication. There was maybe a three-month period where I don't use all of them, and then there are times when you definitely need it. But because the test came back negative, she refused to prescribe it because I could potentially be selling it on the street. She wasn't thinking of it as a chronic, as-needed medication. What is this telling chronic pain patients? IC/BPS patients often have to see many doctors before receiving a diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Does that lead to added challenges? Carter: Pharmacies are now really cracking down on doctor shop - ping\u2014they and physicians can all see everything. Honestly, that may be a good thing for people trying to get pain management because you really can't doctor shop any more. It's impossible to get multiple prescriptions from other doctors. How can the medical community balance the very real impact of the opioid epidemic with the needs of chronic pain patients? Khrestin: It's the question the whole country is asking\u2014how do you keep the teenager who breaks their back from becoming a heroin addict? It's a big slippery slope. But if you have some - one who is actually diagnosed with an actual disease, the pain should be addressed.It's hard to know how doctors are even trained about this. My sense is the younger, fresher doctors are way more difficult about giving medications than those practicing for 40 years. But phys - ical pain isn't overcome simply through therapy. It's a real thing. What advice would you give others for navigating the process of receiving pain medication? Carter: If people have initial photos from when they were diag - nosed, or anything from hydrodistention where you can watch the progression, keep them. As strange as it was for my doctor to ask for actual photos of my bladder, it was import - ant. A lot of people need something they can see, which is unfortunate because not all people with IC/BPS have phys - ical signs that can be seen. Unfortunately, people just have to look for an understand - ing doctor, and there's a lot of due diligence on the patient's part. It's not an easy process\u2014even a couple of years ago I went to a local urologist as a backup, and he told me the best thing to do for a flare would be to go sit in the ocean for two hours a day. But ultimately you will find someone. Go on ICA's web - site and look for people who specialize in IC, or talk to people in your support group. Be patient, be diligent, and continue advocating for yourself. Do you see reasons for optimism? Khrestin: ICA's focus on reclassifying IC to IC/BPS\u2014bladder pain syndrome\u2014is an acknowledgment of the issue writ large. Reshaping the narrative will help doctors, patients and the public understand this is a chronic pain disease. It'll have pos - itive long term effects. Kasper: Yes! With the CDC working to change the problems and stigma they created, advances in pain science and updated ICD codes, and enough advocacy from patients with chronic pain and illness now motivating the medical community to agree that these patients can use a variety of pain manage - ment medications responsibly\u2014which is exactly what they were made for. I'm grateful for the critical role that the ICA plays in this.Join ICA's Angel Society \u2014 Become a Monthly Donor Be an ICA Angel with your convenient, tax-deductible monthly donation.
