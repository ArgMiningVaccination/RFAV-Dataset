Although each session is customized to fit a client's needs, here are just a few styles used during a treatment: SWEDISH MASSAGE Most commonly offered and best known type of massage. Swedish massage uses long, firm, but gentle pressure strokes, kneading, and circular movement on superficial layers of muscle. Swedish massage therapy can be very relaxing to the body. It also improves the circulation, eases muscle aches and tension, while improving flexibility. DEEP TISSUE MASSAGE Deep tissue massage is a type of massage aimed at the deeper tissue structures of the muscle and fascia, also known as connective tissue. The massage consists of slower strokes or friction across the grain of the muscle. This is a more focused type of massage. Deep tissue massage is used for chronically tight or painful muscles, repetitive strain, posture problems, or recovery from injury. SHIATSU Shiatsu is a form of Japanese bodywork that uses localized finger pressure in a rhythmic sequence on acupuncture meridians to clear blockages. Each point is held for 2 to 8 seconds to improve the flow of energy and help the body regain balance. SPORT MASSAGE Sports massage is specifically designed for people who are involved in physical activity. You don't have to be a professional athlete to get one. It's also beneficial to anyone who is active and works out often. The focus isn't on relaxation, but on preventing and treating injury and enhancing athletic performance. A combination of techniques are used. The strokes are generally faster than Swedish massage and facilitated stretching loosens muscles and increases flexibility. NEUROMUSCULAR THERAPY This is the most effective type of massage therapy for rotator cuff and carpal tunnel pain. Neuromuscular Therapy consists of alternating levels of concentrated pressure on the area of a muscle spasm. This therapy is used to reset the neuromuscular junction to relieve the nerve entrapment that causes pain and numbness. REFLEXOLOGY Reflexology is a form of bodywork that focuses primarily on the feet. The underlying theory behind reflexology is that there are \"reflex\" areas on the feet and hands that correspond to specific organs, glands, and other parts of the body. There are many additional physical and mental benefits of massage including: Relaxes the whole body Rejuvenates tired and aching muscles Increases flexibility and range of motion Calms the nervous system Lowers blood pressure Lowers heart rate Enhances skin tone Strengthens the immune system Reduces tension headaches Improves concentration Promotes restful sleep "}
