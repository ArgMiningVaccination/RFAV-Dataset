ALAMEDA COUNTY HEALTH CARE SERVICES AGENCY STAFF Colleen Chawla Agency Director Rebecca Gebhart Finance Director James Nguyen Administrative Services Officer Connie Soriano Administrative Specialist IIFY 2015/2016 Measure A Executive Summary (July 1, 2015 - June 30, 2016) ABOUT THE MEASURE A O VERSIGHT COMMITTEE One of the provisions of Measure A required the establishment of a Citizen Oversight Committee. The Committee's role is to annually review Measure A expenditures for each fiscal year and report to the Alameda County Board of Supervisors (Board) on whether such expenditures conform to the purposes set forth in the measure. The Measure states: \"The citizen oversight committee shall annually review the expenditure of the essential health care services tax fund for the prior year and shall report to the board of supervisors on the conformity of such expenditures. \" The Oversight Committee spent several months reviewing allocation reports, highlighting accomplishments while deliberating and communicating concerns to providers, and reviewing and editing the Measure A report. The Committee used the report forms returned by most Measure A fund recipients, along with information from several provider presentations, to review all funding allocations. OVERALL CONCLUSION The Oversight Committee found that Alameda Health System (AHS) and other recipients of the sales tax revenue spent the funds in compliance with the provisions of Measure A. The Oversight Committee did have concerns for a small number of allocations. These concerns are noted in this Executive Summary and in the individual report summaries for the relevant providers. History of the Measure Measure A, the Essential Health Care Services Initiative, was passed by 71% of Alameda County voters in March 2004. In June 2014, 76% of voters passed Measure AA, which extended the initiative through 2034. Both measures authorize the County of Alameda to raise its sales tax by one-half cent to provide additional financial support for emergency medical, hospital inpatient, outpatient, public health, mental health, and substance abuse services to indigent, low income, and uninsured adults, children, families, seniors, and other residents of Alameda County . A AA 3Measure A generated $137,233,576* in FY 15/16. Highlights Since the full implementation of the Affordable Care Act in 2014, more than 40,000 newly eligible County residents have been enrolled into the state's Medi-Cal program, and more than 64,000 residents have been enrolled in Covered California. Despite these achievements to increase the number of individuals who have health insurance, an estimated 133,234 individuals, or 8.3% of County residents, remain uninsured according to the American Community Survey estimates for 2016. Thus, Measure A revenues continue to play a critical role in helping indigent, uninsured, and low income residents of Alameda County\u2014who depend on the County's health care safety net\u2014maintain access to essential health services. With regard to Measure A recipient reporting, the Committee recognizes an ongoing trend of improvement in the quality and level of detail in the reporting process compared to prior years. This is due in part to the ongoing effort of the Committee and the Health Care Services Agency (HCSA) to improve the accountability of Measure A recipients byDISTRIBUTION OF MEASURE A FUNDS 25% 75%Of the $137,233,576 that Measure A generated in FY 15/16, AHS received 75%, and the remainder of the funds was distributed by the Board to many health care providers who provide essential health care services. 17% 81%2% Behavioral ServicesPopulation Health Care26% 17% 33% 24%Hospital, Tertiary Care, Other the Board of Supervisors Measure A Funding Approved by Allocati on of Measure A Funds toAlameda Does not include interest earned. ** Board allocations are made in advance of a given fiscal year. Therefore, the amount generated by Measure A for that year does not equal the amount allocated by the Board. 4implementing a Results-Based Accountability framework to help providers report measurable performance data that describes the effort, quality, and impact of their programs and services. Countywide Benefits Measure A funds continue to support the health and well-being of large numbers of County residents. AHS alone served 129,805 County residents through Measure A in FY 15/16, while the Alameda County Public Health Department Public Health Prevention Initiative served 129,388. In addition, Measure A contributes to positive outcomes for residents throughout the County, with recipient providers located in every Supervisory District in cities from Fremont to Livermore to Berkeley. Substantial Return on Investment A large number of Measure A recipients leveraged their allocations to receive matching funds from other sources. For the 25% of Measure A funds allocated by the Board, recipients leveraged their allocations to obtain a total of $13.3 million in matching funds. Thus, every $1 in Measure A funds to these recipients returned $0.40 in matching funds. For some recipients, the matching funds represented a return greater than 1:1. Safe Alternatives to Violent Environments (SAVE) obtained almost $85,000 in matching funds on its $40,000 Measure A allocation. Fremont Aging and Family Services obtained almost $200,000 in matching funds on its $52,000 Measure A allocation. Most notably, the School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative obtained over $6,000,000 in matching funds on its $617,000 Measure A allocation, while the School Health Centers obtained almost $12,000,000 in matching funds on an allocation of roughly $1,250,000. Exceeding Expectations Many Measure A recipients exceeded their target numbers for clients served, sometimes dramatically. Serving a larger number of clients with a given allocation translates to a lower per-client cost. For example, La Familia greatly exceeded its targets for providing information to low income residents (4,822 actual vs. 1,200 target, an increase of over 400%) and providing health care application assistance (933 actual vs. 133 target, an increase of over 700%). HIV Education and Prevention Project of Alameda County exceeded its target for one-on-one Overdose Prevention Education and Naloxone Distribution trainings by 158%. Fremont Aging and Family Services conducted 729 home visits to 122 clients, compared to a target of 350 home visits to 85 clients. And LifeLong Heart2Heart reached 865 residents through mobile outreach compared to a target of 200, and provided 1,696 visits to the hypertension clinic compared to a target of 500.AHS alone served 129,805 County residents through Measure A in FY 15/16, while the Alameda County Public Health Department Public Health Prevention Initiative served 129,388. 5$13.3 millionClient Satisfaction In surveys, recipients of Measure A-funded services revealed high levels of satisfaction with their provider and care received. For youth receiving behavioral health services through the Center for Healthy Schools and Communities School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative, 96% stated that they were satisfied with the service they received, and 91% reported that they got the help they wanted. At Preventive Care Pathways, 100% of residents rated the medical care they received as good or very good. And at Tiburcio Vasquez Health Center, Inc., 100% of respondents expressed that health center staff helped them get services they wouldn't otherwise get. Measurable Success Provider recipient reporting continues to improve in providing metrics for client outcomes. Among the measurable results provided, Highland Hospital's Outpatient Pharmacy reported that average wait times have decreased from three to four hours to no more than 30 minutes. At UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland, 100% of children who received Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy demonstrated clinical progress. And at the Health Services for Day Laborers: Community Initiatives Day Labor Center, 100% of clients who required follow-up care received the care they needed, and 100% of uninsured clients were signed up for health coverage. Innovative Services Measure A funding supports a wide variety of services that support the health and well-being of the target population. In addition to traditional medical and mental/behavioral health service providers, Measure A recipients in FY 15/16 included the Connecting Kids to Coverage Initiative, which provides health insurance application assistance; the Alameda-Contra Costa Medical Association Community Health Foundation/East Bay Conversation Project and the National Health Care Decisions Day, which promote understanding and engagement in advance care planning; and the Alameda County Breastfeeding Coalition Childcare Taskforce, which promotes and supports breastfeeding through education, collaboration, and partnership. Youth Outcomes A number of providers reported on improved mental and behavioral health outcomes for youth. The Center for Healthy Schools and Communities School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative reported that students who received group or individual services presented statistically significant improvements in life functioning (38%), behavioral/emotional needs (51%), and school success (37%) from intake to discharge. Youth participating in the Mind Body Awareness program at the Juvenile Justice Center revealed a decrease in stress (87%) and an increase in self-control (83%). Measure A AllocationMatching Funds$34.3 million The recipients of the 25% of Measure A funds allocated by the Board obtained $13.3 million in matching funds from public and private sources. 6Concerns In developing this report, the Oversight Committee identified several concerns regarding the state of health care funding both during the years of Measure A implementation (2004-2016) and in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, many families, especially those living in disadvantaged communities, have not benefitted from the economic recovery in recent years and face rising housing and living costs, which significantly impact the health of County residents. In 2015, an estimated 18,000 to 23,000 County residents experienced homelessness, according to the Health Care for the Homeless Needs Assessment. As the housing and homelessness crisis continues to grow in Alameda County, Measure A continues to play a vital role in providing essential health services to many vulnerable residents, including low income families and seniors. The Committee urges Alameda County to pay close attention to public health policy changes that relate to homelessness and housing affordability that may have significant impacts on health care access or the County's safety net. Moreover, Medi-Cal rate reductions and other funding cuts over the past several years have continued to decrease the ability of health providers to offer services to the expanded Medi-Cal and uninsured populations in the County. Realizing the full promise of these reforms presents a significant challenge as the health care delivery system remains fragmented, eligibility systems are cumbersome and difficult to negotiate, and access to care continues to be compromised by low reimbursement rates and a shortage of providers\u2014particularly in primary and preventive care. Measure A will continue to serve as an essential revenue stream in developing creative and innovative ways to improve access to care, lower the cost of care, and improve the patient experience. This in turn helps promote equity in health care service delivery by addressing the root causes of poor health outcomes. RECOMMENDATION: The Board should make a public announcement that Measure A funding is open to all organizations so that eligible organizations become aware of this funding opportunity and learn how to apply. Outside the area of health care funding, the Committee recognizes that the composition of the Committee has improved in reflecting the diverse make-up of the population served by Measure A. RECOMMENDATION: Recruitment of Oversight Committee membership should place an ongoing focus on representing the diverse make-up of the population served by Measure A. 7Regarding Measure A funding, the Committee raises the following concerns. NOTE : The Committee believes it is important to present any concerns it noticed while reviewing Measure A recipient reports. At the same time, the Committee wants to make clear that raising a concern does not necessarily mean that a problem exists with a recipient's use of Measure A funds. For example, the concern may arise because of incomplete or inaccurate reporting, not because of any inappropriate use of funds. Reporting and Review Concerns The Committee expresses an ongoing concern that the County Counsel's interpretation of the Measure A ordinance limits the Committee's ability to review program efficacy and cost-effectiveness. The Oversight Committee believes that the interpretation of the statute must be revised to expand the role of the Committee and appropriately allocate Measure A funds for administrative staff to oversee the contracts and ensure the effective use of public funds to all grantees\u2014via audit or other method. As part of its role in providing fiscal oversight, the Committee recognizes a need for providers and HCSA to work together to evaluate the long-term impact of Measure A investments in Alameda County. Although reporting continues to improve, the Committee expresses the ongoing concern that its review is impacted by the varying level of detail provided in fund recipient reports, as well as varying levels of responsiveness to specific questions posed by the Committee to specific recipients. This makes it difficult for the Committee to determine whether funding is being spent on the Measure A target population. For example:- Multiple provider reports listed objectives that are not measurable and/or stated positive outcomes without quantifying the statements. - For some reports, it is unclear whether the target population falls within one of the categories listed in the Measure A statute: \"indigent, low income, and uninsured adults, children, families, seniors, and other residents of Alameda County. \" - In other reports, the provider's description of the services offered raises questions as to their relevance to the wording of the Measure A statute. RECOMMENDATION: HCSA should receive funding to create a process for Measure A recipients to verify that they are using Measure A funds to provide their described programs to the populations listed in the measure. This process can include HCSA staff providing training to Measure A recipients on how to effectively collect demographic data to report on the diverse population of indigent, uninsured, and low income clients they serve by race, ethnicity, geography, and language. The Oversight Committee notes that many Measure A recipients do not understand the difference between quality and impact objectives and outcomes. Many 8Measure A recipients also could not provide the specific composition of the demographics that they serve. The Committee further advocates that HCSA be sufficiently staffed to successfully implement such a process. RECOMMENDATION: Organizations that do not provide adequate information in response to HCSA and Oversight Committee requests may not be considered for future funding. RECOMMENDATION: The Board should authorize HCSA to include evaluations of Measure A programs as part of its initiative to improve oversight and outcomes in all its programs. This includes identifying additional funding to ensure that Measure A contracts are included in the initiative. RECOMMENDATION: HCSA should put a process in place to improve the measurable objectives and outcomes reported by providers. RECOMMENDATION: 10% of Measure A recipients should undergo a formal audit each year to track whether money is being spent in accordance with the wording and intent of the measure. RECOMMENDATION: HCSA should continue to hold trainings to reinforce proper and accurate completion of demographic information and adherence to Measure A services. Measure A recipients who fail to complete the reporting form adequately will be required to attend mandatory training. RECOMMENDATION: HCSA should continue to work with recipients to improve the use of Results-Based Accountability performance measures and ensure that the population and services supported with Measure A comply with the ordinance. RECOMMENDATION: HCSA should refine the recipient reporting form to include a question about service delivery in multiple languages, as language barriers can potentially impede access to services for members of the Measure A target population. Alameda Health System In response to questions from the Measure A Oversight Committee, neither Mr. David Cox, CFO, nor Mr. Terry Lightfoot, Director of Public Affairs and Community Engagement, were able to: Determine what portion of Measure A funds were allocated to personnel, subcontracted services, non-personnel program and/or operating expenses, or administrative overhead, separate from their overall agency budget for these categories. Determine what portion of Measure A funds were allocated to the actual number of staff supported, separate from their entire agency staff of 3,415. 9 Determine what portion of Measure A funds were allocated to the actual number of individuals served, separate from the agency total of 43,039 individual patients. Explain why in their Measure A allocation report they identified 17% of their patients as being \"uninsured, \" whereas in their presentation of September 2016 monthly metrics to the Oversight Committee only 5.5% were uninsured. In light of the above collective concerns, it is recommended that Alameda Health System undergo a full and comprehensive audit to track Measure A fund allocations during the FY 15/16 period to clarify public accountability for how the funds were utilized. San Leandro Hospital As San Leandro Hospital is part of Alameda Health System, several of the concerns listed for AHS on page 9 apply to San Leandro Hospital as well. Specifically, AHS was unable to: Determine what portion of Measure A funds were allocated to personnel, subcontracted services, non-personnel program and/or operating expenses, or administrative overhead, separate from their overall agency budget for these categories. Determine what portion of Measure A funds were allocated to the actual number of staff supported, separate from San Leandro's staff of 333. As mentioned previously, it is recommended that Alameda Health System undergo a full and comprehensive audit to track Measure A fund allocations during the FY 15/16 period to clarify public accountability for how the funds were utilized. Timelist Group Inc. This provider did not supply any Measure A funding information for FY 15/16. Therefore, the Committee cannot evaluate whether funds were spent in accordance with the strictures of Measure A. 10Alameda County Board of SupervisorsDISTRIBUTION OF MEASURE A FUNDSHOW THE MONEY WAS SPENT Alameda Health System Board of Trustees25% 75%Measure A tax revenue is used to provide emergency medical, hospital inpatient, outpatient, public health, mental health, and substance abuse services to indigent, low income, and uninsured adults, children and families, seniors, and other residents of Alameda County. Each year, the Alameda Health System (AHS) receives 75% of Measure A funds, which is allocated by their Board of Trustees to provide primary and specialty care, preventative, and mental health services to patients served at AHS's multiple facilities, including Highland Hospital, John George Psychiatric Hospital, Fairmont Hospital, San Leandro Hospital, and Alameda Hospital. The remaining 25% of the Measure A funds received is allocated by the Alameda County Board of Supervisors (Board) to provide critical medical services offered by community-based health care providers, emergency care, and public health, mental health, and substance abuse services to address the many health needs of communities throughout the County. In FY 15/16, Measure A generated $137,233,576 (not including interest earned). The funds were allocated as follows:Alameda Health System (75%): $102,925,182 Alameda County (non-AHS) (25%): $34,308,394TOTAL: $137,233,576 In FY 15/16, the Alameda County approved budget totaled $2.744 billion. The Alameda County Health Care Services Agency approved budget totaled $646 million, or 23.5% of the total County budget. Measure A revenues not specifically designated for AHS accounted for 5.3%. The following sections in the report provide more detail on how AHS and the Board spent Measure A funds in FY 15/16, which includes revenue generated in the reporting year as well as unspent funds earned in previous years. 2015-2016 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 11BACk GROUND Alameda Health System (AHS) is a patient- and family-centered system of care that promotes wellness, eliminates disparities, and optimizes the health of its diverse communities.

Measure A supports all of AHS's services, with the exception of that fraction of AHS's business for which it receives full reimbursement for the cost of services provided. In FY 15/16, Measure A helped AHS achieve the following: Access (number of days to the third-next-available appointment) - Primary care: Highland, 31; Eastmont, 41; Newark, 50. - Specialty care: Highland, 43; Eastmont, 53. Sustainability - Operating margin for FY 15/16 was 3.3%, compared to -8% in FY 14/15. Quality - Total harm reduction improved 55.35% from 10/11 to FY 15/16 and 23.77% from FY 14/15 to FY 15/16. Service - Patients who reported getting help as soon as they wanted after pressing the call button improved 6.42% over the prior year. - Patients who reported that staff took their and their families/caregivers' preferences into account in deciding their health care needs after discharge improved 4.15% over the prior year. Workforce Development - Systemwide scores for employee engagement were 3.95 (2015) and 3.6 (2016), and for physician engagement were 3.68 (2015) and 3.3 (2016).

Community-based organizations (CBOs) provide mental health and substance use disorder services under contract with BHCS to meet the diverse cultural and language needs of County resident populations. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY Measure A funds were used to support several mental health and substance use disorder programs. Funds were roughly evenly distributed between mental health and alcohol and other drug (AOD) programs. Providers used Measure A funds to support expansion in service operations and administrative needs, and to address cost increases not sufficiently covered by standard cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) provided by their contract. The use of Measure A funds to mitigate budget cuts allowed providers to serve approximately the same number of County residents in AOD programs, despite unavoidable cost increases for insurance, utilities, and other non-service-related operational expenses. These additional funds contributed to significant client-level outcomes, such as service continuity, outreach effectiveness, and client engagement in treatment objectives that would be put at risk by cutbacks in provider service capacity.Allocation: $775,848 | Expended/Encumbered: $775,848 Individuals served by Measure (Total individuals served: 36,000 ) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured Adults, Children, Families, Seniors Services provided: Mental Health, Substance AbuseService area: CountywideBehavioral Health and Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) Community www.acbhcs.org Matching Funds BHCS-contracted CBOs leveraged their Measure A allocations to obtain $19,961 in matching funds from Medi- Cal and the Activities (MAA) program.Measure A AllocationMatching Funds$775,848 $19,961 2015-2016 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 18BACk GROUND The Center for Healthy Schools and Communities (CHSC) works to foster the academic success, health, and well-being of Alameda County youth by building universal access to high quality supports and opportunities in schools and neighborhoods. Co-coordinated by CHSC and the Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (BHCS) Agency, the Alameda County School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative strengthens the use of evidence-based practices along a continuum of behavioral health supports that includes prevention, early intervention, and treatment strategies. CHSC and BHCS used their Measure A allocation to enhance two core programs of the Alameda County School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative: the Our Kids Our Families Program, and the School District Consultation program. The main objective of the initiative is to implement and strengthen these programs in the following school districts: Emery Unified Newark Unified New Haven Unified Dublin Unified Livermore Valley Joint Unified Oakland Unified Pleasanton Unified San Leandro Unified Hayward Unified The Our Kids Our Families program, provided at 29 school sites in the Hayward and Oakland Unified School Districts, is a school-based behavioral health program that fosters social-emotional wellness in an educational environment so that children and families feel connected, safe, and supported in school.

He was placed in foster care after his parents were incarcerated but left the foster home due to abuse, leading to homelessness and substance abuse. At school, Jake was arrested for carrying a pocket knife on campus. After his arrest, Jake was referred to COST. The COST helped Jack get a job, accessed funds for transportation to and from school, and provided academic support. The COST continues to connect Jake to services available for transition-age youth and is working on a permanent housing solution. Thanks in large part to the COST support, in June 2016, Jake graduated from high school. 2015-2016 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 19supports prevention efforts at the school sites, as well as early intervention and treatment services for any student and their family that needs it. The School District Consultation program places behavioral health consultants (BHCs) in school districts to provide and enhance preventive social-emotional supports and mental health services for students and their families. The services provided by BHCs include the following: Assess the social-emotional service needs and infrastructure of a school district or set of schools and develop a service plan Coordinate the work of all partner agencies who deliver behavioral health services in schools and districts Provide and/or coordinate clinical case management, group and individual counseling, and crisis assessment and intervention to students Provide workshops, parenting groups, mental health and other appropriate consultation, and linkages to needed school and community resources to parents/caregivers MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY The School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative used its Measure A allocation to support the following activities through the District Behavioral Health Consultation program. Prevention Activities BHCs provided a variety of non-clinical preventative services to students, families, and teachers and other staff at schools and schools districts. These services included the following: Individual mentorship/drop-ins with youth Youth groups Individual mentorship/drop-ins with families Family groups/workshops Teacher/provider consultations School/district staff presentations As a result of Measure A funding, the School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative also supported the unique needs of the population of unaccompanied immigrant youth (UIY) in schools through the development of the UIY Care Team. The UIY Care Team deployed culturally competent clinicians and case managers to schools and districts to connect UIY and their caregivers to mental health supports and other resources. BHCs supported the UIY in their schools/districts by identifying youth who might be unaccompanied immigrants and alerting the UIY team so that they could respond appropriately to their health, mental health, and academic needs. In FY 15/16, BHCs reported serving or brokering non-clinical support for 118 UIY.Matching Funds The School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative leveraged its Measure A allocation to obtain $6,016,022 in matching funds from the following sources: Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) funding, Hayward: $1,345,957 Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) funding, Oakland: $2,133,989 Tobacco Master Settlement Fund (TMSF)/CHSC discretionary : $1,513,112 Medi-Cal Administrative Activity (MAA): $500,000 Mental Health Services Act Intervention Program: $412,866 of Oakland, $110,098Measure A AllocationMatching Funds$617,362$6,016,022 2015-2016 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 20Early Intervention and Treatment Strategies BHCs performed several roles and responsibilities to strengthen the quality of early intervention and treatment programs in all school districts: In all districts, BHCs served as key point persons for responding to behavioral health crises at school sites. BHCs either directly provided crisis response services or coordinated crisis response. In FY 15/16, BHCs provided crisis assessment services to 471 youth, with a total of 420 hours reported on this work. In addition to overseeing Clinical Case Managers in Oakland and Hayward, BHCs provided direct supervision and/or coordination of graduate-level social work and MFT interns in the Emery, Newark, New Haven, San Leandro, and Hayward Unified School Districts. The Our Kids Our Families Intern Program supervised a total of 16 social work and MFT interns. During FY 15/16, 4,073 students were provided with 146,318 hours of clinical services through the program. The program also provided 6,565 hours of support to the families of students receiving clinical services. BHCs also worked to expand the use of therapeutic groups for students who showed early signs of behavioral health struggles. In FY 15/16, 8,876 hours of group services were provided to these at-risk students. In addition, BHCs coordinated clinical staff to work with teachers and other staff to help them support students who were receiving treatment. As a result, 6,241 hours of support were provided to these teachers and staff. In FY 15/16, BHCs coordinated social and emotional learning (SEL) initiatives at all eight school districts supported by Measure A funds. The Emery, Newark, and Hayward school districts received funding to implement a Positive Behavioral Interventions & Supports (PBIS) framework in every school. As a result of this work, PBIS was implemented in 18 of 21 schools in Hayward and four of 13 schools in Newark. BHCs are also supporting quality improvements of San Leandro's PBIS initiative, which was implemented in every school in the district. BHCs also supported other SEL and restorative justice resources in school districts, such as implementing restorative justice coordinators at all secondary schools in Hayward and developing Parent Ambassador and Student Ambassador programs to support engagement in district planning efforts. BHCs also supported the adoption of SEL curriculums in the Emery, San Leandro, and Dublin school districts. BHCs implemented Coordination of Services Teams (COST) and other referral mechanisms for behavioral health supports. COST is an evidence-based model for coordinating care at a school site. The multidisciplinary COST worked together to identify students who are struggling through referrals and data-driven screenings; deliberate strengths and challenges and assess supports needed for each student who is struggling; support the implementation of interventions that will Highlights In surveys of youth receiving behavioral health services in the School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative: 96% stated that they were satisfied with the service they received. 91% reported that they got the help they wanted. 94% reported improvements in their access to an individual who can help them in a crisis. 85% reported i mproved ability to cope when things go wrong. 85% indicated improved relationships with friends and other people. 84% reported improvements in school and/or work.

The hospital serves central Alameda County, a community of 265,000 people. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY For details on San Leandro Hospital's expenditures of Measure A funds, see the AHS entry on page 12. CONCERNS As San Leandro Hospital is part of AHS, several of the concerns listed for AHS on page 12 apply to San Leandro Hospital as well. Specifically, AHS was unable to: Determine what portion of Measure A funds were allocated to personnel, subcontracted services, non-personnel program and/or operating expenses, or administrative overhead, separate from their overall agency budget for these categories. Determine what portion of Measure A funds were allocated to the actual number of staff supported, separate from San Leandro's staff of 333. As mentioned previously, it is recommended that AHS undergo a full and comprehensive audit to track Measure A fund allocations during the FY 15/16 period to clarify public accountability for how funds were utilized.Allocation: $1,000,000 | Expended/Encumbered: $1,000,000 Individuals 43,029 ) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured Adults, Children, Families, Seniors Services provided: Emergency Medical, Hospital Inpatient, Hospital Outpatient, Public Health, Mental Health, Substance Abuse Service area: Countywide, Outside of Alameda County, Homeless or transientSan Leandro Hospital sanleandroahs.org 2015-2016 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 38BACk GROUND St. Rose Hospital (SRH) is a safety-net, independent, nonprofit hospital that provides critical access to emergency medical, hospital inpatient, and outpatient services for indigent, low income, underinsured populations in Central and Southern Alameda County. These services include the following: Critical access. SRH serves as a critical access point for Alameda County and is the only Medi-Cal-contracted facility between Oakland and Fremont. Additionally, SRH serves as a safety-net hospital and provides health care access to many low income residents that do not have adequate transportation to the Alameda County Medical Center. Hospitalists programs. The Hospitalists assume care of indigent and uninsured patients who are admitted to SRH. This alleviates the financial impact of private physicians who request compensation for lack of reimbursement. Women's services. SRH operates the Women's Center to meet the growing demand for OB/GYN services in the community, because many OB practitioners do not accept Medi-Cal rates. The program provides immediate and emergency care for pregnant women who present to the emergency room (ER), often with no history of prenatal care. Cardiac care. SRH is the only Medi-Cal-contracted facility to provide elective cardiac and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) services in Central Alameda County. SRH routinely accepts hospital transfers for emergency and elective cardiac care from non-Medi-Cal providers. SRH serves approximately 11% of Alameda County's indigent population. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY SRH used its Measure A funds to subsidize the cost of providing care to uninsured and/or indigent patients. Specifically, SRH used its Measure A allocation to help achieve the following: Conduct over 4,100 patient encounters and provide over $3.5 million in cost of care to uninsured/indigent patients For both traditional and Managed Care Medi-Cal programs, conduct Allocation: $2,000,000 | Expended/Encumbered: $2,000,000 32,136 ) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured Adults, Children, Families, Seniors Services provided: Emergency Medical, Hospital Inpatient, Hospital OutpatientService area: Countywide, Homeless or transientSt. Rose Hospital strosehospital.org Measure A Helps Letter from a patient who had surgery to address abdominal pain: \"I appreciate all of the assistance that you have given to me.

At CHO, Measure A funding supported three programs/activities: The pediatric Emergency Department (ED), specifically to provide adequate staffing for the large volume of children seen at the ED The Center for Child Protection (CCP) School-based clinics Emergency Department CHO provides highly specialized pediatric emergency services for the children of Alameda County, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. CHO's ED sees a broad array of pediatric disease and injury from the basic to the most complex. CHO is the leading provider for Alameda County children in need of acute care. Children with Medi-Cal rely nearly exclusively on CHO for emergency services since the public hospitals in the area do not provide specialized pediatric care and do not have any beds for children in the event a child needs to stay overnight. In FY 15/16, to CHO's ED was the highest volume ED in the San Francisco Bay Area. CHO's ED is one of two designated Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Centers in Northern California and the only one in the Bay Area. Children's Trauma Center has 24-hour in-house staff including pediatric specialists in emergency medicine, trauma surgery, anesthesiology, neurosurgery, orthopedics, diagnostic imaging, and critical care. CHO maintains an extensive in-house and outpatient rehabilitation department for pediatric trauma patients. The Trauma Center also supports an injury prevention program for the hospital and the community. For many children, the ED also functions as the gateway to a regular medical home, specialty care, or other community programs.Allocation: $2,000,000 | Expended/Encumbered: $2,000,000 Individuals 22,109 ) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured Children Services provided: Emergency Medical, Hospital Outpatient, Public Health, Mental HealthService area: CountywideUCSF Benioff Children' s Hospital Oakland childrenshospitaloakland.org Measure A Helps Issis, 14, came to the CHO ED with vaginal pain and discharge following a sexual assault. Issis's mother told the CHO social worker that she had observed changes in Issis such as resistance toward attending church and increased emotional responses, as well as missing allergy and depression medication. She also reported that Issis had attempted suicide on two occasions. The social worker provided information about the criminal justice process and victim rights as well as ongoing clinical case management to ensure that a police report was generated, a forensic interview was conducted, and a forensic medical exam was authorized. CCP therapists were contacted and immediately begin providing therapeutic services. 2015-2016 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 41Approximately 70% of patients seen in the CHO ED receive Medi-Cal. This number is higher than almost any other hospital\u2014child or adult\u2014in California. Without the CHO ED, children would need to travel further and/or receive care that is not specialized to children. With little doubt, more children would die without the CHO ED. Center for Child Protection CHO and Alameda County recognize that they share a responsibility to provide immediate and comprehensive care for this population of children, yet there are many challenges to maintaining this responsibility. CCP serves more than 1,000 clients per year. CCP is a comprehensive child abuse program within CHO. CCP is the only provider in Alameda County that has the capacity to offer many of its services. Because many CCP services are funded by external sources such as Measure A, there is no charge for eligible clients. This feature is very important because if CCP needed to charge insurance for these services, there would be a record of services provided, and many families would not step forward to divulge such sensitive information. CCP maintains staffing 24 hours per day to respond to acute forensic examinations for children under 14 years old when the alleged sexual abuse occurred within 72 hours. Non-acute forensic examinations for children under age 18 and second opinion medical consults are performed in the CCP outpatient clinic through appointment only. Clinical case management is provided to children and adolescents who present to the ED and/or child abuse management clinic following diagnosis or disclosure of abuse. Comprehensive evidenced-based mental health services are provided to children, adolescents, and their families who have been exposed to childhood trauma, including child abuse and/ or witness to violence. For most of these families, there are no alternatives in Alameda County for many of the services provided by CCP . School-Based Clinics CHO runs two school-based health centers: one at Castlemont High School and one at McClymonds High School. Both sites are integrated into full-service youth and/or family centers that promote youth development and serve as national models for adolescent health care. Youth Uprising/Castlemont Clinic\u2014which operates a full-time comprehensive team of six therapists and a psychiatrist, as well as comprehensive medical services\u2014is the hub for teachers, parents, and students to coordinate therapy, care, support, and help. The Castlemont site is now the highest volume school-connected mental health site in Alameda County.

The program has developed a training and consultation program for school professionals and mental health providers who work with schools, and it has contracts to conduct trainings throughout Alameda County and California. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY CHO used its Measure A allocation to achieve the following: Emergency Department In FY 15/16, there were a total of 47,107 visits to the ED. 534 of these visits were trauma cases where the child faced an immediate life-threatening situation. The average length of stay for patients discharged from the ED was reduced to 2.87 hours, compared to 3.1 hours the previous year (target: <3 hours). Center for Child Protection In FY 15/16, the CCP served more than 2,000 children and their families. 452 of these children and families received intensive behavioral health services. The CCP conducted 97 forensic evidentiary examinations, 55 outpatient medical consultations, and 60 inpatient medical consultations, and provided clinical and psychotherapy services to 205 children. 35 children participated in Camp CCP , where children receive intensive group psychotherapy services integrated with socialization experiences.

The services provided at WIC include dental history interviews to identify risk factors and oral home care practices, brushing the child's teeth and applying fluoride, assessing the child's mouth, and setting goals for home care behaviors. For children who need follow-up care beyond the services provided at the WIC site, the outreach worker collaborates with the family to assess insurance coverage, obtain a dental appointment with a provider, and assist with making the initial dental appointment. For families lacking insurance coverage, the outreach worker arranges insurance assistance through the Healthy Smiles Dental Treatment program. The focus of the service is to families of children (ages 9 to 15 months) who participate in Dental Days at WIC at the Eastmont, Telegraph, Hayward, and Fremont sites. Since siblings often accompany the caregiver at the Dental Days, all services are offered to them as well.

Implemented in the Oakland, Hayward, and San Leandro school districts, the initiative aims to eliminate common barriers to health insurance enrollment and retention by leveraging school districts as channels for reaching uninsured families. The CKC Initiative centralizes enrollment assistance in school district- based Central Family Resource Centers so that families can apply for and renew their health care coverage and public benefits in a \"one-stop shop, \" minimizing visits to multiple County offices. The initiative is a collaboration among the Alameda County Social Services Agency, the Alameda County Health Care Services Agency (HCSA), three of the County's largest school districts, and two community-based organizations. A majority of consumers accessing assistance are Latino and Spanish- speaking and reside in Oakland, the largest school district participating in the initiative. Most families have qualified for two or more affordable coverage programs, indicating that the \"one-stop shop\" model is of particular value for these families. The CKC \"one-stop shop\" model is particularly important for the working poor, whose demanding and inflexible work schedules and difficulty accessing reliable or efficient transportation can prevent them from making or attending appointments at different public agency locations for each family member. The CKC Initiative utilizes three primary strategies to reach its target populations: Trainings or presentations for school site staff, community-based partners, or other school-based resources to increase the number of people on school sites who are referring families in need to the CKC Family Resource Centers for health benefit enrollment assistance. Outreach events hosted at school sites to educate parents and students about health insurance eligibility guidelines and enrollment assistance resources at the CKC Family Resource Centers.Allocation: $316,435 | Expended/Encumbered: $316,435 Individuals 2,710 ) Populations served: Indigent, Uninsured Adults, Children, Families Services provided: Public HealthService area: Hayward, Oakland, San LeandroConnecting Kids to Coverage (CKC) Initiative www.whhs.com 2015-2016 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 52 Targeted outreach calls to families whose Medi-Cal applications are up for renewal or have already fallen off.
